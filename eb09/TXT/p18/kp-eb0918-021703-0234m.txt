PAPA, a large country-town of Hungary, in the district of Veszprim, lies on the Raab and Steinamanger Railway, 75 miles to the west of Pesth. It is the seat of a fine chateau and park of the Eszterh√¢zy family, by whom the handsome Roman Catholic church, lined with red marble, was built in 1778. It also contains a Protestant church, a good Protestant school established about 1530, a Roman Catholic gymnasium, and three convents. A quaint onestoried edifice is shown as the house of Matthew Corvinus. The chief industries are weaving, wine-growing, and the manufacture of paper and stoneware. The population in 1880 was 14,654.
