PARROT, according to Prof. Skeat (Etymol. Dictionary, p. 422), from the French Perrot or Pierrot, a proper name and the diminutive of Pierre ^[1. “Parakeet” (in Shakespeare, 1 Hen. IV., ii. 3, 88, “Paraquito ”) is said by the same authority to be from the Spanish Periquito or Perroqueto, a small Parrot, diminutive of Peri,co, a Parrot, which again may be a diminutive from Pedro, the proper name. Parakeet (spelt in various ways in English) is usually applied to the smaller kinds of Parrots, especially those which have long tails, not as Perroquet in French, which is used as a general term for all Parrots, Perruche, or sometimes Perriehe, being the ordinary name for what we call Parakeet. The old English “Popinjay” and the old French Pαpegαut have almost passed out of use, but the German Papagei and Italian Papagaio still continue in vogue. These names can be traced to the Arabic Babaghã·, but the source of that word is unknown. The Anglo-Saxon name of the Parret, a river in Somerset, is Pedreda or Pedrida, which at first sight looks as if it had to do with the proper name, Petrus; but Prof. Skeat believes there is no connexion between them—the latter portion of the word being rid, a stream. ] the name given generally to a large and very natural group of Birds, which for more than a score of centuries have attracted attention, not only from their gaudy plumage, but, at first and chiefly, it would seem, from the readiness with which many of them learn to imitate the sounds they hear, repeating the words and even phrases of human speech with a fidelity that is often astonishing. It is said that no representation of any Parrot appears in Egyptian art, nor does any reference to a bird of the kind occur in the Bible, whence it has been concluded that neither painters nor writers had any knowledge of it. Aristotle is commonly supposed to be the first author who mentions a Parrot; but this is an error, for nearly a century earlier Ctesias in his Indica (cap. 3),^[2. The passage seems to have escaped the notice of all naturalists except Broderip, who mentioned it in his article “Psittacidae,” in the Penny Cyclopaedia (vol. xix. p. 83). ] under the name of βlττακoς (Bittacus), so neatly described a bird which could speak an “Indian” language—naturally, as he seems to have thought—or Greek—if it had been taught so to do—about as big as a Sparrow-Hawk (Hierax), with a purple face and a black beard, otherwise blue green (cyaneus) and vermilion in colour, so that there cannot be much risk in declaring that he must have had before him a male example of what is now commonly known as the Blossom-headed Parakeet, and to ornithologists as Palaeοrnis cyanocephalus, an inhabitant of many parts of India. Much ingenuity has been exercised in the endeavour to find the word whence this, and the later form of the Greek name, was derived, but to little or no purpose. After Ctesias comes Aristotle’s ψιττdκη (Psittace), which Sundevall supposes him to have described only from hearsay, a view that the present writer is inclined to think insufficiently supported. But this matters little, for there can be no doubt that the Indian conquests of Alexander were the means of making the Parrot better known in Europe, and it is in reference to this fact that another Eastern species of Palaeornis now bears the name of P. alexandri, though from the localities it inhabits it could hardly have had anything to do with the Macedonian hero. That Africa had Parrots does not seem to have been discovered by the ancients till long after, as Pliny tells us (vi. 29) that they were first met with beyond the limits of Upper Egypt by explorers employed by Nero. These birds, highly prized from the first, reprobated by the moralist, and celebrated by more than one classical poet, in the course of time were brought in great numbers to Rome, and ministered in various ways to the luxury of the age. Not only were they lodged in cages of tortoise-shell [9:18:322] and ivory, with silver wires, but they were professedly esteemed as delicacies for the table, and one emperor is said to have fed his lions upon them! But there would be little use in dwelling longer on these topics. With the decline of the Roman empire the demand for Parrots in Europe lessened, and so the supply dwindled, yet all knowledge of them was not wholly lost, and they are occasionally mentioned by one writer or another until in the 15th century began that career of geographical discovery which has since proceeded uninterruptedly. This immediately brought with it the knowledge of many more forms of these birds than had ever before been seen, for whatever races of men were visited by European navigators—whether in the East Indies or the West, whether in Africa or in the islands of the . Pacific—it was almost invariably found that even the most savage tribes had tamed some kind of Parrot; and, moreover, experience soon showed that no bird was more easily kept alive on board ship and brought home, while, if it had not the merit of “speech,” it was almost certain to be of beautiful plumage. Yet so numerous is the group that even now new species of Parrots are not uncommonly recognized, though, looking to the way in which the most secluded parts of the world are being ransacked, we must soon come to an end of this.

The home of the vast majority of Parrot-forms is unquestionably within the tropics, but the popular belief that Parrots are tropical birds only is a great mistake. In North America the Carolina Parakeet, Conurus carolinensis, at the beginning of the present century used to range in summer as high as the shores of Lakes Erie and Ontario— a latitude equal to that of the south of France; and even within the last forty years it reached, according to trustworthy information, the junction of the Ohio and the Mississippi, though now its limits have been so much curtailed that its occurrence in any but the Gulf States is doubtful. In South America, at least four species of Parrots are found in Chili or La Plata, and one, Conurus patagonus, is pretty common on the bleak coast of the Strait of Magellan. In Africa, it is true that no species is known to extend to within some ten degrees of the tropic of Cancer; but Pionias robustus inhabits territories lying quite as far to the southward of the tropic of Capricorn. In India the northern range of the group is only bounded by the slopes of the Himalaya, and further to the eastward Parrots are not only abundant over the whole of the Malay Archipelago, as well as Australia and Tasmania, but two very well-defined Families are peculiar to New Zealand and its adjacent islands (see Kak apo, vol. xiii. p. 825; and Nestor, vol. xvii. p. 354). No Parrot has recently inhabited the Palaearctic Region^[3. A few remains of a Parrot have been recognized from the Miocene of the Allier in France, by Prof. A. Milne-Edwards (Oιs. Foss. France, ii. p. 525, pl. cc. ), and are said by him to show the greatest resemblance to the common Grey Parrot of Africa, Psittacus eriihacus, through having also some affinity to the Ring-necked Parakeet of the same country, Palaeornis torquatus. He refers them, however, to the same genus as the former, under the name of Psittacus verreauxi. ] and but one (the Conurus carolinensis, just mentioned) probably belongs to the Nearctic; nor are Parrots represented by many different forms in either the Ethiopian or the Indian Regions. In continental Asia the distribution of Parrots is rather remarkable. None extend further to the westward than the valley of the Indus,^[4. The statements that have been made, and even repeated by writers of authority, as to the occurrence of “a green parrot” in Syria (Chesney, Exped. Survey Euphrates and Tigris, i. pp. 443, 537) and of a Parrot in Turkestan (Jour. As. Soc. Bengal, viii. p. 1007) originated with gentlemen who had no ornithological knowledge, and are evidently erroneous. ] which, considering the nature of the country in Baluchistan and Afghanistan, is perhaps intelligible enough: but it is not so easy to under stand why none are found either in Cochin China or China proper; and they are also wanting in the Philippine Islands, which is the more remarkable and instructive when we find how abundant they are in the groups a little further to the southward. Indeed Air Wallace has well remarked that the portion of the earth’s surface which contains the largest number of Parrots, in proportion to its area, is undoubtedly that covered by the islands extending from Celebes to the Solomon group. “The area of these islands is probably not one-fifteenth of that of the four tropical regions, yet they contain from one-fifth to onefourth of all the known Parrots” (Geogr. Distr. Animals, ii. p. 330). He goes on to observe also that in this area are found many of the most remarkable forms—all the red Lories, the great black Cockatoos, the pigmy Nasi-ternae, and other singularities. In South America the species of Parrots, though numerically nearly as abundant, are far less diversified in form, and all of them seem capable of being referred to two or, at most, three sections. The species that has the widest range, and that by far, is the common Ring-necked Parakeet, Palaeornis torquatus, a well-known cage-bird which is found from the mouth of the Gambia across Africa to the coast of the Red Sea, as well as throughout the whole of India, Ceylon, and Burmah to Tenasserim.^[5. Tt is right to state, however, that the African examples of this bird are said to be distinguishable from the Asiatic by their somewhat shorter wings and weaker bill, and hence they are considered by some authorities to form a distinct species or subspecies, P. docilis ; but in thus regarding them the difference of locality seems to have influenced opinion, and without that difference they would scarcely have been separated, for in many other groups of birds distinctions so slight are regarded as barely evidence of local races. ] On the other hand there are plenty of cases of Parrots which are restricted to an extremely small area—often an island of insignificant size, as Conurus xantholaemus, confined to the island of St Thomas in the Antilles, and Palaeornis exsul to that of Rodriguez in the Indian Ocean—to say nothing of the remarkable instance of Nestor productus before mentioned (vol. xvii. p. 355).

The systematic treatment of this very natural group of birds has long been a subject of much difficulty, and the difference of opinion among those who have made it their study is most striking, for there is hardly an approach to unanimity to be found, beyond the somewhat general belief which has grown up within the last forty years that the Parrots should be regarded as forming a distinct Order of the Class, though there are some men, justly accounted authorities, who even question this much. A few systematists, among whom Bonaparte was chief, placed them at the top of the Class, conceiving that they were the analogues of the Primates among mammals. Prof. Huxley has recognized the Psittacomorphae as forming 'one of the principal groups of Carinate birds, and, by whatever name we call them, that much seems to be evident. It will here, however, be unnecessary to discuss the exact rank which the Parrots as a group should hold, for sufficient on that score has already been said above (Ornithology, p. 47), and it is quite enough of a task to consider the most natural or—if we cannot hope at present to reach that—at least the most expedient way of subdividing them. It must be admitted as a reproach to ornithologists that so little satisfactory progress has been made in this direction, for of that the existing differences of opinion—differences as wide as have ever existed in any branch of ornithic taxonomy—are sufficient proof. Moreover, the result is all the more disheartening, seeing that there is no group of exotic birds that affords equal opportunities for anatomical examination, since almost every genus extant, and more than two-thirds of the species, have within recent times been kept in confinement in one or another of our zoological gardens, and at their death have furnished subi ects for dissection. Y et the laudable attempt [9:18:323] of Μ. Blanchard {Comptes Rendus, xliii. 1097-1100 and xliv. 518-521) has not been regarded as successful, and it cannot be affirmed positively that the latest arrangement of the Psittaci is really much more natural than that planned by Buffon one hundred and twenty years ago. He was of course unaware of the existence of some of the most remarkable forms of the group, in particular of St rig ops and Nestor·, but he began by making two great divisions of those that he did know, separating the Parrots of the Old World from the Parrots of the New, and subdividing each of these divisions into various sections somewhat in accordance with the names they had received in popular language—a practice he followed on many other occasions, for it seems to have been with him a belief that there is more truth in the discrimination· of the unlearned than the scientific are apt to allow. The result is that he produced a plan which is comparatively simple and certainly practical, while as just stated it cannot be confidently declared to be unnatural. However, not to go so far back as twenty years, in 1867-68 Dr Finsch published at Leyden an elaborate monograph of the Parrots,^[6. Die Papageien, monographisch bearbeitet. ] regarding them as a Family, in which he admitted 26 genera, forming 5 Subfamilies:—(1) that composed of Strigops (Kakapo, ut supr.) only; (2) that containing the crested forms or Cockatoos; (3) one which he named Sittacinae, comprising all the long-tailed species—a somewhat heterogeneous assemblage, made up of Macaws (vol. xv. p. 130) and what are commonly known as Parakeets; (4) the Parrots proper with short tails; and (5) the so-called “brush-tongued” Parrots, consisting of the Lories (vol. xv. p. 7) and Nestors (ut sup.). Except in the characters of the last group he recognized none that were not external, and that fact is sufficient to cast suspicion on his scheme being natural.

In 1874 the late Prof. Garrod communicated to the Zoological Society the results of his dissection of examples of 82 species of Parrots, which had lived in its gardens, and these results were published in its Proceedings for that year (pp. 586-598, pls. 70, 71). The principal points to which he attended were the arrangement of the carotid artery, and the presence or absence of an ambiens muscle, an oil-gland, and a furcula; but except as regards the last character he unfortunately almost wholly neglected the rest of the skeleton, looking upon such osteological features as the formation of an orbital ring and peculiarities of the atlas as “of minor importance ”—an estimate to which nearly every anatomist will demur; for, though undoubtedly the characters afforded by blood-vessels and muscles are useful in default of osteological characters, it is obvious that these last, drawn from the very framework of any vertebrate’s structure, cannot be inferior in value to the former. Indeed the investigations of Prof. A. Milne-Edwards (Ann. Sc. Nat. Zoologie, ser. 5, vi. pp. 91-111; viii. pp. 145-156) on the bones of the head in various Psittacine forms make it clear that these alone present features of much significance, and if his investigations had not been carried on for a special object, but had been extended to other parts of the skeleton, there is little doubt that they would have removed some of the greatest difficulties. The one osteological character to which Garrod trusted, namely, the condition of the furcula, cannot be said to contribute much towards a safe basis of classification. That it is wholly absent in some genera of Parrots had long been known, but its imperfect ossification, it appears, is not attended in some cases by any diminution of volant powers, which tends to shew that it is an unimportant character, an inference confirmed by the fact that it is found wanting in genera placed geographically so far apart that the loss must have had in some of them an independent origin. Summarilv expressed, Garrod’s scheme was to divide the Parrots into two Families, Palaeornithidae and Psittacidae, assigning to the former three Subfamilies Palaeornithinae, Cacatuinae, and String opinae, and to the latter four, Arinae, Pyrrhurvnae, Platycercinae, and Chrysotinae. That each of these sections, except the Cacatuinae, is artificial any regard to osteology would shew, and it would be useless here to further criticize his method, except to say that its greatest merit is that, as before mentioned (Love-Bird, vol. xv. p. 28), he gave sufficient reasons for distinguishing between the genera Agapornis and Psittacula. In the Journal für Ornithologie for 1881 Dr Reichenow published a Conspectus Psittacorum, founded, as several others^[7. Such, for instance, as Kuhl’s treatise with the same title, which appeared in 1820, and Wagler’s Monographic Psittacorum, published in 1832—both good of their kind and time. ] have been, on external characters only. He makes 9 Families of the group, and recognizes 45 genera, and 442 species, besides subspecies. His grouping is generally very different from Garrod’s, but displays as much artificiality; for instance, Nestor is referred to the Family which is otherwise composed of the Cockatoos. Still more recently we have the arrangement followed by Mr Sclater in the List of those exhibited of late years in the gardens of the Zoological Society, and published in 1883. This is more in accordance with the views that the present writer is inclined to hold, and these views may here, though with much diffidence, be stated. First there is Strigops, which must stand alone, unless, as before hinted (vol. xiii. p. 826), Geopsittacus and Pezoporus may have to be placed with it in a Family Strigopidae. Next Nestor, from its osteological peculiarities, seems to form a very separate type, and represents a second Family Nestoridae. These two Families being removed, all the Parrots that remain will be found to have a great resemblance among themselves, and perhaps it is impossible justifiably to establish any more Families. For the present at any rate it would seem advisable to keep them in a single Family Psittacidae, but there can be no objection to separating them into several Subfamilies. The Cockatoos, for instance, can be without much difficulty defined, and may stand as Cacatuinae, and then the brush-tongued Lories as Lorünae, after which the Macaws, Arinae— including possibly Conurus and its allies. Platycercus and its neighbours may form another section, and the same with Palaeornis·, but for the rest there is not yet material for arriving at any determination, though Chrysotis and Psittacus seem to furnish two different types, to the former of which Psittacula appears to bear much the same relation as Agapornis does to the latter. Amongst the genera Chrysotis, Palaeornis, and Psittacus are probably to be found the most highly organized forms, and it is these birds in which the faculty of so-called “speech” reaches its maximum development. But too much importance must not be assigned to that fact; since, while Psittacus erithacus— the well-known Grey Parrot with a red tail—is the most accomplished spokesman of the whole group, it is fairly approached by some species of Chrysotis —usually styled Amazons—and yet its congener P. timneh is not known to be at all loquacious.^[8. In connexion with the “speaking” of Parrots, one of the most curious circumstances is that recorded by Humboldt, who in South America met with a venerable bird which remained the sole possessor of a literally dead language, the whole tribe of Indians, Atures by name, who alone had spoken it having become extinct. ]

Considering the abundance of Parrots both as species and individuals, and their wide extent over the globe, it is surprising how little is known of their habits in a wild state. Even the species with which Englishmen and their descendants have been more in contact than any other has an almost unwritten history, compared with that of many other birds; and, seeing how it is oppressed by and yielding to man’s occupation of its ancient haunts, the [9:18:324] extirpation of the Carolina Parakeet is certain, and will probably be accomplished before several interesting and some disputed points in its economy have been decided. The same fate possibly awaits several of the Australian species and all those in New Zealand—indeed the experience of small islands only foreshadows what will happen in tracts of greater extent, though there more time is required to produce the same result; but, the result being inevitable, those who are favourably placed for observations should neglect no opportunities of making them ere it be too late.
