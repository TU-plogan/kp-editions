PAMIERS, capital of an arrondissement, an episcopal see, and the most populous town (10,478 inhabitants) of the department of Ariége, France, lies on the right bank of that river, 40 miles south of Toulouse, in the middle of a fertile and well-watered valley. Its wines were at one time in high repute. Its industrial establishments at present comprise flour mills, spinning-mills, serge factories, and some large forges, and there is also a gold-washing company (the Ariége derives its name from its auriferous character). The cathedral of Pamiers, with an octagonal Gothic tower, is a bizarre mixture of the Graeco-Roman and Gothic styles; the church of Notre Dame du Camp is noticeable for its crenellated and machicolaied façade. From the site of the old castle, which still retains the name of Castellat, there is a fine view of the Pic de St Barthélemy and the valley of the Ariége.

Pamiers was originally a castle built in the beginning of the 12th century by Roger 11., count of Foix, on lands belonging to the abbey of St Antonin de Frédelas. The abbots of St Antonin, and afterwards the bishops, shared the superiority of the town with the counts. This gave rise to numerous disputes between monks, counts, sovereigns, bishops, and the consuls of the town. Panders was sacked by Jean de Foix in 1486, again during the religious wars, and, finally, in 1628 by Condé.
