PAULUS (or Paullus), Lucius Aemilius, a distinguished Roman general, of the patrician family of the Aemilii, was born about 229 b.c. He was the son of the consul of the same name who fell at Cannae. As curule aedile in 192 he gave a proof of his integrity by prosecuting the persons who made an illegal use of the public pastures. His first laurels were won in Further Spain, whither he was sent as praetor in 191. Though at first defeated with loss, he finally overthrew the enemy in a bloody battle (189) and tranquillized Spain. In 182 he was consul, and in the following year subdued the Ingauni, a piratical tribe of Liguria, dismantling their towns and carrying off their ships. For this service he was granted a triumph. After a period of retirement from public life he was elected consul a second time, for 168, and entrusted with the command in the Macedonian war, which the incapacity of previous Roman generals had allowed to drag on without success for three years. Paulus brought the war to a speedy termination by the battle of Pydna, fought on 22d June (Julian calendar) 168. The battle decided the fate of Macedonia, which was henceforward a Roman province. The Macedonian king Perseus surrendered shortly afterwards and met with a courteous reception from the Roman general. Paulus now availed himself of his position to make the tour of Greece, visiting with an intelligent interest the places immortalized in Greek history and legend. Afterwards, assisted by ten Roman commissioners, he arranged the affairs of Macedonia. In obedience to the orders of the senate, on his return through Epirus to Italy he gave up seventy towns to pillage and carried off 150,000 of the inhabitants as slaves. A magnificent triumph, graced by the presence of the captive king Perseus and his three children, rewarded the conqueror of Macedonia (167). But his public glory was closely attended by private misfortune; of the two sons borne him by his second wife one died a few days before, [9:18:436] the other a few days after, his triumph. The veteran was thus left without a son to bear his name; for of his two sons by his first wife Papiria, the elder had been adopted by Quintus Fabius Maximus, Hannibal’s great opponent, and the younger by the son of Scipio Africanus. The latter, known as P. Cornelius Scipio Aemilianus, was the conqueror of Carthage and Numantia. Paulus was censor in 164, and died in 160. At the funeral games exhibited in his honour the Hecyra of Terence was acted for the second and the Ádelphi for the first time.

Paulus was a fine specimen of a Roman noble. An aristocrat to the backbone, he was yet beloved by the people, whose favour he never deigned to court by unworthy means. His integrity was perfect; of the vast sums brought by him into the Roman treasury from Spain and Macedonia he kept not a penny to himself. At his death his property with difficulty sufficed to pay his wife’s dowry. As a general he was a strict disciplinarian; as an augur he discharged the religious duties of his office with conscientious care and exactness. His piety passed into superstition, as when before the battle of Pydua he* sacrificed to the moon, then under eclipse. His sympathy with Greek learning and art is attested by the Greek masters whom he procured for his sons, as well as by his travels in Greece, the works of art he brought home, and his friendship for the historian Polybius. His nobility of nature won him the affection and esteem of all who knew him, of his enemies no less than of his countrymen. An affecting proof is the fact recorded by Plutarch that his body was carried to the grave by volunteers from all the nations he had conquered, while old men from Spain, Liguria, and. Macedonia followed lamenting the man who (according to them} was at once their conqueror and their saviour.

There is a life of him by Plutarch, but his campaigns in Liguria and Macedonia are more fully described by Livy (xl. 25-28; xliv. 17 - xlv. 41).
