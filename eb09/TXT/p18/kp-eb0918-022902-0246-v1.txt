PAPPENHEIM, Gottfried Heinrich, Graf zu (1594-1632), imperialist general in the Thirty Years’ War, was born on the 29th May 1594. He attended the high schools of Altdorf and Tübingen, but did not seem to profit much by the instruction he received at either institution. In his twentieth year he joined the Roman Catholic Church; and zeal for his new faith induced him to enter the military service of King Sigismund in Poland and afterwards that of Maximilian, duke of Bavaria, head of the Catholic League. In 1620, as a colonel in the army of the League, he distinguished himself in the battle near Prague which decided the fate of Frederick, king of Bohemia. In this battle, after fighting with extraordinary energy, he was severely wounded, and for many hours lay unnoticed under his horse. He received, in 1623, the command of a regiment of cuirassiers who became famous as the Pappenheimer, and with them he fought from 1623 to 1625 at the head of the Spaniards in Lombardy. In 1626, having been recalled to Germany by Duke Maximilian, he crushed an insurrection of peasants in Upper Austria, obtaining in the course of a month a series of victories in which 40,000 peasants are said to have been killed. He then went to the help of Tilly against Christian IV. of Denmark, and took a prominent part in the storming of Magdeburg, the inhabitants of which were treated by him and by his soldiers with savage cruelty. After the battle of Breitenfeld, which was fought at an unsuitable time, contrary to the wish of Tilly, in consequence of Pappenheim’s impetuosity, he covered the retreat of the imperialists; and in Westphalia and the country of the lower Rhine he stimulated the enthusiasm of his party by several successful engagements. When Tilly died, Pappenheim aided Wallenstein in subduing Saxony. On his way to the lower Rhine, where he proposed to support the Spaniards, he was summoned by Wallenstein to Lützen, where battle was about to be given to Gustavus Adolphus; and at the moment of his arrival fortune seemed already to have declared for the Swedes. Pappenheim threw himself into the conflict, and his attack was so furious that the enemy began to give way; but two musket balls penetrated his breast, and he had to be carried from the field. He died on the 17th November 1632, the day after the battle. He left behind him the reputation of one of the bravest warriors and most ardent Catholics of his day. Notwithstanding the sternness of his discipline, he was idolized by his troops.
