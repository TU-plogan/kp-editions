PALINDROME(πάλιν, again, and δρόμος, a course), a verse or sentence which runs the same when read either backwards or forwards. Such is the verse—

Roma tibi subito motibus ibit amor; or

Signa te, signa, temere me tangis et angis; or νίψον ανομήματα μή μάναν tfψιv ^[1. This last is from the καρκίνοι of the emperor Leo VI., the Philosopher, and occurs in a palindrome piece of twenty-seven lines, which can be seen in the Excerpta Varia of Leo Allatius (1641). See also 27. and Q δth ser., vii. 372, via. 77. ]

Odo tenet mulum, madidam mappam tenet Anna, Anna tenet mappam madidam, mulum tenet Odo.

The following is still more complicated, as reading in four ways—upwards and downwards as well as backwards and forwards :—
