+====================================================================+


PHILOLAUS, next to Archytas the most illustrious of the Pythagorean philosophers, was born at Tarentum or, according to Diogenes Laertius, at Crotona.^[1. Boeckh places his life between the 70th and 95th Olympiads (496-396 B.C.). He was a contemporary of Socrates an<l Democritus, but senior to them, and wa# probably somewhat junior to Empedocles, so that his birth may be placed at about 480. ] He was said to have been intimate with Democritus, and was probably one of his teachers. After the death of Pythagoras great dissensions prevailed in the cities of lower Italy, which were allayed only after the lapse of many years through the intervention of the Achaeans. According to some accounts Philolaus was obliged to flee, and owed his escape to his youthful energy. He took refuge first in Lucania, then in Greece; he lived at Thebes, where he had for pupils Simmias and Cebes, who subsequently, being still young men {νεανίσκοι), were present at the death of Socrates. Prior to this Philolaus had left Thebes and returned to Italy, where he was the teacher of Archytas. Pythagoras published nothing, nor did the other early Pythagoreans; the members of the brotherhood, moreover, piously referred their discoveries back to their master; hence many doctrines have been attributed to Pythagoras which were first propounded later in the school. He entered deeply into the number-theory, which constituted the distinctive feature of the Pythagorean philosophy, and in particular dwelt on the properties inherent in the decad —the sum of the first four numbers, consequently the fourth triangular number, the tetractys—which he called great, all-powerful, and all-producing. The discovery of the regular solids is attributed to Pythagoras by Eudemus, and Empedocles is stated to have been the first who maintained that there were four elements. Philolaus, connecting these ideas, held that the elementary nature of bodies depended on their form, and assigned the tetrahedron to fire, the octahedron to air, the icosahedron to water, and the cube to earth; the dodecahedron he assigned to a fifth element, aether, or, as some think, to the universe. This theory indicates considerable knowledge of geometry on the part of its author; it gave, moreover, a great impulse to the study of that science, and many important results were arrived at, so that Aristaeus, who lived before Euclid, was able to write a book on the comparison of the five regular solids.

Philolaus was the first to propound the doctrine of the motion of the earth; some, however, attribute this doctrine to Pythagoras, but there is no evidence in support of their view. Philolaus supposed that the sphere of the fixed stars, the five planets, the sun, moon, and earth, all moved round the central fire, which he called the hearth of the universe, the house of Zeus, and the mother of the gods; but as these made up only nine revolving bodies he conceived, in accordance with his number-theory, a tenth, which he called counter-earth, αντιχθwν. He was the first who published a book on the Pythagorean doctrines, a treatise of which Plato made use in the composition of his Tirnaeus. This work of the Pythagorean, to which the mystical name Bακχαt is sometimes given, seems to have consisted of three books: (1) Hepì κόσμον, containing a general account of the origin and arrangement of the universe; (2) Hepì φvσεως, an exposition of the nature of numbers; (3) ∏qoi ψnχηs, o∏ the nature of the soul.
