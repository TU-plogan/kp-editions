PFALZBURG, a town of German Lorraine, lies high on the west slopes of the Vosges, 25 miles to the north-northwest of Strasburg. In 1880 it contained 3379 (mainly Roman Catholic) inhabitants. The principality of Pfalzburg, originally a part of Luxemburg, afterwards belonged in turn to the bishop of Metz, the bishop of Strasburg, and the duke of Lorraine, and passed into the possession of France in 1661. The town was of importance as commanding the passes of the Vosges, and was strongly fortified by Vauban in 1681. The works resisted the Germans for four months in 1870, but have since been razed.
