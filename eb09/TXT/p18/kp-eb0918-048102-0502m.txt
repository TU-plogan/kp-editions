PEMBERTON, an urban sanitary district of Lancashire, England, situated on the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway, 2âˆ£ miles west from Wigan. Near the town are stone quarries and collieries, and the town itself possesses cotton-mills, chemical works, and iron-foundries. At a short distance is Hawkley Hall, an ancient timber house. At Ancliff in the township of Pemberton there was, according to ancient records, a burning well of considerable fame, but the name Ancliff has now disappeared, and the site cannot be verified. The population of the urban sanitary district (area 2894 acres) in 1871 was 10,374, and in 1881 it was 13,762.
