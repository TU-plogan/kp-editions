PARADISE is an old Persian word (JPairidaeza in the Vendidad) meaning an enclosure, a park. The Greeks use the word in the form Παράδεισος of the parks of the Persian kings, and it was borrowed also by the Hebrews in the form D"∏∩≡> (Cant. iv. 13; Eccles, ii. 5; Neh. ii. 8; A. V., “orchard,” “forest”). The Septuagint chose the Greek form to translate the “garden” of Genesis ii.; other Greek and Latin versions followed them, and thus “paradise” became the usual ecclesiastical name for the garden of Eden, which has been spoken of under Eden. Now, as Paradise in this sense was the residence of man before he sinned, it was natural enough that theological speculation as to the dwelling-place of the righteous, after death, or in the future glory, should attach itself to the account given in Genesis of the original habitation of righteous Adam, and borrow not only the name but in some measure also the conception of paradise as there described. This took place in more than one way, as we see from the Jewish apocalyptic literature, and especially from the book of Enoch. Thus we find (1) the idea that the old Paradise still exists in a secret part of the earth, and that Enoch, Elijah, and other elect and righteous persons dwell there. This is the foundation of the doctrine of the earthly paradise, which passed into Christianity—being supposed to find confirmation in the New Testament, especially in Luke xxiii. 43. The earthly paradise, as developed by Christian fancy, is the old garden of Eden, which lay in the far East beyond the stream of Ocean, raised so high on a triple terrace of mountain that the deluge did not touch it. It is the residence of certain departed saints, and the pictures drawn of it are coloured with classical reminiscences of Elysium and the Islands of the Blest. How these outlines were filled up at different periods may be learned from Ephraem Syrus’s poem on Paradise (4th century), from Cosmas Indicopleustes (6th century), from the Divina Commedia of Dante, and other mediaeval sources. A more ideal conception is (2) that of the heavenly paradise. To the Hebrews ideal things represent themselves as the heavenly counterparts of earthly things; ideals which God’s people are to realize in the future are already existent in heaven; or even things which have once been lost, but which are necessary to man’s true happiness, are preserved in heaven. Thus the heavenly paradise was either a mere figure for the good things, corresponding to those which Adam lost, which are reserved in heaven for the righteous, or it was the heavenly archetype of which the earthly paradise was a copy, or on a crasser way of thinking it was held that the paradise which Adam lost had been actually transported to heaven. The commonest form of the idea was perhaps that expressed in 4 Ezra and the Talmud, by saying that paradise was created before the earth. This paradise is not conceived as the place of the souls of all the righteous after death, but it is inhabited by certain select persons—Enoch, Elijah, Moses, Ezra—who enjoy in it the fellowship of the coming Messiah. After the last judgment, when the enemies of Israel are cast into Gehenna, the righteous are raised to paradise, and there behold the glory of God. Associated with such views as these, we find farther the idea (3) that in the future glory paradise, or the heavenly Jerusalem, which stood in paradise before the fall and was removed to heaven with it (Apoc. Baruch), will be brought down from heaven to earth, that the tree of life will be planted on Zion (Bk. Enoch, 4 Ezra). All these apocalyptic crudities, which it is not necessary to follow into details, are really mechanical developments of a legitimate, one may even say an inevitable, inference from the position that the garden of Gen. ii. represents a state of ideal human felicity lost through sin. For, if this be so, the future bliss of the redeemed must be conceived as somehow analogous to the life of Eden, and a literal unimaginative conception of this analogy, making no allowance for the difference between the happiness of childhood, prior to experience of the everyday world, and the happiness of a life which has conquered the world, must end in regarding the future home of the blest as a mere reproduction of Eden. But the use of the word paradise for the home of [9:18:237] the blessed does not necessarily imply so mechanical a conception as we find in the Jewish apocalypses; to speak of the future bliss at all, without the use of metaphysics, is possible only in the form of poetical description, and for such description the story of the garden of Eden supplied the necessary concrete elements, which the apocalyptists took literally, while higher thinkers used them as symbols— and ordinary language, perhaps, as mere conventional equivalents—for ineffable things. Thus the images borrowed from Eden in such a prophecy as Isa. xi. are certainly not meant literally, any more than the figure of the tree of life in the book of Proverbs. So in the New Testament even Rev. ii. 7 is plainly figurative, and in Luke xxiii. 43 paradise is simply the place of bliss. In 2 Cor. xii. 4 paradise is a heavenly place where ineffable words were heard by Paul; but he himself does not know whether he visited it in the body or out of the body.

See Dillmann’s Buch Enoch, and his articles “Eden” and “Paradies” in SchenkeΓs Bibel- Lexicon·, Weber, Altsynagogale Theologie ; and the books on Biblical theology. The Mohammedan paradise (al-Janna) is borrowed from the Jews, as appears from the name Jannatu 'Adnin, that is, Garden of Eden. It is described in the Koran and by later theologians as a place of all sensuous delights, where the righteous recline on couches in a fair garden drinking the delicious beverage supplied by the fountain Tasnim and waited on by damsels with great bright eyes (“Ηύτ,” Kor. lv. 72, hence our “houri,” which is properly a Persian form). The expression “gardens of Firdaus” (the Persian form of the word Paradise) occurs in Kor. xviii. 107, and is interpreted as meaning the highest region of the Janna (Beidawi in I.)
