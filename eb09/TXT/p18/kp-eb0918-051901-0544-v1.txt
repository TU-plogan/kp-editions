PEPPER TREE. The tree usually so called has no real consanguinity with the true pepper (Piper), but is a member of the Anacard family known botanically as Schinus Molle or Mulli, the latter epithet representing, it is said, the Peruvian name of the plant. It is a small tree with unequally pinnate leaves, the segments linear, entire or finely saw-toothed, the terminal one longer than the rest, and all filled with volatile oil stored in large cells or cysts, which are visible to the naked eye and appear like holes wdιen the leaf is held up to the light. When the leaves are thrown upon the surface of water the resinous or oily fluid escapes with such force as violently to agitate them. The flowers are small, whitish, arranged in terminal clusters, and polygamous or unisexual, with five sepals, as many petals, ten stamens (as large as the petals in the case of the male flower, very small in the female flower, but in both springing from a cushion-like disk surrounding the base of the three-celled ovary). The style is simple or three-cleft, and the fruit a small, globose, pea-like drupe with a bony kernel enclosing a single seed. The fleshy portion of the fruit has a hot aromatic flavour from the abundance of the resin it contains, and to this circumstance the tree probably owes its popular name. The resin is used for medicinal purposes by the Peruvians, and has similar properties to mastic. The Japan pepper tree is Xaηthoxylum piperitum, the fruits of which have also a hot taste. Along the Riviera the tree known as Melia Azedarach, or the “Pride of India,” a very ornamental tree with elegant foliage and dense clusters of fragrant lilac flowers, is also incorrectly called the pepper tree by visitors.
