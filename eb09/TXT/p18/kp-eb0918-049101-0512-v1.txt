PENGUIN, the name (of very uncertain origin) of a flightless sea-bird,^[1. Of the three derivations assigned to this name, the first is by Drayton in 1613 (PοlyοU>iοn, Song 9), where it is said to be the Welsh pen gwyn, or “white head”; the second, which seems to meet with Littré’s approval, deduces it from the Latin pinguis (fat); the third supposes it to be a corruption of “pin-wing” (Ann. Nat. History, ser. 4, iv. p. 133), meaning a bird that has undergone the operation of pinioning or, as in one part at least of England it is commonly called, “pin-winging.” In opposition to the first of these hypotheses it has been urged (1) that there is no real evidence of any Welsh discovery of the bird, (2) that it is very unlikely for the Welsh, if they did discover it, to have been able to pass on their name to English navigators, and (3) that it had not a white head, but only a patch of white thereon. To the second hypo thesis Prof. Skeat (Dictionary, p. 433) objects that it “will not account for the suffix -in, and is therefore wrong; besides which the ‘ Dutchmen ’ [who were asserted to be the authors of the name] turn out to be Sir Francis Drake” and his men. In support of the third hypothesis Mr. Reeks wrote (Zoologist, ser. 2, p. 1804) that the people in Newfoundland who used to meet with this bird always pronounced its name “Pin wing.” Prof. Skeat’s inquiry (loc. citA), whether the name may not after all be South-American, is to be answered in the negative, since, so far as evidence goes, it was given to the North-American bird before the South-Americau was known in Europe.] but, so far as is known, first given to one inhabiting the seas of Newfoundland, as in Hore’s “Voyage to Cape Breton,” 1536 (Hackluyt, Researches, iii. pp. 168-170), which subsequently became known as the Great Auk or Gare-fowl (vol. x. p. 78); and, though the French equivalent Pingouin ^[2. Gorfou has also been used by some French writers, being a corruption of Geirfugl or Gare-fowl.] · preserves its old application, at the present day, the word Penguin is by English ornithologists always used in a general sense for certain Birds inhabiting the Southern Ocean, called by the French Manchots, the Spheniscidae of ornithologists, which in some respects form perhaps the most singular group of the whole Class, or at least we may say of the Carinate Subclass. For a long while their position was very much misunderstood, some of the best of recent or even living systematists having placed them in close company with the Alcidae or Auks, to which they bear only a relationship of analogy, as indeed had been perceived by a few ornithologists, who recognized in the Penguins a very distinct Order, Pηιpennes. The view of the latter is hardly likely to be disputed in future, now that the anatomical researches of MM. Paul Gervais and Alix (Journ. de Zoologie, 1877, pp. 424-470), M. Filhol {Bull. Soc. Philomathique, ser. 7, vi. pp. 226-248), and above all of Prof. Watson (Zoology, Voy. Challenger, part xviii.) have put the independent position of the Splieniscidae in the clearest light.^[3. Though the present writer cannot wholly agree with the conclusions of the last of these investigators, his remarks (pp. 230-232) on the “Origin of the Penguins” are worthy of all attention. He considers that they are the surviving members of a group that branched off early from the primitive “avian” stem, but that at the time of their separation the stem had diverged so far from Reptiles as to possess true wings, though the metatarsal bones had not lost their distinctness and become fused into the single bone so characteristic of existing Birds. The ancestral Penguin, Prof. Watson argues, must have had functional wings, the muscles of which, through atrophy, have been converted into non-contractile tendinous bands.] The most conspicuous outward character presented by the Penguins is the total want of quills in their wings, which are as incapable of flexure as the flippers of a Cetacean, though they move freely at the shoulder-joint, and some at least of the species occasionally make use of them for progressing on land. In the water they are most efficient paddles, and are usually, if not always, worked alternately with a rotatory action. The plumage which clothes the whole body, leaving no bare spaces, generally consists of small scale-like feathers, many of them consisting only of a simple shaft without the development of barbs; but several of the species have the head decorated with long cirrhous tufts, and in some the tail-quills, which are very numerous, are also long.^[4. The pterylographical characters of the Penguins are well described by Mr Hyatt (Proc. Boston Soc. Nat. History, 1871). Mr Bartlett has observed (Proc. Zook Society, 1879, pp. 6-9) that, instead of moulting in the way that birds ordinarily do, Penguins, at least in passing from the immature to the adult dress, cast off the short scale-like feathers from their wings in a manner that he compares to “the shedding of the skin in a serpent.”] In standing these birds preserve an upright position, generally resting on the “tarsus”^[5. The three metatarsals in the Penguins are not, as in other birds, united for the whole of their length, but only at the extremities, thus preserving a portion of their originally distinct existence, a fact probably attributable to arrest of development, since the researches of Prof. Gegenbaur shew that the embryos of all birds, so far as is known, possess these bones in an independent condition. More recently Prof. Marsh has found that in the Dinosaurian genus Ceratosaurus the metatarsals acquire a condition very similar to that which they present in the Penguins (Am. Journ. Science, Aug. 1884).] alone, but in walking or running on land this is kept nearly vertical, and their weight is supported by the toes alone.

The most northerly limit of the Penguins’ range in the Atlantic is Tristan d’Acunha, and in the Indian Ocean Amsterdam Island, but they also occur off the Cape of Good Hope and along the south coast of Australia, as well as on the south and east of New Zealand, while in the Pacific one species at least extends along the west coast of South America and to the Galapagos; but north of the equator none are found. In the breeding season they resort to the most desolate lands in higher southern latitudes, and indeed have been met with as far to the southward as navigators have penetrated. Possibly the Falkland Islands may be regarded as the locality richest in species,^[6. An interesting account of the Penguins of these islands is given by Capt. Abbott (Ibis, 1860, p. 336).] though, whatever may have been the case once, their abundance there as individuals does not now nearly approach what it is in many other places, owing doubtless to the ravages of man, whose advent is always accompanied by massacre and devastation on an enormous scale—the habit of the helpless birds, when breeding, to congregate by hundreds and thousands in what are called “Penguin-rookeries” contributing to the ease with which their slaughter can be effected. Incapable of escape by flight, they are yet able to make enough resistance or retaliation (for they bite powerfully [9:18:492] when they get the chance) to <xcite the wrath of their murderers, and this only brings upon them greater destruction, so that the interest of nearly all the numerous accounts of these “rookeries” is spoilt by the disgusting details of the brutal havoc perpetrated upon them.

The Spheniscùlae have been divided into at least eight genera, but three, or at most four, seem to be all that are needed, and three can be well distinguished, as pointed out by Dr Coues in the Philadelphia Proceedings for 1872 (pp. 170-212), by anatomical as well as by external characters. They are (1) Aptenodytes, easily recognized by its long and thin bill, slightly decurved, from which Pygoscelis, as Prof. Watson has shewn, is hardly distinguishable; (2) Eudyptes, in which the bill is much shorter and somewhat broad; and (3) Spheniscus, in which the shortish bill is compressed and the maxilla ends in a conspicuous hook. Aptenodytes contains the largest species, among them those known as the “Emperor” and ‘ ‘ King” Penguins, A. patagonica and A. longirostris. ^[7. An example, presumably of the former species, weighing 78 lb, was, according to Dr Μ‘Connick {Voyages of Discovery, i. p. 2õ9), obtained by the “Terror” in January 1842.] Three others belong also to this genus, if Pygoscelis be not recognized, but they seem not to require any particular remark. Eudyptes, containing the crested Penguins, known to sailors as “Rock-hoppers” or “Macaronis,” would appeal* to have five species, and Spheniscus four, among which S. nιendiculus, which occurs in the Galapagos, and therefore has the most northerly range of the whole group, alone needs notice here. The generic and specific distribution of the Penguins is the subject of an excellent essay by Prof. Alphonse Milne-Edwards in the Annales des Sciences Naturelles for 1880 (vol. ix. art. 9, pp. 23-81), of which there is a German translation in the Mittheilungen of the Ornithological Union of Vienna for 1883 (pp. 179-186, 210-222, 238-241).
