PERTH, a city of Australia, capital of the colony of Western Australia, is picturesquely situated on the Swan [9:18:669] river, 31° 57' 10" S. lat., 115° 52' 20" E. long., 12 miles above Freemantle and 1700 west-north-west of Melbourne. The streets are wide and regular, and the houses are built chiefly of brick and stone. It is the seat of an Anglican and of a Roman Catholic bishop. In addition to the cathedrals the principal buildings are the town-hall, built entirely by convict labour, the mechanics’ institute, the governor’s palace, and the high school. Perth was founded in 1829, received a municipal constitution in 1856, and was created a city in 1880. In the same year railway communication was opened up by means of the Eastern Railway. The population of the city, including the military, in 1871 was 5007, and in 1881 it was 5044.
