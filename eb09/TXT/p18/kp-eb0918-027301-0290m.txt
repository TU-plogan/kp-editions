PARGA, a town on the Albanian coast, in the Turkish vilayet of Janina, beautifully situated in the midst of orchards devoted to the cultivation of the larger citron, with a rock-built citadel and a harbour formed by a mole constructed by the Venetians in 1572. Its population does not now exceed 1500, but its imports and exports (citrons, wool, oak bark, and skins) reach a value of .£42,000 (1880), and the place is historically famous.

Originally occupying the site of the ancient Toryne (Palaeo-Parga), a short distance to the λvest, Parga was removed to its present position after the Turkish invasion. Under Venetian protection, freely accepted in 1401, the inhabitants maintained their municipal independence and commercial prosperity down to the destruction of the great republic in 1797, though on two occasions, in 1500 and 1560, their city was burned by the Turks. The attempts of Ali Pasha of Janina to make himself master of the place were thwarted partly by the presence of a French garrison in the citadel and partly by the heroic attitude of the Pargiotes themselves, who were anxious to have their city incorporated with the Ionian Republic. To secure their purpose they in 1814 expelled the French garrison and accepted British protection; but the British Government in 1815, with a breach of faith which excited general reprobation, determined to go back to the convention of 1800 by which Parga was to be surrendered to Turkey, though no mosque was to be built or Mussulman to settle within its territory. Rather than subject themselves to the tyranny of Ali Pasha, the Pargiotes decided to forsake their country; and accordingly in 1819, having previously exhumed and burned the remains of their ancestors, they migrated to the Ionian Islands. The Turkish Government was constrained to pay them £142,425 by way of compensation.
