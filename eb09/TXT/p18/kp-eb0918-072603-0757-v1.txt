PHAeDRUS, the author of five books of Latin fables in verse, lived in the reigns of Augustus, Tiberius, Caligula, and Claudius. To his literary vanity we owe most of our scanty knowledge of his life. He was born on the Pierian Mountain in Macedonia, but seems to have been brought at an early age to Italy, for he mentions that he read a verse of Ennius as a boy at school. According to the heading of the chief MS. he was a slave and was freed by Augustus. He incurred the wrath of Sejanus, the powerful minister of Tiberius, but on what grounds is not known. Devoting himself to literature, he lived in poverty and died at an advanced age. The first two books of his fables were published together; the third, fourth, and fifth appeared later, each by itself. The third book is dedicated to Eutychus, a wealthy man of business and probably a freedman, to whom the poet appeals for promised help. The fourth book is dedicated to Parti-culon, who seems to have dabbled in literature. From the fact that Seneca, writing in 43 or 44 a.d. (Consol, ad Polyb., 27), knows of no Latin writer of fables we may infer that Phaedrus published his fables after that time, but the exact date is unknown. His work shows little or no originality; he simply versified (in iambic trimeters)· the fables current in his day under the name of “Aesop,'” interspersing them with anecdotes drawn from daily life, history, and mythology. He tells his fable and draws the moral with business-like directness and simplicity; his language is classical, neat, and clear, but thoroughly prosaic, though it occasionally attains a dignity bordering on eloquence. He is fond of abstract words. From a literary point of view Phaedrus is far inferior to those masters of fable-writing, Babrius and La Fontaine; he lacks the quiet picturesqueness and pathos of the former, and the exuberant vivacity and humour of the latter. Though he frequently refers to the envy and detraction which pursued him, Phaedrus seems to have attracted little attention in antiquity. He is mentioned by Martial (iii. 20, 5), who imitated some of his verses, and by Avianus. Prudentius must have read him, for he imitates one of his lines (Prud., Cath., vii. 115; cp. Phaedrus, iv. 6, 10).

The first edition of the five books of Phaedrus was published by Pithou at Troyes in 1596. But, from the gaps in the books as well as from the disproportionate shortness of some of them, it is plain that this collection is incomplete. In the beginning of the 18th century there was discovered at Parma a MS. of Perotti (1430-1480), archbishop of Siponto, containing sixty-four fables of Phaedrus, of which thirty-two were new. These new fables were first published at Naples by Cassitto in 1808, and afterwards (much more correctly) by Jannelli in 1811. Both editions were superseded by the discovery of a much [9:18:727] better preserved MS. of Perotti in the Vatican, which was published by Angelo Mai in 1831. For some time the authenticity of these new fables was disputed, but they are now generally accepted, and with justice, as genuine fables of Phaedrus. They do not form a sixth book, for we know from Avianus that Phaedrus wrote five books only, but it is impossible to assign them to their original places in the five books. They are usually printed as an appendix. Even thus it is probable that we have not the whole of Phaedrus.

In the Middle Ages Phaedrus exercised a considerable influence through the prose versions of his fables which were current, though his own works and even his name were forgotten. Of these prose versions the oldest existing seems to be that known as the “Anonymus Nilantianus,” so called because first edited by Nilant at Leyden in 1709 from a MS. of the 10th or beginning of the 11th century. It approaches the text of Phaedrus so closely that it was probably made directly from it. Of the sixty-seven fables which it contains thirty are derived from lost fables of Phaedrus. But the largest and most influential of the prose versions of Phaedrus is that which bears the name of “Romulus.” It contains eighty-three fables, is as old as the 10th century, and seems to have been based on a still earlier prose version, which, under the name of “Aesop,” and addressed to one Rufus, may have been made in the Cariovingian period. The preface of Romulus, in which he professes to have translated the fables from the Greek, is a mere fiction of the copyist; no such Romulus as this ever existed, although in the Middle Ages he was sometimes thought to have been a Roman emperor, and has still a place in the Biographie Universelle (1863). The collection of fables in the Weissenburg (now Wolfenbüttel) MS. is based on the same version (the Aesopus ad Rufum) as Romulus. These three prose versions contain in all one hundred distinct fables, of which fifty-six are derived from the existing and the remaining forty-four presumably from lost fables of Phaedrus. Some modern scholars, as Burmann, Dressier, and L. Müller, have tried to restore these lost fables by versifying the prose versions.

The collection bearing the name of Romulus became in its turn the source from which, during the second half of the Middle Ages, almost all the collections of Latin fables in prose and verse were wholly or partially drawn. A version of the first three books of Romulus in elegiac verse enjoyed a wide popularity, even into the Renaissance. Its author (generally referred to since the edition of Névelet in 1610 as the Anonymous of Névelet) was long unknown, but Hervieux has lately shown grounds for identifying him with Walther of England, chaplain to Henry II. and afterwards archbishop of Palermo. The version dates from the latter part of the 12th century. It was especially popular in Italy, where the Italian translation of Accio Zuccho (Verona, 1479) was frequently reprinted. Another version of Romulus in Latin elegiacs was made by Alexander Neckam, born at St Albans in 1157, and towards the end of his life (early part of 13th century) abbot of the Augustinian monastery at Exeter. Neckam knew and copied Walther’s version, but his Oλvn never had the same popularity. Amongst the collections partly derived from Romulus the most famous is probably that in French verse by Marie de France (q.v.). About 1200 a collection of fables in Latin prose, based partly on Romulus, was made by the Cistercian monk Odo of Sherrington; they have a strong mediaeval and clerical tinge. In 1370 Gerard of Minden wrote a poetical version of Romulus in Low German.

Since the first edition of Phaedrus by Pithou in 1596 the editions and translations have been very numerous; among the editions may specially be mentioned those of Burmann (1718 and 1727), Bentley (1726), Schwabe (1806), Berger de Xivrey (1830), Orelìi (1832), Eyssenhardt (1867), L. Müller (1877), Hervieux, in his work Les Fabulistes Latins depuis le siècle d’Auguste jusqu’à la fin du moyen age, Paris, 1884. For the mediaeval versions of Phaedrus and their derivatives see L. Roth, in Philologus, i. p. 523 sq. ; H. Oesterley, Romulus die Paraphrasen des Phaedrus und die aesopische Fabel im Mittelalter, 1870 (untrustworthy); E. Grosse, in Jahrbb. f class. Philol., vol. cv. (1872); and especially the learned work of Hervieux, who gives the Latin texts of all the mediaeval imitators (direct and indirect) of Phaedrus, some of these texts being now edited for the first time.
