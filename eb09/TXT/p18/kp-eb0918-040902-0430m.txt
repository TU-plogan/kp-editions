PATNA, a native state in the Central Provinces of India, lying between 20° 5' and 21° N. lat., and between 82° 45' and 83° 40' E. long., has an estimated area of 2399 square miles, of which 550 are under cultivation, and other 950 are returned as cultivable. The country is an undulating plain, rugged and isolated, with ridges of hills crossing it here and there, and shut in on the north by a lofty irregular range. Rice forms the staple produce, but pulses, oil-seeds, sugar-cane, and cotton are also grown. A vast forest extends for 30 miles around Patna village containing valuable large timber, but infested by tigers, leopards, and other wild animals. Iron ore exists in many parts of the state, but no mines are regularly worked. The only means of communication are a few bullock or pony tracks. The estimated population in 1881 was 257,959, nearly all of whom were Hindus. Patna was formerly the most important of the cluster of chiefships known as the Athára Garhjat (The Eighteen Forts), but under its later rulers it greatly declined. Since 1871, however, when it was taken under direct British management, it has gradually been regaining prosperity.
