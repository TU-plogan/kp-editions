PASSAU, an ancient town and episcopal see of Bavaria, lies in the district of Lower Bavaria, and occupies a highly picturesque situation at the confluence of the Danube, the Inn, and the Hz, 90 miles to the north-east of Munich, and close to the Austrian frontier. It consists of the town proper, on the rocky tongue of land between the Danube and the Inn, and of the three suburbs of Innstadt, on the right bank of the Inn, Ilzstadt, on the left bank of the Hz, and Anger, in the angle between the Ilz and the Danube. Passau is one of the most beautiful places on the Danube, a fine effect being produced by the way in which the houses are piled one above another on the heights rising from the river. The best general view is obtained from the Oberhaus, an old fortress now used as a prison, which crowns a hill 300 feet high on the left bank of the Danube. A detailed inspection of the buildings of the town, most of which date from the 17th and 18th centuries, scarcely fulfils the expectation aroused by their imposing appearance as a whole. The most noteworthy are the cathedral, a florid rococo structure on the site of an earlier church, which claims to have been founded in the 5th century; the post-office, in which the treaty of Passau was signed; the episcopal palace; the old Jesuit college, with a library of 30,000 volumes; the arsenal; the Romanesque church of the Holy Cross; and the double church of St Salvator. The old forts and bastions have been demolished, but the Niederhaus, at the base of the Oberhaus, is still extant, though no longer maintained as a fortress. The chief products of the insignificant industry of the town are tobacco, leather, and paper. It also possesses iron and copper foundries and a few barge-building yards. The well-known Passau crucibles are made at the neighbouring village of Obernzell. Trade is carried on in iron and timber, large quantities of the latter being floated down the Hz. The inhabitants (15,365 in 1880) are nearly all Roman Catholics.

Passau is a town of very ancient origin. The first settlement here is believed to have been the Celtic BoiuduruÎ¹n, on the site of the present Innstadt; and the Romans afterwards established a colony of Batavian veterans (Castra Batava) on the site of the town proper. The bishopric was founded in the 8th century, and most of the subsequent history of Passau is made up of broils between the bishops and the townsmen. The fortress of Oberhaus was erected by the former in consequence of a revolt in the 13th century, and at a later [9:18:342] period its guns were often turned on the town. In 1552 Charles V. and Elector Maurice of Saxony here signed the treaty of Passau, by which the former was constrained to acknowledge the principle of religious toleration. The town was a frequent object of dispute in the war of the Spanish succession, and it was taken by the Austrians in 1806. The bishopric was secularized in 1803, and its territory annexed to Bavaria two years later. The present bishopric was established in 1817.
