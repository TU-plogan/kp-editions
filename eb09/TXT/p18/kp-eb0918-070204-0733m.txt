PETERWARDEIN (Hungarian Petervárad, Servian Petrovaradin), a town and strong fortress of Hungary, is situated on a promontory formed by a loop of the Danube, ,45 miles to the north-west of Belgrade. It is connected with Neusatz on the opposite bank by a bridge of boats 800 feet long. The fortifications consist of the upper fortress, on a lofty serpentine rock rising abruptly from the plain on three sides, and of the lower fortress at the northern base of the rock. The latter includes the town, which contains (1880) 3603 inhabitants, engaged in winegrowing, agriculture, and the manufacture of liqueurs (rosoglio) and vinegar. The two fortresses can accommodate a garrison of 10,000 men. The arsenal contains interesting trophies of the Turkish wars.

Peterwardein, the “Gibraltar of Hungary,” is believed to represent the Roman Acumincum, and received its present name from Peter the Hermit, who here marshalled the levies of the first crusade. It was captured by the Turks in 1526 and retained by them for 160 years. In 1716 it witnessed a signal defeat inflicted [9:18:703] on the Turks by Prince Eugene. During the.revolutionary struggles of 1848-49 the fortress was held by the insurgents for a short time.
