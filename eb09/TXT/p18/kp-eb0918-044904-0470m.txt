PEDOMETER is an apparatus in the form of a watch, which, carried on the person of a traveller, indicates the number of paces made, and thereby approximately the distance travelled. The ordinary form has a dial-plate with chapters for yards and miles respectively, but in some, miles and their fractions only are indicated, while others are divided for kilometres, &c. The registration is effected by the fall of a heavy pendulum, caused by the percussion of each step. The pendulum is forced back to a horizontal position by a delicate spring, and with each stroke a fine-toothed ratchet-wheel attached to it is moved round a certain length. The ratchet communicates with a train of wheels which govern the dial-hands. In using the apparatus a measured mile or other known distance is walked, and the indication thereby made on the dial-plate observed. According as it is too great or too small, the stroke of the pendulum is shortened or lengthened by a screw which correspondingly affects the ratchet motion, [9:18:450] and thereby regulates the indication to the average pace. Obviously the pedometer is little better than an ingenious toy, depending even for rough measurements on the uniformity of pace maintained throughout the journey measured.
