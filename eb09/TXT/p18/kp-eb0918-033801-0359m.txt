PASCHAL I., pope from 817 to 824, a native of Rome, was raised to the pontificate by popular acclamation, shortly after the death of Stephen IV., and before the sanction of the emperor (Louis the Pious) had been obtainedâ€”a circumstance for which it was one of his first cares to apologize. His relations with the imperial house, however, never became cordial; and he was also unsuccessful in retaining in Rome itself the popularity to which he had owed his election. He died at Rome while the imperial commissioners were investigating the circumstances under which two important officers of Lothair, the eldest son of Louis, had been seized at the Lateran, blinded, and afterwards beheaded; Paschal had shielded the murderers but denied all personal complicity in their crime. The Roman people refused him the honour of burial within the church of St Peter, but he now holds a place in the Roman calendar (May 16). Like one or two of his more immediate predecessors he was liberal in his donations to several churches of the city, St Cecilia in Trastevere having been restored and St Maria in Domnica [9:18:339] rebuilt by him; he also built the church of St Prassede. The successor of Paschal I. was Eugenius II.
