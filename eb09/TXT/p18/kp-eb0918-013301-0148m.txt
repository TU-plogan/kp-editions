PAEZ, JoséAntonio, one of the leaders of the struggle for South-American independence, and the first president (1830-38) of the republic of Venezuela, was born of Indian parents in the neighbourhood of Acarigua in the province of Barinas, and died in exile at New York, May 6, 1873. His military career, which began about 1810, was distinguished by the defeat of the Spanish forces at Mata de la Miel (1815), at Montecal and throughout the province of Apure (1816), and at Puerto Cabello (1823). At first he acted in concert with Bolivar {q.υ.}, but in 1829 he procured the secession of Venezuela from the republic of Colombia. For his later life see Venezuela. His autobiography was published at New York in 1867— 69, and his son Ramon Paez (otherwise known as an author) wrote Public Life of J. A. Paez (1864).
