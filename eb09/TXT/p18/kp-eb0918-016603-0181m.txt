PALAePHATUS, the author of a treatise τr∈pc απίστων, “On Incredible (Narratives),” which has been preserved. It consists of a series of explanations of Greek legends, without any attempt at arrangement or plan. It is obviously a mere epitome of some more complete work. The great number of MSS., containing numerous variations in text, and the frequent quotations made from the treatise by late writers, show that it was a favourite work in their time. It is probable that the original treatise, from which it was abbreviated, was the λυσ∈ιs τωv μυθι,κως tipημivωv of a late writer mentioned by Suidas as a grammarian of Egypt or of Athens.
