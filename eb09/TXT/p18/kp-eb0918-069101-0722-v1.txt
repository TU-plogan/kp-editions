PESSINUS, or Pesinus (Π∈σ∙crιiOfis, Dérivons), an ancient city of Galatia in Asia Minor, situated on the southern slope of Mount Dindymus. It stood on the left bank of the river Sangarius, about 150 stadia (17 miles) from its source, and 16 miles south of Germa on the road from Ancyra to Amorium. It was the capital of the Tolistobogii and the chief commercial city of the district. It was famous for its worship of the mother of the gods (Cybele), who here went by the name of Agdistis. Her priests were anciently princes as well, but in the time of Strabo (1st century B.c.) their privileges were much diminished. The kings of Pergamum built a new temple adorned with porticos of white marble. The image of the goddess, a stone (or piece of wood) said to have fallen from heaven, was taken to Rome in 204 b.c., in compliance with an oracle in the Sibylline books to the effect that the foreign foe could be driven from Italy if the Idaean Mother (Cybele) were brought from Pessinus to Rome. But the goddess continued to be worshipped in her old home as well as at Rome; her priests, the Galli, went out to meet Manlius on his march in 189 b.c., and at a later age the temple was visited by Julian the Apostate. In the division of the empire under Constantine, Pessinus was made the capital of the province Galatia Salutaris. It was also the seat of a metropolitan bishopric. After the 6th century the town disappears from history. The rains discovered by Texier occupy three hills near the village of Bala-Hissar, 9 or 10 miles south-east of Sevri-Hissar. They include a theatre in partial preservation and numerous fragments of marble columns, friezes, Arc. The modern town of Sevri-Hissar is built at the height of about 3000 feet on the southern base of a steep granite rock, half-way up which are the ruins of a castle.
