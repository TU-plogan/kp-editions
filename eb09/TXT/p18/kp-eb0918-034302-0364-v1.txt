PASSION WEEK, the fifth week in Lent, begins with Passion Sunday {Dominica Passionis or de Passione Domini), so called from very early times because with it begins the more special commemoration of Christ’s passion. In non-Catholic circles Passion Week is often identified with Holy Week {q.v.), but incorrectly.
