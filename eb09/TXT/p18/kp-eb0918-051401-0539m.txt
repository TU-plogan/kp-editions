PENTECOST, a feast of the Jews, was in its original meaning, as has been explained in Pentateuch (supra, p. 511), the closing feast of the harvest gladness, at which, according to Lev. xxiii. 17, leavened bread was presented at the sanctuary as the firstfruits of the new cereal store. Hence the names “Feast of Harvest” (Exod. xxiii. 16), “Day of Firstfruits” (Num. xxviii. 26); but the commoner Old Testament name (Exod. xxxiv. 22; Deut. xvi. 10, 16; 2 Chron. viii. 13) is “Feast of Weeks,” because it fell exactly seven weeks (Deut. xvi. 9), or, on the Jewish way of reckoning an interval by counting in both termini, just fifty days (Lev. xxiii. 16) after the offering of the first sheaf of the harvest at the Feast of Unleavened Bread. Pentecost or “Fiftieth” day is only a Greek equivalent of the last name (πeντηκoστη in the Apocrypha and New Testament). The orthodox later Jews reckoned the fifty days from the sixteenth of Nisan, cutting the ritual sheaf on the night of (that is, on our division of days, the night preceding) that day (see Passover). In Deuteronomy Pentecost, like the other two great annual feasts, is a pilgrimage feast (Deut. xvi. 16), and so it was observed in later times; but, unlike the others, it lasts but one day, agreeably to its character (expressed in the name ΓΠ∙¾ ’Acrapöá, given to it by Josephus and the later Jews) as merely the solemn closing day of harvest-time. Like the other great feasts, it came to be celebrated by fixed special sacrifices. The amount of these is differently expressed in the earlier and later priestly law (Lev. xxiii. 18 sq.; Num. xxviii. 26 sqf); the discrepancy was met by adding the two lists. The later Jews also extended the one day of the feast to two. Further, in accordance with the tendency to substitute historical for economic explanations of the great feasts, Pentecost came to be regarded as the feast commemorative of the Sinaitic legislation.

To the Christian church Pentecost acquired a new significance through the outpouring of the Spirit (Acts ii.). See Whitsunday.
