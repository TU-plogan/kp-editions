PAULUS DIACONUS, the historian of the Lombard dominion in Italy, flourished in the 8th century (see Lombards, vol. xiv. p. 813). An ancestor of his named Leupichis entered Italy in the train of Alboin and received an allotment of lands at or near Forum Julii (Friuli). By an invasion of Avars all the five sons of this warrior were swept off into Illyria, but one, his namesake, returned through many perils and restored the ruined fortunes of his house. His grandson was Warnefrid, who, by his wife Theodelinda, became the father of Paulus. The future historian (born about 720 or 725) received an education unusually good for his times, possibly in part conducted at the court of King Ratchis in Pavia. From a teacher named Flavian he received at least the rudiments of Greek. In middle life, probably, he retired into the great Benedictine monastery of Monte Cassino, which his patron King Ratchis had entered in 749. The ruin which befell the Lombard monarchy in 774 at the hands of Charles the Great may have caused him to take this step. In this ruin was involved his brother Arichis, whose estates were confiscated, himself confined in prison for seven years, and his wife and children reduced to beggary. About 781 Paulus left his monastery and travelled to France, probably in order to intercede for this brother, and after considerable delay his request was granted. Meanwhile, his literary gifts had come to be highly appreciated by the Frankish king. The letters and the verses which passed between Charles (employing the pen of a secretary) and Paulus give -a pleasant idea of the relation between the two parties, and remind us of the intercourse between the Italian princes and the scholars of the Renaissance. After some years’ residence in France Paulus returned to Italy and to his convent, and died, probably between 790 and 800, at his beloved Monte Cassino. His surname, Diaconus (or Levita), shows that he took orders as a deacon, no doubt during his residence in the monastery.

The chief works of Paulus are his Continuation of Eutropius and his Lombard History. The former (one of his earliest works) was written at the request of Adelperga, wife of the duke of Benevento. Paulus recommended her to read the Roman history of Eutropius, but, as she complained that this heathen writer said nothing of church affairs, and stopped short at the death of Jovian, Paulus interwove some extracts from the ecclesiastical historians, and added six books (xi∙-xvι), bringing down the history to 553 a.d. At this point his Lombard History, in six books, written in the later years of his life and cut short by his death, takes up the tale, which is told henceforward from the point of view of a Lombard patriot. The sagas of the Langobardic warriors, plentifully interspersed, give to the narrative a wild barbaric interest. The document called the Origo Gentis Langobardicae and the lost history of Secundus of Trient furnished some of his materials. He also makes free use of Gregory of Tours, Bede, Isidore, and others. In some aspects Paulus naturally suggests a comparison with Jordanes, that other historian of a barbarian nation falling into ruin, but in learning and literary honesty the Lombard is greatly the superior of the Goth. His style is, for his age, wonderfully good, though his grammar shows the breaking down of the old Latin inflexions into the lingua volgare.

Paulus wrote also a history of the bishops of Metz, some homilies, and several small poems, some rhythmical, some metrical. His works were frequently copied in the Middle Ages. Of the Lombard History there are more than a hundred MSS. extant, those of Assisi, Cividale, and St Gall being the most important. The edition of his histories published as part of the Monumenta Germanise Historica (1878-79) supersedes all others. For further information, the student may consult G. Waitz’s preface to the Lombard History in that edition, and F. Dahn’s Laηgobardische Studien, au able monograph, but perhaps too negative in its conclusions. The English reader will find an excellent sketch of Paulus’s life and writings in Ugo Balzani’s Early Chroniclers of Italy (London, 1883).
