PERSIGN Y, Jean Gilbert Victor Fialin, Duc de (1808-1872), the most devoted servant of Napoleon III., who with the due de Morny and Marshal Saint-Arnaud formed the triumvirate which established the second empire, was born at Saint-Germain Lespinasse (Loire) on 11th January 1808. He came of a rood family, but not a noble one, and, as his father had been killed at the battle of Salamanca in 1812, he was brought up by an uncle, who sent him to be educated at the college of Limoges. He entered the 3d Hussars in 1825, the cavalry school at Saumur in 1826, and became maréchal des logis in the 4th Hussars in 1828. He was at this time a Legitimist, but was soon made a Republican by his captain, and he helped to persuade his regiment to assist in the insurrection of 1830. For this service he expected great rewards, but got none, and was eventually dismissed from the army for insubordination in 1831. Finding himself without resources, he took to journalism, and assisted in editing the Temps, and in 1833, by which time he had become a profound Bonapartist, he issued a solitary number of a new journal, the Occident français, in which he proclaimed his political creed. This number was sent to Queen Hortense at Arenenberg, and when Μ. Fialin followed it in person, calling himself the vicomte de Persigny, he met with a warm reception, and soon became indispensable to Louis Napoleon. He had two qualities which gave him ascendency over the young prince, fidelity and audacity. He it was who planned the attempt on Strasburg in 1836, and that on Boulogne in 1840. For his share in the last escapade he was sentenced to imprisonment in a fortress for twenty years, which was commuted into detention at Versailles, where he wrote a curious book to prove that the Pyramids were built to keep the Nile from silting up. When the Revolution of 1848 broke out he laboured indefatigably for the Bonapartist cause, securing the election of Louis Napoleon to the Constituent Assembly in June and in September 1848, and to the presidency in December 1848. His own prosperity was now secured; he was made aide-de-camp to the prince president, and elected to the Legislative Assembly in May 1849 for the department of the Loire. He then became one of the secret plotters of the coup d’état, and was at first designed for the office of minister of the interior, but a man of more capacity, De Morny, was chosen for this post, and Persigny only accompanied Colonel Espinasse to take possession of the hall of the assembly. On securing the throne Napoleon III. hastened to reward his most faithful personal adherent. Persigny became minister of the interior in the place of De Morny in January 1852, and a senator in December 1852. He resigned office in 1854 and became ambassador in London, with but one short interval (1858-59), from May 1855 to November 1860, when he again became minister of the interior. His second tenure of office lasted till June 1863, when he resigned in disgust at the influence which Μ. Rouher was attaining over the mind of the emperor, and was made duc de Persigny in September 1863. As a minister he showed very little capacity, and throughout the years of his political influence he never seemed to understand, like De Morny, the real bases of the existence of the second empire. He, however, from dislike of Rouher, supported Ollivier in 1869, and defended the plébiscite, and when the empire fell in 1870 escaped to England. He did not long survive the overthrow of the idea which he had so strenuously supported, and died at Nice on 11th January 1872. Fialin de Persigny was certainly only an adventurer, but he had one merit, which the other founders of the second empire did not possess, fidelity to his master.

For Persigny’s life, see a most eulogistic biography by Delaroa (Ze due de Persigny et les doctrines de l'empire, 1865); a short biography in Mirecourt’s Portraits contemporains (1858); and Castille’s Portraits politiques et historiques (1859). His own curious book, De la destination et de l’utilité permanente des Pyramides diÉgypte et de Nubie, was published in 1845, and he wrote various political pamphlets, of which the most interesting relates to the Strasburg attempt, Relation de l’entreprise du prince Napoléon Louis (Lond. 1837). For his political career under the empire, see Taxile Delord’s Histoire du second empire (1868-75).
