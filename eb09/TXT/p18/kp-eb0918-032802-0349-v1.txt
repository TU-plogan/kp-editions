PARTÁBGARH, Pratábgarh, or Pertabgurh, a district of Oudh, India, situated between 25° 34' and 26° 10' 30" N. lat., and between 81° 22' and 82° 29' 45'' E. long., is bounded on the N. by Rái Bareli and Sultán-pur, and on the E., S., and W. by Jaunpur and Allahábád districts. The Ganges forms the south-western boundary line, while the Gumti marks the eastern boundary for a few miles. The area (1881) is 1436 square miles. The general aspect of Partábgarh is that of a richly wooded and fertile plain, here and there relieved by gentle undulations, and in the vicinity of the rivers and streams broken into ravines. The one important river (the Ganges and Gumti nowhere entering the district) is the Sái, which is navigable in the rains, but in the hot season runs nearly dry. The only mineral pro ducts are salt, saltpetre, and kankar or nodular limestone. The manufacture of salt and saltpetre from the saliferous tracts is prohibited. Tigers and leopards are hardly ever met with; but wolves still abound in the ravines and grass lands. Nílgái, wild cattle, hogs, and monkeys do much damage to the crops. Snakes are not numerous. Small game abounds.

The population in 1881 was 847,047 (420,730 males, 426,317 females; 763,054 Hindus, 83,944 Mohammedans, 48 Christians). The principal grain crops are barley, wheat, and rice. Other food crops are gram, peas, arhar, joár , and bàjra. Sugar-cane cultivation has largely increased of late years, and poppy is grown under the superintendence of the Opium Department. Miscellaneous crops include tobacco of superior quality, indigo, fibres, pán, &c. Irrigation is extensively carried on, and manure is made use of wherever procurable. Rents have steadily increased since the introduction of British rule, and still show a tendency to rise. Artisans and skilled labourers have much improved in circumstances of late years; but agricultural labour is still paid in kind at about the same rates that prevailed under native rule. Partábgarh is now well opened up by roads. Four large ferries are maintained on the Ganges, and two on the Gumti. Partábgarh forms a great grain-exporting district Other important exports comprise tobacco, sugar, molasses, opium, oil, ghi, cattle and sheep, hides, &c. The imports consist mainly of salt, cotton, metals and hardware, country cloth, and dyes. The manufactures of the district comprise sugar, blanket weaving, glass beads and bracelets, water-bottles, &c. The gross revenue of the district in 1882-83 was £175,735, of which the land revenue contributed £98,220. Education is afforded by 91 schools, on the rolls of which on 31st March 1883 there were 3493 scholars. The climate is healthy. The average rainfall for the fourteen years ending 1881 was 37 inches.
