PERCEVAL, Spencer (1762-1812), prime minister of England from 1809 to 1812, was the second son of John, second earl of Egmont, and was born in Audley Square, London, in November 1762. He was educated at Harrow and at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he graduated Μ. A. in 1781. He was called to the barat Lincoln’s Inn in 1786. A very able speech in connexion with a famous forgery case having drawn attention to his talents, his success was from that time rapid, and he was soon regarded as the leading counsel on the Midland circuit. Entering parliament for Northampton in April 1796, he distinguished himself by his speeches in support of the administration of Pitt. In 1801, on the formation of the Addington administration, he was appointed solicitor-general, and in 1802 he became attorney-general. An ardent opponent of Catholic emancipation, he delivered in 1807 a speech on the subject which helped to give the deathblow to the Grenville administration, upon which he became chancellor of the exchequer under the duke of Portland, whom in 1809 he succeeded in the premiership. Notwithstanding that he had the assistance in the cabinet of no statesman of the first rank, he succeeded in retaining office till he was shot by an assassin, perhaps a madman, named Bellingham, in the lobby of the House of Commons, 11th May 1812. Perceval will be chiefly remembered for his strenuous opposition to Catholic emancipation, an opposition due to a conscientious dread of the political evils that might result from it. He was a vigorous debater, specially excelling in replies, in which his thorough mastery of all the details of his subject gave him a great advantage.
