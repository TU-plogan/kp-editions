PARDUBITZ, a town of Bohemia, situated at the confluence of the Elbe and the Chrudimka, 55 miles to the east of Prague. The most interesting buildings are the old fortified château of the 16th century, with its Gothic chapel; the church of St Bartholomew, dating in its present form from 1538; the quaint town-house; the Griines Thor, a mediaeval gateway; and the handsome new synagogue. The inhabitants, amounting to 10,292 in 1880, are engaged in the manufacture of sugar, agricultural implements, sweetmeats, spirits, beer, and iron. There is also a tolerably active trade in grain and timber, and the horse fairs attract numerous customers. Pardubitz is a town of ancient origin, the history of which is little more than a record of a successibn of feudal superiors. In 1560 it passed into the possession of the crown, which retained the town-lands down to 1863, λvhen it sold them to the Austrian Credit Bank. Pardubitz suffered severely in the Hussite wars.
