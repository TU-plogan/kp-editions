PEA (Pisum), a genus of Leguminosae, consisting of herbs with compound pinnate leaves ending in tendrils, by means of which the weak stems are enabled to support themselves, and with large leafy stipules at the base. The flowers are typically “papilionaceous,” with a “standard” or large petal above, two side petals or wings, and two front petals below forming the keel. The stamens are ten,—nine united, the tenth usually free or only slightly joined to the others. The ovary is prolonged into a long, thick, bent style, compressed from side to side at the tip and fringed with hairs. The fruit is a characteristic “legume” or pod, bursting when ripe into two valves, which bear the large globular seeds (peas) on their edges. These seeds are on short stalks, the upper extremity of which is dilated into a shallow cup or aril; the two cotyledons are thick and fleshy, with a radicle bent along their edges on one side. The genus is exceedingly close to Lathyrus, being only distinguished technically by the style, which in the latter genus is compressed from above downwards and not thick. It is not surprising, therefore, that under the general name “pea” species both of Pisum and of Lathyrus are included. The common field or grey pea with compressed mottled seeds and two to four leaflets is Pisum arvense, which is cultivated in all temperate parts of the globe, but which, according to the Italian botanists, is truly a native of central and southern Italy. The garden pea, P. sativum, is more tender than the preceding, and its origin is not known. It has not been found in a wild state anywhere, and it is considered that it may be a form of P. arvense, having, however, from four to six leaflets to each leaf and globular seeds of uniform colour.

P. sativum was known to Theophrastus; and De Candol1e points out that the word ‘ ‘ pison” or its equivalent occurs in the Albanian tongue as well as in Latin, whence he concludes that the pea was known to the Aryans, and was perhaps brought by them into Greece and Italy. Peas have been found in the Swiss lake-dwellings of the bronze period. The garden peas differ considerably in size, shape of pod, degree of productiveness, form and colour of seed, &c. The sugar peas are those in which the inner lining of the pod is very thin instead of being somewhat horny, so that the whole pod can be eaten. Unlike most papilionaceous plants, peaflowers are perfectly fertile without the aid of insects, and thus do not intercross so freely as most similar plants do. On the other hand, a case is known wherein the pollen from a purple-podded pea applied to the stigma of one of the green-podded sugar peas produced a purple pod, showing that not only the ovule but even the ovary was affected by the cross. The numerous varieties of peas in cultivation have been obtained by cross-fertilization, but chiefly by selection. Peas constitute a highly nutritious article of diet from the large quantity of nitrogenous materials they contain in addition to starchy and saccharine matters.

The Sweet Pea, cultivated for the beauty and fragrance of its flθλvers, is not a true Pisum, but a species of Lathynιs {L. odoratus), a native of southern Europe. The Chick Pea {Cicer arietinum), not cultivated in England, is still farther removed from the true peas. The Everlasting Pea of gardens is a species of Lathyrus, with very deep fleshy roots, bold foliage, and beautifu! but scentless flowers. L. latifolius, a British wild plant, is the source of most of the garden varieties.
