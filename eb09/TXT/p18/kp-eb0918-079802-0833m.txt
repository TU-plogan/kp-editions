PHLOX, a considerable genus of Polemoniaceae, chiefly consisting of North-American perennial [liants, with entire, usually opposite, leaves and showy flowers generally in terminal clusters. Each flower has a tubular calyx with five lobes, and a salver-shaped corolla with a long slender tube and a flat limb. The five stamens are given off from the tube of the corolla at different heights and do not protrude beyond it. The ovary is three-celled with one to two ovules in each cell; it ripens into a three-valved capsule. Many of the species are cultivated for the beauty of their flowers; and the forms obtained by cross-breeding and selection are innumerable. The garden varieties fall under three groups,—the annuals, including the lovely P. Drum-moηdi from Texas and its many forms; the perennials, including a dwarf section of alpine plants (forms of P. sul>ulatd), suitable, by reason of their prostrate habit and neat mode of growth, for the rockery; and the taller-growing decussate phloxes which contribute so much to the beauty of gardens in late summer, and which have probably originated from P. paniculata. The range of colour in all the groups is from white to rose and lilac.
