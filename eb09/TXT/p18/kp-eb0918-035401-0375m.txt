PAT ΛRENES, a name apparently first used in Milan about the middle of the 11th century to denote the party most extremely opposed to the marriage of priests; besides Patareni, the forms Paterini, Patarelli, Pataraei occur among others. Various etymologies, more or less farfetched, have been offered; it seems, however, pretty well established that the party was so called because, under the leadership of Arialdus, a deacon of Milan, its members used to assemble in the Pataria, or ragmen’s quarter of that city {pates being a provincial word for a rag). The name ultimately came to be applied to the dualistic sect of the Cathari, who were opposed to marriage altogether, and indeed was one of their most common designations in Italy, France, and Bosnia.
