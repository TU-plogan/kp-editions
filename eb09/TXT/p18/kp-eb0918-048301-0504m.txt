PEMBROKE, a municipal and parliamentary borough of South Wales, is picturesquely situated on an elevated ridge at the head of Pennar Mouth Creek, on the south side of Milford Haven, 30 miles south-west of Carmarthen. The ruins of the ancient castle, originally founded by Arnulph de Montgomery in 1094, occupy the summit of the ridge. The castle was one of the strongest of the ancient fortresses of Wales. Beneath it is an enormous natural cavern, called “The Wogan,” 70 feet long and 50 feet wide. At the beginning of the Civil War the castle was held for the Parliament, but, the commandants having gone over to the Royal cause, it was taken by Cromwell after six weeks’ siege. Near the castle are the ruins of Monkton Priory church, in the Norman style, containing a long vaulted nave in good preservation.' The church of St Mary, in the Early Pointed style, possesses a massive steeple. At Pater, 2 miles west of Pembroke, is Pembroke dock, an important Government dockyard, surrounded with very strong fortifications. The dock is 70 acres in extent, and the yard affords employment to about 24,000 artisans. There are also artillery and infantry barracks. Pembroke possesses a town-hall, assembly rooms, a mechanics’ institute, an infirmary, and several charities. The town was incorporated by Strongbow, earl of Pembroke, in the reign of Stephen, but the earliest charter preserved is one granted by John, which was confirmed by successive sovereigns. The population of the municipal borough (area, 5626 acres), which includes the two wards of Pater and Pembroke, in 1871 was 13,704, and in 1881 it was 14,156. The population of the parliamentary borough (area, 6298 acres) in the latter year was 16,339.
