PERINTHUS, a town of Thrace, on the Propontis, 22 miles to the west of Selymbria, strongly situated on a small peninsula on the Bay of Perinthus, on the site of the modern Eski Eregli. It is said to have been a Samian colony, and to have been founded about 599 b.c. According to Tzetzes, its original name was Mygdonia; later it was called Heraclea (Heraclea Thraciae, Heraclea Perinthus). It figures in history chiefly by its stubborn and successful resistance to Philip of Macedon in 340, at which period it seems to have been even more important than Byzantium itself. A number of extant coins of Perinthus show that it was the seat of large and celebrated festivals.
