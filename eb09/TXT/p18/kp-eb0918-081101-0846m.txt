PHOeNIXVILLE, a borough in the United States, in Schuylkill township, Chester county, Pennsylvania, is situated 27â…› miles north-west of Philadelphia by the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad, on the right bank of the Schuylkill river, which is there joined by French Creek, crossed by eight fine bridges. Phoenixville is best known as the seat of the blast-furnaces and mills of the Phaenix Iron Company, which had its origin in a rolling and slitting mill erected in 1790 by Benjamin Longstreth, and long ranked as the largest in the States. The works cover 150 acres and employ sometimes 2500 men. Phoenixville also contains a pottery, a sash and planing mill, a shirt-factory, and needle works; and iron, copper, and lead are all mined in the neighbourhood. The vicinity of the borough is noted for its large number of magnificent iron bridges. The population was 2670 in 1850, 4886 in 1860, 5292 in 1870, and 6682 in 1880.
