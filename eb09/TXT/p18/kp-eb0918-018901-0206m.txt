PALLA VICINO, or Palla vicini, Sforza (1607â€”1667), cardinal, representative of another branch of the same family, was born at Rome in 1607. Having taken holy orders in 1630, and joined the Society of Jesus in 1638, he successively taught philosophy and theology in the Collegio Romano; as professor of theology he was a member of the congregation appointed by Innocent X. to investigate the Jansenist heresy. In 1659 he was made a cardinal by Alexander VII. His death occurred in 1667.

Pallavicino is chiefly known by his history of the council of Trent, written in Italian, *and published at Rome in two folio volumes in 1656-57 (2d edition, considerably modified, in 1666). His avowed object was to correct and supersede the very damaging work of Sarpi on the same subject, and he certainly, by virtue of his position, had access to many important sources from the use of which his predecessor had been precluded; the contending parties, however, are far from agreed as to the completeness of his success. The work was translated into Latin by a Jesuit named Giattinus (Antwerp, 1670). There is a good edition of the original by Zaccharia (6 vols. 4to, 1792-99). It was translated into German by Klitsche in 1835-37.
