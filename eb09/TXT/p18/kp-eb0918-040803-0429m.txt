PATNA, a district in the lieutenant-governorship of Bengal, and in the division or commissionership of Patna,^[1. The division of Patna lies between 24° 17' 15" and 27° 29' 45" N. lat., and between 83° 23' and 86° 46' E. long., and comprises the districts of Patna, Gayá, Sháhábád, Darbhangah, Muzaffarpur, Sáran, and Champáran. The area (1881) was 23,647 square miles, and the population 15,063,944, viz., Hindus 13,327,728, Mohammedans 1,730,093, Christians 5875, and “others” 248. ] lying between 24° 58' and 25° 42' N. lat., and between 84° 44' and 86° 5' E. long., is bounded on the N. by the river Ganges, which separates it from Sáran, Muzaffarpur, and Darbhangah, on the E. by Monghyr, on the S. by Gayá, and on the W. by the Son, which separates it from Sháhábád. Patna district, with an area (1881) of 2079 square miles, is, throughout the greater part of its extent, a level plain; but towards the south the ground rises into hills. The soil is for the most part alluvial, and the country along the bank of the Ganges is peculiarly fertile. The general line of drainage is from west to east; and high ground along the south of the Ganges forces back the rivers flowing from the district of Gayá. The result is that, during the rains, nearly the whole interior of the district south of a line drawn parallel to the Ganges, and 4 or 5 miles from its bank, is flooded. There are no forests or jungles of any extent, but fine groups of trees are found in many places. In the south-east are the Rájágríhá Hills, consisting of two parallel ridges running south-west, with a narrow valley between, intersected by ravines and passes. These hills, which seldom exceed 1000 feet in height, are rocky and clothed with thick low jungle, and contain some of the earliest memorials of Indian Buddhism. Hot springs are common on the Rájágríhá Hills. The chief rivers are the Ganges and the Son. The total length of the former along the boundary of Patna is 93 miles. The Son first touches the district near Mahíbalípur village, and flows in a northerly direction for 41 miles, till it joins the Ganges. The only other river of any consequence is the Púnpún, which is chiefly remarkable for the number of petty irrigation canals which it supplies. So much of the river is thus diverted that only a small portion of its water ever reaches the Ganges at Fatwá. Great changes have from time to time taken place in the course of the Ganges, and the point at which the Son [9:18:409] joined this river was once several miles east of its present position. Large game is not abundant except on the Rájágríhá Hills, where bears, wolves, and jackals are common, and hyaenas are sometimes seen. Of smaller game, duck, quail, and ortolan are abundant, and partridges and wild geese are also found.

The census of 1881 returned the population at 1,756,856 persons (males 858,783, and females 898,073). Hindus numbered 1,541,061, Mohammedans 213,141, Christians 2588, and “others” 66. Of high-caste Hindus there are 47,041 Brahmans and 64,332 Rájputs. Ranking next to these two castes are the Bábhans, a class who number 121,381 in Patna district, and whose origin is much disputed. They assert themselves to be Sarwariá Brahmans, but, although they are held in high respect, this rank is not generally accorded to them. Among the Súdras the most numerous are the Goálás or Ahírs, the great herdsman class, ofwhom there are 217,845; and the Kurmís, an agricultural caste, who number 194,222. Among the semi-Hinduized aboriginal tribes the Dosádhs, the ordinary labouring class of Behar, number 99,976. The Wahabis form the most interesting section of the Mohammedan community. They are a numerous body, and include several wealthy traders, though the majority belong to the lower classes. The following towns in the district contained a population in 1881 exceeding 10,000—Patna city (170,654); Behar (48,968); Dinápur, including the cantonment (37,893); Bárh (14,689); Khagaul (14,075); Mukáma (13,052); Fatwá (10,919).

Rice, which forms the staple of the district, is divided into two great crops—the kartikd or early rice, sown in June or July and reaped in October or November; and the agháni or winter rice, sown after the commencement of the rains and cut in November or December. The boro or spring rice is also cultivated to a limited extent, being sown in November or December and reaped in April or May. By far the most important of these is the agháni crop, of which forty-six varieties are named. Among the other principal crops are wheat and barley, khesárí, gram, pease, cotton, tobacco, sugar-cane, a little indigo and mustard, several other oil-producing plants, and poppy. All the poppy grown in the province of Behar is manufactured at Patna city.

Patna is subject to blights, floods, and drought, but seldom to such an extent as to seriously interfere with the general harvest. There are abundant facilities for importations of grain in case of distress. The trade of the district centres in Patna city, which, next to Calcutta, is the largest river-mart in Bengal. The total length of district and provincial roads is 454 miles. The East Indian Railway traverses the entire length of the district for 86 miles. Several newspapers are published at Patna, the most important being the Behar Herald, published weekly and conducted by the native pleaders of the Patna bar.

Patna is one of the two places in British India where opium is manufactured. The poppy cultivated is exclusively the white variety (Papaver somniferum album), and the crop requires great attention. The amount of produce from various lands differs considerably. Under favourable circumstances of soil and season, the out-turn per acre may be as high as 41 ìb of standard opium (i.e., containing 70 per cent, of pure opium and 30 per cent, of water), paid for by the Government at the rate of 5s. per lb; but the average is from 21 to 27 ft> per acre. The opium is made up into cakes weighing about 4 ìb, and containing about 3 ìb of standard opium. These cakes are packed in chests (forty in each), and sent to Calcutta for exportation to China. The price which they fetch varies every year; the average rate per chest in 1880-81 was about £135 and the cost £39.

The net revenue of Patna in 1882-83 amounted to £278,550, of which £147,205 was derived from the land-tax. In 1874-75 there were, exclusive of the Patna college, 309 Government and aided schools with 9003 pupils; by 1877-78 the number had risen to 816, and the pupils to 16,396. The Patna college was founded in 1862, and is the only institution for superior instruction in Behar; the total number of pupils in 1881-82 was 166. The climate of Patna is considered remarkably healthy. The average annual rainfall is 35 '66 inches.
