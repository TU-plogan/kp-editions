PETER III., Feodorovich (1728-1762), was son of Anna, daughter of Peter the Great, who had married the duke of Holstein. He was born at Kiel in 1728, his real names being Karl Peter Ulrich; he went to Russia in 1742 on being named heir to the throne. In 1745 he married Sophia Augusta, princess of Anhalt-Zerbst, who, on entering the Greek Church, took the name of Catherine. They lived very unhappily together. In January 1762 the czarina Elizabeth died and Peter succeeded her. He soon became unpopular on account of his fondness for the Prussians and the introduction of German regulations in the army. His wife took advantage of his unpopularity and caused herself to be crowned empress, July 1762. Peter showed great want of energy, and only attempted to stem the insurrection when it was too late. He was removed to Ropsha in the government of St Petersburg, and, after having been forced to sign a renunciation of all rights to the throne, was strangled by Orloff and others. He was first buried in the Alexandro-Nevski monastery, but his remains were removed in 1796 by Paul to the Petropavlovski church.
