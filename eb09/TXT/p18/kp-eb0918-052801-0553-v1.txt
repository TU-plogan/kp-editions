PERGOLESI (or Pergolese), Giovanni Battista (1710-1736), Italian musical composer, was born at Jesi, Ancona, 3d January 1710, and educated at Naples in the Conservatorio dei Poveri di Gesu Cristo, where he studied the violin under Domenico de Matteis, and counterpoint under Gaetano Greco, Durante, and Francesco Feo. While learning all he could from these great teachers he struck out from the very first a style of his own, and brought it prominently forward in his earliest known composition, an oratorio, called La Conversione di S. Guglielmo, performed in the church of S. Agnello in 1731, in which year he also produced his first opera, Sallustia, at the Teatro Fiorentino. After receiving further instruction from Vinci he produced another opera, Recimiro, which failed lamentably. This disappointment led him to devote his chief attention to church music; and his next great works—two masses, one for two and the other for four choirs, with double orchestra—established his reputation as a genius of the highest order, and proved that he was at least as great in his newly-adopted style as in his dramatic pieces. Nevertheless, the greatest success that he was ever destined to attain was reserved for his celebrated intermezzo^[1. A light buffo piece, the acts of which were interpolated, for the sake of relief, between those of a serious opera.] —or, as we should now call it, operetta —La Serνa Padrona. This delightful work, fairly successful on the occasion of its first production in 1731 or 1733, became after Pergolesi’s death a recognized favourite at every theatre of importance in Europe. In 1746 it found its way to Paris, and had a long run at the Théâtre Italien, followed in 1752 by an equally successful one at the Académie. Two years later it was translated into French, and ran for 150 successive nights. As late as 1867 it was revived in this form at the Opéra Comique; and in 1873 it was revived in London at the Royalty Theatre. The libretto by Nelli is unusually bright and sparkling; and so fresh is the music that it still sounds as if composed but yesterday. In this characteristic, indeed, lies the secret of its extraordinary success, for the scale on which it is written is of the smallest imaginable dimensions. The dramatis personae consist of three characters only, one of them being mute, and the orchestra is limited entirely to the stringed band, unrelieved by a single wind instrument. But the fire of genius breathes in every bar, and the whole work has the character of a continuous inspiration.

In 1734 Pergolesi was appointed maestro di cappella at Loreto. Soon after this his health began to fail rapidly, but he worked on incessantly to the end. His last compositions were a cantata for a single voice, Orfeo ed Eurydice ; a lovely Salve Regina, also for a single voice; and his famous Stabat Mater, for two female voices. For this last-named work—the best known of all his sacred compositions—he received in advance ten ducats (£1 15s.), and thought the price enormous. He was barely able to finish it before his death, which took place at Pozzuoli, 16th March 1736.

Pergolesi’s works comprise fourteen operas and intermezzi, nineteen sacred compositions, and many charming pieces of chamber music,—a long list, when one remembers that he died at the age of 26 years and 3 months. The purity of his style has not been ex ceeded by any composer of the Italian school; and in his orchestral effects and other points of little less importance he shows himself immensely in advance of all his predecessors.
