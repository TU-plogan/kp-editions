PALENCIA, capital of the above province, occupies a level site on the left bank of the river Carrion, here crossed by a good stone bridge and by another called Los Puentecillos. Palencia is the junction of the lines from Asturias and Galicia, and is 7 miles from Venta de Banos on the Madrid and Irun Railway. The distances northnorth-east from Valladolid and south-east from Leon are 23 and 82 miles respectively. The height above sea-level is 2362 feet. The town is protected on the west by the river; on the other sides the old machicolated walls, 36 feet high by 9 in thickness, are in fairly good preservation, and beautified by alamedas or promenades which were laid out in 1778. The city is divided into two parts, the ciudad and the puebla, by a winding arcaded street, the Calle Mayor, which traverses it from north to south. The cathedral, which overlooks the Carrion, was begun in 1321 and finished in 1504; it is a large building in the later and somewhat poor Gothic style of Spain. The site was previously occupied by a church erected by Sancho el Mayor over the cave of St Antholin, which is still shown. The church of San Miguel is a good and fairly well-preserved example of 13th-century work; that of San Francisco, of the same date, is inferior, and has suffered more from modernization. The hospital of San Lazaro is said to date in part from the time of the Cid, who was married to Ximena here. The leading industries of Palencia are the woollen and linen manufactories, in which a third of the inhabitants are engaged; flour-milling comes next in importance. The population of the ayuntamiento was 14,505 in 1877.

Palencia, the Pallantia of Strabo and Ptolemy, was the chief town of the Vaccaei. Its history during the Gothic and Moorish periods is obscure; but it was a Castilian town of some importance in the 12th and 13th centuries. The university founded here in 1208 by Alphonso IX. was removed in 1239 to Salamanca.
