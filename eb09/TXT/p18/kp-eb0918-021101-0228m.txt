PÁNIPAT, a decayed historical town in Karnâl district, Punjab, India, situated on the Grand Trunk Road, 53 miles north of Delhi, in 29° 23' N. lat. and 77° Γ 10" E. long. The town is of great antiquity, dating back to the great war of the MahZblιarata between the Pândavas and Kaurava brethren, when it formed one of the tracts demanded by Yudishthira from Duryodharia as the price of peace. In modern times, the plains of Pânipat are celebrated as having thrice formed the scene of decisive battles which sealed the fate of upper India,—in 1526, when Bâbar on his invasion of India with his small but veteran army completely defeated the imperial forces; in 1556, when his grandson, Akbar, on the same battlefield, conquered Hemu, the Hindu general of the Afghan Sher Shâh, thus a second time establishing the Mughal power; and finally, on 7th January 1761, when Ahmad Shâh Durâni decisively shattered the unity of the Mahratta power. The modern town stands near the old bank of the Jumna, upon high ground composed of the debris of earlier buildings. The population in 1881 numbered 25,022, including 16,917 Mohammedans. Although there are many brick-built houses and some well-paved streets in the centre of the town, the outskirts are low and squalid, and the general aspect of the whole town miserable and poverty-stricken.
