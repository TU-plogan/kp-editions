PHORMIUM, or New Zealand Flax (also called “New Zealand hemp”), is a fibre obtained from the leaves of Phormium tenax (ord. Liliaceae). The plant is a native of New Zealand, the Chatham Islands, and Norfolk Island; it is now cultivated as an ornamental garden-plant in Europe, and for economic purposes it has been introduced into the Azores. The leaves grow from 3 to 6 and even 9 feet in height and from 2 to 3 inches in breadth, springing from the extremity of a rhizome. After the tuft of leaves has continued growing for about three years a flowering stalk springs up to the height of about 16 feet, and when it comes to maturity the whole plant dies down. Meantime, however, lateral branches or fans have been given off from the main rhizome, and thus the life of the plant is continued by stem as well as seed. Phormium has been treated as a cultivated plant in New Zealand, though only to a limited extent, and with no promising results; for the supplies of the raw material dependence has been principally placed on the abundance of the wild stocks and on sets planted as hedges and boundaries by the Maoris. Among these people the fibre has always been an article of considerable importance, yielding cloaks, mats, cordage, [9:18:813] fishing-lines, <fcc., its valuable properties having attracted the attention of traders even before colonists settled in the islands. The leaves, for fibre-yielding purposes, come to maturity in about six months, and the habit of the Maoris is to cut them down twice a year, rejecting the outer and leaving the central immature leaves. Phormium is prepared with great care by native methods, only the mature fibres from the under-side of the leaves being taken. These are collected in water, scraped over the edge of a shell to free them from adhering cellular tissue and epidermis, and more than once washed in a running stream, followed by renewed scraping till the desired purity of fibre is attained. This native process is exceedingly wasteful, not more than onefourth of the leaf-fibre being thereby utilized. But up till 1860 it was only native-prepared phormium that was known in the market, and it was on the material so carefully, but wastefully, selected that the reputation of the fibre was built up. The troubles with the Maoris at that period led the colonists to engage in the industry, and the sudden demand for all available fibres caused soon afterwards by the Civil War in America greatly stimulated their endeavours. Machinery was invented for disintegrating the leaves and freeing the fibre, and at the same time experiments were made with the view of obtaining it by waterretting and by means of alkaline solutions and other chemical agencies. But the fibre produced by these rapid and economical means was very inferior in quality to the product of Maori handiwork, mainly because weak and undeveloped strands are, by machine preparation, unavoidably intermixed with the perfect fibres, which alone the Maoris select, and so the uniform quality and strength of the material are destroyed. No means have yet been devised for producing by mechanical or chemical means fibre in the perfect condition it shows when selected and prepared by Maoris. Phormium is a cream-coloured fibre with a fine silky gloss, capable of being spun and woven into many of the heavier textures for which flax is used, either alone or in combination with flax. It is, however, principally a cordage fibre, and in tensile strength it is second only to Manila hemp; but it does not bear well the alternations of wet and dry to which ship-ropes are subject. It is largely used as an adulterant of Manila hemp in rope-making, and recently it has come into use as a suitable material for the bands of self-binding reaping-machines. Between 1864 and 1876 there were exported from New Zealand 26,434 tons of phormium, valued at £592,218; in 1881 the exports were 1307 tons, of the value of £26,285.
