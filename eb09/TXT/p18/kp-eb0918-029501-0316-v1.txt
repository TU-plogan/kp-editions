PARIS, the son of Priam, king of Troy. Before he was born his mother Hecuba dreamed that she was delivered of a firebrand. The dream was interpreted that her child would ruin his country, and when Paris was born he was exposed on Mount Ida. His life was saved by the herdsmen, and he grew up among them, distinguished for beauty and strength, till he was recognized and received by his parents. When the strife arose at the marriage of Peleus and Thetis between Hera, Athena, and Aphrodite, each claiming the apple that should belong to the most beautiful, Paris was selected as the judge. The three rivals unveiled their divine charms before a mortal judge on Mount Ida. The scene afterwards became a favourite subject in Greek art, and it is usual to represent Hermes escorting the goddesses. Each tried to bribe the judge, Hera by promising power, Athena wisdom, Aphrodite the most beautiful woman in the world. Paris decided in favour of Aphrodite, and thus made Hera and Athena the bitter enemies of his country. To gain the woman whom Aphrodite had promised, Paris set sail for Lacedaemon, deserting his old love Oenone, daughter of the river-god Cebren, who in vain tried to induce him to give up his purpose. He was hospitably received by Menelaus, whose kindness he repaid by seducing his wife Helena to flee with him to Troy. The details of the flight are variously related (see Helena). The siege of Troy by the united Greeks followed. Paris proved a lazy and backward fighter, though not wanting in actual courage when he could be roused to exert himself. Before the capture of the city he was mortally wounded by Philoctetes with an arrow. He then bethought him of the slighted nymph Oenone, who he knew could heal the wound. He was carried into her presence, but she refused to save him. Afterwards, when she found he was dead, she committed suicide. Paris is represented in Greek art as a beautiful young man, beardless, wearing the pointed Phrygian cap, and often holding in his hand the apple.
