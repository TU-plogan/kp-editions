PÉLISSIER, Jean Jacques Amable (1794-1864), duke of Malakhoff, marshal of France, was born 6th November 1794 at Maromme (Seine Inférieure), where his father was employed in a powder-magazine. After attending the military college of La Flèche and the special school of St Cyr, he in 1815 entered the army as sub-lieutenant in an artillery regiment. A brilliant examination in 1819 secured his promotion to the staff. He served as aide-decamp in the Spanish campaign of 1823, and in the expedition to the Morea in 1828-29, at the conclusion of which he received the grand cross. In 1830 he took part in an expedition to Algeria, and on his return was promoted to the rank of major. Nine years later he was again sent to Algeria as chief of the staff with the rank of lieutenantcolonel, and remained there in active service till the Crimean war, taking a prominent part in many important operations, and, by gradual promotion, advancing to the rank of general of division. The merciless severity of his conduct in suffocating a whole Arab tribe in a cavern, where they had taken refuge and refused to surrender, awakened in 1846 such a strong feeling of indignation in Europe that Marshal Soult, the French minister of war, expressed in the chambers his regret at its occurrence; but Marshal Bugeaud, the governor-general of Algeria, not only gave it his approval but shortly afterwards secured for Pélissier further promotion. On the declaration of war with Russia Pélissier was sent to the Crimea, where on 16th May 1855 he succeeded Marshal Canrobert as commander-in-chief of the French forces before Sebastopol. After the capture of the fortress he was, on the 12th September, promoted to be marshal. On his return to Paris he was named senator, created duke of Malakhoff (22d July 1856), and rewarded with a grant of 100,000 francs per annum. From March 1858 to May 1859 he acted as French ambassador in London, whence he was recalled to take command of the army of observation on the Rhine. In 1860 he was appointed governor-general of Algeria; and he died there 22d May 1864.
