PENELOPE, the faithful wife of the Greek hero Odysseus (Ulysses), immortalized by Homer in the Odyssey. She was the daughter of the Spartan Icarius and Peribaea. Shortly before Odysseus left his native island of Ithaca to war against Troy, Penelope bore him a son, Telemachus. When her husband tarried long many chieftains of Ithaca and the islands round about wooed her to wife; they behaved wantonly, wasting the substance of Odysseus, insulting his son, and corrupting the maidservants. The heart of Penelope yearned for Odysseus, and, to rid herself of the importunities of the wooers, she bade them wait till she had woven a winding-sheet for old Laertes, the father of Odysseus. But every night she undid the piece which she had woven by day, so that the web was always unfinished. This she did for three years, till her maids revealed the secret to the wooers. Robbed of her pretext for delay she was in sore straits, till she was relieved by the arrival of Odysseus after an absence of twenty years. He slew the wooers, and the long-parted husband and wife were united once more.

Such is the story of Penelope in Homer. Later writers add other particulars about her. She was won by Odysseus in a race proposed by Icarius to his daughter’s suitors. When Icarius would fiιin that Odysseus should bide with him in Sparta, or at least leave him his daughter, and Odysseus let Penelope choose whether she would go with him to Ithaca or stay with her father in Sparta, she silently drew her veil over her face. Her father understood her and let her go (Pausan., iii. 12, 20). Some said that she bore a son, Ptoliporthes, to Odysseus after his return from Troy. Others (marring Homer’s picture of her as a true and loving wife) said that in her husband’s absence she bore Pan to Hermes or the suitors. Another story was that on his return Odysseus repu<liated her as [9:18:491] unfaithful, that she went to Sparta and thence to Mantinea, where she died and where her tomb was shown (Pausan., viii. 12). According to others, after the death of Odysseus she married Telegonus (son of Odysseus and Circe) in Aeaea, or in the Islands of the Blest. The name is connected with πηvos, πhvη, “woof,” and hence means “weaver.” The Homeric form is Penelopeia.
