PERIANDER was born about 665 b.c. and succeeded his father Cypselus as despot of Corinth in 625 b.c. His rule appears to have been at first mild and beneficent, but evil advice or domestic calamity converted him into a cruel tyrant. There runs a well-known story that he sent to ask the advice of Thrasybulus, tyrant of Miletus, who, instead of replying, walked with the messenger through a cornfield and struck off as he walked the tallest and fairest of the ears. Periander took the hint, and proceeded to exterminate the most eminent of his subjects.^[1. In Aristotle’s version of the story the rôles of Periander and Thrasybulus are reversed. ] Whatever the cause, there seems no reason to doubt that the latter part of the despot’s life was darkened by crime. Goaded by the slanders of concubines, he murdered his beloved wife Melissa, daughter of Procles, tyrant of Epidaurus, and then, in a fit of remorse, burned the slanderers alive.^[2. The relations of Periander to his dead wife form the subject of a curious tale. It is said that he got a necromancer to call up the spirit of Melissa (as Saul called up Samuel), in order to question her about a hidden treasure, just as people in Wurtemberg used to call up ghosts in churchyards for a similar purpose. But the ghost refused to answer. “For,” said she, “I am cold; 1 cannot wear the garments laid in my grave, because they have not been burned.” So Periander called together all the women of Corinth in their best attire as for a festival, stripped them, and burned their garments on the grave of his wife, that her ghost might not go naked. Similar to this is the story in Lucian of the ghost of a dead wife appearing to her husband and begging him to find and burn one of her golden sandals which had fallen underneath the chest and so had not been burned with the other. ] The murder of his wife alienated from the tyrant the affection of his favourite son Lycophron, whom, failing to move either by rigour or blandishments, he banished to Corcyra, then a dependency of Corinth. At last, enfeebled by age, Periander offered to resign the tyranny to his son and to retire himself to Corcyra; but the prospect alarmed the Corcyreans, and they put Lycophron to death. The tyrant took his revenge by sending three hundred of the noblest Corcyrean youths to Alyattes, king of Lydia, to be made eunuchs of; they were rescued, however, by the Samians. Periander did not long survive his son; he fell into a deep despondency, and died either of grief or by violence voluntarily incurred in 585 b.c., at the age of eighty.

The accounts of Periander’s character are at first sight discrepant. One writer (Heraclides) describes him as just and moderate, an enemy of vice and luxury, which he severely repressed. But more commonly he appears as cruel and oppressive. He surrounded himself with a body-guard, and, according to Aristotle, reduced tyranny to a system by putting down eminent and aspiring citizens, impoverishing the rich, maintaining spies, and sowing distrust between classes and individuals. His costly offerings to the gods drained the resources, while his public works and constant wars taxed the energies and distracted the attention of the citizens. The privilege of settling in Corinth was placed by him under certain restrictions. On the other hand, he not only patronized literature in the person of the poet Arion but was himself the author of a collection of moral maxims in 2000 verses. His reputation for wisdom stood so high that he was commonly reckoned amongst the seven wise men, though some, as Plato, denied his claim. Amongst the wars to which he owed his military fame were successful expeditions against Epidaurus and Corcyra. He built a fleet and scoured the seas on both sides of the isthmus, through which it is said that he meditated cutting a canal. To him were due the Greek colonies of Apollonia, Anactorium, and Leucas. On the whole, Periander would appear to have been one of those brilliant despots whose personal vices have not destroyed their literary and artistic sense, and who by their abilities have raised the states which they governed to a high pitch of outward prosperity and power. Certain it is that with the close of his dynasty, which happened a few years after his death, when his successor Psammetichus perished in a popular rising, the golden age of Corinthian history came to an end.

There was another Periander, tyrant of Ambracia, said to have been a relative of the tyrant of Corinth. He was deposed by the people, probably not long after the death of the latter.

The chief authorities for the life of Periander are Herodotus (iii. 48-53; V. 92), Aristotle (PoZ., v. 11, 12), Heraclides Ponticus (v.), Nicol. Damasc. (59, 60), Diog. Laert. (i. 7). The letter’s in Diogenes ascribed to Periander are no doubt spurious.
