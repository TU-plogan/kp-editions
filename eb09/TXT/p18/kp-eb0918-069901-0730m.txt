PETER II., Alexeievich (1715-1730), son of Alexis and grandson of Peter the Great, was born at St Petersburg in 1715, and ascended the throne in 1727. He was under the guardianship of Menshikoff, to whose daughter Mary he was betrothed. The faction of the Menshikoffs was overthrown, however, by the Dolgorukis, to a daughter of whose house the czar was now to be married. All these political plans were rudely broken by the death of Peter in January 1730. During his short reign this youth showed reactionary tendencies, and it seemed as if the capital of Russia was again to be transferred to Moscow. The young czar was buried in the cathedral of the Archangel in that city.
