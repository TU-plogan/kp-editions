PETROPAVLOVSK, a district town of western Siberia, in the government of Akmolinsk, is situated on the right bank of the Ishim river, 185 miles to the west of Omsk.

The old fort occupies a hill about 100 feet high, which slopes abruptly to the Ishim, while the wooden houses and the broad, unpaved, but regular streets of the town occupy partly the declivities of the hill and partly the (sometimes inundated) banks of the river. The fertile steppes to the east, west, and south of the town largely supply it with corn and cattle, and at the same time give great facilities for trade with the Kirghiz, with Turkestan, and with Bokhara. Its exports passing through the custom-house are estimated at an annual value of about £200,000, the chief items being cottons (upwards of £100,000), woollen stuffs, corn, metals, metallic wares, and spirits. The value of the cattle imports exceeds £150,000 annually, and the aggregate value of the skins, cotton goods, furs, tea, and wool imported reaches the same figure. The town has several tallow-melting houses, tanneries, and glue and soap works; and its industries are steadily increasing. The population (7850 in 1865) now exceeds 11,500.

The small fort of Petropavlovsk, consisting of an earthen palisaded wall, was founded in 1752, and was the military centre of the Ishim line of fortifications. It became at once a place of trade with the Kirghiz, and in 1771 had a population of 914 inhabitants. It received municipal institutions in 1807.

Petropavlovsk is also the name of a Russian seaport in Kamchatka, on the eastern shore of the Bay of Avatcha in 53° N. lat. and 158° 44' E. long. Its beautiful harbour, one of the best on the Pacific, is but little frequented, and the town consists merely of a few huts with some 500 inhabitants. Its naval institutions were transferred to Nikolaievsk after the attack of the allies in 1854.
