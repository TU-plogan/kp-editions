PARNY, Év Ariste Désire de Forges, Vicomte de (1753-1814), was born in the Isle of Bourbon on 6th February 1753. He was sent to France at nine years old, was educated at Rennes, and in 1771 entered the army. He was, however, shortly recalled to Bourbon, where he fell in love with a young lady whom he celebrated poetically as Éléonore. His earlier biographers state her to have been called Esther de Baif, while the later give her the name of Mdlle. Troussaille. His suit was not favoured by the lady’s family. He returned to France, published his Poesies Ërotiques in 1778, was saluted by Voltaire on his last visit to Paris as “Mon cher Tibulle,” and acquired at once a reputation for graceful and natural verse-writing which, though he lived many years and produced much inferior work, never entirely left him. He had some fortune, and he established himself near Paris. The Revolution impaired his means, but did not otherwise trouble him; indeed he obtained an appointment under it. In 1796 (he had published much else, but nothing of importance), appeared the Guerre des Dieux, a poem in the style of Voltaire’s Pucelle, directed against Christianity, and containing some wit, but much more that is simply dull and indecent. It commended itself to the times, however, and the author is said to have afterwards amplified it into a Christianrde, the manuscript of which the Government of Louis XVIII., according to the story, bought for thirty thousand francs and destroyed. Parny devoted himself in his later years almost entirely to the religious or anti-religious and political burlesque. Under the consulate and the empire he turned his wrath from Christianity to England, and produced in 1805 an extraordinary allegoric poem attacking George III., his family, and his subjects, under the eccentric title of “Goddam! Goddam! par un French-dog.” The body of the poem is quite worthy of its title. Another and longer poem called Les Rose-Croix, though less extravagant, is still less readable; and indeed all Parny’s later work is valueless except [9:18:319] as a curiosity. His early love poems or elegies, however, and some slight miscellaneous work of his more mature years, show, with something of the artificiality of the time, a remarkable grace and ease, a good deal of tenderness, and not inconsiderable fancy and wit. One famous piece, the Elegy on a Young Girl, is scarcely to be excelled in its kind. In the natural comparison of Parny with his younger English contemporary, Moore, whom he in many ways resembles, the palm must be given to the French poet for precision and enduring elegance of style at his best, though he has less melody and tenderness, and though he condescended to much work far inferior both morally and artistically to the worst of Moore’s.

There is no complete edition of Parny’s works, and the loss is small. There are several good selections containing almost everything of real value, among which may be mentioned that of Garnier Freres.
