+=====================================================================+


PEACOCK, Thomas Love (1785-1866), novelist and poet, was born at Weymouth, 18th October 1785. His father, a glass merchant in London, died soon after his son’s birth, and young Peacock received his education at a private school at Englefield Green, where he distinguished himself by unusual precocity. After a brief experience of business he elected to devote himself to study and the pursuit of literature, living with his mother on their private means. His first books were poetical, The Monks of St Mark (1804), Palmyra (1806), The Genius of the Thames (1810), The Philosophy of Melancholy (1812),— works of no great merit. He also made several dramatic attempts, which did not find their way to the stage. He served for a short time as secretary to Sir Home Popham at Flushing, and paid several visits to Wales. In 1812 he became acquainted with Shelley, who made him his executor together with Lord Byron. In 1815 he evinced his peculiar power by writing Headlong Hall, the prototype of all his subsequent novels. It was published in 1816, and Melincourt followed in the ensuing year. During 1817 he lived at Great Marlow, enjoying the almost daily society of Shelley, and writing Nightmare Abbey and Rhododaphne, by far the best of his long poems. In 1819 he received the appointment of assistant examiner at the India House, at the same time as Mill and Strachey. Peacock’s nomination appears to have been due to the influence of his old schoolfellow Peter Auber, secretary to the East India Company, and the papers he prepared as tests of his ability were returned to him with the high encomium, “Nothing superfluous and nothing wanting.” This was characteristic of the whole of his intellectual work; and equally characteristic of the man was his marriage about this time to a Welsh lady, to whom he proposed by letter, not having seen her for eight years. His official duties greatly interfered with independent composition. Maid Marian nevertheless appeared in 1822, The Misfortunes of Elphin in 1829, and Crotchet Castle in 1831; and he would probably have written more but for the death in 1833 of his mother, to whom he was deeply attached. He also contributed to the Westminster Review and the Examiner. His services to the East India Company, outside the usual official routine, were considerable. He defended it successfully against the attacks of Mr J. S. Buckingham and the Liverpool salt interest, and made the subject of steam navigation to India peculiarly his own. He represented the company before the various parliamentary committees on this question; and in 1839 and 1840 superintended the construction of iron steamers, [9:18:445] which not only made the voyage round the Cape successfully, but proved very useful in the Chinese war. He also framed instructions for the Euphrates expedition, pronounced by General Chesney to be models of sagacity. In 1836 he succeeded Mill as chief examiner, and in 1856 he retired upon a pension. During his later years he contributed several papers to Fraser's Magazine, including reminiscences of Shelley. He also wrote in the same magazine his last novel, Gryll Grange (1860), inferior to his earlier writings in humour and vigour, but still a surprising effort for a man of his age. He died 23d January 1866 at Lower Halliford, near Chertsey, where, so far as his London occupations would allow him, he had resided for more than forty years.

Peacock’s position in English literature is unique. There was nothing like his type of novel· before his time; though there might have been if it had occurred to Swift to invent a story as a vehicle for the dialogue of his Polite Conversation. But, while Swift’s interlocutors represent ordinary types, Peacock’s are highly exceptional; while the humour of the former consists in their stereotyped conventionality or unconscious folly, the talk in Peacock’s novels is brilliant; and, while Swift’s characters utter proverbs, Peacock’s are equipped from the author’s own stores of humorous observation or reflexion. He speaks as well in his own person as through his puppets; and perhaps no writer since Pope has enriched English literature with such an abundance of quotable things. This pithy wit and sense, combined with remarkable grace and accuracy of natural description, atone for the primitive simplicity of plot and character. There is just enough of both to keep the story going, and the author’s plan required no more. Of his seven fictions, Nightmare Abbey and Crotchet Castle are perhaps on the whole the best, the former displaying the most vis comica of situation, the latter the fullest maturity of intellectual power, and the most skilful grouping of the motley crowd of “perfectibilians, deteriorationists, statu-quo-ites, phrenologists, transcendentalists, political economists, theorists in all sciences, projectors in all arts, morbid visionaries, romantic enthusiasts, lovers of music, lovers of the picturesque, and lovers of good dinners,” who constitute the dramatis personae of that comedy in narrative, the Pea-cockian novel. Maid Marian and The Misfortunes of Elphin are hardly less entertaining, but are somewhat cramped by the absence of portraiture from the life and the necessity for historical colouring. Both contain descriptive passages of extraordinary beauty. Melincourt is a comparative failure, the excellent idea of an orangoutang mimicking humanity being insufficient as the sole groundwork of a novel. Headlong Hall, though more than foreshadowing the author’s subsequent excellence, is marred by a certain bookish awkwardness characteristic of the recluse student, which reappears in Gryll Grange as the pedantry of an old-fashioned scholar, whose likes and dislikes have become inveterate and whose sceptical liberalism, always rather inspired by hatred of cant than enthusiasm for progress, has petrified into only too earnest conservatism. Pianos and perspective equally with competitive examinations and “panto-pragmatism” are the objects of the writer’s distaste, and for the first time in his career we feel inclined to laugh at him, being no longer able to laugh with him. The book’s quaint resolute paganism, however, is very refreshing in an age eaten up with introspection; it is the kindliest of Peacock’s writings, and contains the most beautiful of his poems, “Years Ago,” the reminiscence of an early attachment. In general the ballads and songs interspersed through his tales are models of exact and melodious diction, and instinct with true feeling. His more ambitious poems are worth little, except Rhododaphne, attractive as a story and perfect as a composition, but destitute of genuine poetical inspiration. His critical and miscellaneous writings are always interesting, especially the restorations of lost classical plays in the Horae Drαmαticae, but the only one of great mark is the witty and crushing exposure in the Westminster Review of Moore’s ignorance of the manners and belief he has ventured to portray in his Epicurean. Peacock resented the misrepresentation of his favourite sect, the good and ill of whose tenets were fairly represented in his own person. Somewhat sluggish and self-indulgent, incapable of enthusiasm or self-sacrifice, he yet possessed a deep undemonstrative kindliness of nature; he could not bear to see any one near him unhappy or uncomfortable; and his sympathy, no less than his genial humour, gained him the attachment of children, dependants, and friends. His feelings were steady rather than acute; he retained throughout life with touching fidelity the memory of an early affection. In official life he was upright and conscientious; his judgment was shrewd and robust, and the quaint crotchets and prejudices which contrasted so curiously with his usual sagacity were in general the exaggeration of .sound ideas held with undue exclusiveness. As a candidate for literary immortality he should be safe. The same causes which restrict his popularity ensure his permanence. His novels depend but slightly on temporary phases of manners, but are vitally associated with standard literature, and with general tendencies innate in the human mind. Neither his intellectual liberalism nor his constitutional conservatism will ever be out of date; and what Shelley justly termed “the lightness, strength, and chastity” of his diction secures him an honourable rank among those English writers whose claims to remembrance depend not only upon matter but upon style.

Peacock’s works were collected, though not completely, and published in three volumes in 1875, at the expense of his friend and former protégé, Sir Henry Cole, with an excellent memoir by his grand-daughter Mrs Clarke, and a critical essay by Lord Houghton. Other criticisms have been written, by Mr Spedding in the Bdin-bιιrgh Review and by James Hannay in the North British Review. For an interesting personal notice, see A Poet’s Sketch Book, by R. W. Buchanan, 1884. (R. G.)
