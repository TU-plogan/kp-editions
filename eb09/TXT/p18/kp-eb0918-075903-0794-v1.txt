PHILLIPS, William (1775-1828), an able mineralogist and geologist, who did much to foster in Britain the study of the sciences to which he was devoted, was born in May 1775. His Outline of Mineralogy and Geology was published in 1815 and passed through several editions. His Introduction to the Knowledge of Mineralogy, published in 1816, was for upwards of forty years one of the standard text-books in that science. Successive editions of it were brought out under different editors after his death. It was specially distinguished by its elaborate crystallographic details, based upon measurements with Wollaston’s reflecting goniometer. But it is chiefly the services rendered by Phillips to the science of geology, then in its infancy, that entitle his name to grateful recollection.. In addition to the first work above-named, he published in 1818 a most useful digest of English geology, under the title of A Selection of Facts, from the best Authorities, arranged so as to form an Outline of the Geology of England and Wales. This little volume contained a geological map of the country, based on that of W. Smith and some horizontal sections. Its importance in geological literature is to be found mainly in the fact that it formed the foundation of the larger work undertaken by Phillips in conjunction with W. Conybeare, of which only the first part was published, entitled Outlines of the Geology of England and Wales; and comparative Views of the Structure of Foreign Countries (1822). This volume made an era in geology. As a model of careful original observation, of judicious compilation, of succinct description, and of luminous arrangement it has been of the utmost service in the development of geology in Britain. Phillips was a member of the Society of Friends. He was a Fellow of the Royal, Geological, and other learned societies. He died in 1828.
