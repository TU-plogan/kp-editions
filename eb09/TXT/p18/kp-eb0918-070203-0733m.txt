PETERSBURG, a city and port of entry of the United States, in Dinwiddie county, Virginia, lies 23 miles south of Richmond on the south side of the Appomattox river, which is navigable for large vessels from the James river up to the falls opposite the city, and for flat boats 107 miles above the falls to Farmville. Petersburg is an important railway junction, manufactures tobacco, cotton goods, and iron wares, and carries on a very extensive shipping trade in the export of tobacco, cotton, flour, and peanuts (groundnuts). Its public buildings comprise a court-house, a custom-house, and post-office, two markets, and a theatre; there are two public libraries and a public park (Poplar Lawn). The population was 14,010 in 1850, 18,266 in 1860, 18,950 (10,185 coloured) in 1870, and 21,656 in 1880.

Petersburg was laid out at the same time with Richmond (1733) by Colonel William Byrd, on the site of an Indian village destroyed in 1676. It was first incorporated in 1748. During the Revolutionary War it was twice the headquarters of the British under General William Phillips, who died while in possession of the town in 1781. The bravery of the Petersburg volunteers on the Canadian frontier in 1812 procured it the title of Cockade City of the south. The terrible siege of Petersburg, lasting from June 1864 to 3d April 1865, was the final scene of the Civil War.
