PELOPS, a hero of Greek mythology, was the grandson of Zeus, son of Tantalus and Dione, and brother of Niobe. His father’s home was on Mount Sipylus in Asia Minor, whence Pelops is spoken of as a Lydian or a Phrygian, or even as a Paphlagonian. Tantalus was a friend and companion of the gods, and one day he served up to them his own son boiled and cut in pieces. The gods detected the crime, and none of them would partake except Demeter (according to others Thetis), who, distracted by the loss of her daughter Persephone, ate of the shoulder. The gods restored Pelops to life, and the shoulder consumed by Demeter was replaced by one of ivory. Wherefore the descendants of Pelops had a white mark on their shoulder ever after. This tale is perhaps a reminiscence of human sacrifice, of which numerous traces remain in Greek legend and history. Poseidon admired Pelops, the beautiful boy, and carried him off to Olympus, where he dwelt with the gods, till, for his father’s sins, he was cast out from heaven. Then, taking much wealth with him, he crossed over from Asia to Greece. He went to Pisa in Elis as suitor of Hippodamia, daughter of King Oenomaus, who had already vanquished in the chariotrace and slain many suitors for his daughter’s hand. But by the help of Poseidon, who lent him winged steeds, or of Oenomaus’s charioteer Myrtilus, whom he or Hippodamia bribed, Pelops was victorious in the race, wedded Hippodamia, and became king of Pisa. Pelops’s race for his wife was a favourite subject of Greek poetry and art. It may be a confused recollection of the custom of wife-snatching prevalent in early times. When Myrtilus claimed his promised reward, Pelops flung him into the sea near Geraestus in Eubaea, and from his dying curse sprang those crimes and sorrows of the house of Pelops which supplied the Greek tragedians with such fruitful themes. Among the sons of Pelops by Hippodamia were Atreus, Thyestes, and Chrysippus. According to others Chrysippus was his son by a different mother. Atreus and Thyestes were jealous of Chrysippus and murdered him, wherefore Pelops drove them out. According to another story it was Hippodamia who murdered him and fled, but afterwards her bones were brought back to Olympia, where she had a temple, in which the women offered her a yearly sacrifice. From Pisa Pelops extended his sway over the neighbouring Olympia, where he celebrated the Olympian games with a splendour unknown before. He warred against and treacherously slew Stymphalus, king of Arcadia. His power and fame were so great that henceforward the whole peninsula was known to the ancients as Peloponnesus (Isle of Pelops). In after times Pelops was honoured at Olympia above all other heroes; a temple was built for him by Heracles, his descendant in the fourth generation, in which the annual magistrates sacrificed to him a black ram. During the Trojan war the Greeks were told that Troy could not be taken until they fetched a bone of Pelops. So a shoulder-blade of Pelops was brought from Pisa. When it was being brought back again the ship carrying it was wrecked off Eubaea. Many years afterwards the bone was taken up by Damarmenus, a fisherman, in his net. Astonished at its size, he went to inquire of the Delphic oracle. There he met envoys from Elis come to discover a remedy for a pestilence. The oracle bade them recover the bone of Pelops, and commanded Damarmenus to restore it to them. He did so, and he and his descendants were appointed custodians of the bone. Some thought that the Palladium was made of the bones of Pelops. This belief in the miraculous efficacy of the bones of heroes was common in Greece (witness, e.y., the story of the bones of Orestes in Herodotus). From the great size of the bones they may sometimes have been those of large extinct animals.

From the reference to Asia in the tales of Tantalus, Niobe, and Pelops it has been conjectured with some probability that Asia was the original seat of these legends, and that it was only after emigration to Greece that the people amongst whom they were current localized a part of the tale of Pelops in their new home. In the time of Pausanias the throne of Pelops was still shown on the top of Mount Sipylus. The story of Pelops is told in the beautiful first Olympian ode of Pindar. The prosaic version of the story found in Nicolaus Damascenus (17) differs in several points from the usual legend.
