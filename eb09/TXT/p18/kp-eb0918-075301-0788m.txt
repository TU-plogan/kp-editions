PHILIPPOPOLIS, Filippopel, and (Turkish) Felibe, a city of Thracia, previous to 1878 the chief town of a sanjak in the Turkish vilayet of Adrianople, and now the capital of the independent province of Eastern Roumelia and the chief town of one of the six departments, lies 112 miles west-north-west of Adrianople by rail and thus 309 miles from Constantinople, mainly on the right bank of the Maritza (the ancient Hebrus). The railway runs farther up the river to Sarambey and Simcina, but has no direct connexion with the other railway systems of Europe. Highways, however, from Bulgaria, Servia, and Macedonia meet at Philippopolis, which, besides being the centre of an extensive trade, carries on considerable manufactures of silk, cotton, and leather. The city is built partly on a striking group of granite eminences (whence the old Roman name, Trimontium) and partly on the low grounds along the river, which in the outskirts are occupied by rice-fields. On the left side of the river and connected with the city by a long bridge is the suburb of Karshiaka. The population, estimated at 24,000 to 28,000, consists of Bulgarians, and, in smaller proportions, of Greeks, Turks, Armenians, Jews, and Gipsies. A Greek archbishop has his see in the city, and among the public buildings are a number of Greek churches and a Greek lyceum (1868).

Eumolpia, a Thracian town, was captured by Philip of Macedon and made one of his frontier posts; and, though the soldiers seem to have given it the title of “Poneropolis,” or City of Hardships, and it was not long afterwards recovered by the Thracians, the name of Philip’s City has stuck to it ever since. Under the Romans Philippopolis or Trimontium became the capital of Thracia; and, even after· its destruction by the Goths, when 100,000 persons are said to have been slain, it continued to be a flourishing city till it was again laid in ruins by Joannes Romaioctonus, the Bulgarian king. It passed under Turkish rule in 1360; in 1818 it was [9:18:754] destroyed by an eartlιquake; and in 1846 it suffered from a severe conflagration. During the war of 1877-78 the city was occupied by the Russians.
