PAN, a Greek god worshipped chiefly in Arcadia, among whose mountains he had numerous sanctuaries and holy caves. While he is a very common figure in poetry and art, it is exceedingly difficult to gain any clear idea of his actual worship in his Arcadian home. He appears to have been worshipped on the mountain tops as well as in caves; he was the herdsman’s god, and the giver of fertility to flocks; he was a god of prophetic inspiration and of dreams, in which he sometimes revealed the cure of diseases; he was himself a huntsman and the god of hunters, and Arcadian sportsmen beat his image if they returned empty-handed from the chase; even fishermen invoked him for aid in their occupation; he guided travellers (as ∈voδιos and ττο/ΛτταΪος) on the pathless mountains, and even smoothed the rough sea by the sound of his flute; he was the god of music, of dance, and of song, Echo and Syrinx were the objects of his love, and he sported and danced with the mountain Nymphs. The nineteenth Homeric Hymn gives a most poetic account of his birth from the union of Hermes and the daughter of Dryops, and of his life among the Arcadian mountains and springs. His power of inspiration and prophecy shows that there was an orgiastic, enthusiastic side of his worship, which made it easy for Pindar to connect him with the worship of Cybele, and for others to identify him with Marsyas. His voice inspires terror, and he produced sudden panics among men. The Athenian herald Phidippides heard his voice by the way promising victory at Marathon; the Athenians attributed their triumph to his aid, and to the panic he inspired among the Persians, and consecrated to him a cave in the north side of the Acropolis. He had a temple and oracle near Acacesium, in which a fire burned continually. The analogy of his nature with Dionysus led to his assimilation with the Satyrs, and he is [9:18:208] often pictured among the Bacchic Thiasus. It was only a step further to speak of many Pans, male and female, and of infant Panisci. In the mystic eclecticism of Orphic religion, Pan was conceived as· the universal god in a pantheistic fashion. His mother is variously called Oenoe, or Callisto, or Penelope; his father is Zeus, or Hermes, or Apollo, or Odysseus, or the suitors generally. He was represented as a half-human half-brute figure, with the legs and horns of a goat and a face whose features resembled those of an animal. According to the Homeric Hymn, his mother was terrified when he was born with his hideous figure and long goat’s beard. The story, alluded to by Milton, Mrs Browning, and the modern poets, of the pilot Thamus, who, sailing near Paxos in the time of Tiberius, was commanded by a mighty voice to proclaim that “Pan is dead,“is first found in Plutarch (De Orae. Defectu, 699).
