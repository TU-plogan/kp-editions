PP is the sixteenth letter of our alphabet. In the original Phoenician form (see Alphabet) it was not unlike a crook. In Greece it became angular (∏), and later the downward strokes were made equal in length (∏), though in the old Corinthian the rounded form still occurs, closely resembling the Phoenician type. In old Latin the angular form is found, as in Greece, but also the form with which we are familiar, with the bottom of the curve joined to the straight line. The old guess that P was at first a rude sketch of a mouth must be abandoned unless we are prepared to credit the Phoenicians with having so far anticipated Mr Melville Bell’s “visible speech.”

The sound it denotes is a closed labial, differing from b as a surd from a sonant; it is heard only when the lips open; there is then a percussion as the breath escapes, which constitutes the sound. The difference between breath and voice can be easily seen in the production of the two sounds, 79 and b. When the lips are closed—as they must be closed (exactly in the same way) for each of the sounds—if we then try to articulate p, no effort can produce any kind of sound till the lips open; the chordae vocales do not vibrate, and there is therefore nothing in the mouth but mere breath. But if we make as though we would sound b, while still keeping the lips shut, a certain dull sound is quite audible, produced by the vocalized breath (or voice) within the mouth; and the action of the top of the larynx in producing this sound may be distinctly felt. Of course this sound is not a b ; that does not come till the lips part.

It is noteworthy how very small is the number of pure English words which begin with 72. Such words correspond to words which began with b in Greek, Latin, and other members of the parent Aryan speech; and these are equally few. Nearly all the words which we have in English beginning with p are therefore borrowed, such as “pain,” “pair,” “police,” which came to us from France; others are scientific terms, oftenest modelled upon the Greek. The reason of this deficiency of words in the parent language commencing with b is not easy to find.

The Latins denoted the sound of Greek <∕> by the double symbol ph·, this is a p followed by a slight breathing, not so strong as an h; thus “philosophia” was pronounced not as we now pronounce it, but rather like “p’hilosop’hia.” But this sound eventually passed into the∕-sound, and it is so written in Italian (e.g., “filosofia ”); French and English have kept the bld spelling, but not the sound. So here, as elsewhere, we have quite unnecessarily two symbols, ph and ∕, expressing the same sound.
