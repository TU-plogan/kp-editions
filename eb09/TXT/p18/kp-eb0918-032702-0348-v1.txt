PARSONS, or Persons, Robert (1546-1610), a celebrated Jesuit, was the son of a blacksmith, and was born at Nether Stowey, near Bridgwater, England, in 1546. His precocity attracted the attention of the vicar of the parish, who gave him private instruction, and procured his entrance in 1563 as an exhibitioner to Balliol College, Oxford. He graduated B.A. in 1568, and M.A. in 1572. He was fellow, bursar, and dean of his college, but in 1574 he resigned his fellowship and offices, for reasons which have been disputed, some alleging improprieties of conduct, and others suspected disloyalty. Soon after his resignation he went to London, and thence in June to Louvain, where he spent some time in the company of Father William Good, a Jesuit. He then proceeded to Padua to carry out a previously conceived intention to study medicine, but further intercourse with English Jesuits so influenced his mind, that in July 1575 he entered the Jesuit Society at Rome. In 1580 he was selected along with Campian, a former associate at Oxford, and others, to undertake a secret mission to England against Elizabeth. Through the vigilance of Burghley the plot was discovered and Campian arrested, but Parsons made his escape to Rouen, and occupied himself for some time in the composition of treasonable tracts against Elizabeth, which he caused to be secretly sent to England. In 1583 he returned to Rome, where he was appointed prefect of the English mission, and in 1586 chosen rector of the English seminary. He also devoted much energy to the establishment of seminaries elsewhere on the Continent, for the training of priests to be despatched to England to aid in reviving the cause of Romanism. After the disaster to the Spanish Armada in 1588, he endeavoured to persuade the Spanish monarch to undertake a second invasion, and, unsuccessful in this, he incited various plots against Elizabeth, all of which were, however, abortive. On the death of Cardinal Allen in 1594 he made strenuous efforts to be appointed his successor, and, failing in this, he retired to Naples until [9:18:328] the death of Clement VIII. in 1606. From this time he continued his active intrigues against Protestantism in England until his death, 18th April 1610.

Parsons was the author of a large number of polemical tracts, a list of which, to the number of thirty-three, is given in Chalmers’s Biographical Dictionary. For portrait, see Gentleman's Magazine, vol. lxiv.
