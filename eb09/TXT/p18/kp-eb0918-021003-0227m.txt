PANCSOVA, a town of Hungary, near the Servian frontier, is situated on the river Ternes, just above its junction with the Danube, which it reaches 9 miles above Belgrade. The town contains Roman Catholic, Protestant, and Greek churches, a convent, and manufactories of starch and beetroot sugar. Cotton and mulberries (for feeding silkworms) are cultivated, and a brisk trade in live stock and grain is carried on with Turkey. The hog fairs are largely attended. In 1880 Pancsova contained 17,127 inhabitants, partly Serbs and partly Germans. It was burned by the retreating Austrians in 1788, and was again occupied by Austrian troops in 1849, after they had defeated the Hungarians in the vicinity.
