PERSIA PERSIA, or Írán. In modern political geography these two terms are synonymous; the kingdom which we call Persia the Persians themselves call írán. But each of the words has a somewhat complicated history, a brief sketch of which will best explain the connexion between the several subjects which, in an encyclopaedic treatment, naturally demand notice under one or other of the names which head this article.

Persia, or rather Persis (Greek exclusively ∏∈pcrts), is the Latinized form of a name which originally and strictly designated only the country bounded on the N. by Media and on the N.W. by Susiana, which of old had its capital at Persepolis or Istakhr, and for almost twelve centuries since has had it at Shíráz. This country and its people were anciently called Pársa (now Párs or Fárs). The oldest certain use of the name is in Ezekiel (xxvii. 10, xxxviii. 5). The Greek form ∏∈pσαt, with e for ã, which all European languages follow, seems to have come from the Ionians, who disliked to pronounce a even in foreign words. Thus ∏∈ρσ^αι would stand for ∏τ)pσαt, which in turn stands to Pársa as Mi∕δoι to Máda.

The name of Persian was naturally extended to the great monarchy of the Achaemenians who came forth from Persis; and so again, when a second great empire, that of the Sásánians, arose from the same land, all its subjects began to be called Persians, and Persis or Persia was sometimes used of the whole Sásánian lands (Ammianus, xxiii. 6, 1). The prevalent language of this empire (see Pahlavi) had a still better right to be called Persian, for it seems to have had its basis in the language of the old Persis. The same thing is true of the so-called New Persian, which has been a literary language for the last thousand years.

Historically, then, the term Persian is fitly applied to the two great empires which rose in Párs or Persis—the form Persis will be used in this restricted sense throughout the present article—and not unfitly to the modern state which embraces Persis and its sister lands, and in which a descendant of the ancient tongue of Persis is still the official and literary language.

The name írán, on the other hand, was originally of much wider signification than Persia, and the whole upland country from Kurdistán to Afghánistán may, in accordance with the native use of its ancient inhabitants, be called the Iranian upland. The inhabitants of this upland, together with certain tribes of the same race in adjacent lands, shared with their near kinsmen in India the name of Aryans (Ariya, Airya of the Avestα ; Sk. Arya). King Darius calls himself “Persian son of a Persian, Aryan son of an Aryan,” and Herodotus (vii. 62) knows *Apιoι as an old name of the Medes. The ancient nobles affected names compounded with Arya,—Ariyarámna (^Αριαράμνης), Ariobarzanes, and the like. The lands of the Aryans, as a whole, were called Ariyána (Airiyana of the Avesta); Eratosthenes and after him Strabo and others are certainly wrong in limiting , Apιaνη, Αριaνoι, to eastern írán (Afghanistán, Baluchistán, &C.).^[1. Less careful writers, like Pliny, confuse Ariana with Aria, properly Haría, the land of Haraiva, the lateι - Ilarév, Hare, Hari; Arabic Herát.]

Ardashír, the first Sásánian, is called on coins and inscriptions “king of the kings of Érán,” his son Shápúr or Sapor is “king of the kings of Érán and not-Érán.” Now Ardashír, as well as his son, had non-Aryan subjects, the main population of Babylonia and other provinces being of Semitic race; Érán and not-Érán therefore must here be used not ethnographically but in a definite politico-geographical sense. The official name of the empire, however, was always Érán, and the great officers of state had such titles as Érán-Spáhpat, “general of Érán,” Érán-Anbárakpat, “store-master of Érán.”^[2. Sásánian inscriptions in Chaldaic Pahlavi still show the ancient form Arián (}KΗK), and Greek inscriptions of the older kings have the genitive pl. Αpιai'ωi'. But the corresponding common Pahlavi inscriptions and the coins already show the form Érán (]KΙ'K), following an established law of phonetic decay.]

For the last 500 years most Persians have pronounced írán instead of Érán (more recently also írón, írún), and this is the official title of the kingdom which once had Ispahán, and now has Teherán, as capital. Modern írán, or Persia, does not embrace nearly the whole Iranian upland, still less all men of Iranian nationality, that is, all who speak an Iranian dialect akin to Persian. On the other hand, the modern kingdom of írán has many subjects who are not Iranians ethnographically, but come originally from Central Asia or Arabia, and speak Turkish or Arabic.

PART I.—ANCIENT IRAN.

Section I.— Medo-Persian Empire.

. The Babylonian Berosus, writing soon after Alexander the Great, states that at a very early time, which we must place somewhat over two thousand years before Christ, the Medes conquered Babylonia, and that eight Median kings reigned thereafter in Babylonia for a space of 224 years.^[3. The information is preserved by Eusebius, who took it from Alexander Polyhistor; see Eusebius, Chronicon, ed. Schoene, 25.] This is an early instance of the occupation of the rich lowlands by warlike tribes of the neighbouring highlands; and indeed the contrast between the plain of the Euphrates and Tigris, peopled mainly by Semites, and the tableland of the Iranians, surrounded by lofty mountains, is a very important factor in the whole history of wide regions of Asia. But it is, to say the least, not certain whether Berosus means the Iranian people afterwards called Medes. The expression might have a merely geographical signification, and it is at all events possible that at that distant period tribes of different descent dwelt in the land. In any case, we have here no Iranian empire, but only a Babylonian dynasty founded by foreigners.

Be this as it may, it is certain that at an early period there were regular monarchies of some size even in the distant Iranian lands. Unmistakable traces lead us to assume an old empire in Bactria—the Iranian land far to the east, in the region of the Oxus, beyond the great tableland—which must have developed a tolerably high civilization. But we have no exact information about it.

The series of the great Iranian monarchies begins for us with the Median empire of Ecbatana. Unfortunately we possess but little trustworthy information about its history, being almost wholly dependent on what two Greeks, Herodotus and Ctesias, who wrote long after the fall of the kingdom, report from the mouths of Orientals. These two authorities differ so widely that their statements are to a great extent mutually exclusive. Nevertheless careful investigation has shown that many of the statements of Ctesias (which are only preserved through the medium of later writers, like Diodorus) rest on the same basis as those of Herodotus. This common basis included an artificially arranged chronology.^[4. See Hupfeld, Exercitationes Herodoteae Spec. II.: sire de retere Medorum, τeano, Rinteln, 1843.] According to Herodotus[9:18:562] the Medes freed themselves from the Assyrians, and lived for a time without a master till Deioces obtained the kingly power by stratagem. There reigned then
[table]

The totals show how the figures are arranged on an artificial system. The duration of the kingdom is exactly a century and a half, divided into two exactly equal portions, each of which is occupied by the reigns of two kings. But further, according to Herodotus, the rule of the Medes over Upper Asia, i.e., the land east of the Halys, lasted 128 years, save only (τrαpe^) the twenty-eight years during which the Scythians ruled. It is easy to see that “save only’’means “minus,” and that thus the foreign supremacy of the Medes is reckoned at exactly 100 years, or two-thirds of the total duration of the kingdom. Obviously such figures can at most be only approximately correct. Now the number 128 is got by adding the reigns of the first king and the last two. This number is certainly due to an error on the part of Herodotus, who has committed similar mistakes.in arithmetic elsewhere; in adding up he took the reign of Deioces for that of Phraortes. We may conjecture that the original statement received by Herodotus was that the supremacy, represented by the last three reigns, lasted a century, a round number being put for 97 (22 + 40 + 35). With regard to the individual items, it is somewhat suspicious that the second half (75 years) is divided into its two most convenient fractions, 40 and 35. Consequently we cannot place much reliance on the figures representing the reigns of the first two rulers either, especially as it can be made probable that they also rest on an artificial basis.

Now it can be proved that Ctesias’s list of nine or properly ten kings was based on that of Herodotus, but with all the numbers doubled. Probably this list of Ctesias assigned 350 years as the total duration of the empire, which is the number given in Justin, i. 6, 17. The Mede from whom Ctesias derived his information, or the Median source on which his informant drew (there is no mistaking the Median colouring which pervades Ctesias’s narrative), wished to glorify the empire of his people by the length of its duration, hence the doubling. The source from which the names of the Median kings in Ctesias are derived is still a mystery; they are quite different from those of Herodotus. Even Oppert’s hypothesis, that the names of the last four kings in Ctesias are the Iranian translation of the non-Iranian names in Herodotus and belong to the language of the second kind of cuneiform writing, though perhaps plausible at first sight, is on close examination untenable. In general there is no warrant for the assumption that as late as the time of the Median and Persian empires there was a large non-Iranian population in Media,—an assumption which conflicts with all tradition and originates solely in the difficulty of finding a home for the second kind of cuneiform writing. But the names of the kings in Herodotus are now all authenticated, directly or indirectly, by the inscriptions lately discovered. Probably too the reckoning of the total duration of the empire at a century and a half is about right. Indeed such chronological systems sometimes correspond better, on the whole, with the facts than their artificiality would lead us to expect.

Ctesias’s narrative opens with a highly-coloured description of a real event, namely, the destruction of Nineveh by the leader of the Medes, called by him Arbaces, with the helpof the Babylonian Belesys(the historical Nabopolassar). But the fact that by this event the position of Media as a great power was for the first time assured is mixed up by Ctesias with the beginning of the monarchy itself. In addition, he grossly exaggerates the duration of the empire; so that we arrive at the monstrous result that between 606 or 607, the real date of the destruction of Nineveh, and 550, the year of the fall of the Median supremacy, more than 300 years are supposed to have elapsed.

Down to the destruction of Nineveh we must ignore Ctesias almost completely and follow Herodotus alone.

We will not repeat Herodotus’s naive story of the foundation of the Median kingdom by Deioces, son of Phraortes, a story in which Greek and Oriental colours are charmingly blended. We may assume as certain that Deioces possessed a principality, the central point of which was Ecbatana (or Agbatana; Old Persian Hagmatana, now Hamadán), a place which for thousands of years has held the rank of a capital. This principality probably never embraced the whole of Media (i,e., nearly the present provinces of Irák Adjemi and Azerbíján with a portion of Turkish Kurdistán), but by his successors it was enlarged into the great Median empire. Of course there was no smooth and formal constitution, no fixed frontier, no exact determination of the prerogatives of different chiefs in the particular districts. From of old the Assyrians had made frequent attempts to subjugate the country of the Medes, but perhaps never quite possessed the whole land with its numerous inaccessible mountains and warlike robber tribes. Nevertheless they made successful expeditions into the interior of Media even down to the time at which Herodotus regards Media as independent.^[5. For this and what follows compare, besides the works of the Assyriologists, A. V. Gutschmid, Neue Beitrüge zur Geschichte des alten Orients, 87 sq.] Neither the liberation of Media nor the foundation of the monarchy is an event which can be limited to a particular year, the thing took place gradually. In the period not long before Deioces, according to Herodotus’s reckoning, very many tributary Median chieftains are mentioned in the Assyrian inscriptions; this confirms, in some measure at least, the statement that “anarchy” then prevailed.^[6. That parts at least of Media were subject to Assyria at that period is further shown by 2 Kings xvii. 6, xviii. 11—surer evidence than that of the inscriptions, which may not always be rightly interpreted, and contain, besides, many exaggerations.] In 715 b.c. there was carried off as prisoner one Dajaukku; this is certainly the same name, perhaps the same person (for his captivity may have been brief), as Dãiokës, which appears in Herodotus in the Ionic form Dëiokês. We can certainly identify Herodotus’s first king with the prince whose land, called Bit Dajaukku, i.e., land of Dajaukku, King Sargon of Assyria conquered in 713 B.c. The man who thus gave his name to the land must have occupied a high station. The date is not very remote from that assigned by Herodotus to Deioces; for we get from Herodotus as the date of Deioces 709-656, or, if we correct his error in dating the end of the empire, 700-647. Deioces was notaking of kings; he was forced to bow to the Assyrians repeatedly, but he was the founder of the empire. Three kings followed him. It is possible that there were really more, and that in the summary list the shorter reigns are passed over. Nor can we place much reliance on Herodotus’s assertion that each successive ruler was the son of his predecessor.

In perfect harmony with the conditions of development of a small state into a great power is the statement of Herodotus that the second king of the Medes, Phraortes {Frawarti ∖ according to Herodotus’s reckoning 656-634 [647-625]), extended his sway beyond the limits of Media and first of all subjugated Persis, or Persia proper, the secluded mountain-land south-east of Media. During all this time indeed, as we learn from Darius’s great inscription, Persis had kings of its own; but these were simply vassals of the sultan [9:18:563] who had his seat in Ecbatana. After conquering the Persian, Phraortes, says Herodotus, subjugated piece after piece of Asia, until he was discomfited and slain in the attempt to conquer the Assyrians in Nineveh, whose empire was by that time completely lost. Allowing for some exaggerations with respect to the extent of the empire, there is nothing in these statements that need excite suspicion. Independent evidence seems to show that towards the middle of the 7th century the Assyrian empire had fallen very low;^[7. The Assyrian inscriptions break off abruptly with the year 644; Gutschmid, op. eit., 89.] and that the inhabitants of the cluster of vast cities to which Nineveh belonged were able to repel the first attack of an enemy who could hardly have been their match in the art of siege-warfare is perfectly natural. Besides, the stability of the Median military, political, and court institutions, which were afterwards taken over unaltered by the Persians, must surely have required for its development a longer time than some modern inquirers, following exclusively the cuneiform inscriptions, have assumed for the actual duration of the Median empire.

Phraortes’s successor Cyaxares (Huwakhshatara; according to Herodotus’s reckoning 634-594 [625-585]) brought the empire to the highest pitch of power. He is said to have introduced fixed tactical arrangements into the army. It was to him that the pretenders whom Darius had to overcome traced their descent, as he tells us himself. Cyaxares, according to Herodotus, took the field successfully against Nineveh, but as he was besieging the city the inroad of the “Scythians” compelled him to forego for a time all the fruits of victory. Who these Scythians were is unknown. Herodotus took them for the people tolerably familiar to the Greeks, whose true name was Scolotae; but his evidence does not go for much, since he often falls into the popular misuse of the term “Scythian” as a name for all the peoples of the steppes, and brings the inroad of these Scythians into a most unlikely connexion with the desolating raids of Thracian tribes (the Trares or Treres, commonly called Cimmerians) in Asia Minor. We must content ourselves with assuming that we have here one of those irruptions of northern barbarians into Iran of which we hear so often in later times. Probably these nomads came, as Herodotus indicates, through the natural gate between the Caucasus and the Caspian Sea, the pass of Derbend, though it is quite possible that they came from the east of the Caspian, from the steppes of Turkestán. Whether these Scythians are really the same people who made their way as far as Palestine and Egypt^[8. Herod., i. 105; compare Trogus, in Justin, ii. 3, and Jordanes, De orig. Get., 6, whose account perhaps goes back to Dinon.] is, indeed, far from being as certain as is commonly supposed, nor can the date of the irruption into these countries be determined. At any rate, the barbarians overthrew the Medes and flooded the whole empire. From what we know of the doings of Huns, Khazars, Turks, and Mongols in later times we can infer how these Scythians behaved in Iran. Cyaxares must have come to some sort of terms with them; and at last he rid himself of them in a truly Eastern fashion, by inviting most of them— i.e., of their chiefs—to a feast, where he made them drunk and slew them at their wine.^[9. Between the years 1030 and 1040 A.D. we know three cases λvhere princes of Iranian lands despatched inconvenient Turkomans in exactly similar fashion see Ibn Athír, ix. 266 sq., 272.] It is not in the least surprising that Cyaxares afterwards had Scythians in his service; savages like these have no steady national feeling, and serve any potentate for pay.

With the Scythian disorders we might combine the contests which, according to Ctesias, the Parthians and Sacae (i.e., the inhabitants of the Turkoman desert, who are also called “Scythians” by the Greeks) waged with

Cyaxares or Astibaras, as Ctesias calls him.^[10. See Diod., ii. 34; Nicol. Dam., 6; Anonymus de mulieribus.] But it is not safe to do so, as the whole narrative is only the framework for a pretty romance.

Cyaxares marched a second time against Nineveh and destroyed it about 607. Not only Ctesias but also Berosus^[11. See Euseb., Chronicon, pp. 30, 35, 37, and Syncellus, 210 B. The first passage refers to Abydenus, who made use of Berosus. He names the Median king ’hστυaγηs, which Gutschmid regards as a corruption of ’ Aστυαpτ∕s = ’ λστιβaρηs. This is acute, but it seems better to suppose that Abydenus or an excerptor confused Cyaxares with the last king of the Medes.] asserts that the king of the Medes achieved this great success in league with the king of Babylon. That the Median tradition represented the Mede and the Babylonian tradition the Babylonian as suzerain, and the other king as a vassal, is not surprising. The more powerful of the two was doubtless the Median, the richer the Babylonian. Unfortunately Herodotus’s work does not include the “Assyrian memoirs,” in which he intended to give a fuller account of the fall of Nineveh,—probably because he died before completing the task. In order to protect himself against his ally, -who by the fall of the Assyrian empire had grown too powerful, the Chaldaean king had recourse to a double precaution; he married his son, afterwards the potent Nebuchadnezzar, to Amyite or Amyitis, daughter of the Median king; but he also erected extensive fortifications. After the fall of Nineveh, Nebuchadnezzar* made himself master of Syria and Palestine, and Cyaxares acquired most of the rest of the Assyrian territory. Probably Assyria proper belonged to him also, and we can thus explain Xenophon’s error that the Assyrian cities before their destruction belonged to the Medes (Anab., iii. 4, Ι-ΙΟ). When Cyaxares afterwards began the war with the Lydians he was already master of Armenia and Cappadocia, though he probably did not acquire them until after he had got rid of the Scythians and destroyed Nineveh. The pretext for the war was afforded by the flight of some Scythians in Cyaxares’s service to Alyattes,^[12. He reigned, according to Herodotus’s reckoning, from 618 to 561. As this is narrated by Herodotus in his history of Lydia, he probably has it from Lydian sources, and Ave may regard this as a welcome confirmation of what we are told on Median authority about the destruction of the Scythians.] king of Lydia; but the real cause was doubtless thirst of conquest. The war lasted for five years with varying fortune, and was ended by the battle during which the eclipse of the sun, said to have been predicted by Thales, took place. The terrified combatants saλv in this a divine warning and hastily concluded peace. An impression so profound could be produced by nothing short of a total eclipse. Now, according to Airy’s calculation, of all the eclipses of that period the only one which was total in the east of Asia Minor (where we must necessarily look for the seat of Avar) was that of 28th May 585. Ancient writers^[13. Pliny, H. N., ii. § 53, and other passages; compare Gelzer, in Rhein. Museum für Philologie., N. F., xxx. 264 sq. An astronomer, a friend of the writer of this article, has by independent calculations confirmed the dates assigned in the text for both eclipses.] also place the eclipse in this year. But this only proves that learned Greeks of a much later age calculated the year of an eclipse which they took to be that of Thales; yet in this case they have hit the truth. More exact calculations have shown that the eclipse of 30th September 610, formerly regarded as that mentioned by Herodotus, was total only to the north of the Black Sea. Besides, it is inconceivable that this Avar and the neAv grouping of states which it involved should have taken place before the destruction of Nineveh. The 28th of May 585 is perhaps the oldest date of a great event which can be fixed with perfect certainty dθAvn to the day of the month. The conclusion of peace which followed affords us a remarkable instance of diplomatic mediation in [9:18:564] very ancient times. The peace was brought about by Syennesis, prince of Cilicia, and Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon.^[14. For the latter Herodotus wrongly substitutes lus successor Labynetus (Nabunaid; Persian Nαbunαitα).] Astyages, son of Cyaxares, married Aryenis, daughter of Alyattes. But according to Herodotus’s calculation the above date does not fall within the time of Cyaxares; and even with the necessary correction (of nine years · see below) Astyages ascended the throne in this same year. We might suppose that the battle fell in the father’s, the peace in the son’s time. But, as we saw above, the dates of these reigns are not of a sort in which we can place much confidence, and it is more likely that the reign of Astyages did not last so long as tradition asserts. Thus Cyaxares probably died after 585.

Of the reign of his son Astyages (in Ctesias Astyigas, in a Babylonian inscription Ishtuvigu) we have no particulars. It is not even certain that he was cruel, for Herodotus’s account of him and of the revolt of Cyrus is not impartial, based as it is on the narratives of the descendants of Harpagus, who had an interest in portraying in unfavourable colours the prince whom their ancestor had betrayed. On the other hand, Ctesias’s Median authority (Nicolaus Dam., 64 s⅛.), which sets Astyages in a very favourable light, has no better claim to credence on this point.

The Median empire must at this dime have reached a tolerably high degree of civilization. As remarked above, the polit ical and military institutions of the Persians are substantially those of the Medes; even the dress (of the Persian troops) was borrowed from the Medes.^[15. Herod., vii. 62.] Of buildings erected by the Median kings there are, so far as we know, no remains. The colossal lion, still to be seen, though in a sadly mutilated state, at Hamadán, and about which Arabian writers have all sorts of wonderful tales, is perhaps a monument of the Median age. The fortifications of Ecbatana must certainly have been magnificent; according to Herodotus’s description, they showed strong traces of the influence of the star-worship practised by the neighbouring Babylonians, whose civilization was of a much earlier date.^[16. See Sir H. Rawlinson, in G. Rawlinson’s Herodotus, i. 98, and Joh. Brandis, in Hermes, ii. 264.] It may be that careful explorations in the neighbourhood of Hamadán or excavations will one day bring to light traces of that distant age, perhaps even some distinct inscriptions of Median kings. Such inscriptions would be of the highest value; and we might almost conjecture that the language and writing would be identical with those of the Persian kings. Since the Magi are expressly described by Herodotus as a Median tribe, and since in the age of the Achaemenians the Persian priests were drawn as exclusively from the Magi as in later times, it is highly probable that the Median kings established the Zoroastrian religion as the state religion, and appointed this Median tribe to be the priests. The religion itself arose in the far east, probably in Bactria. It is often assumed nowadays to have originated in Media, but the fact that its sacred books know nothing of the Magi tells particularly against this view. How firmly the Median Magi were in possession of the priesthood in Persia proper (Persis) about the year 522 we learn from the circumstance that they maintained their position in spite of the catastrophe of the false Smerdis. They must therefore have already held it for some time, and this carries us back almost necessarily to the influence of the Median empire. If this is correct, the Median empire has an extraordinary importance in the history of religions. The consideration enjoyed by the Median monarchy is proved by the fact that in Western lands which never came in contact with it at all its name was so familiar that more than a hundred years after its fall the Persians were still mostly called Medes by the Greeks; in particular the wars of independence with the Persians still went at a much later date simply by the name τ<χ Μηδικά. ^[17. It is noteworthy, however, that Aeschylus in the Persae says “Persians” almost exclusively, but “Medes” only exceptionally (ver. 236, 791, and so in his epitaph); perhaps the poet chose “Persians” as the less usual expression.]

Nor was the Median empire properly destroyed by Cyrus; it was only transformed. Another race of the Iranian people and another dynasty stood at the head of the Iranian empire and carried out, as far as it was at all possible, Cyaxares’s scheme for the conquest of Asia and the border-lands. That the Persian empire was the direct heir of the Median was known both to the Greeks—for only on this supposition were the above-mentioned expressions possible—and to the Hebrews (Isa. xiii. 17; Ezra i. 3, &c.).

We possess three accounts of the mode in which the transition was effected, that of Herodotus, that of Ctesias, (of which that of Dinon, preserved only in some fragments and vestiges, is merely a variation), and that of Xenophon in the Cyropaedia. Though Xenophon had before him the works of both Herodotus and Ctesias, we must, with Niebuhr,^[18. Lectures on Ancient History, i. 96, Eng. tr.] regard his book as nothing more than an extremely silly romance; the attempts to employ it as an independent historical source have always failed. Herodotus probably got his charming narrative directly or indirectly from the descendants of Harpagus, a man who undoubtedly played a chief part in transferring the supremacy from the Medes to the Persians. Ctesias’s narrative, which we are obliged to piece together from Nicolaus Damascenus, Photius, Justin, Polyaenus, and Diodorus, is highly coloured, but in parts very pretty, and has, in contradistinction to Xenophon’s romance, a genuinely Oriental stamp. It appears to be based on the account of a Mede, who gave a marked preference to his own people, and represented the founder of the Persian empire in as unfavourable a light as it was possible for a Persian subject (and probably an official) to do. There was no denying the fact of Cyrus’s final victory, but in Ctesias’s narrative he achieves his greatest successes by cunning and deceit. He is a genuine herdsman’s son, takes early to robbery, and discharges menial services, in the course of which, significantly enough, he gets plenty of hard knocks. His accomplice Oebares is a cowardly rascal. Astyages defeats Cyrus in Persis itself and pursues him to his home, Pasargadae; he is only saved by the intervention of the women. On the other hand, Astyages magnanimously spares Cyrus’s father, who had fallen into his power. It is particularly significant that over the corpse of Astyages, who had been left by stratagem to pine in the wilderness, a royal guard of lions kept watch and ward. Of course all this does not exclude the supposition that this partisan narrative is founded on a genuine Persian legend. For the rest, the narrative of Ctesias agrees in some particulars, and even in some names, with that of Herodotus.

That Cyrus (hum, nominative Kurush, or rather Kúm, Kúrush ^[19. The u is long, as is shown by the agreement of K0pos, Aeschyl., Pers., 768, and ti∏l□ of the Old Testament. The long u makes it impossible to identify the name with the Indian Kuru, as Spiegel proposes.]) was not of lowly descent but of a princely house was long ago seen to be a necessary supposition. Popular legend loves the elevation of sons of the people to the throne, but as a matter of fact national kingdoms are not easily founded anywhere, and least of all amongst primitive peoples, except by persons of distinguished birth. A knowledge of the Persian inscriptions has put it beyond a doubt [9:18:565] that Cyrus was of royal blood. A cylinder with an inscription of his, found lately at Babylon,^[20. Trans, of the Roy. √ts. Soc., N. S., xii. 70 sq. (Sir H. Rawlinson).] affords us fuller information. Cyrus’s father was, just as Herodotus tells us, Cambyses {Kambυjiya), his grandfather Cyrus, his great-grandfather Sispis (i.e., the Persian Chaispi i Greek Teispes). We can combine the contents of this cylinder, on the one hand with the list of Darius’s ancestors in Herodotus (vii. 11), and on the other hand with Darius’s own statements in the great Behistún inscription. The last list is shorter by three than that of Herodotus; but, as Darius says that eight of his family were kings, and that they reigned in two lines, while neither he nor his successors in their inscriptions give the title of king to his immediate predecessor, we must assume that the Behistún list of ancestors is somewhat curtailed; and we can with some probability draw out the complete list in exact harmony with Herodotus.^[21. See Büdinger, Die neuentdeckten Inschriften über Cyrus, p. 7 (Vienna, 1881). The pedigree is almost certain, though possibly it may be incomplete and may not contain all “kings.”] We shall indicate the kings by figures and give the names in the ordinary Greek form.
[table]

Achaemenes (Persian Hαkhdmanf), ancestor of the whole family, is perhaps not an historical personage, but a heros eponymus. According to our calculation Teispes, the first king, flourished about the year 730, therefore somewhat earlier than the foundation of the Median empire, but somewhere about the time which Herodotus assigns for the beginning of the independence of Media. Perhaps the rise of the provincial dynasty is connected with the weakening of the Assyrian power in Iran. Now on the cylinder Cyrus calls himself and his forefathers up to Teispes not kings of Persia but kings “of the city Anshan.” Similarly on a lately-discovered monument of still greater importance, a Babylonian tablet,^[22. Transactions of the Soc. of Bible Arch., vii. 139 sq. (Pinches).] he is called “king of Anshan,” but also “king of Persia.” Anshan has been looked for, without sufficient grounds, in the direction of Susiana. Even if it be true that Anshan, written as here in two ways, elsewhere means Susiana—and this Oppert emphatically denies—we should still have to regard this only as a Babylonian inexactitude of expression. It is far more likely that Anshan was a place in Persis, the proper family seat of the Achaemenians, therefore perhaps near Pasargadae or identical with it. An attempt has even been made, in consequence of this designation, to deny that Cyrus was a Persian at all, although Darius calls himself an Aryan and a Persian, and therefore regarded Cyrus and Cambyses as such; indeed he expressly designates them members of his family. It may be that the Achaemenians ruled in a part only of Persis; but we have just as good a right to assume that, as Herodotus and Ctesias assert, Cyrus’s father at least was governor of the λvhole province. His mother, according to Herodotus, was the daughter of Astyages. This may very well be historical, though the confirmation by the oracle which describes him as a “mule” (Herod., i. 55) does not go for much, since these oracles are tolerably recent forgeries, and it is conceivable that we have here nothing more than an example of the well-known tendency of lords of new empires in the East to claim descent, at least in the female line, from the legitimate dynasty. Ctesias indeed tells us that Cyrus afterwards married a daughter of the dethroned Astyigas, Amytis (which was also the name of Astyages’s sister, wife of Nebuchadnezzar). Of course this does not absolutely exclude the possibility of Cyrus being the son of another daughter of the king.

Stripped of its romantic features, Herodotus’s narrative of the rise of Cyrus is in fundamental harmony with the new document which we possess on the subject, in the shape of annals inscribed on a Babylonian tablet. According to Herodotus, Cyrus and the Persians revolted; Harpagus the Mede, who was in league -with him, was despatched against him. A part of the Median army fought, but another part went over to Cyrus or fled. In a second battle Astyages was defeated and taken prisoner. Now the tablet tells us among other things: “and against Cyrus king of Anshan, . . . went and . . . Ishtuvigu, his army revolted against him and in hands took, to Cyrus they gave him.” Thereupon, it proceeds, Cyrus took Ecbatana and carried off rich booty to Anshan. This summary account of the Babylonian annalist by no means excludes the supposition that Cyuιs had fought a previous battle against Astyages. Both accounts say that the treachery and faithlessness of the army procured Cyrus the victory. We might even harmonize the Babylonian document with Ctesias’s narrative that Cyrus was at first hard pressed and driven back as far as Pasargadae, if there were not other grounds, quite apart from its fabulous embellishments, which render this account improbable.

The date of the overthrow of Astyages and the taking of Ecbatana is, according to the Babylonian tablet, the sixth year; and, as it is in the highest degree probable that the years in this memorial are those of the Babylonian king Nabunaid, we must place these events in the year 550. Hitherto it has been supposed, following Herodotus, that the reign of Cyrus (559-530) was to be reckoned from the fall of the Median empire, and that accordingly the latter event was to be placed in 559. But now we see that Cyrus numbered his years from the time when he ascended the throne in Persia. Whether the revolt against Astyages began when he ascended the throne, we do not know. We may very well believe Herodotus (i. 130), that Cyrus treated Astyages well down to his death. On this point Ctesias agrees with Herodotus.

After the taking of Ecbatana, which made Cyrus the great king, he must have had enough to do to subdue the lands which had belonged to the Median empire. Little reliance can be placed on Ctesias’s account of these struggles. Herodotus (i. 153) states that the Bactrians, who according to Ctesias were soon subdued, were, like the Sacae, not subjugated until after the conquest of Babylon.

The next war was against the powerful and wealthy king Craesus of Lydia, who ruled over nearly the whole western half of Asia Minor. It was a continuation of the war between the Medes and Lydians which had been broken off in 585. Here again the story in Herodotus is embellished with many marvellous incidents, and is employed to exemplify moral doctrines. If Craesus really began the war, he assuredly did so not frivolously but deliberately, in order to anticipate the inevitable attack. A fierce struggle seems to have taken place in Cappadocia (Herod., i. 76, and especially Polyaenus, vii. 8, 1 sqj), which already belonged to Cyrus. Craesus retreated to prepare for another campaign, but Cyrus followed hard after him, routed him [9:18:566] when he offered battle, and captured his capital Sardis after a short siege. Not only Herodotus but also apparently his contemporary Xanthus the Lydian, quite independently of Herodotus, told how Cyrus would have burned Craesus alive.^[23. See Nicolaus Dam., 67 (apparently put together from Herodotus and Xanthus).] The statements of Ctesias and Xenophon to the same effect are borrowed from Herodotus. But there is also a vase of the time of Pericles representing Craesus seated on a pyre and majestically pouring out a libation.^[24. Mon. de l'Insk Arch., i. 54.] We may not of course infer from this that Craesus offered himself as a willing sacrifice; but it certainly shows that a hundred years later there was a. general belief that Craesus had stood upon the pyre. And it is by no means inconceivable that Cyrus, whom we must picture to ourselves, not as the chivalrous and sentimental hero of Xenophon, but as a savage conqueror, should have destined such a punishment for a vanquished foe, against whom he may personally have been especially embittered. No doubt to pollute the fire with a corpse was even in those days an impiety in the eyes of the Persians, but who knows whether Cyrus in his wrath paid much more heed to such religious maxims than did his son Cambyses 1 However, Croesus was pardoned, after all, perhaps because some external circumstance interposed (because a sudden shower prevented the fire from burning ?), or because the conqueror changed his mind before it was too late. The pious and believing saw in the event a direct intervention of Apollo on behalf of the man who had honoured the Delphic shrine so highly.^[25. Craesus’s good repute amongst the Greeks of the mainland (see Pindar, Pgth., i. 184 [94]) was due to his liberality to the Delphians. Even 400 years afterwards the Delphians appealed to their old friendship with the people of Sardis (i.e., with Craesus). Bulletin de corresp. hellénique, v. 383, 389 sq. That Craesus could also be inhuman enough is shown by Herod., i. 92.]

The date of Croesus’s fall is not quite certain. It may have been 547 or 546. When Cyrus had marched away, the Lydian Pactyas, whom Cyrus had appointed guardian of the treasures, raised a revolt, but it was speedily put down by the king’s generals. From that time forwards the Lydians never made the slightest attempt to shake off the Persian rule.

But now began that struggle of the Persians with the Greeks which has had so much importance for the history of the world. The Lydian kings had subdued a number of Greek cities in Asia Minor; but even these latter shrank from submitting to the still barbarous Persians, whose rule was far more oppressive, inasmuch as they ruthlessly required military service. But Harpagus and other Persian leaders quickly took one Greek town after the other; some, like Priene, were razed to the ground. Some of the Ionians, such as the Teians, and most of the Phocaeans, avoided slavery by emigrating. Miletus alone, the most flourishing of all these cities, had early come to an understanding with Cyrus, and the latter pledged himself to lay no heavier burden on it than Craesus had before him. In most of the cities the Persians seem to have set up tyrants, who gave them a better guarantee of obedience than democratic or aristocratic governments. In other respects they left the Greeks alone, just as they left their other subjects alone, not meddling with their internal affairs so long as they paid the necessary contributions, and supplied men and ships for their wars. Most of the other peoples in the west of Asia Minor submitted without much resistance, except the freedom-loving Lycians. Driven into Xanthus, the capital, they perished in a body rather than surrender.^[26. About 500 years later the inhabitants of Xanthus followed their example in the straggle with that champion of freedom, Brutus.] Some Carian cities also defended themselves stoutly. This may have given a Persian here and there an inkling even then that the little peoples on the western sea were, after all, harder to manage than the nations of slaves in the interior of Asia. Sardis became and remained the mainstay of the Persian rule in western Asia Minor. The governorship was one of the most influential posts in the empire, and the governor seems to have exercised a certain supremacy over some neighbouring governorships.

Though Cyrus had made, and continued to make, conquests in the interior of Asia, he was still without the true capital of Asia, Babylon, the seat of primeval civilization, together with the rich country in which it lay, and the wide districts of Mesopotamia,^[27. We always use “Mesopotamia” in the sense in which alone this geographical conception ought to be used, viz., as equivalent to the Arabic Jazíra, i.e., to denote the cultivated land between the middle Euphrates and the Tigris, which is separated by the Mesopotamian desert from the totally different 'Irak (Babylonia).] Syria, and the borderlands over which it ruled. Now that we know the two Babylonian memorials mentioned above we can dispense with most of the various, often very fabulous, accounts which Greek writers give of the conquest of Babylon; but when these documents are rightly understood the divergence between them and the account of Berosus^[28. In Josephus, c. Ap., i. 20. On many particular points in these memorials the Assyriologists themselves hold different opinions; but the part which concerns us most seems to be free from doubt.] is, on the main points, not very great. Before the capture of the city, in the summer of 539, a great battle took place, in consequence of which Cyrus occupied the capital without any further serious fighting, since the Babylonian troops had mutinied against their king. Late in the autumn of 539^[29. On 3d Marheshwán, which month corresponds nearly to our November. The year which begins with 5th January 538 is, in the astronomical canon, the first year of Cyrus as king of Babylon. If, as the strict rule requires, we make the small remainder of the year after the taking of the city to be the first year of Cyrus’s reign, then the events in the text fall in 538. But probably the remainder of the year was not reckoned in, and for this there are analogies. (See below.)] Cyrus marched into Babylon, Nabunaid, the king, having previously surrendered himself. According to Berosus, Cyrus appointed Nabunaid governor of Carmania, east of Persis^[30. This statement is further supported by that of Abydenus, doubtless taken from Berosus, that Darius drove Nabunaid out of Carmania (Euseb., Chron., p. 41). This is certainly not an invention. At the most, the former king of Babylon might have been confounded with another Babylonian prince.]; but in the annals inscribed on the tablet it is said to be recorded that Nabunaid died when the city was taken. If both memorials represent Cyrus as a pious worshipper of the Babylonian gods, if, according to the cylinder, the Babylonian god Merodakh, wroth with the king of Babylon because he had hot served him aright, actually himself led and guided Cyrus, such a piece of priestly diplomacy ought not to impose on any student of history. The priests turned to the rising sun, whether they had been on good or bad terms with Nabunaid. Cyrus certainly did not put down the Babylonian worship, as the Hebrew prophets expected; he must even have been impressed by the magnificence of the service in the richest city of the world, and by the vast antiquity of the rites. But he was no more an adherent of the Babylonian religion, because the priests said he was, than Cambyses and the Roman emperors were worshippers of the Egyptian gods, because Egyptian monuments represent them as doing reverence to the gods exactly in the style of Egyptian kings. Sayce doubts whether Cyrus could read their documents; we doubt whether Cyrus understood their language at all, and regard it as inconceivable that he learned their complicated writing; indeed, on the strength of all analogies, we may regard it as scarcely probable that he could read and write at all.^[31. Even the comparatively simple Persian cuneiform writing was certainly always the secret of a few; otherwise it could not have happened that, e.g. , the Behistún inscriptions of Darius should have been described to Ctesias as those of Semiramis (Diod., ii. 13).] The countries subject to [9:18:567] Babylon seem to have submitted without resistance to the Persians. The fortress of Gaza alone, in the land of the Philistines, perhaps defended itself for a time.^[32. According to the conjecture of Vaiesius in Polyb., xvi. 40, τhv Hepσωv, which, though not absolutely certain, is still the best emendation of the passage.] On the other hand, the Phoenician cities, some of which offered a sturdy resistance to other conquerors, submitted immediately, and remained steadily obedient to the Persians down almost to the end of the empire. It seems, however, that, as the real prop of the naval power of Persia, they were almost always treated with special consideration by the latter. In the very first year of his reign in Babylon^[33. This statement goes to show that the small remainder of the year after the taking of Babylon was not reckoned in Cyrus’s first year. For he had at that time something more important to do than to trouble himself straightway about the Israelites.] (538) Cyrus gave the Jewish exiles in Babylon leave to return home (2 Chron. xxxvi. 22 sq. =Ezra i. 1 sqf). Comparatively few availed themselves of this permission, but these few formed the starting-point of a development which has been of infinite importance for the history of the world.

How far to the east Cyrus extended his dominion we do not know, but it is probable that all the countries to the east which are mentioned in the older inscriptions of Darius as in subjection or rebellion were already subject in the time of Cyrus. In this case Chorasmia (Khárezm; the modern Khiva) and Sogdiana (Samarkand and Bokhárá) belonged to him. Agreeably with this, Alexander found a city of Cyrus (Cyropolis)^[34. Arrian, iv. 2 sq. ; Curtius, vii. 6, 16, vii. 6, 20; Strabo, 517; Ptol., vi. 12; Steph. Byz.; Plin., vi. 49; Solinus, xlix. 4.] on the Jaxartes, in the neighbourhood of the modern Khókand. He doubtless ruled also over large portions of the modern Afghánistán, though it is hardly likely that he ever made his way into the land of the Indus. The story of his unsuccessful march on India^[35. Nearchus, in Arrian, vi. 24, 2; Strabo, 686, 742.] seems to have been invented by way of contrast to Alexander’s fortunate expedition.

Different accounts of Cyrus’s death were early current. Herodotus gives the well-known didactic story of the battle with Tomyris, queen of the Massagetae, as the most probable of many which were told. If we accept Herodotus’s statements, we must look for the Massagetae beyond the Jaxartes. In Ctesias Cyrus is mortally wounded in battle with the Derbices, who probably dwelt near the middle or upper Oxus. A fragment of Berosus^[36. Euseb., Chron., p. 29.] says that Cyrus fell in the land of the Dai (Dahae), i.e., in the modern Turkoman desert, perhaps in the southern or south-western portion of it; this account may very well be derived from contemporary Babylonian records. Be that as it may, Cyrus met his death in battle with a savage tribe of the north-east. The battle was probably lost, but the Persians rescued his body, which was buried at Pasargadae in the ancient land of his race. To this day there is to be seen at Murgháb, north of Persepolis (on the telegraph line from Abúshehr to Teherán), the empty tomb and other remains of the great mausoleum, which Aristobulus, a companion of Alexander, described from his own observation^[37. See Strabo, 730; Arrian, vi. 29, 4 sq.]; and on some pillars there the inscription is to be read: “I am Cyrus, the king, the Achaemenian.” Till lately the same inscription was also to be found high on the pillar which bears in bas-relief a winged figure of a king. This figure is furnished with a “pshent,” i.e., such an ornamented crown as is worn by kings and gods on Egyptian monuments.^[38. See the copies in the great works of Texier and of Flandin and Coste. The most exact representations are those from photographs in Stolze, Persepolis (Berlin, 1882), tab. 128sg ’., 132 sq. The proof that this is really the grave of Cyrus is given in Stolze’s Introduction, as well as in his paper in the Verhαndl. der Gesellschaft für Erdkunde zu Berlin, 1883, Nos. 5 and 6 (p. 19 sq. of the separate edition).] This was no doubt meant by Cambyses as a special mark of honour to his father, whose monument must have required years to finish. It is quite natural that the ancient art of Egypt should have made a deep impression even upon those of its conquerors who in other respects had little liking for Egyptian ways.

If one could accept without question the judgment of the Persians as recorded by Herodotus (iii. 89, 160), expanded by Xenophon, and repeated by later writers (from Plato downwards), Cyrus must have been the most perfect model of a ruler. But we must view with great suspicion a tribute of praise like this paid to the founder of an empire by those who reaped the fruits of his labours. The founder of the Sásánian empire is also described as a paragon of wisdom and virtue, though his deeds strikingly belie such an estimate. We must be content to know that we are no better informed about the character of many other great men of the past than about that of Cyrus. That he was a very remarkable man and a great king is a matter of course. Whether he deserves the reputation of a great statesman, which even in modern times has been accorded to him, we cannot say. Certain it is he left the empire still in a very unformed condition. To expend the immense treasures of Ecbatana, Sardis, and Babylon for the benefit of the empire was to be sure an idea which certainly would never have entered into the head of any Eastern conqueror. The treasures simply became the property of the king, though of course a large part went to the leading Persians and Medes who filled the most important offices.

Cyrus died in the beginning of the year 529. He left behind him two sons, Smerdis^[39. So Herodotus (the name being assimilated to a genuine Greek name Smerdies, Smerdes). Aeschyl., Pers., 774, has Mardos; Justin, i. 9, 9 sq., Mergis; the scholium on Aesch., l. c., Merdias.] (Persian Bardiya) and Cambyses (fTambujiyαj ; their common mother was according to Herodotus an Achaemenian, according to Ctesias the daughter of the Median king. The great inscription of Darius states that Cambyses caused Smerdis to be put to death without the people being aware of it. From this it follows that the partition of the kingdom between the two brothers, of which Ctesias speaks, can hardly have taken place; for the murder of a king or consort could not have remained concealed. Besides, in both the Babylonian inscriptions, of which mention has been frequently made, Cambyses is spoken of in a way which distinctly shows him to have been heir-apparent. This fratricide, the true motives of which we do not know, was the forerunner of many similar horrors in the dynasty. The inscription proves, as against Herodotus, that the deed was done before the expedition to Egypt. Nothing else is told us about the earlier part of the reign of Cambyses. It is only when we come to his conquest of Egypt that we have more exact information. The pretexts for the Egyptian war need not detain us. The riches of Egypt had from of old allured the lords of the neighbouring lands, and Herodotus takes it for a matter of course that Cyrus had occupied himself with plans against Egypt. According to the statements of Manetho^[40. See Wiedemann, Geschichte Aegyptens von Psammetich I. bis auf Alexander den Grossen, p. 218 sq. ; comp, too Diod., i. 68. For what follows, and for all that concerns the relations between Egypt and Persia, the work of Wiedemann is to be consulted. At the same time the assumption of the year 525 as the date of the conquest is open to some objections; there are many arguments in favour of 527.] and of the Egyptian monuments, the conquest of Egypt took place in the spring of 525. Vast warlike preparations preceded the expedition. The Greeks-of Asia Minor, the Cyprians, who had just submitted, and the Phoenicians had to furnish the fleet. A countryman of Herodotus, the mercenary captain Phanes of Halicarnassus, deserted from the Egyptians to the [9:18:568] Persians and made himself very usefid in the conquest. It seems that only one great battle was fought, at Pelusium, the gateway of Egypt. The Egyptians, utterly beaten, fled to Memphis, which soon fell into the enemy’s hands. Thus Egypt became a province of Persia; and a pretext was soon found for executing the captured king Psammenitus. This was followed by the submission of the neighbouring Libyans and the princes of the Greek cities of Cyrene and Barca. The peculiar religious feelings of the Egyptians were almost as easily wounded as those of the Jews were in later times. The Persians, flushed with victory, recked little of Egyptian wisdom or folly, least of all recked the brutal king. It is true that even Egyptian inscriptions represent him as a pious worshipper of the Egyptian gods, but this is only the courtly ecclesiastical style, which the Egyptians, partly from servility, partly from long habit, can never drop. And, even if Cambyses did once in a way gratify a pious Egyptian, e.g., by ordering his troops to quit a temple which they had occupied as a barrack, no great importance is to be attached to the fact. No doubt the Egyptian priests grossly exaggerated the king’s wickednesses, but enough remains after all deductions. The dreadful hate which again and again goaded the naturally patient and slavish nation into revolt against the Persians dates from this time; Darius could not atone for the guilt of Cambyses. The brutality of the latter began with maltreating and burning the mummy of the former king Amasis, who had personally insulted him or his father; to the Persians, as Herodotus expressly says, the burning of the body was no less an impiety than to the Egyptians. From Egypt he sent an expedition to the shrine of Ammon in the Libyan Desert, but, caught presumably in a simoom, it was never heard of again. He led in person a great expedition to Nubia (“Aethiopia ”). It does not seem to have been such an utter failure as one might at first infer from Herodotus’s narrative, for some districts to the south of Egypt were conquered; but the results purchased by hecatombs of men who perished by fatigue or were buried in the sands were far from contenting the king. Returning to Memphis, he found the people exulting over the discovery of a new Apis. Their joy did not fall in with his mood. In a fury, or perhaps out of a tyrant’s caprice, he inflicted with his own hand a mortal wound on the sacred steer and instituted a massacre among its worshippers. We may well believe Herodotus that from that time his barbarity to the Egyptians showed itself in ever darker colours. He spared not even the Persians. Ctesias too calls him bloodthirsty. Added to this was his drunkenness. But his marriage with one or two sisters, at which Herodotus takes offence, was really, according to Persian notions; an act of piety.^[41. Herodotus’s Persian informants told him much of the real or pretended virtues of their people, but concealed things which would have offended him.] Similarly, when he put to death a corrupt judge of the highest family and caused his skin to be made into a covering for the seat on which his son was to sit and administer justice, the act was one which all Orientals recognized as truly kingly (Herod., v. 25).

The empire was extended in another direction, when Polycrates, the powerful tyrant of Samos and the neighbouring islands, sought safety in submission to the great king.

Suddenly, however, the empire rang with the news that the king’s brother Smerdis had seized the crown in Persis. We are now in possession of Darius’s own account of these events, and can fairly dispense with the Greek narratives; but we may note that here again, in spite of his poetical colouring, Herodotus stands the test much better than Ctesias.^[42. Small remains of another ancient and trustworthy account are to be found in Justin.] Gaumáta (in Ionic form Comètes, Justin, i. 9), a

Magian, gave himself out as Smerdis (spring of 522) and formally assumed the government. Even Darius’s account lets us see that Cambyses was very unpopular, and the same thing appears from the fact that everybody sided with the new king. Cambyses seems to have marched against him as far as Syria, but there he put an end to himself,—an end plainly affirmed by the great inscription, and quite in keeping with the wildly passionate nature of the man. Gaumáta reigned, universally acknowledged, and, as it seems, beloved, because he granted extensive remissions of taxes. He appeared in the character of Smerdis, son of Cyrus, and therefore as Persian king. This is enough to show that there can be here no question of a political opposition of the Medes to the Persians, such as Herodotus imagines, nor yet of a religious opposition to the Persians by the Magians. The changes for the worse now introduced, and abolished again by Darius when he ascended the throne,^[43. Unfortunately in this interesting passage of the great Behistún inscription the particulars are very obscure.] seem to imply no more than a very intelligible disregard of the leading Persian families, whom Gaumáta could not but fear, since they knew much better than the people that he was an impostor. He fell, not through the patriotic indignation of the Persian people, but through the enmity of these families. Seven persons conspired against him; their names, each with that of his father, arc given by Darius in full agreement with Herodotus, while the list of Ctesias presents somewhat more divergence.^[44. In Ctesias the name of a son is twice given for that of the father. It is obvious that we are here dealing with the ancestors of the seven great families, and one generation could very easily be named by mistake for another.] No doubt they were members of the seven most illustrious houses, but certainly not the actual heads of these houses; for such a life-and-death enterprise, where all depended upon energy and silence, could not be entrusted to persons who happened to be heads of families and some of them perhaps old men. Moreover, Darius himself, who was undoubtedly from the outset the real leader, was certainly not the head of his house, for his father Hystaspes (Visht-áspa) was still alive and in full vigour, since he afterwards governed a province and fought the rebels. But the ringleaders would choose one out of each of the seven families in order to commit the families themselves. The conspiracy was completely successful; and the seven killed Gaumáta in the fortress Sikathahuvati near Ecbatana, in the land of Nisa in Media. This happened in the beginning of 521. Darius was then made king. He was probably the only one of the seven who was qualified to be so, for he alone belonged to the royal family, of which, it is true, there may have been many members more nearly related to Cambyses. At any rate there was hardly another candidate for the crown as able as he.

Darius {Dárayavahu, in the nominative DcírayavahnsK) was then, according to Herodotus (i. 209), about thirty years of age. Amongst other measures for securing himself and adding to his dignity he took to wife Atossa, daughter of Cyrus, who had already been married to her brother Cambyses and to the false Smerdis. He soon showed that his six comrades were not his peers by executing Intaphernes, who had forgotten the respect due to the king, together with his whole family. That at first his seat on the throne was far from firm is intimated by Herodotus (iii. 127), who also mentions cursorily an insurrection of the Medes against him (i. 130), but it is only from the king’s great inscription that we learn the gigantic nature of the task he undertook when he ascended the throne. He had first to unite the empire again; one province after the other was in insurrection; the west alone remained quiet, but it was partly in the hands of governors of [9:18:569] doubtful loyalty. Darius gives the day of the month for the most important events, but unfortunately not the year. Moreover, in consequence of the mutilation of the Babylonian text it is only of some of the Persian months that we can say with certainty to what parts of the year they roughly correspond.^[45. The obvious assumption that the strange name Anámaka, i.e., “anonymous,” for a month means an intercalary month would compel us to infer that all the events falling in this month belonged to one and the same year, for two successive years or every other year cannot each have an intercalary month. But a careful consideration of the particulars shows that all these events could not fall in the same year. Another obstacle to regarding Anámaka as an intercalary month is the circumstance that it corresponds to the tenth Babylonian month Tebet, i.e., probably to December or January, whereas intercalary months usually follow the twelfth or sixth month.] Thus the particular chronology of these insurrections remains in many points quite uncertain, especially as it can be seen that many events narrated as successive were contemporaneous. In any case Darius acted very energetically and promptly; and the chief provinces were undoubtedly again reduced to subjection in the first three years of his reign. The insurrection of Athrina in Susiana was promptly suppressed by a Persian army. More dangerous was the revolt in Babylon of Nidintubel (Nadintabairaf a real or pretended member of the Babylonian royal house who assumed the august name of Nabukadrachara (Nebuchadnezzar). Darius hastened thither and defeated him in several battles. But the long siege after which, according to Herodotus, the rebel city fell into the hands of Darius, cannot have taken place then.^[46. See below under Xerxes.] While Darius was in Babylon a whole series of revolts broke out. That of Martiya in Susiana, who called himself Imani, and appeared in the character of king of that country, was indeed soon put down with the help of the people of Susiana themselves, but in Media, the heart of the monarchy, the situation was much more grave. Phraortes {Frαwαrti), who gave himself out to be a scion of the old royal house of Media, was made king of Media, and the Parthians and Hyrcanians to the eastward, whose satrap was Hystaspes, father of Darius, sided with him. The king’s generals could effect nothing decisive against Phraortes; at last he was overthrown by the king in person. Like all rebels who deduced their descent rightly or wrongly from the old dynasties, he was put to death with circumstances of especial cruelty. In the meantime one of Darius’s generals had put down a second false Nebuchadnezzar in Babylon; others had to suppress insurrections in two regions of Armenia, which were, perhaps, connected with the revolt of Phraortes, and a rising in the distant Margiana (the district of Merv). Even Persis had risen. Another false Smerdis, Vahyazdáta, appeared in the east while Darius was in Babylon, and crowds flocked to him. His power increased so much that he was even able to send an army to Arachosia (a part of western Afghánistán). While Darius in person took the field against Phraortes, he despatched against Vahyazdáta a general who at last overthrew the rebel. Arachosia, too, was reduced to subjection. So, too, was the nomad tribe of the Sagartii (perhaps on the northern or north-eastern frontier of Persis), with Chitratahma at their head, who also claimed to be of the royal house of Media. Afterwards Gobryas (^Gaubruva) i one of the seven, suppressed a third revolt in Persis. The king in person reconquered the Sacae, who had been in subjection before. The generals employed by Darius were Persians and Medes; but there was one Armenian among them. His faithful army was composed of Persians and Medes, but his adversaries were also supported in part by Persians and Medes. Darius must have been a great ruler to conquer them all. Picture his position when he took the field against Phraortes; Babylonia was his once more, and its wealth must have supplied him with the means of war, but almost the whole of Iran and Armenia was in the hands of men whom he calls rebels and liars, but some of whom, at least, had perhaps more right than he to the sovereignty, and whose people were devoted to them. No sooner had he reached Media than Babylon was again in arms. Nothing but great energy and circumspection could have carried him safely through all his difficulties.

The satrap of Sardis, Oraetes, had not revolted, but his conduct was that of an independent prince. Him Darius put out of the way by stratagem (Herod., iii. 120 sqf. At the same time Samos became definitively a Persian province, after a royal army had, with much bloodshed, set up as tyrant Syloson, brother of Polycrates, whom Oraetes had put to death. The removal of Aryandes,^[47. Polyaenus, vii. 10, 7, calls him Oryandres.] governor of Egypt, who assumed, even at that date, the royal privilege of minting money, seems to have followed not long afterwards.^[48. Wiedemann, op. cit., p. 236, fixes as the date the year 517; but his grounds are not conclusive.] He had extended his power westwards. But we see from Herodotus that to the west of the last mouth of the Nile the Persian rule was always precarious; and that he can have conquered Carthage, whose naval power was perhaps a match for that of the whole Persian empire, is quite incredible. At the most it is possible that the prudent leaders of that commercial state may in negotiations and treaties have occasionally recognized the king in ambiguous phrases as their lord.

The experience gained by Darius in the first unsettled years of his reign must have been in part the occasion of his introducing numerous improvements into the organization of the empire. Governors with the title of satraps (fhshathrapávan, i.e., land-rulers) there had been before, but Darius determined their rights and duties. Vassal princes of dangerous power were tolerated only with reluctance. The satrap had indeed the power and splendour of a king, but he was nevertheless under regular control. The court received from special officials direct reports of the conduct of the governors, and from time to time royal commissioners appeared with troops to hold an inspection. The satrap commanded the army of his province, but the fortresses he was obliged to leave in the hands of troops directly under the king. But the most important part of the reform was that Darius regulated the taxes and imposed a fixed sum upon each province, with the exception of the land of his fathers, which enjoyed immunity. The Persians were discontented at this, and dubbed Darius in consequence “higgler” (κάπηλος) ; but this is doubtless only the cry of high officials, to whom any regulated fiscal system was objectionable, as making it somewhat more difficult for them to fleece their subordinates. It is not at all to be supposed that the irregular contributions (“presents,” Herod., iii. 89) previously levied were less burdensome to the subjects. However imperfect the Persian state system was, and however illusory the measures of control may often have been, still the organization introduced by Darius marks a great step in advance over the thoroughly rude old Asiatic system.

In the Behistún inscription, which is placed not long after the conclusion of the great revolts, India does not as yet appear as a province, though it does in the later inscriptions of Persepolis, and in the epitaph of Darius. Herodotus says that Darius caused the Indus to be explored from the land of the Pactyans (Pakhtu, Afgháns) to its mouth by Scylax, a Greek or rather Carian, and then conquered the country. But in any case this Persian “India” was only one portion of the region of the Indus. If this conquest was somewhat adventurous, much more so was [9:18:570] the enterprise against the Scythians. Profound motives for this expedition have been sought for, but it no doubt sprang simply from the longing to conquer unknown lands. That Darius, an energetic and valiant Eastern prince, always hitherto favoured by fortune, should have been free from lust of conquest is in itself very unlikely. The expedition against the Scythians falls about 515. With regard to the preparations and the beginning of the expedition up to the crossing of the Danube we are well informed. The Greek subjects, of whom even by this time there were many on the European (Thracian) side— such as the inhabitants of Byzantium and the Thracian Chersonese—were obliged to supply the fleet. Mandrocles of Samos built a bridge over the Bosphorus. The Persians must soon have found how useful the skill of the Greeks might be to them, without suspecting the dangers with which the Greek spirit threatened them. The king’s march may be followed as far as the Danube; it lay pretty nearly due north, the warlike Getae, a Thracian people, being subdued on the way. With the entry into the Scythian country itself Herodotus’s narrative becomes completely fabulous. His chief error is in leaving out of sight the enormous distances in these regions (the southern part of modern Russia) and the great rivers. Hence he represents the native tribes and Darius as marching the distance between the Danube and the Don, or even the Volga, twice in not more than two months, as if the distances were as in Greece. Darius, who passed the Danube by a bridge in the neighbourhood, perhaps, of Isaktchi, can hardly have crossed even the Dniester. Strabo, who either possessed more exact accounts of the expedition, or drew correct inferences from the disaster which afterwards overtook King Lysimachus in this neighbourhood, forms a very intelligent judgment on these matters. The expedition failed, not through the superior tactics of the Scythians, who behaved just as might be expected of such nomads, with a mixture of timidity and audacious greed of booty, but through the impassable and inhospitable nature of the country, through hunger and thirst, through exhaustion and disease. After sustaining heavy losses Darius was obliged to retreat across the Danube. The king, or at all events his army, was saved by the Greek tyrants, especially Histiaeus of Miletus, who refused to follow the advice of their colleague Miltiades to break down the bridge. But the damage to the prestige of the empire was great; the Greeks had seen their lord and master in distress. Nevertheless the district south of the Danube was retained. That the Scythians immediately followed up their enemy, or that they even opened negotiations with the Spartans, as Herodotus states,^[49. The story of the dealings of King Cleomenes with the Scythians (Herod., vi. 84) rests on a joke,—he drank immoderately, “like a Scythian.”] is not to be supposed. Moreover, Megabyzus, whom Darius on his return left behind in Europe, subdued great districts of Thrace along with the Greek cities on the coast. The king of Macedonia also acknowledged the great king as his liege lord. The cities on the Hellespont,^[50. This expression is used to designate the towns lying on the Hellespont, Propontis, and Bosphorus.] which after the failure of the expedition made no secret of their feeling towards the Persians, and in part expressed their hostility in overt acts against them, received sharp punishment. The islands of Lemnos and Imbros were occupied. At the mouth of the Hebrus (Maritza) Doriscus was converted into a fortress with a standing garrison.^[51. To the same time may be referred the foundation on the Asiatic side of Dareium, named after Darius, just as Harpagium probably has its name from Harpagus. It is to be observed that in the district of Old Phrygia such towns called after persons are found from of old, as Midaeium, Gordiaeium, Dascylium, and others.]

The eyes of the Persians were now turned towards Greece proper. While the Greek coast of Asia Minor was indispensable to the power which held the interior, the possession of the mother-country of Hellas was, as we can easily see, not only unnecessary but positively dangerous to the Persians, especially as they were themselves absolutely unfitted for the sea. But to the Persians of those days, absorbed in schemes of universal empire, considerations such as these could not present themselves. Besides, the enterprises of the Persians against the Greeks were to a large extent suggested and furthered by the Greeks themselves. Repressed factions, tyrants in exile or in danger, were but too ready to invoke the help of the foreigner at the price of slavery. When the Persians attacked a Greek state there was always another at enmity with it which at once took their side. Even the inconsiderable enterprise which was the outward occasion of the Ionian revolt, namely, the attack of the Persians on Naxos, was brought about by the banished aristocrats of the island, who applied to Aristagoras, lord of Miletus, and hence to his superior, Artaphernes, the king’s brother and satrap of Sardis. The enterprise failed, and in his embarrassment Aristagoras gave the signal for the revolt which he and his father-in-law Histiaeus, the proper tyrant of Miletus, who was detained at the court of Susa, had planned long before.

The great rising of the Ionians and other Greeks and non-Greeks shows a vigorous love of freedom, and much individual boldness and skill on the side of the insurgents · but, quite apart from the vast odds against them and the unfavourableness of their geographical situation, their enterprise was from the outset doomed to failure, because they did not form a compact party, because not even the Ionian cities practised that discipline and subordination which for war are indispensable, and lastly because Aristagoras and Histiaeus were adventurous intriguers and tyrants, but without the gifts of rulers or generals. Of the history of the revolt, in addition to the excellent accounts which he derived from Hecataeus of Miletus, a contemporary and actor in the events he describes, Herodotus has all sorts of popular fables to tell. The chronology is uncertain; probably the revolt began in 500 or 499, and was substantially ended by the capture of Miletus in 495 or 494 (six years later, Herod., vi. 18). Aristagoras made himself master of the fleet on its return from Naxos, took prisoner the tyrants on board at the head of the contingents of their cities, and restored the republic in Miletus, only of course with the view of thereby ruling the confederacy. The Spartans, admittedly at that time the first power of Greece, were sober enough to refuse the help requested. But the Athenians, who had already excited the wrath of the Persians by refusing to comply with the demand of Artaphernes that they should receive back Hippias as tyrant, had the courage or rather the foolishness to despatch twenty ships to the help of the Ionians. They thus mortally insulted the Persians without really benefiting their friends. The Athenians shared in the march on Sardis. The confederates burned the city, but could not capture the citadel; on the contrary, they were obliged to beat a hasty retreat, and were after all routed at Ephesus. However, the Persian army did not as yet permanently take up quarters in Ephesus. The Athenians, who may have dreamed of pressing forward into the interior of Asia, returned home with their illusion dispelled, and Athens took no further part in the war. But the impression produced by this unsuccessful expedition upon a modern critic is very different from that which it produced upon the Asiatics of those times. They said: “The Ionians have risen against the king; the Ionians from beyond the sea have come to their help; they have [9:18:571] burned the king’s capital,” and many added, “It is all over with the king’s supremacy !” Not only did the Hellespontine cities, with Byzantium at their head, join the Ionians, but also a great part of the Carians, the Greeks in the Troad, and almost the whole of the very flourishing island of Cyprus. By this time the possession of these lands was really endangered by the revolt. But now the Persians came with a great fleet to Cyprus. The Ionians sailed to meet them, beat them at sea off Salamis in Cyprus, but were beaten by the Persians on land. After great struggles, which are described in an almost epic style, befitting the primitive state of the island, Cyprus came once more under the power of the Persians, after being free only one year. This was the first heavy blow to the insurrection. Much fighting took place on the mainland; and most of the Persian enterprises were successful, but not all. In particular the Carians, who in general displayed great gallantry in this war, annihilated a whole Persian army under a son-in-law of Darius. But the longer the war lasted, the more marked became the progress made by the Persians. Aristagoras left the seat of war, and withdrew to his possessions of Myrcinus on the Lake of Prasias in the south of Thrace, near what was afterwards Amphipolis, but was there slain by natives as early as 497.^[52. Thuc., iv. 102.] Darius then despatched Histiaeus, whom he still continued to believe faithful, to Ionia, probably in order to open negotiations. He availed himself of the opportunity to seek to regain the lordship of Miletus and put himself at the head of the whole revolt, but the Milesians would have nothing more to do with him or with Aristagoras. The great intriguer had connexions on all sides, but no one trusted him in the long run. He became at last a pirate on his own account; and after many adventures he fell into the hands of the Persians and was crucified. It is a noteworthy fact that Histiaeus had actually concerted a conspiracy with the Persians in Sardis, against Artaphernes and Darius, the discovery of which cost many their head. Fidelity has never been an Iranian virtue.

The decisive struggle was concentrated about Miletus. There, at the little island of Lade, as Grote points out, the odds against the Greek fleet (600 triremes against 353) were not so unfavourable as they were at Salamis, and the want of unity of leadership was not much greater than it was there; but the Ionians and Lesbians were not, or were no longer, the equals of the European Greeks in bravery and warlike skill. A complete overthrow was the result, in which treachery on the Greek side had its share. Miletus long defended itself by sea and land, but was at last taken and destroyed; the women and children were sold as slaves. The captured Milesians were carried off into the heart of Asia and settled at Susa. Miletus, up to that time by far the most important of all Greek cities in Asia, though it afterwards recovered, still never regained its old position. The most important city of the coast was henceforward Ephesus, which took no part in the battle of Lade, and perhaps had at that time already submitted amicably to the Persians.

The subjugation of the rest of the Greeks of the mainland and islands, as well as of the Carians, now rapidly followed, not without dreadful massacres and devastations. The Phoenicians, who formed the main body of the Persian fleet, seem to have been especially zealous in the work of destruction. The old bitterness between the Canaanites and the Hellenes, so vividly shown during these centuries in Sicily, cannot have died out in the east. In ruined Ionia a frightful state of things must have prevailed, so that at last Artaphernes saw himself obliged to undertake a regular organization to ensure the peace of the country. At the same time he caused the land to be surveyed, and established fixed imposts.^[53. Herod., vi. 42; Diod., x. 59.] These were not higher than before the war, but naturally they now pressed much harder on the impoverished Ionians. Thereupon the young Mardonius, son of the Gobryas who has been mentioned before, and brother-in-law and son-in-law of the king, established democracies in all Ionian cities. The weakened communities might well seem to the Persians at that time less dangerous than ambitious tyrants. However, this measure apparently applied only to the Ionians of the mainland, not to the islanders nor to the other Greeks of the mainland.

Mardonius cherished great designs. He wished to conquer Greece itself. He did actually conquer Greeks and non-Greeks in the north-west of the Archipelago, but at the promontory of Athos his fleet was shattered by a storm.

The second expedition against Greece was on a greater scale. Under the conduct of the Mede Datis and the younger Artaphernes, son of Darius’s brother of the same name, the Persians took Naxos, and destroyed Eretria in Euboea, the inhabitants of which had sent five ships to help the Ionians at the beginning of the revolt. But at Marathon they were utterly defeated by the Athenians and Plataeans (September or October 490). They quickly renounced the project of subjecting Athens to Hippias as tyrant and to Darius as suzerain, and departed home. Miltiades, who, as lord of the Thracian Chersonese, had once been the king’s vassal and had afterwards been obliged to fly, had taken the measure of the Persian. By his victory Athens had rendered immortal service to Europe and the cause of civilization. It was the first great victory of the Greeks over the Persians in the open field; the moral impression had an immense effect in the sequel, when the danger was much greater.

The south-west of the empire alone had hitherto remained free from rebellion against Darius. Darius, who had been with Cambyses in Egypt (Herod., iii. 139), treated the Egyptians with forbearance, and in return loyal priests praised him to fellow-countrymen and Greeks. If a notice of Polyaenus is to be trusted, he must have gone in person to Egypt in the year 517,^[54. See Wiedemann, op. dt.,p. 237.] in order to lighten the burdens of the people. Amongst other measures which promoted the material wellbeing of the land, he made a canal from the Nile to the Red Sea, as an inscription of the king himself testifies to this day. But the hatred of the Egyptians to the Persians was too great. In the year 486 (Herod., vii. 1, 4) the first great insurrection of the Egyptians against the Persians took place. From an inscription we know that during it Khabbash or Khabash was king of Egypt. Darius did not live to see the revolt put down, for he died in the following year, 485.

Darius is the most remarkable king of the dynasty of the Achaemenians, and perhaps the most remarkable of all the native kings of Iran. So far as we know, only the Sásánid Khosrau I. in the 6th and the Safavid Abbás the Great in the 17th century a.d. can be compared with him. He was as energetic as he was prudent. He was of course a despot, and could be ruthless and even cruel, but on the -whole he was inclined to be mild. We lay especial weight on the testimony of Aeschylus, who had himself fought at Marathon against the army of Darius, and who shared the exasperation of the Athenians against the Persians, but nevertheless in his Persae expresses very high respect for the king. This, then, was the judgment of educated Greeks on the prince who had brought such untold misery upon their nation. To such a judgment great weight is to be attached. In harmony with it are the particulars which we know of the doings and ordinances[9:18:572] of Darius. He seems, too, to have shown a correct insight in his choice of the persons to whom he entrusted important positions.

He was succeeded, apparently without any disturbance, by his son Xerxes {Khshayársháj I., who, as son of Atossa, elder daughter of Cyrus, had probably always been regarded as heir-apparent.^[55. In spite of the anecdote in Herod., vii. 2-4; Justin, ii. 10; Plut., De frat, amore, p. 488, and Reg. apophtlι., p. 173.] The time was not yet come when claimants to the throne and suspects were assassinated. On the contrary, the king’s blood-relations played under Xerxes as under Darius a great rôle as leaders and counsellors. But the whole generation was probably deeply degenerate, though the difference could hardly anywhere have been so great as that between Darius and Xerxes, λvho begins the series of weak and unworthy kings.

The subjugation of Egypt was effected in 484 (Herod., vii. 7). The measures taken by Khabbash to protect the mouths of the Nile against the “fleet of the Asiatics” had thus been unsuccessful. According to Herodotus a much harder yoke was laid on Egypt than before. The king’s own brother Achaemenes was made satrap of the country.

Babylon too seems to have again risen in revolt. Ctesias assigns to this date the revolt with which the well-known story of Zopyrus^[56. This story, with all sorts of variations, is very widely spread in the East, but it can hardly rest on an historical fact.] is connected, naming instead of Zopyrus his son Megabyzus. The long siege of which Herodotus speaks does not, as we saw, fit in with the revolt under Darius; it belongs, perhaps, to the time of Xerxes. Ctesias gives us to understand that Xerxes wounded the religious feelings of the Babylonians, and Herodotus speaks expressly of the desecration of their sanctuaries by the same king (i. 183). To the victorious Macedonians, who emphatically asserted that they were come to avenge the destruction of Greek temples by Xerxes, the Babylonian priests afterwards told many tales of the outrages he perpetrated on their sanctuaries.^[57. Arrian, vii. 17, 2; Strabo, 738.] Doubtless they grossly exaggerated, but they did not invent everything. Of course such sacrileges may equally well have taken place when the city was reconquered, or have been the occasion of a revolt.

Darius was firmly resolved to wipe out the disgrace of Marathon, and to bring the whole of Greece under the yoke. His mighty preparations for the march thither had been interrupted by the revolt of Egypt, and, if our conjecture is right, of Babylon. They were now vigorously recommenced; and provision was made for the maintenance of the army, at least within the limits of the Persian domain. Xerxes himself went to Sardis, the.first great rendezvous. From there he sot forward in the spring of 480. We will not further describe the great expedition, which, after the dearly-bought successes at Thermopylae and Artemisium, ended with the defeats of Salamis (September 480) and Plataea (479)—all this belongs rather to the history of Greece—but we will briefly discuss the causes which procured for the disunited and far from numerous Greeks a victory ovèr the mighty power of the great empire. It may very well be said that it would have been possible to subdue even Hellas, and to put an incalculable check upon the Greek spirit, if the great enterprise had been conducted with more sagacity. There was no lack of Greek traitors, nor even of traitor states, from which the king might have learned how to set about the business. But the blind arrogance of the Asiatic king was bent on bearing down everything by the sheer weight of his masses, and when he failed in this his arrogance passed at once into childish cowardice. The fleet certainly mustered over 1200 sail at the beginning of the war, and even after the heavy losses by storms at Eubaea, losses, however, which the Greeks no doubt exaggerated, it must with reinforcements have numbered fully 1000 ships of war,—a force too large to operate, at least in a single mass, in the narrow Greek seas. Moreover, it was without an able head. If the ships furnished by the Phoenicians and the subject Greeks were fairly a match for those of the free Greeks, on the other hand the Persians, Medes, and Sacae who manned the fleet as soldiers probably cut but a sorry figure, and the Persian officers associated with the native ship captains cannot have contributed to the more efficient working of these powerful engines of war. Again, the army, which in any case numbered over a million men, was far too numerous to find sufficient sustenance for any length of time, in spite of the frugal habits which mostly characterize Asiatics. To this must be added the circumstance that the levies were drawn from peoples many of whom were totally unused to the Greek climate. Famine and pestilence must have wrought dreadful havoc among the soldiers. By far the most of them were a useless rabble. Of the Asiatics proper probably only some Persian and Median regiments of guards were well armed, but even they were not to be compared, man for man, with the heavy-armed soldier-citizens of Greece. Moreover, in the use of their weapons on land the Greeks, and above all the Spartans, were far superior to all the Persians. Even the Greeks on the Persian side -were no match for the Greeks of Europe; some of them fought half-heartedly, and an anxious watch was kept on them, so that they were more a hindrance than a help. If the Persians were kept well informed of the enemy’s affairs by means of traitorous Greeks, much more so were the Greeks through deserters and friends in the enemy’s camp. Even when the Persians were driven by necessity to take the resolution of sending back all worthless troops, and when the king had fled. Greece was still in great danger, for an able man, Mardonius, now stood with the best part of the army in the heart of the country. But even with a defeat at Plataea all would not have been over, for the enemy was without his fleet. Add to all this the excellent bearing of those Greeks who remained faithful to their fatherland. Exemplary above all was the conduct of Athens; she durst not allow the laurels won at Marathon to wither. The Spartans, too, with their morbidly exaggerated sense of military honour, earned immortal renown. Even petty Greek communities like Thespiae, Tegea, and Aegina came gloriously to the front. At the head of the Greeks stood many distinguished men, above all Themistocles. On the whole, we may say that here Greek intellect, Greek valour, and Greek virtue triumphed over the spiritless and helpless hordes of Asiatic slaves.

Here and there a modern^[58. E.q., Maspero, Hist, ancienne des peuples de I Orient, chap. xιv.] has expressed the opinion that the conquest of the Greeks by the Persians would have been no such great misfortune after all, inasmuch as the intellectual superiority of the former would have asserted itself even under a foreign dominion, especially as the Persians were not regular barbarians; but this opinion is entirely false. Only in a free country could the Greek spirit fully unfold itself, only in democratic Athens could it accomplish its highest work and achieve imperishable results for all time. In the externals of civilization the Asiatics might, in some respects, be actually the superiors of the Greeks; but genuine free human culture first arose among the latter, and if there was one pride that was justified it was that of the cultivated Greeks as against all barbarians. The Greeks themselves had no inkling of the high sense in which the watchword at Salamis, “All is at stake” (Aeschyl., Pers., 405), was applicable to the whole of human culture.
[9:18:573]

King Xerxes had shown himself in the war a thoroughly commonplace Eastern despot, as boastful as he was effeminate. The dreadful sacrifice described by Herodotus (vii. 114) may be excused on the ground of religious superstition, but the mutilation of the corpse of Leonidas and the decapitation of the Phoenicians who commanded the fleet show the spirit of the man. His disgraceful flight must have been welcome to Mardonius. The latter fell like a man at Plataea; indeed the battle of Plataea did honour to a large part of the vanquished. Of course great masses of the vast army returned to Asia, several doubtless still in good order, but many, very many, must have perished in Greece, and in Thrace, where the savage Thracians cut off large numbers of the fugitives.

The Greek fleet did not at first venture to pursue the Persians to Asia, but afterwards it crossed at the request of the Greek islanders. At the headland of Mycale, not far from Miletus, the remainder of the Persian fleet was annihilated just about the time of the battle of Plataea. The liberation of the islands and of the greater part of the Greek cities on the coast of Thrace followed. Thrace and Macedonia regained their independence without any effort of their own. The whole of the islands were permanently wrested from the Persians, and the liberation of the Asiatic coast was already begun.

We stand here at the decisive turning-point of Persian history. Henceforward Greece might be coveted and designs against it cherished, but no enterprises were undertaken. The Persians were thrown back upon the defensive. Though they often afterwards exercised an influence on the history of Hellas by means of money or diplomacy, still the respect for their fighting power was gone, and so far it is possible to regard Alexander’s expedition as a result and continuation of the old struggles, and the saying of Aeschylus, “In Salamis the power of the Persians lies buried,” may be called prophetic.^[59. Aeschyl., Pers., 596 sq. The brevity and simplicity of the expression 2χet rà lleρσωv cannot be rendered in any modern language.]

Xerxes was still in Sardis when his full brother Masistes came thither with the beaten forces from Mycale. Disquieted probably by the neighbourhood of the victors, the king retired into the depths of Asia. About the same time he deeply offended Masistes on a point of family honour; in revenge Masistes intended to go to his province of Bactria and there raise a revolt, but was cut down by horsemen despatched after him (Herod., vii. 108 sqf This story (like that told by Herodotus in iv. 13) exhibits all those horrors of a later age which Ctesias loves · to paint. The idea of a revolt, moreover, was not far to seek after the profound humiliation inflicted by the Greek war and the dreadful losses of men,—how many Sogdianians, Indians, and Nubians can have returned to their homes? The inhabitants of distant frontier lands may even then have severed their connexion with Persia, and even then mountain and desert tribes in the very heart of the empire may have regained their full independence.

Unfortunately the work of Herodotus breaks off abruptly with the battle of Mycale, and with it our only continuous ancient history of the empire conies to an end. The fragments of Ctesias and the occasional statements of other writers can only, to a small, extent, supply the deficiency. Henceforward we possess tolerable information on the shifting relations between the Persian empire and the Greek states, but on little else.

Under the conduct of Pausanias, the victor of Plataea, the Greeks sailed (477) first to Cyprus and then to Byzantium. At the capture of the latter many distinguished Persians fell into their hands, and Pausanias, who must have appeared to Xerxes as a sort of king of Greece, took advantage of this opportunity to open a correspondence with the Persian monarch. Artabazus, son of the Pharnaces who had held a command under Mardonius, received the satrapy of Hellespontine Phrygia (where his family retained the power thenceforward down to the fall of the empire), for the purpose of conducting the negotiations. The definite statements of Thucydides leave no doubt as to Pausanias’s guilt. In particular the king’s letter (i. 129) bears every mark of genuineness. Happily he proved himself a clumsy intriguer, and when long afterwards in Sparta retribution at last overtook him he had ceased to be dangerous, at least for the freedom of Greece as a whole. The conduct of Pausanias, together with a want of inclination and capacity for distant naval expeditions, caused the Spartans to resign the conduct of the maritime war against Persia. They withdrew, and the command passed into the hands of the Athenians (476). The naval power of Sparta was quite insignificant, and was certainly surpassed by that of some of her allies, such as Aegina and Corinth; and the advantage to Persia of the absence of the Peloponnesian fleet was far more than counterbalanced by the circumstance that the Greek naval forces were now under a single energetic leadership, which aimed at nothing less than the exclusion of the enemy from all Greek seas and coasts. The war lasted for a long time, but few of its details are known to us, though the scanty statements of the Greek writers are partly illustrated by Attic inscriptions. The European coast was soon completely cleared. Eion fell after an arduous siege (about 470). Doriscus alone continued for long to be a Persian possession. The most brilliant episode of this period of the war is the great naval expedition of Cimon.^[60. About 465. Perhaps it falls within the reign of Artaxerxes.] He liberated the Greek cities of the Carian and Lycian coast, and took the bilingual towns, which were occupied by a Persian force; all were incorporated in an Attic maritime league. The important Phaselis on the borders of Lycia and Pamphylia also fell into his hands. At the mouth of the Eurymedon the Persian fleet, under a son and a nephew of Xerxes, was defeated and destroyed, and a land-victory for the Greeks followed immediately. Upon this Cimon sailed hastily for Cyprus, where he captured eighty ships. Here for once the Greeks were numerically superior, but nevertheless it was a great exploit to have advanced victoriously so far beyond their own waters.

About this time Xerxes was assassinated. From various writers we can piece together an account of this event by Ctesias, and another by Dinon,^[61. He wrote in the time of Alexander.] which differ from each other in numerous particulars; a third version is given by Aristotle {Pof, p. 1311 b). For such scenes, occurring in the interior of the seraglio, an outsider is not a trustworthy authority, but this much is clear: Xerxes was killed by Artabanus, captain of the body-guard; his youngest son Artaxerxes, in league with the murderer, put to death his elder brother Darius, who had a better title to the throne. It does not, however, follow with certainty that Artaxerxes was a parricide. We have here a change of sovereign of the sort which abounds in Oriental history. Artabanus was soon afterwards put out of the way by Artaxerxes. Later chronologists represent him as actually reigning for seven months, but this is probably a mistaken interpretation of expressions used by Dinon.

Artaxerxes {Artakhshathra ^[62. A second form, Artαklιshαsht, is represented by Hebrew and Egyptian forms, and by 'Apτaζiσσηs on a Greek inscription (Le Bas and Waddington, No. 1651).] ) I. came to the throne in 464. His surname “Longhand” (Mακpoχ∈φ), which seems to have been first mentioned by Dinon, has no doubt a symbolical meaning, “of far-reaching power,” but later Greek writers took it literally. Ctesias tells of a [9:18:574] rising of the Bactrians immediately after his accession to the throne, which may have been instigated by Hystaspes, the king’s elder brother, who was then in his satrapy of Bactria (Diod., xi. 69). Two battles took place, the second of which ended in a decisive victory for the royalists, so that Bactria was once more reduced to subjection.

In the early part of the reign of Artaxerxes falls the appearance of Themistocles at the Persian court; so say the contemporary Charon of Lampsacus (Plut., Themist., 27), and also Thucydides (i. 137) j to their authority that of all later writers, who here mention Xerxes, must give way. On calmly weighing the trustworthy accounts and taking into consideration the circumstance that even at a later time Themistocles as a “traitor” was refused a grave in Attic earth, we can hardly avoid concluding that the gifted saviour of Greece, the founder of the Attic seapower, a man far superior intellectually to Pausanias, but of boundless ambition, and with a strong propensity to intrigue, was really guilty of entering into traitorous communication with the Persians in his own interest. Certainly he knew admirably how to give himself out as an old friend of the Persians,^[63. But the letter in Thuc., i. 137, cannot be regarded as an authentic document.] and to hold out to them the prospect of still doing them valuable service against his countrymen. The king gave him Magnesia on the Maeander in Lydia and two other towns; as the tyrant of these places under Persian supremacy the victor of Salamis lived some time longer.^[64. Here, too, he coined money. Of the two specimens known to us, one is plated, “which seems to show that with the coinage the cunning Athenian combined a financial speculation,” Brandis, Münz-, Mass-, und Gewichtwesen Vorderasiens, p. 459.] Like this illustrious fugitive, other Greek exiles or adventurers came to the Persian court from time to time, and played there occasionally a certain rôle.

Hardly was Artaxerxes seated on the throne when the second great revolt of Egypt broke out. Inarus, son of Psammetichus, a Libyan prince, placed himself at the head of the Egyptians and was made king of the whole country. The satrap Achaemenes, son of Darius, fell in battle. Inarus summoned to his aid the Athenians, who were still at war with the Persians, and the Athenians were rash enough to involve themselves in the struggle (about 460). They had just come once more to Cyprus with 200 ships. They sailed to Egypt, and with the help of the Egyptians shut up the Persians and the Egyptians who sided with them in the castle of Memphis. Persia had recourse to diplomacy: an embassy was sent to Sparta in order to stir up the Spartans to make a vigorous diversion against Athens. When this attempt failed, a large army was at last despatched under Megabyzus, son of Zopyrus, which subdued the country after hard fighting; for, with all their hatred of the Persians, the Egyptians were no match for them in battle. The Athenians in Egypt were annihilated (probably 455); the same fate befell a reinforcement of fifty ships. Inarus fell by treachery into the hands of the Persians and was crucified. His son Thannyras, however, received (Herod., iii. 15) his original province (probably the Libyan nome), which points to the war having been concluded by a treaty, of which Ctesias also makes mention. In the swamps of the Delta Amyrtaeus (Amun-art-rut) maintained himself as an independent king; and by him the Athenians were once more invited to Egypt (450 or 449). Cimon, who was again at Cyprus with 200 ships, despatched sixty to his help, but they soon returned, probably without accomplishing much. Cimon died during the siege of Citium, one of the most important cities of Cyprus, and the mainstay of the Phoenician nationality on that island. The Athenians raised the siege, but achieved on their retreat once more a brilliant victory by sea and land.^[65. The epigram which Diodorus (xi. 62) wrongly applies to the battle of the Eurymedon refers to this battle.]

These are the last contests of the Athenians and their allies with the Persians. Peace must have been concluded shortly afterwards. We cannot here enumerate and criticize the arguments which have often been adduced for and against the supposition that a regular peace (though not a “peace of Cimon”) was concluded. No one probably would have questioned the reality of such a peace were it not that the Attic orators of the 4th century, by grossly exaggerating the terms of a treaty which in their time had long been a dead letter, had rendered the very existence of the treaty open to suspicion, and that the able historian Theopompus, moved apparently by dislike of the Athenian democracy and a desire to gratify his powerful patron, King Alexander, had attempted by false though learned arguments to disprove the genuineness of the original treaty of peace, of which only a copy was extant in his time. The text of the original document was given by the best authority on Attic decrees, Craterus.^[66. Shortly after Alexander.] It is hardly conceivable that the great war should have died out of itself without the Athenians getting some security that their possessions and their widely ramifying commerce would be left unmolested. Moreover, all that we are told or can infer as to the contents of the treaty agrees perfectly with the political relations of the time. The treaty was not at all in the spirit of the high-flying plans of Cimon’s party; for, while the Persians acknowledged the independence of the Greek towns on the west coast, including the Lycian, and pledged themselves to send no ships of war into Greek waters, the Athenians in return renounced all rights in the eastern seas. The most sagacious of the Athenians had perceived that Cyprus, and much more Egypt and Phoenicia, lay outside the natural sphere of Athenian power. We can understand, however, that Callias, the author of the treaty, earned the dislike of the Athenians for his pains. The balance of advantages secured by the peace was on the side of Athens, but the Persians resigned nothing which they actually possessed, and they were now secured against Athenian raids. It was certainly anomalous that the great empire which owned the rest of Asia Minor should have no rights over the narrow strip of coast, which could everywhere be overlooked from the interior. Even the capital of the Hellespontine-Phrygian satrapy, Dascylium, from which that province is sometimes called Dascyl-itis, was now a member of the Attic naval confederacy. The satraps were still obliged as before to pay to the king the taxes due from the coast-lands, and this must have been a constant incitement to them to reconquer those lands. There was no Persian fleet in the Black Sea. The Greek towns on its coast were free, and some of them belonged to the Athenian league and were occasionally visited by Athenian war-ships. At most a portion of the natives of the countries round about the Black Sea were in a state of loose dependence on the Persian eπq>ire. In Lycia and Caria there were districts which obeyed neither the king nor Athens, or at least were not closely dependent on any foreign power.^[67. Compare Thue., ii. 69; iii. 19.]

The condition of Egypt at this time is very obscure. Amyrtaeus had no doubt been finally overthrown by the Persians, but his son Pausiris was left by them in possession of his father’s kingdom. In the year 445 we find an Egyptian or Libyan king, Psammetichus, who presented the Athenians with a great quantity of corn.^[68. Philoehorus, in schol. Aristoph. Vesp., 716; schol. Aristoph. Plut., 178; Pint., Pericles, 37.] This was [9:18:575] perhaps another son of Inarus. But we know nothing more of him and his reign.

The conclusion of peace did not prevent the Persians, or at least individual satraps, from occasionally supporting enemies of Athens. Samian oligarchs, with the help of Pissuthnes, satrap of Sardis, made themselves masters of the island (440 or 439), and estranged it from Athens. The Athenians feared that a Phoenician fleet might come to the help of the oligarchs, but not a Persian interfered when they reduced the island once more to subjection. About 430 Colophon was made over to Itamenes (no doubt a Persian general or governor) and the barbarians by a party among the inhabitants favourable to Persia, and thereupon Notium,^[69. In addition to purely political opposition, the local jealousy between Notium and its “superior town” Colophon had its share in the matter. See Aristot., Pol., p. 1303 b.] a dependency of Colophon, was also occupied by the royalists, for thither also Pissuthnes despatched Persian troops, who entrenched themselves in the town. Amongst these troops were Arcadian mercenaries. This is the first undoubted mention of Greek mercenaries in Persian pay; henceforward they play a very great part in the history of the empire. The Persian rulers had observed how far superior the Greeks were to the Asiatics, and in Greece there were always plenty of stout fellows who were impelled by political events, the love of adventure, or poverty to enter foreign service as soldiers of fortune. Most of them came from the Peloponnesus, presumably from the mountains of Arcadia, which yielded but a scanty subsistence to its inhabitants. The Athenian party in Notium called in the Athenian admiral Faches; by shameful perfidy he made himself master of the entrenchments, and put the garrison to the sword. With Notium, Colophon was now once more a member of the Athenian league. No further consequences followed from these hostilities.

During the early years of the Peloponnesian War the Spartans repeatedly held communications with the Persians, whose assistance they desired against Athens. These negotiations were, for the time being, without result. The Spartan diplomatists were unskilful, and the Persian authorities were cowardly, indolent, ignorant, and selfish.^[70. See Thuc., ii. 67; iii. 31; iv. 50.] The impecunious Peloponnesians wished above all for Persian gold, and, moreover, for the Phoenician war-ships. The Athenians also tried to tap the inexhaustible source of wealth for their own benefit, but of course in vain.^[71. Aristophanes, in the Acharnians (represented January b.c. ), ridicules these long and fruitless negotiations of the Greeks with the Persian king.]

Of the internal state of the empire during the long reign of Artaxerxes I. we know very little. Ctesias, or rather the extract of him made, not always carefully, by Photius, tells us indeed various stories, but he jumbles together fact and fiction, history and anecdote. Of most importance is the quarrel of Megabyzus, conqueror of Egypt, with the Persian court; he maintained a rebellion for several years in Syria, till at last, after several conflicts, a full pardon was assured him by treaty. It is not improbable that this war was the occasion of the destruction of the walls and gates of Jerusalem lamented by Nehemiah (in the year 445). According to Ctesias, Megabyzus afterwards fell into disgrace again, but was again taken into favour. In all these complications an important part is played by those cruel, intriguing, dissolute women, the queen-mother Amestris, daughter of Otanes, of whose character we get a very unpleasing view from Herodotus (vii. 114; ix. 109 sqf), and her daughter Amytis, wife of Megabyzus. Even without an exact knowledge of the circumstances, we can well understand how it was that Zopyrus, son of Megabyzus, came to take refuge in Athens. He fell while attempting, in company with the Athenians, to capture Caunus (in Caria), which had revolted. His grandmother Amestris got the Carian who had killed him into her power and had him crucified.

From Nehemiah’s memoirs we see that in those days one who was not a Persian might not only fill the tolerably high office of cupbearer^[72. Cp. Herod., iii. 34, and Nicol. Damasc. (Le., Ctesias), 64.] in the royal household, but might also become deputy-governor over his fellow-countrymen.

The history of Ctesias, untrustworthy as it is in particulars, shows us the manner of life at court. Artaxerxes I. was a very weak man, and women and favourites took the government out of his hands. Still, he may have deserved the praise, often bestowed on him, of good-nature. He may also have been of stately presence; as an Iranian chief he was doubtless an excellent huntsman^[73. Cp. the anecdote of Ctesias in Photius about his lion hunt.]; but his “incredibilis virtus belli” (Nepos, De regibus, 1) is precisely “incredibilis.” In reading the eulogies of Persian kings we must always remember that the ultimate sources of writers like Ctesias and Dinon are court news, wherein even the deceased kings are spoken of in a courtly tone.

Artaxerxes died in 424. His successor, Xerxes II., the only one of his eighteen sons who was legitimate,^[74. This probably means that the wife who bore him was of a noble Persian family.] was murdered after a month and a half by his brother Secydianus or Sogdianus. But after six and a half months^[75. No reliance is to be placed on these numbers in Ctesias. Others assign to the two monarchs two and seven months respectively. In any case they did not together reign a full year, since the astronomical canon ignores them.] the murderer was in his turn overthrown by his brother Ochus, satrap of Hyrcania, and, in violation of solemn oaths, put to death.^[76. Cp. also Pausanias, vi. 5, 3, where probably we should read Σόγ- διov with Bekker.] Ochus assumed the name of Darius, ascending the throne about the beginning of the year 423.^[77. The beginning of 411 falls, according to the document in Thuc., viii. 58, in his thirteenth year; this is probably a reckoning which begins the year with the spring, and accordingly reckons his first year (or rather the year in which he came to the throne) from the spring of 424 to 423. The astronomical canon begins the year of his accession with 7th December 424.] Darius II. is called Nothus or Syrus,^[78. Hypothesis of Aeschyl., Pers., and schol. on v. 6.] because his mother was a Babylonian concubine. From the first mention of him by Ctesias his wife and sister Parysatis appears as the prompter of all his acts and all his crimes; and this mischievous woman possessed the greatest influence for many years. The king’s full brother Arsites, in conjunction with another son of Megabyzus, Artyphius, raised the standard of revolt, probably in Syria. But his Greek soldiers were bribed, and thus he fell into the hands of the royalists, and, in violation of the oath, was put to death at the instigation of Parysatis. The same fate befell some of those who had taken part in the murder of Xerxes II. Darius had presumably come forward from the beginning as his avenger. Soon after 410 the great revolt of the Egyptians was successfully accomplished. The first independent king was called Amyrtaeus, and was presumably a grandson or other relative of the former Amyrtaeus. The deep decay of the Persian military power is proved by the fact that for sixty years it failed to reduce the un warlike Egyptians, though the latter were frequently divided amongst themselves by internal dissension and double rulers.

The above-mentioned Pissuthnes, satrap of Sardis, had also revolted. Tissaphernes, who here appears for the first time, put down the rebellion by the usual means of bribery and perjury; the Athenian Lycon, leader of Pissuthnes’s Greek mercenaries, plays a far from honourable part in the affair. The events fall after 424, and at least some years before 412. But Pissuthnes’s son Amorges continued [9:18:576] the revolt in Caria, and was supported therein by the Athenians, perhaps because they already knew for certain that Tissaphernes was preparing to help the Spartans.^[79. On the other hand, Andocides {De pace, p. 27), twenty years later, it is true, represents the support given to Amorges rather as the cause of the king’s enmity to the Athenians.]

When the power of Athens seemed annihilated by the dreadful catastrophe in Sicily, the Persians expected to regain the whole sea-coast. Tissaphernes, satrap of Sardis, and his rival Pharnabazus, satrap of Hellespontine Phrygia, vied with each other in invoking the help of the Spartans. The party hostile to Athens in the cities of the mainland and in the islands displayed great zeal in bringing about the alliance. Moreover, the no less able than infamous Alcibiades strained every nerve to secure so favourable an opportunity of distinguishing himself personally and injuring his native city. Not without reluctance the Spartans resolved on a decisive step. They might have known beforehand that they would only receive real support from the Persians on condition of surrendering to them a great portion of the Greek cities which had once been freed by Athens, though now mostly hostile to her. They chose to attach themselves to the more powerful but, as it soon appeared, wholly untrustworthy Tissaphernes rather than to Pharnabazus. Of course the confederates did the Athenians much damage, and wrested from them a great part of their domain. The Lacedaemonians actually served the satrap as catchpolls against Amorges, who resided in Iassus near Miletus, and so he could be taken captive and carried alive to the king. But the Athenians still exhibited astonishing endurance and resource. It is true that neither of the confederates meant honestly by the other. Whether from avarice or mere whim, Tissaphernes supplied the Peloponnesians in insufficient measure with money and stores, and without these they were not in a position to wage Avar in Asia. The intrigues of Alcibiades contributed to soav mistrust and confusion. The Spartan leaders repeatedly concluded treaties with the satrap, but they were not ratified. At last it was agreed that the Avhole mainland of Asia, and therefore all the Greek cities there, should belong to the king, but that in return for this the Persians should give the Spartans effective help. If Tissaphernes had rapidly and energetically carried out the terms of this treaty, the war might perhaps have been ended quickly enough. But to keep faith Avas contrary to the nature of the man. Moreover, he had probably promised more than he could perform: to bring up the great Phoenician fleet was not quite in his poAver. The Phoenicians themselves, and perhaps high Persian lords also, had certainly little desire to engage again the Attic galleys which had handled them so roughly at the Eurymedon and at Cyprus. Pharnabazus supported the Spartans much more honourably and effectively. This he showed especially Avhen the Athenians were again making steady progress (410) under the leadership of Alcibiades after his return. The Athenians πoav devastated the king’s territory in various places, and Pharnabazus had at length to engage to forAvard Athenian envoys to the king for the purpose of conducting negotiations for a peace (409) at the court itself. But events noAv took a decisive turn. Cyrus, the king’s son, was made satrap of Lydia, Great Phrygia, and Cappadocia, and commanderin-chief of all the troops in Asia Minor, Tissaphernes retaining only the coast-cities (408). Cyrus possessed burning ambition, and longed to avenge the defeats which his house had experienced at the hands of the Athenians. Hence he sought to unite himself closely with the Spartans. Just at this time the command fell to the cunning, energetic, and unscrupulous Lysander. These two men were the ruin of Athens. Cyrus granted Lysander, Avho had completely Avon his affection, all the money he Avanted, and when after Lysander’s temporary recall the relations with Sparta were disturbed, because the noble Callicratidas did not care to play the courtier to the barbarians, the return of Lysander sufficed to put everything on its former footing. When Cyrus was summoned to the bedside of Darius (either really ill or pretending to be so), he left his Spartan friend the most abundant resources and the fullest authority. With this help Lysander succeeded in at last compelling Athens, πoav completely isolated, to accept the melancholy peace of March 404. Even after all the misfortunes of Athens it was only Persian gold which enabled the Spartans to humble her.

According to Ctesias, Terituchmes revolted against King Darius, caused his wife Amestris, daughter of the king and Parysatis, to be put to death, but was himself slain by treachery. This event, garnished in the usual manner with a full measure of perfidy and cruelty, is perhaps to be connected with the unsuccessful revolt of the Medes mentioned by Xenophon (Hell., i. 2, 19) under the year 410/409. In the fall of Terituchmes his sister Statira, wife of the king’s eldest son Arsicas,^[80. Arsikas is the form in Ctesias; Plut., Art., 1. From this Photius has wrongly made Arsakes. Dinon called him Oarses. The initial sound was perhaps w.] was nearly involved; thenceforward the bitterest hatred subsisted between Parysatis and her daughter-in-laAv Statira.

About the time of the conclusion of peace between Athens and Sparta Darius II. died. Arsicas ascended the throne under the name of Artaxerxes (II).^[81. At the very beginning of the new reign Ctesias has again some dreadful stories of murder and intrigue to tell. As court physician of Parysatis he had seen only too much of such things, which are characteristic of the Persian court.] The surname “Mnemon” (the mindful) seems again to have been first mentioned by Diπon.^[82. See Plut., l.c. I] The younger and much abler son Cyrus, preferred by Parysatis, came Avith 300 Greek mercenaries, no doubt to seize the throne, but he was too late. Tissaphernes, professedly the friend of Cyrus, warned the king against him, and with good reason. Cyrus Avas arrested, but at the instance of Parysatis he was released and sent back to his satrapy,—a very unwise measure, for his ambition was only inflamed by his imprisonment and by his exasperation against Tissaphernes.

Meantime Lysander lorded it over the Greeks, He even possessed sufficient influence to induce Pharnabazus, Avho in other respects was remarkably respectable^[83. But the worth of his character has been often over-estimated; the contrast with the baseness of Tissaphernes is apt to place Pharnabazus in too favourable a light.] for a satrap, to violate the law of hospitality by causing Alcibiades to be put to death. But even the patience of Pharnabazus Avas at last worn out by Lysander; he urgently demanded the recall of the latter, and the Spartans, Avho had allowed the atrocities of Lysander towards the Greeks to pass unnoticed, respected the satrap’s demand, and recalled their admiral (402 or 401).

No sooner was Cyrus in his satrapyagain than he began to make great encroachments. He gained over the Ionian cities which belonged to the province of Tissaphernes and laid siege to Miletus, which adhered to Tissaphernes. On Orontes, a partisan of the latter, he made open war. Meantime he collected under false pretexts an army of Greek mercenaries, and in 401 set out with the real purpose of seizing the throne. He had with him nearly 13,000 Greek mercenaries commanded by Clearchus, a Spartan exile, and a vast host of Asiatics. But Tissaphernes hastened into the interior before him to carry the tidings. Of this expedition we have the Avell-known account by Xenophon, who took part in it.^[84. Good supplementary information is given by Diodorus, who has indirectly made use of the narrative of another writer who shared in the expedition.] The Spartans favoured [9:18:577] the enterprise of their friend, but without openly breaking with the king. Cyrus advanced boldly, confident in the military superiority of the Greeks; but he had some trouble in carrying them with him as far as Syria and Babylonia, for they were not engaged for so distant a goal. He made his way without difficulty into the heart of the empire. Neither the passes of the Taurus leading from Cappadocia into Cilicia nor those of the Amanus from Cilicia into Syria were blocked. The vassal-prince of Cilicia, Syennesis, put a good face on a bad business and let him through. Even the line of defence between Babylonia and the Mesopotamian desert was unoccupied. At Cunaxa, 500 stadia from Babylon,^[85. So says Ctesias, who knew the country. Xenophon says 360 stadia. These figures are equal to nearly 58 and 42 English miles respectively,—about 93 and 67 kilometres.] they came upon the mighty royalist army. The Greeks carried everything before them; the king proved a miserable coward and fled. But, in fighting the Asiatic rabble, Clearchus seems to have adhered too pedantically to the cautious Spartan tactics, and not to have dashed with sufficient rapidity at the enemy’s centre. Cyrus, however, rushed foolhardily into the mêlée and there fell.

Even if we deduct much from Xenophon’s idealistic portrait, we must still admit that Cyrus was a very able and in many respects honourable man, far worthier of the throne than his brother. F rom his grim mother he probably inherited his spirit and energy. Certainly none of the kings after Darius I. can be compared with him, except perhaps Artaxerxes III. But for Greece, as Grote shows, it was very fortunate that at that time the kingdom of Persia did not fall to a man whose most ardent endeavour it would have been to bring the Greeks into subjugation to himself, and who had learned in the school of Lysander and elsewhere the best means of accomplishing that object.

Cyrus’s Greeks were an object of terror to the king’s troops. All the deception and crimes employed against them had their source in cowardice. The king’s hosts were reinforced by the army of Cyrus, which after their leader’s fall passed over to the enemy; but all these Asiatics trembled before the dauntless Greek mercenaries, comparatively few in number as they were and strangers to the country. It is characteristic of the state of the empire that Tissaphernes allowed the Greeks to plunder the villages which were the special property of Parysatis; he probably thought that with the death of her favourite son her power was broken, while he himself had succeeded in appearing as the deliverer of the empire. After electing fresh leaders in place of those who were foully assassinated, the “ten thousand” made themselves a way through wild mountains and wild peoples; they had to endure a thousand dangers and hardships, but from the king’s forces they experienced no serious hindrance.

This expedition revealed to the Greeks the weakness of the empire and the cowardice of its rulers and defenders. Cyrus had penetrated to its centre without striking a blow, and an army of ordinary Greek mercenaries proved itself more than a match for the power of the whole empire. It was perceived how helpless the colossus was; it was perceived that great territories, which had been regarded as royal provinces, were completely independent.^[86. On the effect produced by the expedition, see Xenophon, Bell., vi. 1, 12; Isocrates, passim.] Independent at that time were the predatory Mysians (in Olympus), Pisidians, and Lycaonians;^[87. At least in part; such mountain peoples did not, of course, form integral wholes, and, if one tribe was independent, another may have obeyed the satrap.] the Lycians (entirely ?) and the Bithynians and Paphlagonians half and half,—the last two peoples had kings of their own; further, the Greek cities on the Euxine; finally, the Carduchi and other wild peoples in the south and north-west of Armenia.

The death of Cyrus widened the breach between Parysatis and Statira. The former could not forget her darling, and succeeded in bringing to a cruel end one after another all who had participated in his death. Statira was exultant; but she was eventually poisoned by her mother-in-law. Artaxerxes was indignant at this deed and banished Parysatis for ever from his sight; but he could not live without the firm guidance of his mother, and soon recalled her.

Tissaphernes succeeded to all the privileges of the post which Cyrus had occupied. This could not but hasten the inevitable conflict with Sparta, which now, at the height of her power, could not bring herself to fulfil the treaty and resign to the Persians all the Greek cities of Asia Minor. The Greeks expected to be protected by Sparta against Tissaphernes, who was already enforcing his rights with the strong arm, and the war which the Spartans began in 401 against the Persians in Asia Minor was no doubt popular, but as a land-power with limited resources they were not in a position to conduct much more than a purely predatory war. The state of Ionia and Aeolis must have changed very much for the worse since the termination of the Attic supremacy, and the Asiatic Greeks were now perhaps for the most part unworthy of the blood that ran in streams on their behalf. Tissaphernes and Pharnabazus sought each to shift upon the other the burden of the war, the conduct of which was not essentially altered when the command of the Spartans devolved on Agesilaus (396), who strove in vain to give the struggle the prestige of a Pan-hellenic enterprise. But, when Agesilaus had gained a great victory close to Sardis, Tissaphernes, who had meantime, more from cowardice than treachery, remained inactive in Sardis, was quietly displaced by a successor in the person of Tithraustes, who succeeded in seizing and executing him.^[88. See Diod., xiv. 80; Plut., Art., 23; Polyaenus, vii. 16, 1.] The real cause of his fall was the hatred of Parysatis. The game of treaties, which neither side meant to keep, and the efforts of the one satrap to thrust the Spartans upon the other, began afresh. In course of time Agesilaus certainly gained ground rapidly. But his successes were in part much exaggerated even by contemporaries.^[89. Isocrates, Paneg , 70.] On the whole, they were predatory expeditions on a large scale, which showed with ever greater clearness the weakness of the empire, but did not directly affect its stability. Even after his great victory, Agesilaus did not venture to attack Sardis—a striking contrast to the speed and thoroughness with which Alexander took possession of these lands. In 394 Agesilaus was recalled, for Sparta needed him in Europe more than in Asia; the intolerable nature of the Spartan supremacy had done more than Persian gold to rouse even the proved allies of Sparta, such as the Thebans and Corinthians, into leaguing themselves with Athens in revolt. When Agesilaus reached the frontier of Baeotia he heard the dreadful tidings of Cnidus.

After the decisive defeat at Aegospotami the admiral of the Athenian fleet, Conon, had fled to Evagoras, prince of Salamis in Cyprus. Evagoras, a tyrant of the “grand” type like Pisistratus or Gelo, favoured Conon’s efforts to enter into relations with the Persian king with a view to raise Athens from her fall. When the war between Persia and Sparta broke out, Pharnabazus had made it clear to the court that it was absolutely necessary to raise a fleet, and that no better commander could be found for it than the tried sailor-hero of Athens. Under the leadership of such a man the Persians actually dared to send Phoenician ships once more into those Greek waters which they had long anxiously avoided. But Conon’s successes, such especially as the revolt of Rhodes from Sparta (probably in 396), [9:18:578] were crippled by the miserable Oriental administration, e.g., the tardiness in paying the men. Hereupon Conon went himself to the king at Babylon, obtained a grant of the necessary money and powers and the king’s consent to bestow the nominal command of the fleet upon the trustworthy Pharnabazus. Then at the head of the Persian fleet the Athenian admiral utterly defeated the Spartans at Cnidus (beginning of August 394). In a short time nearly all the islands and cities on the Asiatic coast were freed from the Spartan prefects (“harmosts ”), and Conon carried his point of nowhere occupying the citadels with Persian garrisons. The Spartan sovereignty of the seas, after lasting ten years, was over for ever. Pharnabazus sailed to the Peloponnesus (393), and at Corinth was joyfully greeted by the Greeks gathered for the war with Sparta. He supplied them liberally with money and then returned home, while Conon restored the marine fortifications of Athens. Thus as a matter of fact a Persian fleet now ruled the Archipelago, but it was a menace and danger to Greek freedom no more. It was only with Greek help, under the leadership of a man like Conon, that the king’s ships could still achieve much.

As the land-war in Greece dragged on for a long time, the Spartans had again recourse to diplomacy. The new satrap in Sardis, Tiribazus, who in some measure revived the vacillating policy of Tissaphernes, met their advances. He overthrew Conon, who escaped death at his hands only with extreme difficulty and fled to Evagoras, at whose court he must have died soon afterwards.^[90. This follows, in opposition to other statements, from Lysias, Pro bonis Aristoph., p. 155; cp. Isoer., Paηey., 73, and Dinon in Nepos’s Conon, at the end.] But Tiribazus soon received in the person of Struthas a successor more favourably disposed to Athens. Many conflicts of Greeks against Greeks still took place by land and sea, but all the belligerents were exhausted, at least financially. So, when the Spartans at last succeeded through their ambassador Antalcidas and through Tiribazus in bringing about a peace, all the more important states of Greece found themselves obliged to accede to it, however unwillingly. This is the notorious peace of Antalcidas, which Tiribazus laid before the delegates of the Greeks at Sardis or Ephesus in 387. It is not a mutual compact but a simple edict of the king. It sets forth that in the king’s opinion all cities of the Asiatic mainland, as well as the islands of Clazomenae and Cyprus, ought to belong to him; that, on the other hand, all other Greek states, even the petty ones, ought to be independent, with the single exception of Lemnos, Imbros, and Scyros, which should continue as of old to belong to Athens. If any one refused to accept this decision, upon him the king and his allies (particularly the Spartans) would wage war with all their power.

It is hardly likely that the true import of this document was understood at the Persian court. That the great king should issue a simple order was there regarded as a matter of course, but the Persian statesmen, who really knew the state of affairs, may have had trouble in securing the acknowledgment of the freedom of the islands. By this peace the Spartans personally gained a great success; for they gave up nothing which they still possessed, while by the declaration of the independence of even the pettiest communities, they secured this advantage, that the cities which had hitherto ruled over wider areas were restricted to their own special domain, that, e.g. i Thebes, hitherto head of Baeotia, now remained only one of many independent Boeotian cities. Thus Greece was split up into a thousand petty communities, which Sparta, who did not dream of extending the independence to her own subjects, could with ease dominate collectively. Through this peace the Spartans gained for about sixteen years a much greater power over the Greek mainland than they had ever possessed before, and they ruthlessly turned it to account. Athens, slowly regaining her strength, was appeased by the three islands, but nowhere was “the peace sent down by the king” felt to be a disgrace more keenly than at Athens. In that peace the king issued orders to the Greeks as to his subjects, and the express and definitive surrender of all the Greeks on the Asiatic coasts was felt all the more bitterly in the intellectual capital of Greece because there was no prospect of ever again freeing them as in the days of Xanthippus and Cimon. And yet it was known that the Persian empire was now much weaker than it had been then, and that it was only maintained by Greek mercenaries.^[91. Compare many passages in the orators and Plato. Especially interesting is the passage in Isocr., Epist. ad Archid., p. 436, on the wild doings of the Greek mercenaries, who were specially burdensome to the Greek cities under Persian rule.] The real gain to Persia by the peace was a firm hold on the sea-coast. The domineering attitude towards the other Greeks was a mere appearance. In the following decades the king repeatedly commanded peace, even after Thebes had completely broken the power of Sparta (371). The powers for the time being employed Persian intervention as a means to their own ends, and there were plenty of diplomatic negotiations with the king, but Persia had no advantage from them. Moreover, now one, now another Greek state supported rebel satraps and vassals. They all, the king as well as the rebels, procured mercenaries from Greece.^[92. We are told that the king desired the internal peace of Greece, because he hoped thereby to procure mercenaries all the more easily from that country (Diod., xv. 38).]

Meantime another enemy had arisen to the Persian supremacy in the west—an enemy who, if Athens, his friend and sympathizer, had at that time been once more a great naval power with an aggressive policy, might perhaps have excluded the Persians from all the western seas. Evagoras of Salamis had made himself the almost independent lord of Cyprus, relying on the ancestral antagonism of the Greek to the Phoenician element in the island. As early as 390 forces were levied against him. Athens, under obligations to him on Conon’s account, supported him openly, although she was at that time still formally leagued with the Persians against Sparta. After the peace of Antalcidas Persia made great efforts to reduce Evagoras again to subjection. He was in league with Egypt, scoured the seas far and wide, and had even for some time maintained a siege of Tyre. The cunning Cypriot also kept up a secret correspondence with the vassal princes of Caria. After a ten years’ struggle he had to yield to superior force, but by skilful negotiation with the satraps he was able to procure a tolerable peace. Soon afterwards he was murdered, but his descendants long continued to be princes of different towns in Cyprus.

About this time probably the expedition of Artaxerxes against the Cadusians took place, of which Plutarch, after Dinon, has given us a detailed account.^[93. Artax., 24; op. Diod., xv. 8, 10.] The Cadusians are the inhabitants of the modern Gílán, who were probably never completely subdued, and who certainly by their raids inflicted much annoyance on the neighbouring territory of the king. Darius II. had taken the field against them shortly before his death,^[94. Xenophon, Hell., ii. 1, 13.] and the repeated mention in the fragments of Ctesias of the Cadusians at the time of the Median empire is presumably a reflex of the state of things in his own day. Artaxerxes’s campaign turned out disastrously. The king probably thought to crush the wild mountain tribes—who, however, are only to be caught by small and skilfully led armies—by masses of troops; but he fell into an ambush, from which he was only saved by [9:18:579] the negotiations which Tiribazus astutely opened with the rebel chieftains. No doubt he had to pay a large sum for his liberation.

Meanwhile the war with Egypt -was never quite at a standstill. Even before the subjugation of Evagoras much fighting took place, but without result. Our knowledge of the particulars, even of the chronology, is very inexact. After the conquest of Cyprus the war was renewed. The Egyptian king invited the Athenian Chabrias to take the command, but Pharnabazus contrived that the Athenians should recall him (376/375). Pharnabazus, who by this time must have been about seventy years old, was placed at the head of the army which was being mustered at Λccho on the Phoenician coast. The Athenian mercenaries were commanded by Iphicrates, who had been sent from Athens. The campaign opened successfully, but dissensions arose between Iphicrates and Pharnabazus, whose proceedings were much too slow to suit the dashing freelance, for Pharnabazus had to report everything to court and to ask instructions from the same quarter. This, along with other circumstances, saved Egypt once more (374). There is the old story, too, of the difficulties of the wars of this period—a mutiny amongst the mercenaries for arrears of pay. The third of the great Athenian condottieri, Timotheus, son of Conon, who fought in the king’s service against Egypt in 372, seems also to have been unable to effect anything.

The last part of the reign of Artaxerxes II. is filled with revolts of the satraps and chiefs of Asia Minor, of which we have numerous but mostly isolated and, to a large extent, inexact accounts. It is impossible to determine the connexion of events. We do not even know in all cases whether the same names designate the same persons; and we are nowhere exactly informed of the motives which induced the individuals to revolt. It is the more difficult to form a judgment on the events because sometimes the same persons side now with, now against the king. These revolts, which lasted in part into the reign of Artaxerxes III., must have weakened immensely the imperial power in the western provinces, and prepared the way for the Macedonians. Rich Greek cities and energetic tyrants probably won for themselves at that time a tolerably independent position. At the head of those who remained faithful to the king we find Autophradates, satrap of Lydia. He fought the rebels repeatedly. Nevertheless Diodorus (xv. 90) names him among the rebels; and it is, after all, possible that there is here no confusion, but that Autophradates was also a rebel for a time. If we omit some smaller risings, such as that of Tachos, who established himself in a fortress on the Ionian coast (after 380), the series begins with Ariobarzanes, successor of Pharnabazus in the Hellespontine satrapy, and no doubt a near relative. Before the beginning of the revolt (about 367) he had formed connexions with Sparta and with Athens, which again stood at the head of a naval confederacy, and he was supported, at least indirectly, by both states. Accordingly, by the diplomatic intervention of Sparta, Autophradates and Mausolus of Caria were induced to raise the siege of Assus (in the Troad), into which Ariobarzanes had thrown himself. The satrap fell by the treachery of his own son Mithradates into the hands of the royalists and was crucified (probably about 365).^[95. Xen., Cyrop., viii. 8, 4; Aristot., Pol., 1312a; Harpocration, s.v. Άριοβαρζάνηί. He is to be distinguished from Ariobarzanes (about 362-337), ancestor of the kings of Pontus, who, however, seems to have belonged to the same house, and was probably heir to a district on the Propontis.]

Mausolus (or rather, according to the inscriptions and coins, Maussõllos, Mαr'σ-σωλλos), a native hereditary prince of part of Caria (probably 375-351^[96. See Pliny, xxxvi. 30, 47.]), had extended his power tolerably far. These Carian potentates, who bore the title of satraps, were in point of fact but little dependent on Persia, and were watched by the Persians with great mistrust. In their cunning and in the sagacity with which they profited by circumstances they recall the Macedonian kings of that period, whom they also resemble in their patronage—often perhaps ostentatious—of Greek art and manners. Mausolus appears to have once been in open conflict with his suzerain; but, though nothing definite is known on the subject, there is no doubt that he came off without serious harm.

Datames, satrap of Cappadocia, of Carian race, had rendered many good services; in particular he had reduced the nearly independent Paphlagonians once more to subjection to the great king.^[97. The Greek cities on the southern coast of the Euxine, which Xenophon about 400 found quite free, were again subjugated at this time. Datames coined money in Sinope, as did also his (probably indirect) successor Ariarathes.] But at last he also revolted in league with Ariobarzanes. He was a man of great shrewdness and versatility, whose stratagems and adventures afforded much entertainment even to later generations. He long kept the king’s troops in check, till he was at last treacherously murdered by Mithradates, son of Ariobarzanes,—the same Mithradates probably whom we found above betraying his father.

The command of the rebel forces was entrusted to Orontes, satrap of Mysia.^[98. Diod., XV. 91. Mysia is not otherwise known as a satrapy proper. But at any rate Asia Minor was the scene of his exploits.] From the confused accounts it is unfortunately impossible to determine whether he is identical with one or other of the persons of that name who are elsewhere mentioned. Further, we have no clear conception of the position which he occupied in the revolt, nor of the way in which he came to betray his comrades. We read, moreover, of the treachery of a less conspicuous confederate. The rebels had despatched Rheomithres to Tachos, king of Egypt, who sent them fifty war-ships and much money. Rheomithres summoned the commanders to a rocky fortress on the northern coast of Ionia, bound them, and delivered them up to the king.

In the year 361 Tachos actually assumed the offensive against the Persians. On his side he had once more Chabrias as leader of mercenaries, and the aged Agesilaus, officially sent by the Spartans, who were bitterly enraged at the Persians because they had now, after the destruction of the Spartan power by Epaminondas, recognized the independence of Messenia, though in doing so they only carried out the letter of the peace of Antalcidas. But, when Tachos was engaged in Phoenicia, his nephew Nectanebus set himself up as rival king, and Tachos was obliged to take refuge with the Persians. If the Persians had been still energetic they would have used the opportunity, when the legitimate king of Egypt had fled to them and two claimants were struggling for the throne, to subjugate the country. But they did nothing of the kind, even when Chabrias had returned to Athens and Agesilaus had died on the way home (probably 360).

At the instigation of Parysatis Artaxerxes had married his own daughter Atossa. She used her interest to secure the succession for the energetic and violent Ochus, who is said to have promised to marry her; the Persian religion approved marriage not only with a sister but also with a daughter, and even with a mother. The elder son Darius was already invested with the succession and the royal title, but having engaged in a conspiracy against his father he was tried and executed, and Ochus, it is said, found means of getting rid of his other brothers, who stood in his way. Soon afterwards the aged Artaxerxes died after a reign of forty-six years (in the course of the year 358). Many stories are told of his mildness [9:18:580] and affability, but, even if they are true, they have little significance. The contempt for his brother which Cyrus exhibited was perfectly justified; under the effeminate king the empire gradually fell to pieces.

But his successor, Ochus, who took the title of Artaxerxes (HL), was of a different stamp. True, it is not perfectly certain that the great restoration of the empire is to be ascribed to his personal influence; it may be that the whole merit belongs to some of his officials, and that he only lent it his name, but it is much more probable that the initiative was his. He was, it appears, one of those great despots who can raise up again for a time a decayed Oriental empire, who shed blood without scruple and are not nice in the choice of means, but who in the actual position of affairs do usually contribute to the welfare of the state as a whole. At the very beginning of his reign he secured himself on the throne by a massacre of his nearest relatives, though no doubt the statement of Curtius (x. 5, 23) is exaggerated.^[99. More distant relatives were left alive, as he who was afterwards Darius III. and his brother, Oxyathres. A son of the Darius who was executed appears in Aιτian, i. 16, 3 (334 B.c. ). Thus the king did not extirpate even the branch that was most dangerous to him. It is to be remembered that even Alexander the Great, after ascending the throne, put several near relatives out of the way.] The judgment of the Greek writers on Artaxerxes III. was too much influenced by such deeds as found an historian in Dinon, as well as by the hatred of the Egyptians, whom he humbled and mortally offended; hence it was one-sided and unjustly unfavourable.

But for a while the empire was in a state of absolute dissolution. Artabazus, satrap of the Hellespontine Phrygia, very probably a son of Pharnabazus and immediate successor of Ariobarzanes, had fought against Autophradates as early as 365 and been taken prisoner by him. At that time the Athenians had acted against him openly enough, at least towards the end.^[100. Owing to the inconstant nature of the foreign policy of Athens at that time—a policy too often influenced by the personal interests of the great captains of mercenaries — as well as to the shifting attitude of the satraps, it is impossible for us to form a clear conception of these events from the isolated statements of contemporaries (like Demosthenes and Aeneas Tacticus) and later writers. It is to be observed that in these decades violent revolutions took place in some Greek cities under Persian supremacy, and that they even made war on each other. With the restless character of the Greeks such things were not to be averted unless each town was occupied by a Persian garrison, which was certainly not the case.] But it is not clear how far Artabazus then rebelled against the king, who was father to his mother, Aparna. But at the time of the so-called Social War (about 355) he fought against the king’s satraps and was powerfully supported by the Athenians. Chares won for him a great victory over Tithraustes. And, when, at the king’s threats, Athens left him in the lurch, he was able, being well furnished with money, to procure the services of the Theban Pammenes, and maintained himself for a long time. The turn in his fortune seems to have come from the Thebans also entering into an understanding with the king. About 350 we find Artabazus a fugitive at the court of Philip of Macedonia, and with him his brother-in-law, the Rhodian Memnon. However, after the subjugation of Egypt, Memnon’s brother Mentor, who, like Memnon, was one of the most distinguished generals of his time, succeeded in procuring pardon for both, and thenceforward Artabazus remained loyal down to the overthrow of the empire.

The revolt of Orontes (or Orontas) fell somewhat later. Probably he is the same whom we found above betraying his comrades. He may very well have received the rule over a wide-coast district^[101. There are coins ascribed to Lampsacus and to Clazomenae bearing the name of an Orontes.] as the price of his treachery (see Diod., XV. 92). He is mentioned in 354 by Demosthenes (De symmoriis, 186) as an enemy of the king. In 349/348 the Athenians formed an alliance with him. From the fragmentary inscription in which this is recorded it does not follow with certainty that at that time he was still in rebellion. About his end we know nothing, but perhaps he was removed after the restoration of Artabazus.

That from the outset Artaxerxes III. was believed to be a person of greater activity than his father may perhaps be inferred from the rumour current in 354/353 that the king was preparing a great expedition against Athens and Greece. Many Greek states may certainly have had a guilty conscience towards the king on account of their wavering policy and the purely mercenary support which they had repeatedly lent to rebellious satraps. Demosthenes warned the Athenians against taking up a hostile attitude to the king on the ground of mere rumours.^[102. In the speech De symmorüs. Similarly in the speech De Rhodiorum libertate (191 sq. ) he advises the Athenians not to offend the king frivolously (351 b.c.).]

The war in Egypt still went on. And now the cities of Phoenicia, previously so trustworthy, also revolted, and so did the kings of Cyprus. Even in Judaea there must have been an insurrectionary movement. The revolted Sidonians showed such exasperation that we can hardly avoid the supposition that Persian rulers had wounded their religious feelings,—the sensitive side of Semitic peoples. The satraps Mazaeus (Mazdai) of Cilicia and Belesys of Syria were driven back by Mentor, whom Nectanebus, king of Egypt, had sent to the help of Tennes, king of Sidon. But, when the great king himself took the field at the head of a powerful army, which included 10,000 Greek mercenaries,^[103. Through Diodorus and some statements of others we possess by exception fairly good information about these struggles.] Tennes and Mentor made terms. Sidon surrendered — though probably only after a severe siege—and was fearfully punished. More than 400,000 men are said to have burned themselves in Sidon on this occasion. The fate of the first-born of Canaan quickly brought the rest of the Phoenicians to their knees. At this time much blood was shed in Judaea also, though we have only scattered notices of the fact.^[104. Josephus, Arch., xi. 7, 1; by Eusebius’s canon 1657 from Abr., and his copiers; Solinus, xxxv. 4. The king at that time settled a number of Jews in Hyrcania. Judaea was forcibly pacified, perhaps by Orophernes (or Olophernes), brother of the then satrap of Cappadocia. Orophernes distinguished himself in this war (Diod., xxxi. 28); the assumption that it was he who reduced Judaea would explain why in the book of Judith—mere romance though it is—an Olophernes appears as the wicked commander who fights against the Jews.] Mentor now went over to the king’s side and fought against his former employers. It was to him and not to the Persian eunuch Bagoas that the king chiefly owed his success; but undoubtedly the royal presence contributed much to the result by facilitating rapid decisions and preventing dangerous jars. Mentor succeeded in everywhere sowing dissension between the Greek mercenaries of the Egyptian king and the Persians; and even more by intimidation than by the sword Egypt was, after long independence, again made a Persian province (344).^[105. So Manetho, who makes Ochus reign six years in Egypt. In harmony with this we learn from Isocrates {Phil. , 102) that in 347/346 Egypt was not yet subdued, while according to the letter of King Philip (Demosth., p. 160) in 340 the reduction of Egypt and Phoenicia had long been effected.] Artaxerxes seems to have made the “vae victis” thoroughly clear to the Egyptians, and to have treated even their religion with little more respect than Cambyses before him: temples were desecrated and sacred animals slaughtered. For a time the Egyptians had to satisfy their rage with nicknaming the king, after the unclean Typhonian beast, “ass.” Cyprus, too, was again reduced. The enterprise was conducted by the prince of Caria, Idrieus. The Greek mercenaries were led by the well-known [9:18:581] Athenian Phocion,^[106. Diod., xvi. 42; the sources from which our biographers of Phocion (Plutarch and Nepos) draλv did not mention this fact, which does not accord very well with the pattern of philosophic virtue which they made out Phocion to be.] and with him was a pretender Evagoras, of the family of the famous Cyprian prince of that name.

Thus by force and policy the old state of the monarchy was restored in all the western lands. Mentor, the real conqueror of Egypt, was splendidly rewarded. He received the satrapy of the west coast of Asia Minor, and quickly removed by cunning and treachery Hermias, tyrant of Atarneus and the friend of Aristotle, who had concluded treaties like an independent prince^[107. Cp. the treaty with Erythrae, Le Bas and Waddington, No. 1535.] and stood in suspicious relations to King Philip of Macedonia. It has been already mentioned that Mentor procured the pardon of his brother-in-law Artabazus and his brother Memnon. It is not improbable that the bestowal of this province on the skilful general and diplomatist, and the restoration of Artabazus to his hereditary satrapy, may be connected with the attention which the king paid to the plans of the Macedonian, which were gradually disclosing themselves more and more. Of course no one thought of danger to Asia Minor, much less to the whole empire, but Philip’s efforts to secure the mastery of the Bosphorus and Hellespont were enough in themselves to excite grave anxiety.

As early as 350 the story went that Philip had sent an embassy to the king,^[108. Demosth., Phil. I., p. 54.] and it is definitely stated that he concluded a treaty with Ochus.^[109. Arrian, ii. 14, 2.] The pacific intentions of the Persians, at least for the moment, were no doubt sincere; not so those of Philip, who had to subdue Greece before he could put into execution his designs on Asia Minor, a circumstance overlooked by the honest but politically short-sighted Isocrates in his exhortation to Philip to attack Persia (347/346). Probably Demosthenes was not alone in perceiving that the safety of Greece now lay in an alliance with the Persians against Philip. Negotiations went on busily between Athens and the king, who at all events sent subsidies repeatedly for the conflict with Macedonia. In the year 340 Persia interfered actively by rescuing, in conjunction with Athens, the town of Perinthus on the Propontis (and therefore close to Persian territory), which was besieged by Philip; and the Macedonians could perhaps with some right assert that with this step the Avar betAveen the Persians and them had begun.^[110. Arrian, ii. 14, 5.] But the Persians did not see, what to us is obvious from the result, that it Avas necessary for them to prevent the subjugation of Greece ; or, if they saw it, they lacked the energy to act.

Artaxerxes probably did not reach the battle of Chaeronea (August 338), which made Philip master of Greece. So far as Ave can judge, however, it Avas a great misfortune for the empire that this king, the first since Darius I. Avho had in person energetically conducted a great expedition and restored the empire, died just at this critical moment. Probably he was murdered by Bagoas, who placed Arses, the youngest of the sons of Artaxerxes, on the throne.^[111. In Plut., De fork Alex., p. 336 sq., he is called Oarses. The Persian form of the name is not known.] But, Avhen Arses Avas preparing (so it is said) to punish Bagoas, the latter put him and his children to death (335). We knoAV nothing further of this king. Under his reign (spring 336) a Macedonian army first crossed into Asia, after Philip had previously caused himself to be nominated general of the Greeks against the Persians. The Macedonians gained some not unimportant successes, but the undertaking was checked in the very same year by the assassination of Philip. The commander Parmenio returned to Europe, and Memnon, av1io after Mentor’s death commanded in these regions, probably won back from the

Macedonians nearly all their conquests in Asia, though it is likely that Abydus, commanding the passage of the Hellespont, and perhaps one or two more strong places, remained in their hands.

In order to rule securely Bagoas placed on the throne, not a near relation of the murdered man,^[112. We read of a son of Ochus in 330 (Arrian, iii. 19, 4). We bad above a grandson of Artaxerxes II. Thus Bagoas had not killed all “the brothers” of Arses, and the king’s family was not extinct, as Diodorus asserts (xvii. 5).] but Codomannus,^[113. The name is given only by Justin (from Dinon), x. 3.] s who reigned as Darius (HL), a great-grandson of Darius II., and a man of about forty-five years of age.^[114. Arrian, iii. 22, 6.] But the king-maker was caught in his OAvn snare, for Darius soon put him out of the way.

Over the last of the Achaemenians misfortune has thrown a halo of romance, but sober criticism can see in him only an incapable despot like so many whom the East has produced. It may be true that in earlier life, under Artaxerxes III., he once proved his personal bravery in the war against the Cadusians, and was rewarded with the satrapy of Armenia;^[115. Justin, Z.c.; Diod., xvii. 6.] as a king he always behaved like a coward in the moment of danger. Vast attempts and a shameful flight, feeble or rather effeminate behaviour combined with braggart pride, lack of intelligence, especially in the conduct of war,—these are features which fully justify Grote in comparing him with Xerxes. It is no reproach that he Avas not a match for perhaps the greatest general in history, but an Ochus would doubtless have made the task a some-Avhat harder one, and would scarcely have been guilty of the folly of beheading, in a fit of bad temper, so useful a man as the old condottiere Charidemus, who thoroughly understood the mode of fighting the Macedonians.

The history of Alexander the Great is given under the articles Alexander the Great and Macedonian Empire; here we can only enumerate the chief steps in the downfall of the Persian empire. We see hoAv great is the force of cohesion in such an empire, even after all the shocks it has received, and under an incapable ruler. What the giant poAvers of Alexander achieved in a feAv years might never have been accomplished at all by the qualities and resources of an Agesilaus.

After placing a terrible curb on the Greek love of freedom by the destruction of Thebes, Alexander crossed the Hellespont in the beginning of spring 334. A feAV weeks later, on the Granicus, he annihilated the great Persian army which should have barred his onward march. Sardis, the capital, at once fell into his hands. Here, for the first time, we see the miserable spectacle of a high Persian officer going over to the enemy and surrendering to him the town or district committed by his king to his charge. At the beginning of winter the whole coast as far as PamphyliaAvas Alexander’s; Miletus and Halicarnassus Avere the only places which he had had seriously to besiege, and it Avas only the narroAvly-enclosed citadel of the latter town Avhich yet Avithstood all attacks. But there was still a great danger. The Rhodian Memnon, who had been joint-commander at the Granicus, undertook Avith all his might to kindle a conflagration in Alexander’s rear, and to force the king to cross over to Greece. The Persian fleet, which he commanded, ruled the sea; several of the most important islands Avere occupied; and from the Greek mainland thousands of patriots were looking for Memnon’s arrival in order tp rise against the Macedonians. But Memnon died suddenly. The death of this man, his only Avorthy adversary, is perhaps the greatest of those pieces of luck Avhich so highly favoured the great Alexander. His successor Pharnabazus, son of Artabazus, continued, it is true, the naval operations, but he was not able to carry out Memnon’s plans. MeanAvhile Alexander secured [9:18:582] the most important parts of Asia Minor, and then set out on his forward march. At the farthest extremity of Cilicia Darius in person met him at the head of a huge army, but the field of battle was so badly chosen that the numerical superiority of the Persians did not come into full play. The brilliant victory of Issus (about November 333) and the flight of Darius threw wide regions into the power of Alexander, who, with all his daring, was also cautious, and did not follow the Persian king in his flight into the interior. He sought first to make himself master of the whole Phoenician coast, in order to cut off from the Persians every possibility of annoying him any longer at sea. And in reality the fleet, which was chiefly furnished by the Phoenicians, melted away when Alexander had taken possession of their country. The Cyprian ships, too, returned home, and Cyprus also submitted. But Tyre withstood the great conqueror for seven months^[116. The resistance of the Tyrians is certainly not explained by their attachment to the Persians, scarcely either by their love of freedom. We suspect here again a religious motive. Alexander desired to offer sacrifice in the temple of Heracles, and probably the pious Canaanites would as little allow this as the Jews would have permitted any foreign ruler to enter their temple.] (332), and had to pay a dreadful penalty for its resistance. Gaza, too, defended itself bravely. Egypt welcomed exultingly the Macedonian who freed them from the hated Persians. After the acquisition of Egypt Alexander possessed a territory large and strong enough to be able to survive, if need be, a reverse. In the spring of 331 he left Egypt and marched through Syria and Mesopotamia to Assyria proper, where Darius awaited him at the head of vast masses of troops, and this time in a favourable position. But on 1st October 331 Alexander defeated the king at Gaugamela so decisively that henceforward the Persian empire, as such, was shattered. Darius fled to Media. Without striking another blow Alexander captured the capitals, Babylon and Susa, with their vast treasures. In vain the wild independent Uxians (better “Huxians”) barred a difficult mountain-pass against him, in vain did a Persian army do the same: he quickly forced a passage through the mountains and marched into Persia proper. Pasargadae and Persepolis, the cradle of the monarchy, were his.' Persepolis, in the immediate neighbourhood of which another conflict took place, was given up by him to his soldiers to plunder; the royal palace he caused to be burned.^[117. Cp. the article Persepolis.] In this act we discern, in opposition to the usual view, a well-considered measure, excellently calculated to work upon the Asiatic mind. The burning of the royal castle was meant to show the Asiatics that their empire was utterly overthrown, and that Alexander was their only lord. Besides the Greeks might see in the step an act of vengeance for the destruction of the Greek temples by Xerxes, as the official phrase ran.

Thereupon Alexander hastened to Media in pursuit, once for all, of Darius. The latter fled eastwards. He had still a considerable army with him, but only the Greek mercenaries were absolutely true to him, like the Swiss guard to Louis XVI. At last Bessus, satrap of Bactria (and Sogdiana apparently), seized the person of the king, in order either to make use of him for his own ambitious purposes or to put him out of the way. As a matter of fact, he murdered him in Parthia, just when the pursuing Alexander had nearly overtaken him (July or August 330). Such was the melancholy end of the last of the Achaemenian great kings.

Bessus thereupon hastened into his satrapy and assumed the title of king and the name of Artaxerxes (IV.). We know that he was a “kinsman” of Darius; perhaps in his case this means more than that he was merely connected with him by marriage, and this satrap of Bactria may have actually belonged to the race of the Achaemenians, like his predecessors the princes Masistes and Hystaspes. It would thus be more easy to explain why various grandees favoured his undertaking, and why he was recognized as king, e.g. i by the satrap of Aria (the district of Herát), and vigorously supported. That he enjoyed the royal title for some time is due only to the circumstance that Alexander first made himself securely master of eastern Iran before he marched into Bactria and Sogdiana. After many adventures Bessus fell into Alexander’s power on the farther side of the Oxus, and was put to death.

After the return from India the satrap of Media conducted in chains to Alexander a certain Baryaxes, who during Alexander’s absence had declared himself king of the Persians and Medes. Of course he was.executed. He is said to have been a Mede, not a Persian. Certainly his movement had never even a momentary importance; he is only once mentioned (Arrian, vi. 29, 3). But such last throes of a mighty monarchy are, after all, worthy of attention.

Literature.— Rawlinson, The Five Great Monarchies, vols, ii., iiî. (2d ed., London, 1871), gives a useful accouut·of the Medo-Persian history down to Alexander, as does also vol. ii. of Fr. Spiegel’s Erânische Alteτthumskunde (Leipsic, 1873). Neither work is exhaustive, and in both we frequently miss true historical criticism. For the time down to Xerxes Duncker’s Geschichte des Alterthums, vol.iv.(5th ed., Berlin, 1880; Eng. tr. by Abbot, 1877-83), is recommended by its very careful use of all the sources and its acute mode of combining them, though the latter quality often leads to somewhat arbitrary construction. Owing to the close contact between Persian and Greek history the larger works on the latter are obliged to cover much of the same ground as the former. In this department Grote ó ττάνυ is to be named above all; unfortunately at the time he wrote it was not in his power to make use of the important Persian inscriptions. (TH. N.)

After the decisive battle of Gaugamela (331 b.c.) Alexander proclaimed himself king of Asia.^[118. Plut., Alex., 34, 37, does not prove that there was another, still less a preferable account of the date of this occurrence.] He never accepted the compromise recommended by Parmenio, which would have left to the Persians the upper satrapies east of Mount Zagrus, and established a sharply-marked natural and ethnographic frontier. Soon a symbolic act, the burning of the palace of Persepolis, announced to the Asiatics that the Achaemenian monarchy was dead, and that Alexander claimed its whole inheritance. The punishment of Bessus, exactly modelled on that inflicted on pretenders by Darius I., showed that Alexander claimed to be the legal heir of the Achaemenians. Bessus’s ears and nose were cut off, and he was brought to Ecbatana for execution before the assembled Medes and Persians, for “this Bessus lied and said, I am Artaxerxes king of Persia.”

After Alexander had by his rapid and effective movements taken actual possession of the whole empire, Media was swiftly traversed, but the eastern frontier was not subdued and secured so easily. Crossing the mountainwall that separates the southern margin of the Caspian from the rest of Iran, Alexander received in person the homage of the coast-lands. Khorásán and the region of the Oxus were traversed by his armies in all directions; from Bactria the march was obliquely through Sogdiana to the Jaxartes on the farthest limits of the empire, and an onslaught was even made on the Scythians beyond that river.^[119. Here perhaps occurs the first trace in history of the Turkish race. Carthasis, the brother of the Scythian king in Curtius (vii. 7, 1), may be, asNöldeke observes, Turkish kardãshy, “his brother,” from dãsh, of which tâsh is the older form.] Alexander was determined to secure a frontier so important for the trade of Central Asia, and to free the peaceful industry of Iran from the incursions of its hereditary[9:18:583] enemies the Turanian nomads. Prestige rather than material advantage was gained by the rapid fall of the supposed impregnable rocky nests of Arimazes in Sogdiana, of Chorienes or Sisimithres in the mountain region of the upper Oxus,^[120. The last two places are identical. All the sources know only two fortresses taken by Alexander in these regions: those which mention Sisimithres omit Chorienes and vice versa ; and the essential points are the same in Arrian (iv. 21) and Curtins (viii. 2, 19-33).] and, above all, of the Indian fortress Aornus. Though usually clement to the conquered, Alexander was terrible to those who rose against him—to the Arians, for example, and to the strong cities that headed the insurrection in Sogdiana; when the movement was crushed, he laid the land waste far and wide and slew all the males; 120,000 Sogdians are said to have thus lost their lives. Alexander too, like Caesar, did not shrink from a breach of faith if it served his purpose; this was seen in the massacre of the Indian mercenaries who had defended Massaga, which was meant to spread terror before him as he entered India.^[121. Diod., xvii. 84. The official Macedonian account in Arrian (iv. 27) ignores the treachery.] The Achaemenian power at its climax had never crossed the Indus; Alexander passed the river and pushed into India proper. This adventurous march was undertaken wholly for the sake of prestige, and was specially meant to impress the imagination of the Greeks, to whom India was a land of marvels. Alexander proposed to reach the Ganges and the ends of the habitable earth; and it was sorely against his will that his own soldiers forced him to confine his plans to the rational scope of securing the Indus as his frontier and adding to his realm its commercially important delta.^[122. As the Greeks then knew India only from Ctesias, whose geography is of the vaguest, Alexander probably under-estimated the vast size of the peninsula.] Alexander had now accomplished what, in the eyes of the Arian peoples, was necessary to give the last stamp of legitimacy to the new empire; he had led his armies round all the frontiers and taken personal possession of his lands. To close the circle he had still to march back through Gedrosia and Carmania. But it may well be doubted if he would have faced this last exploit had he known beforehand the full terrors of the burning desert; not a fourth part of the forces that began the march from India survived a journey which has been fitly compared λvith the retreat from Moscow.

A series of minor expeditions completed the work of the great campaigns by reducing a number of mountain tribes, which had shaken off the weak yoke of the Achaemenians, exacted tribute at the chief passes, and in their irreclaimable savage habits of plunder were like the modern Kurds, the born foes of the Iranian peasant. Such were the Uxians, the Mardians in Persis, and the people of the same name to the south of the Caspian, and finally the Cossaeans, whom Alexander disposed of in his last campaign in forty mid-winter days. The future obedience of these brigands was secured by planting fortresses at the most difficult points of the roads, and they were compelled to settle down and take to husbandry.^[123. Arrian, Ind., 40, 8.]

These vast results were only obtained by the aid of continual fresh levies in Europe, and strong garrisons had to be left in the conquered lands. Alexander’s work could not last unless the European occupation became permanent; and therefore he planned a great network of new cities, in which colonies of Greek or Macedonian soldiers were planted. According to Plutarch (De Alex.fort., i. 5, p. 328 F) more than seventy cities owed their origin to Alexander; some forty of these can still be traced.^[124. See the careful enumeration in Droysen, Gesch. d. Hellenismus, 2d ed., vol. iii. pt. 2, p. 187 sq.] In Media, in the Cossaean neighbourhood, and in Carmania we know only two by name, though we are told that in the first two districts there were really a large number of such towns, seemingly inconsiderable places. In the east of Iran the settlements were more important, and twenty-six can be enumerated in Aria, the country of the Paropanisus, Bactria, Sogdiana, India, and the land of the Oritae,— Bactria and Sogdiana alone claiming eight of these.^[125. Strabo, xi. p. 517. Alexandria on the Tanais and twelve other towns are spoken of by Justin (xii. 5, 16), but xii. is perhaps a corruption of vii.] The composition of these settlements is illustrated by the details given for Alexandria in the Indian Caucasus; according to Diodorus, the city and one or more minor settlements within a day’s journey of it received 7000 barbarians, 3000 camp-followers, and as many of the mercenaries as volunteered to stay; but Curtius, who certainly reproduces the common source more accurately than Diodorus, names 7000 Macedonian veterans and a number of mercenaries whose engagement had expired. The Greek element in this colony must have been large, for the town still keeps its Greek name (Alasadda) in an Indian book of the 4th century a.d. Alexandria on the Tanais (Jaxartes), again, was partly peopled by Sogdian insurgents, forcibly transplanted from their homes, which the conqueror had destroyed. Some of Alexander’s last orders refer to the founding of cities and the transplanting of Europeans to Asia and Asiatics to Europe, a measure designed to promote the assimilation of all parts of the empire. Macedonia alone did not suffice for this gigantic scheme of colonization, and it was chiefly Greeks who were planted in the most eastern satrapies, in Bactria and Sogdiana. At such a distance from home the Greeks could have no other interest than loyalty to Macedon; it was the same policy as dictated to the Romans the establishment of Latin colonies in their new conquests. But the antagonism between Greeks and Macedonians was too great to allow the former to forget that they were, after all, really men deported by the great king (άνάσπαστοι) ; and so even from the first there were seeds of discord between them and the rest of the empire.

Alexander’s capital was Babylon, the natural centre of an empire that embraced both Iran and the West, and recommended also by its command of the great lines of international traffic, and by its historical traditions of empire. The Achaemenian system of satrapies was retained; kingships were left only in the exceptional case of India.^[126. Oxyartes is sometimes called king by a mere inaccuracy. Dexippus, ap. Phot., cod. 82, p. 64, b. xxii. (Bekker), makes Alexander give Oropius the ∑οyδιavωv βασιλείαν. The geographical order, and the fact that Sogdiana has been mentioned before, demand the correction ∑ουσιavωv, and for κotvωs we must read κdivοs ; see Justin, xiii. 4, 14. Oropius was the successor of Abulites. The province seems to have been officially designated a kingdom, but that does not make its governor a king.] The satrapies of the upper country seem to have been fourteen: Persis, Paraetacene, Carmania, Media, Tapuria with the Mardian country, Parthia with Hyrcania, Bactria, Aria with Drangiana, Gedrosia with the Oritae,^[127. This province was perhaps formed by Alexander; it was afterwards joined to Arachosia.] Arachosia, the Paropanisus country (which probably was quite independent under the later Achaemenians, and was first placed under a satrap by Alexander), India on this side the Indus, India beyond the Indus (from the Bactrian frontier to the confluence of the Indus and the Acesines), and beyond this the province of the lower Indus extending to the sea. The last three satrapies were also new. Alexander retained the old satraps of Darius in three provinces; in Paraetacene and Tapuria it would have been impossible to drive the old rulers from their mountains without a tedious campaign, and in Aria Satibarzanes was confirmed in his post to detach him from Bessus. But in all three [9:18:584] cases the old satraps were superseded on the first opportunity. Most new appointments, however, were given to Persians; at first there were Macedonian satraps only in rebellious Arachosia, Gedrosia, and the three new Indian provinces. This policy helped the subjects to fall in with the new rule; but on second appointments Macedonians generally took the place of Persians, and at Alexander’s death there were Persians only in Media (from which Atropates, as the sequel proved, could not have been removed without a fight), in Parthia, and in the Paropanisus, which was held by Alexander’s father-in-law. The power of the satraps was considerably reduced; in Parthia, Aria, and the Paropanisus there seems to have always been a Macedonian resident (eπιaκoπoς) beside the satrap, with the control of the military. Indeed in all the provinces the command of the forces seems to have been separated from the office of satrap, though it was not always entrusted to a single officer. The satraps also lost the right to engage mercenaries and to coin; and in the western countries, of which we know most, a single officer —always a Macedonian—was sometimes charged with the tribute of several provinces. Perfect order and an exact definition of the functions of every officer could not be attained from the very first; yet even in this period of transition the finances of the empire improved. At Alexander’s death 50,000 talents (=£11,288,515) lay in the treasury, and the annual tribute was 30,000 talents, or six and three-quarters millions sterling. What was of more consequence, the treasures of the East were no longer hoarded in the old Oriental fashion, but put in circulation and applied to a number of great and useful enterprises. Such were the exploration of the course and mouths of the Indus; the voyage of Nearchus, which opened the searoad between the Indus and the Euphrates; the restoration of the trade of Babylon by removing the weirs which obstructed navigation, and by works on the canals and the Pallacopas; the attempt to discover a sea-way round Arabia, in which Hiero of Soli explored the east coast of the peninsula; and the commission given to Heraclides for exploration of the Caspian.

Alexander sought to assure the permanence of the empire by fusing Greeks and Persians into one mass. Thirty thousand Persians, the so-called eπιγoνoι, were armed and disciplined like Macedonians, and Persians were received on equal footing in the Macedonian corps and even, to the disgust of the Macedonian nobles, in the corps d'élite of the cavalry, in which the latter served. Macedonia, in truth, was not populous enough to keep the cadres full. Alexander adopted the regal robes of Persia and the regal state. The court was served by eunuchs, and men kissed the ground before the great king. It was a strange sight for Hellenes when a poor wretch from Messene was ordered to execution because he had inadvertently sat on the kingly throne.^[128. Plut., Alex., 73.]

To the Greeks a union with a barbarian was no regular marriage; but the Bactrian Roxana was Alexander’s queen. His friends were urged to follow his example; eighty of his courtiers married Persians on the occasion of the great wedding at Susa, and 10,000 soldiers who had chosen Asiatic wives received gifts on the occasion. Still more startling was the introduction of polygamy; the king took a second wife, Statira, daughter of Darius, and a third, Parysatis, daughter of Ochus.

All this was Persian fashion; but when Alexander claimed divine honours as the son of Jupiter Ammon he asked both Persians and Macedonians to adopt from the Egyptians the most perfect model of devout submission to their sovereign. Could this compound of nationalities prove more than a kingdom of iron and clav 1 The answer lay in the attitude of that part of its subjects which still retained a vigorous life. The western nations, long schooled to slavery, were passive under the change of rule. The Persians, too, and all western Iran acquiesced after the first conflict was decided. In the east it was not so. Here the northern province of Chorasmia had been independent of the later Achaemenians, and its kings had ruled the great plains as far as the north-east slopes of the Caucasus.^[129. So in the Middle Ages Khárezm and Kipchak stood under the same sovereign, and were not included in the realm of Jagatai.] Bactria, Sogdiana, Aria, Arachosia, Drangiana, and the borderlands towards India had obeyed Persian satraps, but Bessus and his partisans did not forfeit their allegiance by the murder of Darius. These eastern Iranians, who had no close connexion with Persia, opposed the most obstinate resistance to the conqueror: the Arians rose again and again; and an energetic chief like Spitamenes could always stir up a party in Sogdiana. These risings began in the castles of the numerous chieftains (ύπαρχοι), but it was a national spirit that made them so obstinate and bloody; the Iranians of Sogdiana and Bactria had acquired in their constant wars with the Turanians a sense of self-respect which the effeminate Medes and Persians wanted. Their situation, too, favoured their resistance; for their ancient enemies in the desert had a common interest with them in opposing a strong central government, and were easily persuaded to lend them succour or shelter. Sacae and Dahae fought for Bessus, and Spitamenes found refuge with the Massagetae; the wilderness offered a retreat where regular troops could not follow, and from which a petty warfare could always be renewed. In India the Bráhmans had been the soul of a still more vigorous resistance; they preached revolt to the rajahs of the lower Indus, and were the object of Alexander’s special severity. Eastern Iran was the cradle and always remained the chief support of Zoroastrianism,^[130. Sisimithres’s wife was his own mother, a union which the Aυesiα specially approves.] and religion must have had its part in the patriotic resistance of Bactria and Sogdiana. Alexander forbade the practice of throwing the dying to the dogs (Onesicritus, ap. Strabo, xi. p. 517), which the Bactrians certainly took from the Λvestα ; and this was just the kind of decree which drives an Oriental people to desperation. The Macedonians did pay some attention to Iranian thought; a magian Osthanes is said to have been in the train of Alexander, and Theopompus, a contemporary of the conqueror, shows the first traces of acquaintance with the A vesta. The Persian tradition that Alexander burned the twenty-one nosks of the original A vesta, and that only one part of the holy book was subsequently recovered from memory, is of course not historical, but it rests on a very true feeling that the new order of things was at irreconcilable war with the old faith.^[131. See Spiegel, Z. D. Μ. G., ix. 174.]

Alexander desired to fuse the Greeks and barbarians together, but the practical means directed to this ideal aim were such as brought him into conflict with the natural leaders of the new state. By asking the Greeks as well as the barbarians to worship him as divine he destroyed the whole effect of the theatrical arts in which he was a master, and by which he hoped to recommend his mission as an eminently Hellenic one to the masses; even Callisthenes, the enthusiastic herald of the new era, was bitterly undeceived, and, turning against Alexander, fell a victim to the despotism of the man who had been his idol. But, what was still more fatal, the net result of his efforts at a fusion of races was not to Hellenize the Persians but to teach the Macedonians to exchange their old virtues for the effeminacy and vices of the East. It is not fair to say that if the Macedonians had possessed a riper civilization they [9:18:585] might have resisted the foreign influence; their numbers were too small, and Alexander pushed his plans too hastily and with too exclusive regard to surface-effect, to make any other issue possible. Nay, Alexander wished to have it so, and there was no surer path to his favour than to' wear a Persian coat and talk broken Persian like the scheming Peucestas. Alexander liked Oriental splendour and the Oriental ceremony which placed an infinite distance between the king and his highest subjects; great statesmen generally love to be absolute, and Alexander enjoyed Oriental despotism and mechanical obedience much more than councils of state and discussions of policy with the Macedonian soldier-nobility, whose sturdy independence was always asserting itself, and whose kings, unless in virtue of great personal qualities, had never been more than primi inter pares. Then, too, Alexander, in the splendour and magnitude of his conquests, lost touch of the movements that were going on at home. The true task of Macedonia in the world’s history was to unite Greece under its hegemony,—a task clearly marked out, and one which Philip had pursued with masterly skill. But the completion of this task called for a modest and unsensational line of action quite foreign to Alexander’s spirit; Antipater’s hard-won victory at Megalopolis, but for which his father’s work would have fallen to pieces behind him, was received with a characteristic sneer on the war of mice which seemed to be going on in Arcadia.^[132. Plut., Agesil., 15.] Philip’s old generals judged otherwise and judged better; it was not blindness to the conqueror’s genius, but a just perception of what was practicable and desirable, and an instinctive dread of the unknown issues of the king’s plans, which gradually estranged from him his truest councillors; and it was an evil sign that his only close friend was a poor creature like Hephaestion, who could not boast of a single service. Then came the first conspiracy and the murder of the aged Parmenio, whose son Philotas was mixed up with it,— a crime to which Alexander was led simply through fear. The wild extravagances of grief that marked the death of Hephaestion, and of which a pyre worth two and a half millions sterling was the least, show how Alexander lost himself more and more as he broke with the Macedonian character. His last orders, cancelled at his death by Perdiccas, included an invasion of Carthage by land and sea, with a further view to Spain, and the erection to King Philip of a tomb surpassing the Great Pyramid. The extravagance of these plans was as palpable to the Macedonian soldiery as to their leaders, and they too shared the growing alienation from the monarch. There were mutinies as well as conspiracies; the soldiers were tired of following from adventure to adventure, and at the Hyphasis they had their way. In his later days Alexander was repeatedly wounded, a fact significant of a change in the spirit of the troops, for no great general would expose himself as Alexander did—for example, in storming the city of the Malli—unless his men required this stimulus.

The want of coherence in the empire was seen even while Alexander was in India. Many satraps broke all restraint, renewed the old oppressions of the Persian time, hired mercenaries again, and only awaited a fit moment for open rebellion; the generals of the army that lay in Media committed sacrilege and crimes of every kind; the treasurer Harpalus violated his trust and escaped with his plunder. Alexander, on his return, soon restored order with terrible severity, but the ferment was still at work, especially in the west, and was increased through the disbanded mercenaries of the satraps who returned to the coast. There is one event of the time of anarchy when Alexander was in India which, though passed over in the official sources of Arrian, deserves special notice as a pre lude of what was to come (326 b.c.). The Greeks settled in Bactria and Sogdiana rose against the Macedonians on a false rumour of Alexander’s death. Three thousand of them seized the citadel of Bactra, gained the support of the natives, and, crowning their leader Athenodorus, proposed to make their way home. Athenodorus was assassinated, but his followers remained unmolested, and joined the mass of their countrymen in the general rising of the Greek military stations after Alexander’s death.

One Macedonian custom Alexander had retained, that of carousing with his generals. A series of debauches in the malarious climate of Babylon brought on a violent fever, which ended in his death (13jh June 323).^[133. The exact date in our calendar, which cannot be calculated from the Macedonian date 27 or 29 Daesius, is found by the aid of Pseudo-Callisthenes (Cod. A in C. Müller’s ed., p. 151; Arm. Tr. in Zacher, Pseudo -Cad., p. 100).] The object of his life, the fusion of Macedonians and Persians, was not attained. The Persians still felt themselves subject to a foreign power, and in eastern Iran this feeling was bitter. The Macedonians again had been carried by Alexander’s genius far out of their true path of development into a giddy career, in which a capable and valiant nation found its ruin. Alexander did not die too soon, if he was not to see the collapse of his work.

Terrible civil wars broke out at once on Alexander’s death, and lasted almost unbroken for forty-two years, tearing his work to pieces, and scattering to the winds Macedonia’s claims to universal empire. There was no legitimate heir, but the name of “king” was borne by Philip (323-317), a bastard of the elder Philip, and by Alexander II., Alexander’s posthumous son by Roxana (323-311). The real power lay at first with Perdiccas, who as regent governed the whole empire from Babylon, and, after Perdiccas was killed in a mutiny in the Egyptian campaign of 321, passed for the moment to Pitho and Arrhidaeus, till in the same year the regency fell to Antipater. As he ruled from Macedonia, the eastern satrapies were pretty much left to themselves, but Pitho, who held the chief of these —that of Media—took the first place, and soon appears as strategus of all the upper satrapies. But his ambition united the satraps against him, and he was driven not only out of Parthia, which he had occupied after murdering the satrap Philip, but out of Media too. The satraps now joined hands with Eumenes and placed themselves under his leadership when he came to Susa in 316 as the king’s strategus at the head of the argyraspids. Pitho had meantime fled to Seleucus, satrap of Babylon, and with him sought help from Eumenes’s great enemy, Antigonus. A war in Media and Susiana ensued, and Eumenes, whose military successes were constantly frustrated by disobedience and treason in his followers, was betrayed to Antigonus and put to death in 315. Antigonus, already furnished with a commission as strategus from Antipater, now lorded it over all. Pitho, still greedy of power, and thinking of conspiracies to recover it, was executed; the Persian satrap, Peucestas, who had led the allies against Pitho, was superseded, and Seleucus fled to Ptolemy. Soon, however, the other potentates united against the threatening power of Antigonus, and in the war that followed Seleucus, with some help from Ptolemy’s soldiers, repossessed himself of his satrapy of Babylon,—an important event, which forms the epoch of the Seleucid era (1 Sei. = 312/311 b.c.). Presently a victory over Nicanor, who held Media for Antigonus, made Seleucus master of Media and the adjoining provinces. Antigonus had still some temporary successes, but at the end of the war Seleucus was acknowledged lord of Babylonia and the upper satrapies.

In these conflicts we can distinguish two main interests, represented by the cavalry and the infantry, or, what is [9:18:586] the same thing, by the higher and lower nobility respectively/ The former fought for the unity of the realm of Alexander, the latter for the national traditions of Macedon. In the first years the mass of the army made its wishes very distinctly felt, e.g., in the rising against Perdiccas; even the esprit de corps of a single body like the argyraspids had often a decisive influence on general politics. The fall of Perdiccas was really the end of the Perso-Macedonian empire founded by Alexander, as was made manifest by the fact that Babylon ceased to be the capital, and Antipater with the kings passed into Europe. On the ruin of Alexander’s political structure the ruin of his house directly followed; all the political and military talent of Eumenes, its one sincere defender, could not avert the catastrophe, for Eumenes, who as a Greek was always looked on with suspicion, soon fell a victim to Macedonian jealousy. With him the kingship really came to an end, though the empty name of it lasted a little longer. The later conflicts have a different character; a certain number of leaders had risen gradually above the mass of the officers, attaching to their parties the less prominent men, and it was the conflicting interests of these leaders which were now represented in politics and war. Last of all, the particular interests of the subject provinces came to find expression in the conflicts of their chiefs, and the signal was given for the formation of distinct kingdoms. In the wild struggles for supremacy the last remains of Macedonian loyalty disappeared; when we are told that the strategi and satraps of the upper provinces were still faithful to the royal house, and that Antigonus, as late as 315, counted on it in making Avar against Cassander, the loyalty can hardly be regarded as a genuine sentiment, but was merely a cover for the pride of chieftains who were willing to acknowledge a distant and merely nominal sovereign, but not to obey men who had lately been their equals. And in truth the sentiments of the upper satrapies were of little consequence. The power to give them effectual expression was lacking, and these lands, till much later, received all their political impulses from the west.

To make up for this, Iran was little touched by the civil wars; only Media and Parthia were seats of Avar, and that for a short time. Among the satraps Peucestas of Persia, Tlepolemus of Carmania, and Stasanor of Bactria are represented as good rulers, beloved by the natives; Avhen Antigonus deposed Peucestas, a Persian notable told him to his face that the Persians Avould obey no one else, and lost his life for his frankness. Antigonus’s realm was less than Alexander’s by Egypt, Syria, Thrace, and Macedonia, and the tribute from it Avas 11,000 talents (tAvo and a half millions sterling). The ordinary taxes, therefore, had not been raised; but Antigonus raised special wartaxes also, 5000 talents at one time in Susiana and as much in Media.

The list of satrapies at this period is known from the records of the partitions of Babylon (323), Triparadisus (321), and Persepolis (315). There were twelve upper satrapies, Persis, Carmania, Great Media, Lesser Media, Parthia with Hyrcania, Bactria with Sogdiana, Aria Avith Drangiana, Arachosia with Gedrosia, the Paropanisadae, India from the Paropanisadae to the Indus, India between the Indus and Hydaspes, India on the lower Indus with Pattala. Of Alexander’s satrapies we miss Paraetacene, included in Persis, and Tapuria, which Alexander himself seems to have joined to Parthia. The only new satrapy is Lesser Media. It Avas thought proper to Elace Media, the most important Iranian province, in the surer ands of the Macedonian Pitho, son of Crateuas, but the north-west part of the province was left to the old satrap Atropates, whom Alexander had sent to Media in 328. He was father-in-laιv of Perdiccas, and so claimed consideration, but probably he could not have been displaced if it had been tried.^[134. On Atropates see Arrian, iv. 18, 3, and Pseudo-Cal. in C. Müller, p. 149, where after ↑leυκtστy read Άτραπάτην ’Οξυδάτην μeτaστrjσaι άπδ τηs M77δiαs. His connexions in north-east Media are illustrated by the fact that he had with him at Gaugamela Cadusians, Albanians, and Sacesinae.] At the new division on the death of Perdiccas (321) Pitho was confirmed in Media as far as the Caspian Gates, but nothing is said of Lesser Media, which was really no longer part of the empire. Thus Atropates was the founder of a small separate kingdom, which thenceforth continued to bear his name, in Greek Atropatene, in Arabic and Persian Adharbaiján, and in Armenian (more nearly conformed to the original) Atrpatakan. It was never a very important state, but is worth notice as the first new native realm within the empire of Alexander and the first symptom of the Iranian reaction against Hellenism.^[135. The hypothesis that Atropatene was an important place as a refuge for the fire-worshippers has no other basis than a false etymology, Adharbaijan= Fireland. It became important politically only in the later Middle Ages, when it was the gateway of the Turkish migration westward and received a Turkish population.]

Except in the case of Media the partition of Babylon made no change in the holders of the upper satrapies. So we are expressly told (Curt., x. 10, 4, and Just., xiii. 4, 19, where for ulteriore read ulteriusque), and the apparent exceptions to the principle are perhaps merely due to our ignorance of previous changes. The most remarkable of these is that Pitho, son of Agenor, av1io under Alexandeι - shared with a Persian the satrapy of the lower Indus, is now found in India Citerior in room of Nicanor, while his old satrapy has fallen to no other than King Porus.^[136. This is certain from Arrian, ap. Phot., cod. 92, p. 71, b. xl. (Bekker), where Pattala is said to have obeyed Porus.] We may be sure that the Macedonians sanctioned this extension of the power of the Indian king only because they could not help it, and it is probable that Porus had usurped the province in the troubles that broke out in India as soon as Alexander left it in 326 (Arr., vi. 27, 2). Thus one more province was now only nominally attached to the empire. Porus, indeed, Avas assassinated through Macedonian intrigue between 321 and 315, but the country never again came permanently under their power.

The partition of 321 was less conservative. Nicanor was removed from Aria to Bactria, and Philip from Bactria to Parthia, superseding Phrataphernes. These changes had probably some connexion with the rising of the Greeks in Bactria and Sogdiana after Alexander’s death. No Persian satraps now remained except Atropates and Oxyartes, av1io had connexions by marriage with the conquerors. Antigonus, to please the natives, changed this policy, and even put the Mede Orontobates in the great province of Media, but he returned at the same time to Alexander’s policy of limiting the satraps’ power. We hear nothing of strategi in the satrapies from 321 to 315, so it is probable that Perdiccas and life immediate successors had allowed the satraps to hold also the military command in their provinces. Antigonus again appointed strategi, Avho were always Macedonians.

In a time of civil war it is not surprising that the old disorders of the Achaemenian period reappeared. During the Avars of Eumenes and Antigonus the Uxians and Cossaeans again appear as independent, and as plundering travellers. But a much more serious outbreak was that of the Greek settlers in the north-east against the Macedonians. On the news of Alexander’s death in 323 the military colonies rose under Philo, the Aenian, and with 20,000 foot and 3000 horse attempted to fight their way home. They Avere met by Pitho, governor of Media, and defeated by an inferior force through the treachery of one of their chiefs. Pitho granted them terms if they Avould lay down their arms and return home, but the Macedonians refused to respect the convention; they knew Perdiccas had ordered the extermination of the rebels, and, falling on the disarmed foe, they massacred them and divided their spoil.

Such a catastrophe could not fail to embitter the relations betAveen eastern and western Iran, betAveen Greeks and Macedonians. It is hardly accidental that the only notice Ave have as to how Seleucus Nicator (reigned 312- 280) came into possession of the upper satrapies is that he subdued Bactria by force of arms. To his Asiatic subjects Seleucus appeared as a king from the first; officially, and among the Greeks, he received this title only in 306. His first care was directed to India, where, probably during the wars of Eumenes and Antigonus, the Macedonian officials had been slain and obedience transferred to Chandragupta, founder of the Maurya kingdom. Seleucus crossed the Indus, but Chandragupta obtained peace on favourable terms, giving Seleucus five hundred warelephants, but increasing his dominions by the parts of the Paropanisadae, Arachosia, and Gedrosia that lay tθAvards [9:18:587] the Indus. The kings swore to this treaty and became lasting allies.

Instead of the twenty-one Asiatic satrapies of the partitions Seleucus divided his empire into seventy-two, thus diminishing the dangerous strength of the individual governors. But the old arrangement was restored later, and at the beginning of the reign of Antiochus III. we find Media, Persia, Susiana, and the district of the Erythraean Sea (separated off from Babylonia) standing each under one head (Polyb., v. 40-54). Apparently an eparch came to be appointed with military command over all the sections of each old satrapy, and gradually drew to himself all the functions of the satraps in the old régime, so that he could be spoken of indifferently as satrap or strategus.

Seleucus had built for himself a new capital, Seleucia on the Tigris, but in process of time his chief attention came to be more and more engrossed by the affairs of the west, and the seat of power was shifted to Antioch in Syria. A kingdom like that of Seleucus could hardly be governed from Syria, which lay so far from its natural centre, and about 293 or a little later Seleucus found it advisable to make over the upper satrapies to Antiochus, his son by his first marriage with Aparna, daughter of Sρitamenes, giving him Seleucia as his capital and his stepmother Stratonice as wife. Seleucus, like Antigonus, dreamed of regaining the whole monarchy of Alexander, and fancied himself within reach of his goal after the fall of Lysimachus, when he was himself removed by assassination. Antiochus Soter (280-261) was prudent enough to be content with what he possessed and acquiesce in the actual division of the empire into three realms, practically corresponding to the three continents.

No one had been so zealous as Seleucus in extending Alexander’s schemes of colonization; he is said to have founded seventy-five cities. Among such of these as we know an unusual proportion lies in Media—the breast of Iran, as the Orientals call it—where it was doubly important to strengthen the Macedonian element. A Greek settlement in Ecbatana and the cities of Laodicea, Apamea near Rhagae, and Europus were his foundations; Alexandria Eschata, in the extreme north-east, was strengthened by new recruits; and even beyond this city, as *it seems, in the land of the Scythians, an Antioch was founded. These last undertakings probably came after the association in the empire of Antiochus, who, through his grandfather Spitamenes, had special reasons for interest in these parts. It was then that Demodamas crossed the Jaxartes and raised altars beyond it to the Apollo of Didyma, the patron god of the dynasty. Then, too, Alexander’s plan of exploring the Caspian was resumed; the admiral Patrocles made a voyage of discovery, and got only just far enough to be confirmed in the false notion of a north-east passage to India,—probably, therefore, to the extremity of the peninsula of Mangishlak. It was seen, on the other hand, that the Caspian was not connected with the Maeotis; but Seleucus shortly before his death still entertained a plan for a canal from the Caspian to the Cimmerian Bosphorus. Antiochus carried on his father’s work of founding cities, and built Laodicea in the east of Persis; but he gave more attention to eastern Iran. A wall of 1500 stadia (about 172 miles) was carried round the oasis of Merv, and there, at the confluence of the Margus and the Zothales, the ruined city Syriana was rebuilt as Antioch, with a circuit of 8 miles. In Aria Antiochus Soter founded Sotira, his general Achaeus Achaia; the older chief towns Artacabane and Alexandria on the Arius received new walls, the latter with a circuit of from 3 to 6 miles. Alexandropolis in Arachosia had been similarly strengthened by Seleucus. With all these efforts, however, Hellenism made no such deep impression on Iran as on the west, nor did the loosely-jointed empire attain to anything higher than a Hellenistic reproduction of the kingdom of the Achaemenians. Even in the fragmentary records that we possess we hear from the first of rebellions little favourable to consolidation of the realm; Seleucus, like Alexander, still had an army of Macedonians and Persians together, while the later Seleucids, at least in their western wars, used natives sparingly and only as bowmen, slingers, or the like, and preferred for these services the wild desert and mountain tribes of Iran.^[137. See the accounts of the army of Antiochus III. in Polyb., v. 79, and Livy, xxxvii. 40.] Of the Persian troops of Seleucus we read that 3000 rebelled, and were mastered and destroyed only by treachery; another and seemingly connected story speaks of a rising of 3000 Macedonians (Polyaenus, vii. 39, 40). Antiochus himself executed his eldest son, Seleucus, on suspicion of conspiracy against his life; the heir of the kingdom was his second son, Antiochus II. Theos (261-246), a drunken and dissolute prince, who neglected his realm in the society of unworthy favourites.

This king is mentioned in a remarkable contemporary Indian inscription. The Seleucids were constant allies of the great Maurya (Magadha) kingdom. Between 311 and 302 Megasthenes repeatedly went as ambassador from Seleucus to Chandragupta, and Daimachus went in like manner from Antiochus to the court of Chandragupta’s successor, Ami-tragháta (280-276). The next king, Asoka, became a Buddhist about 263. He then founded hospitals for men and beasts throughout his realm, planted places where nothing had grown before, and provided wells and grew trees along the roads for the refreshment of man and beast. Further, he tells us, he caused his example in these things to be followed by his neighbours, whether southern or western. Among the latter Antiochus, king of the Greeks, has the first place.

Under the weak Antiochus II. north-eastern Iran was lost to the empire. While the Seleucids were busy elsewhere, probably in the long war with Ptolemy Philadelphus, which occupied Antiochus’s later years, Diodotus, viceroy of Bactria, took the title of king. The new kingdom included Sogdiana and Margiana from the first, while the rest of the East, with a single exception scarcely noticed at the time, adhered to the Seleucids.^[138. Justin, xli. 4, 5, exaggerates rhetorically, on the basis of some such expression as that used by Strabo, in speaking of the event.] Now the formation of a strong local kingdom, heartily supported by the Greek colonies, and likely to control the neighbouring nomads and protect its own frontiers with strictness, was by no means agreeable to the chiefs of the desert tribes who, like the modern Turcomans, had been wont to pillage the settled lands, and raise blackmail with little hindrance from the weak and distant central authority at Antioch.^[139. These brigands had destroyed two of Alexander’s cities, Alexandria in Margiana and Heraclea in Media, before the time of Antiochus I.; Pliny, N. H., vi. 47, 48.] Accordingly two brothers, Arsaces and Tiridates, whose tribe, the Parnians, a subdivision of the Dahae, had hitherto pastured their flocks in Bactria, on the banks of the Ochus, moved west into Seleucid territory near Parthia. An insult offered to the younger brother by the satrap Pherecles moved them to revolt; Pherecles was slain, and Parthia freed from the Macedonians. Arsaces was then proclaimed first king of Parthia (250 b.c.). Such is the later official tradition, and we possess no other account of the beginnings of the Arsacid dynasty. But when the official account transforms Arsaces, who, according to genuine tradition, was the leader of a robber horde and of uncertain descent, into a Bactrian, the descendant of Phriapites, son of Artaxerxes II. (who was called Arsaces before his accession), and makes him conspire with his brother and five others, like the seven [9:18:588] who slew the false Smerdis, we detect the inventions of a period when the Arsacids had entered on the inheritance of the Achaemenians, and imitated the order of their court. The seven conspirators are the heads of the seven leading noble houses to whom, beyond doubt, the Karen, the Suren, and the Aspahapet belonged.^[140. Moses of.Chorene (it 28) knows only these three lines besides the Arsacids. Other Armenian historians, however (Langlois, i. 109, 199), know four lines of Arsacids which may have taken the place of lost families.] And further, genuine tradition does not know the first Arsaces as king of Parthia at all, and as late as 105 b.c. the Parthians themselves reckoned the year (autumn) 248/247 as the first of their empire.^[141. See the cuneiform tablet in G. Smith, Assyrian Discoveries, p. 389, which agrees with Euseb., Chron., p. 299 (Aucher).] But 248 is the year in which Arsaces I. is said to have been killed, after a reign of two years, and succeeded by his brother, who, like all subsequent kings of the line, took the throne-name of Arsaces. The first Arsaces must have existed, for he appears as deified on the reverse of his brother’s drachmae, but he was not king of Parthia. Nay, we have authentic record that even in the epoch-year 218/247, the year of the accession of Tiridates, Parthia was still under the Seleucids. These contradictions are solved by a notice of Isidore of Charax (Geog. Gr. Min., i. 251), which names a city Asaak, not in Parthia, but north-west from it, in the neighbouring Astauene, where Arsaces was proclaimed king, and where an everlasting fire was kept burning. This, therefore, was the first seat of the monarchy, and Pherecles was presumably satrap of Astauene, not eparch of Parthia.

The times were not favourable for the reduction of the rebels. When Antiochus II. died, the horrors that accompanied the succession of his son Seleucus II. Callinicus (246-226) gave the king of Egypt the pretext for a war, in which he overran almost the whole lands of the Seleucids as far as Bactria. Meantime a civil war was raging between Seleucus and his brother Antiochus Hierax, for whom the Galatians held, and at the great battle of Ancyra in 242 or 241 Seleucus was totally defeated and thought to be slain. At this news Arsaces Tiridates, whom the genuine tradition still represents as a brave robber-chief, broke into Parthia at the head of his Parnians, slew the Macedonian eparch Andragoras, and took possession of the province.^[142. Justin, xli. 4, 2. What is said of Andragoras in xii. 4, 12, rests on a slip of the memory.] These Parnian Dahae were a branch of the Dahae who lived beyond the Sir Darya and the Sea of Aral (the Tanais and Maeotis of Strabo, xi. p. 515, and Curt., vi. 2, 13, 14), and were called Xandians or Parnians; but, in consequence of internal dissensions, they had migrated at a remote date to Hyrcania and the desert adjoining the Caspian.^[143. The common tradition connects the migration with the conquests of the Scythian king Iandysus, a contemporary of Sesostris. It adds that Parthian means “fugitive” or “exile” (Zend, pérétu). But the name Parthava is found on the inscriptions of Darius long before the immigration of the Parnians.] Here, and in great measure even after they conquered Parthia, they retained the peculiarities of Scythian nomads. The Parthian language is described as a sort of compound between Median and Scythian · and, since the name of the Dahae and those of their tribes (Strabo, xi. p. 511) show that they belonged to the nomads of Iranian kin, wflιo in antiquity were widely spread from the Jaxartes as far as the steppes of south Russia, we must conclude that the mixed language arose by the action and reaction of two Iranian dialects, that of the Parthians and that of their masters.^[144. An idea of the difference between the two may be got from the fragments of Khárezmian, preserved by Bérúní.] Their nomad costume the Parnians in Parthia gradually gave up for the Median dress, but they kept their old war-dress, the characteristic scale-armour, com pletely covering man and horse. The founder of the empire appears on coins in this dress, with the addition of a short mantle, and so again does Mithradates II. The hands and feet alone are unprotected by mail; shoes with laces, and a conical helmet with flaps, to protect the neck and ears, complete the costume.^[145. Mithradates I. was the first to adopt the robes of a Persian great king.] The conquerors of Parthia continued to be a nation of cavalry; to walk on foot was a shame for a free man; the national weapon was the bow, and their way of fighting was to make a series of attacks, separated by a simulated flight, in which the rider discharged his shafts backwards. Many habits of the life they had led in the desert were retained, and the Parthian rulers never lost connexion with the nomad tribes on their frontiers, among whom several Arsacids found temporary refuge. Gradually, of course, the rulers were assimilated to their subjects; the habitual faithlessness and other qualities ascribed to the Parthians by the Romans are such as are common to all Iranians. The origin of the Parthian power naturally produced a rigid aristocratic system; a few freemen governed a vast population of bondsmen; manumission was forbidden, or rather was impossible, since social condition was fixed by descent; the 10,000 horsemen who followed Surenas into battle were all his serfs or slaves, and of the 50,000 cavalry who fought against Antony only 400 were freemen.

Arsaces Tiridates soon added Hyrcania to his realm and raised a great host to maintain himself against Seleucus, but still more against a nearer enemy, Diodotus of Bactria. On the death of the latter, however, the common interests of the Parthians and Bactrians as against the Seleucids brought about an alliance between Arsaces Tiridates and Diodotus II. With much ado, Seleucus had got the better of his foreign and intestine foes and kept his kingdom together, and in 238 or a little later, having made peace with Egypt and silenced his brother, he marched from Babylon into the upper satrapies. Tiridates at first retired and took shelter with the nomadic Apasiacae, but he advanced again and gained a victory, which the Parthians continued to commemorate as the birthday of their independence. Seleucus was unable to avenge his defeat, being presently called back by the rebellion stirred up by his aunt Stratonice at Antioch. This gave the great Hellenic kingdom in Bactria and the small native state in Parthia time to consolidate themselves. Tiridates used the respite to strengthen his army, to fortify towns and castles, and to found the city of Dara or Dareium in the smiling landscape of Abévard. Tiridates, who on his coins appears first merely as Arsaces, then as King Arsaces, and finally as “great king” (probably in imitation of Antiochus Magnus), reigned thirty-seven years, dying in 211/10. His nation ever held his memory in almost divine honour.

Seleucus III. Soter (226-223) died early, and was followed by Antiochus III. Magnus (223-187), who in his brother’s lifetime had ruled from Babylon over the upper satrapies. Molon, governor of Media, supported by his brother Alexander in Persis, rose against him in 222 and assumed the diadem.^[146. The coins of “King Molon” show that his rebellion has nothing to do with the King Antiochus of C. I. G., 4458. The latter, appearing in a list of deified kings arranged in the order of their deification or death, is the eldest son of Antiochus III., who died in 193.] The great resources of his province, which followed him devotedly, enabled Molon to take the offensive and even to occupy Seleucia after a decisive battle with the royal general Xenaetas. Babylonia, the Erythraean district, all Susiana except the fortress of Susa, Parapotamia as far as Europus, and Mesopotamia as far as Dura were successively reduced. But the young king soon turned the fortunes of the war. Crossing the Tigris in person, he [9:18:589] penetrated into Apolloniatis and cut off Molon’s retreat. Molon was forced to accept battle near Apollonia; his left wing passed over to the enemy, and, after a crushing defeat, he and all his kinsmen and chief followers died by their own hands (220). Antiochus now marched to Seleucia to regulate the affairs of the East. He used his victory with moderation, mitigating the severities of his minister Hermias; but he had effectually prevented the rise of a new kingdom in the most important province of Iran. In the same year, before he returned to Syria, he marched across Mount Zagrus against the aged Artabazanes, the most powerful of the native princes, who ruled not only Atropatene but the neighbouring lands, especially east Armenia (Polyb., v. 55, 7), and by the terror of his approach extorted an advantageous treaty.

A period followed in which the king was fully occupied in the west, but after this he began a campaign of several years in the upper satrapies, to which his contemporary renown was mainly due. First he regulated the affairs of the Armenian kingdom of Arsamosata, whose king, Xerxes, had fallen by the intrigues of his own wife, a sister of Antiochus.^[147. John of Antioch, in Müller, iv. 557.] Then, descending the Euphrates by ship to Seleucia, he appeared in Media in 209, hardly as an enemy, though he seized the gold and silver decorations of the temple of the goddess Aene in Ecbatana. Thence with 100,000 foot and 20,000 horse he marched against the new Parthian king, Arsaces II.,^[148. This king seems to have had Arsaces as his proper name, for Justin always uses the proper name of Parthian kings. Vaillant’s conjecture, which gives him the name of Artabanus I., has no basis.] son and successor of Tiridates. Crossing the desert obliquely to Hecatompylus, he forced his way into Hyrcania over Mount Labus (the eastern part of the Elburz mountains), defeating the Parthians on the summit, and besieged the fugitives in Sirynca. The Parthians planned an escape by night, and massacred the Greek residents to prevent its betrayal; but the plan failed. The city yielded, and the war ended in a treaty which left Arsaces his kingdom, but beyond question reduced him to a vassal. In 208 began the much more serious war with Bactria. Here the successors of Diodotus had been dethroned by a usurper, Euthydemus of Magnesia, whose coins indicate a long reign. Euthydemus tried to defend the line of the Arius (Herirud), but Antiochus effected a passage a little west of the city Guriana,^[149. For Υayoυρiav, Polyb., x. 49, where all editors adopt the geographically impossible Ύαπουρίαν of Reiske, read rà Γoυplava, comparing Ptol., vi. 10, 4.] inflicted a decisive defeat on the hostile cavalry, and forced Euthydemus to retreat to Zariaspa. But the siege of Bactra, the capital, proved tedious, and the war made little progress. Antiochus himself opened negotiations and was impressed by the declaration of the Bactrian king, that if he were reduced to extremities he must call in the help of the nomads, which would be fatal to the Greek civilization of the land. At length, in 206, a peace was arranged, and Antiochus was visited in his camp by Demetrius, the youthful son of Euthydemus, who pleased the king so well that he betrothed to him his daughter; Euthydemus was left on his throne, and the two powers swore an alliance offensive and defensive, which cost Bactria no more than certain payments of money, the victualling of the Macedonian troops, and the surrender of the war-elephants. The Bactrian Greeks were grateful for this moderation; their memorial coins place Antiochus Nicator with Euthydemus Theos, Diodotus Soter, and Alexander Philippi among the founders of their political existence.^[150. That Antiochus Nicator is Antiochus III. Magnus follows from Malalas, i. 261; if the style of his Bactrian coins, resembling as they do those of Diodotus, really demands an earlier date, they must belong to the last of the Diodotides not mentioned by the authors, not, as the numismatists suppose, to Antiochus II.] Antiochus next crossed the Paropanisus into the valley of Cabul, renewing the friendly relations of his dynasty with the Indian king Subhagaséna, and receiving from him 150 war-elephants. The return march was through Arachosia and Drangiana, the winter being spent in Carmania. Thus it appears that south of the Paropanisus political relations had remained unchanged for a hundred years, and the successes of Antiochus in Upper Asia, together with the prudent limitation of his schemes to what was practicable, did much to give permanence to the empire in the East, notwithstanding its many points of weakness. The series of victorious campaigns was concluded by a maritime excursion in 205 against the rich merchant-community of G err ha on the Arabian shore of the Persian Gulf, in which Antiochus again showed his moderation, receiving from the Gerrhaeans a gift, 500 talents of silver, 1000 talents of incense, and 200 talents of oil of myrrh, but leaving them the freedom they had enjoyed from time immemorial.

Under very different circumstances did Antiochus revisit the eastern lands eighteen years later, his prestige broken by the war with Rome, and his position as a great power shattered in a way that could not fail ultimately to react on his Asiatic subjects. His most urgent difficulty, however, lay in an exhausted treasury, and the demands of Rome for a heavy war-tribute. Antiochus came to Susa in search of money and seized a pretext to plunder the rich and famous temple of Bel in Elymais; but the attempt was fatal to its author, who was destroyed, together with his followers, by a rising of the Elymaeans (187). This, no doubt, was the moment when Elymais became independent and formed a small separate kingdom in the upland part of Susiana.

Antiochus was followed in the kingdom by his sons, first the weak Seleucus IV. Philopator (187-175), and then the gifted Antiochus IV. Epiphanes (175-164), who had a clear insight into the evils that were sapping the empire, but attempted to cure them and bind the loose complex of provinces more closely to the centre with such impatience and violence that he only hastened the fall of his dynasty. He too, like all the later Seleucids, was in chronic want of money, and it was chiefly to raise tribute that he marched into the East in 166. He first made for Greater Armenia and the neighbouring Sophene, which had never paid much more than nominal allegiance to Macedon, and after the defeat of Antiochus the Great by Rome (189) had formed themselves into kingdoms under Artaxias and Zadriades, the former strategi. Antiochus penetrated into Armenia and took Artaxias prisoner, but restored him to his kingdom. He was next called by urgent affairs to the shores of the Persian Gulf. Over the Persians we read that his lieutenant in Mesene gained a double victory in one day, by sea and by land, at the promontory of Naumachaea^[151. Pliny, vi. § 152; but one is tempted to suspect a corruption of the text and read Drymatina, Macae; horum, &c.] over against the Carmanian coast. This victory, however, implies that Persis had already cast off the Macedonian yoke,^[152. Strabo, xv. p. 736, gives a general confirmation of the existence of a kingdom here in the time of the Macedonians.] and that the new kingdom had already extended its sway over the opposite coast of Omán, as we know to have been the case about 70 a.d. ^[153. Peripl. Μ. Er. (Geog. Gr. Min., i. 283). The connexion of the opposite coasts is natural; in the 10th century the Buwaihids ruled over 'Omán.]

At the mouth of the Tigris Antiochus restored an old city of Alexander’s and called it Antioch;^[154. Pliny, Λ τ . H., vi. 139, says “Antiochus quintus regum,” reckoning Antiochus Hierax. We call Eupator Antiochus V., but he cannot be meant, and there is no way of counting which would make Sidetes the 5th Antiochus.] it had been destroyed by an inundation, a sign that the negligent government of the later Seleucids had let the canal system, [9:18:590] restored by Alexander, fall again into ruin. Another of Epiphanes’s measures directed to the strengthening of the Hellenic element in the East was the occasion of the change to Epiphanea of the name of the Median capital. But against these useful efforts must be set the plundering of the temples of the barbarians, a sure way to exhaust Oriental patience, and one which involved the king in a catastrophe so like to that of his father that we should suspect some confusion were the accounts not so well confirmed.^[155. Comp. Gran. Licinian., p. 9, with the first confused account in the letter of the Jews to Aristobulus, 2 Mac. i. 10 sq.] The king, we are told, heard of a rich temple of the goddess Nanaea in Elymais stored with the gifts of many generations; he marched out to plunder it, but was driven back by the natives to Babylon. In Persis he received tidings of the formidable rising in Judaea^ excited by similar acts of violence; apparently he was then on his way against the Persian rebels, but on the journey he died of consumption in the Persian town of Tabae (164). .

Antiochus had given Mesene with its capital, Antioch, to a native dynast, Hyspaosines, as satrap; and, when Antioch, like its predecessor Alexandria, was soon ruined by floods, the city was removed to an artificial hill and protected by an embankment. Linder the name of Spasinu Charax (Hyspaosines’s pile-town) the new city rose to commercial prosperity, and became the capital of . the petty kingdom of Characene, which probably became independent at the death of Antiochus. Thus the Seleucid empire was now quite cut off from the Persian Gulf by a circle of small native states.^[156. Hyspaosines was not an Arab, as Pliny states, vi. § 139. The Iranian names of the older kings of Characene justify Juba’s account of their extraction.]

Now followed the troubled reign of the child-king Antiochus V. Eupator (164-162), which was cut short by Demetrius Soter (162-150). The latter was constantly persecuted by the Romans, who raised enemies against him on every side, and so the times seemed to invite a renewal of the enterprise of Molon. Since the time of Epiphanes the satrap of Media had been one Timarchus of Miletus, brother of the intriguing and influential treasurer Heraclides, and, like the latter, a favourite of the late king, who had often sent him to Rome. Knowing the ground there, he went to Rome, and easily persuaded the senate to grant him the title of king (161).^[157. The corrupt passage of Diodorus, Eχc. Escnr., 13, ought to run thus, Tιμαpχ⅛> iξtivaι καί abτq> βaσιλta elvat.] He made a treaty with Artaxias of Armenia against Demetrius, compelled the neighbours of Media to acknowledge him, and extended his power as far as Zeugma, and finally over Babylonia.^[158. In Diod., l.c., read τηs Βαβυλωνίαν for τηs βασιλείαν. Hence the error of Appian, who does not mention Media at all.] But .he fared in the end no better than Molon. The Babylonians were oppressed and hated him, and the selfconceived majesty of Timarchus, who on his coins called himself “the Great,” soon broke down in conflict with Demetrius, one of the most gifted princes of a highly-gifted dynasty. Timarchus was slain, his brother fled, and the victor was saluted as “saviour” (Soter) by the grateful Babylonians (160). It was a great victory for Demetrius; he had saved the best part of Iran for his monarchy, and he had shown all who speculated on the support of Rome that the decrees of the republic were powerless in regions to which its arm could not reach.

The true danger for the Macedonian monarchy came not from rebellious lieutenants but from the ever stronger reaction of the Oriental element, of which the little state of Parthia was the most vigorous champion. The kings of Parthia had long kept quiet after the war with Antiochus the Great. Phriapatius, successor of Arsaces II., who reigned fifteen years (c. 191 -c. 176), calls himself on his coins

“Arsaces Philadelphus,” perhaps because he had married a sister, and (first of all Parthian kings) Philhellen.^[159. For these and other Parthian coins P. Gardner’s work is the authority. Oue of them is dated 125 Sei. = 187 B.c.] By the last title he presents himself, at a time when the Seleucid power was sinking, as the protector of his present and future Greek subjects. His eldest son and successor, Phraates I. (Arsaces Theopator of the coins), conquered the brave Mardian highlanders and transplanted them to Charax in the neighbourhood of the Caspian Gates, a proof that the Parthians had already detached Comisene and Choarene^[160. Choarene contains the only Greek city in the older conquests of the Parthians, and the coin with Greek date and title is of the year of Antiochus’s death.] c from Media (Strabo, xi. 514), probably just after the death of Antiochus the Great.

About 171 Phraates died and left the crown not to his sons but to his brother Mithradates (Arsaces Epiphanes and apparently also, on tetradrachms of 139, 138, Arsaces Philhellen), a prince of remarkable capacity, who made Parthia the ruling power in Iran. His first conquests, it would seem, were made at the expense of Bactria.

The kingdom of Bactria had made vast advances under Euthydemus, whose son Demetrius crossed the Indian Caucasus and began the Indian conquests, which soon carried the Greeks far beyond the farthest point of Alexander. The Punjab was reduced and the city of Çákala, under the name of Euthydemia, became the capital of the Indian conquests; but besides this it appears that Demetrius himself marched down the course of the Indus, conquered Pattala and the kingdoms of Saraostes (Suráshtra) and Sigerdis, probably the district of the commercial city Barygaza. The object, it is plain, was to reach the sea and get a share in the trade of the world; and it is possible that the extension of the power of the Bactrian Greeks over Chinese Tartary as far as the Seres and Phaunians had a similar object, viz., to protect the trade-route with China along the Tarym river. For the Seres are the Chinese, and the Phauni, according to Pliny,^[161. N. II., vi. 55, where read “Phuni et Thocari.”] lay west of the Attacori (the mythical people at the sources of the Hoang-ho) and east of the Tochari, whose earlier settlements were east of Khoten. They occupied, therefore, the very region which, according to Chinese sources, was then held by a nomadic pastoral people, the Tibetan No-kiang. History shows that Chinese Tartary is easily conquered from the Oxus and Jaxartes, but very hard to hold, and there is thus no reason to doubt the truth of the Bactrian advance in this direction. Strabo, unluckily, does not tell us whether the campaign was made by Demetrius; it must have fallen before 177, when the great conquests of the Hiung-nu began, but after 201, when the founder of the Han dynasty regained the country as far as the Great Wall, and put China in a position to take part in the trade of inner Asia. This is precisely the period of the greatest power of the Greeks in Bactria. Demetrius, having succeeded his father, was displaced in Bactria by the able usurper Eucratides, some time between 181 and 171.^[162. Sallet’s numismatic arguments, which place Eucratides about 200 B.c., are not conclusive, and do violence to the other testimonies.] A thousand cities obeyed Eucratides, and both he and his rival Demetrius sought to extend the Greek settlements, the one founding Eucratidia in Bactria, the other Demetrias in Arachosia. Now Justin tells us that the Bactrians were so exhausted by wars with the Sogdians, Arachosians, Drangians, Arians, and Indians that they at length fell an easy prey to the weaker Parthians; but Eucratides he describes as a valiant prince, who once with 300 men held out during five months, though besieged by 60,000 men of Demetrius, king of India, and then, receiving succours, subdued India.
[9:18:591]

This implies that besides the kingdom of Bactria and that of Demetrius—the latter now confined to India and probably to the lands east of the Indus—there were independent states in various districts still Seleucid in 206. Justin’s statement is confirmed by the coins, which also show that Eucratides came forth as victor from a series of wars with the lesser states. Sogdiana, according to Chinese authorities, was occupied by the Scythians in the lifetime of Eucratides; Antimachus, to judge from a naval victory recorded on his coins, once reigned on the lower Indus; the principal place where coins of him and his successor Antialcides have been found is the Cophen valley; the latter prince, who borrows from Antiochus Epiphanes the title “Nicephorus,” may be viewed as his younger contemporary. The neighbouring realm of Plato was ephemeral, but his money is unique as giving a date by the Seleucid era (165 b.c.). Pantaleon and Agathocles, whose coins are chiefly to be found in Begram, Cabul, Ghazni, Kandahar, and Sistan, were doubtless kings of Arachosia and Drangiana. Before this these countries belonged to Demetrius, and even, as the coins show, to his father Euthydemus, who cannot have been contemporary with the last years of Antiochus the Great, so that they were probably given as a dowry to his daughter when she married Demetrius. This marriage really took place, for the Seleucid name Laodice is found among the Bactrian Greeks. The victories of Eucratides are proved by his surfrappé coins. Thus he restruck coins of Antialcides and appears posthumously as “God of the city Kariçi”^[163. I.e., Charis, a Greek town, which Appian, Syr., 57, placedin Parthia with two other towns which really lay in Aria.] on money of Apollodotus, king of the Indians. Heliocles, co - regent and successor of Eucratides, and Strato, apparently the successor of Apollodotus, restruck each the money of the other, and Heliocles’s name also appears over what is perhaps a coin of Philoxenus, who reigned in the region of Peshawar.^[164. See in general, A. v. Sallet’s “Ñachf. Alex. d. Gr,” in Zeitschr. f. Num., vi., and Cunningham, Num. Chron., ix. x.]

On his way back from the conquest of India Eucratides was murdered by his son and co-regent, probably Heliocles.^[165. This is the usual assumption, for Heliocles appears on coins both as contemporary and as successor of Eucratides, and there is a surfrappe coin of his which was originally struck by Eucratides for the marriage of Heliocles with Laodice (perhaps a daughter of Demetrius by his Seleucid queen). But there is much to be said for the view of Cunningham {Jourη. As. S. Beng., 1840, p. 869; Num. Chron., ix. 239), that the murderer was Apollodotus, whose title “Philopator” always points to a co-regency.] The date of this murder may be fixed by that of Demetrius, who must have been born not later than 224, and may be taken to have lost his kingdom not later than 159. Eucratides cannot, according to Justin’s account, have lived many years longer. This would give c. 155 b.c. as the lowest possible date for the death of Eucratides. A little before this time notable signs of concession to the rising spirit of the natives appear on the coins. The medals of the older Greek kings follow the Attic standard and have only Greek legends, but from the time of Demetrius the reverse bears a legend in the Indian language spoken in the Cabul valley and in the so-called Arianian character, a letter derived from the Semitic. At the same time we begin to find square coins, and in the later part of the reign of Eucratides a new native standard begins to prevail.^[166. Sallet, op. cit., p. 25 sq.]

In the midst of the civil wars, which became more serious after the death of Eucratides, Mithradates of Parthia began to extend his dominions at the expense of Bactria; even in the lifetime of Eucratides he succeeded in annexing the satrapies of Aspiones and Turiua. These seem to have covered Aria, for the Hindu-Kush is named as the eastern boundary of the Parthians (Justin, xli. 6, 8),—whence perhaps the mention of Arians amongst the foes of Eucratides. Another account makes Mithradates rule as far as India, and declares him to have obtained without war the old kingdom of Porus, or the rule over all nations between the Indus and the Hydaspes.^[167. This account goes back through Oros., v. 4 (following Livy),'and Diod., p. 597, to the excellent authority of Posidonius.] The two accounts are reconciled by Chinese records, which tell that c. 161 B.c. the nomad people Sse broke into the valley of the Cophen and founded a kingdom in the very place of the

Parthian conquests in India, which must therefore have been ephemeral. This fact has its importance, as illustrating the way in which the internal wars of the east Iranian Greeks helped to prepare the ground for the Scythian invasion. After this success in the east Mithradates turned his attention to the west, where the chances of success were not less inviting. Demetrius had at length fallen before a coalition of the neighbouring sovereigns, powerfully supported by the Romans through their instrument the exile Heraclides. A pretender, who called himself son of Antiochus Epiphanes, was put up as king by the coalition; he appeared in Syria in 152, and slew Demetrius in battle in 150. The pretender, who took the name of Alexander Theopator Euergetes, proved quite incompetent, and lost the support of Ptolemy Philometor, who in 147 put up Demetrius, the son of Demetrius, against him. At length, in 145, Alexander, utterly defeated by Ptolemy, was slain in his flight by an Arab chieftain. Demetrius II. Nicator, however, soon made himself bitterly hated, and a certain Diodotus of Casiana, in the region of Apamea, a man of mean origin, was able first to set up against him Alexander’s young son Antiochus Epiphanes Dionysus, and then to murder his puppet and proclaim himself as King Trypho. Five years of fighting drove Demetrius out of the greater part of Syria. Such was the state of the empire when war broke out between Media and Parthia, and was finally decided in favour of the latter. Mithradates left Bacasis in Media and turned to Hyrcania. Media in this account appears as independent, and that this was so is confirmed by the notice in Diod., Exc. Esc., 25, that a certain Dionysius “the Mede” raised Mesopotamia in 142 against Trypho to avenge the murder of the young Antiochus. Dionysius must be a son of Timarchus; Heraclides, when he installed Alexander in Syria, must have thought also of his own family, and raised it again to the throne of Media, which the senate had already recognized as a separate kingdom. But the short-lived independence of Media was, as we have seen, soon cut short by Mithradates, who did not lose the opportunity afforded by the civil wars of Syria in 147. Babylonia followed the fate of Media; Demetrius’s lieutenant was defeated, and the whole province, with its capital Seleucia, fell into the hands of the Parthians. Thus the East was finally lost to the Macedonians.

The change of rule was not well received by the new subjects of Parthia, least of all by the Greeks and Macedonians of the upper provinces, who sent embassy after embassy to Demetrius. That prince, who had now little to lose in Syria, at length accepted their invitation to come and take the rule over them, hoping that if he could secure the upper satrapies they would help him against Trypho. In 140 he marched into Mesopotamia, and thence by Babylon to the upper provinces. He was well received by the natives, and even the small native states made common cause with him against the proud barbarians, whose neighbourhood they felt as oppressive. He was joined by the Persians and Elymaeans, and the Bactrians helped him by a diversion, appearing now for the last time as an independent people. At first things went well, and the Parthians were defeated in several battles, but in Media in 139 Demetrius was surprised by the lieutenant of Mithradates during negotiations for peace; his forces were annihilated, and he himself taken prisoner and dragged in chains through the provinces that had joined his cause. The Parthian king received his captive with favour and assigned him a residence and suitable establishment in Hyrcania. He even gave him his daughter Rhodogune, and promised to restore him to his kingdom, but this plan was interrupted by death.

Mithradates’s last campaign was against the king of Elymais, Demetrius’s ally; the rich temples of Elymais, [9:18:592] that of Athena, and that of Artemis or Nanaea in Azara yielded him a booty of 10,000 talents (£2,258,000), and the great town of Seleucia on the Hedyphon was taken^[168. In giving this order of events it is assumed that the capture of Demetrius, omitted in Justin’s epitome of Trogus, xli. 6, conies after § 7, not, as has been assumed since Vaillant, after § 8. When Trogus mentions such unimportant events as the nomination of Bacasis to Media and the visit of Mithradates to Hyrcania, we must suppose that these facts bore on others of more note, that Bacasis was the captor of Demetrius, and that the royal court was in Hyrcania when the captive was brought before the Parthian king.] (Strabo, xvi. p. 744). The country was brought under Parthia, but continued to have its own kings. The coins make it likely that Mithradates simply set up a new dynasty, a branch of his own house.^[169. Coins of the venerable Camnascires, whom Pseudo-Lucian Macrobii calls a Parthian, but separated from the great kings by Armenia and Characene, have been brought from Baghdad and Shuster, and can hardly have been struck elsewhere than in Elymais. He was preceded by an Arsaces, not one of the main Parthian line. See Sallet, in Z. f. Num., viii. 207 sq.] Mithradates died in a good old age in 138, or a little later.^[170. Demetrius had married PJιodogune when Antiochus VII. married his deserted wife Cleopatra in 138, and there were children by the marriage, though not earlier than the time of Demetrius’s second attempt to escape; hence both attempts must have been after the death of Mithradates.] His memory was reverenced almost equally with that of the founder of his house, but his real glory was much greater, for it was he who made Parthia a great power. He is praised as a just and humane ruler, who, having become lord of all the lands from the Indian Caucasus to the Euphrates, introduced among the Parthians the best institutions of each country, and so became the legislator of his nation.

The divisions of the empire which he founded can be sketched by the aid of an excerpt from the itinerary of Isidore of Charax (at the beginning of the Christian era) and of Pliny (Λ r . II. , vi. 44, 112). The empire was divided into the upper and lower kingdoms, separated by the Caspian Gates. The lower kingdoms were seven —(1) Mesopotamia and Babylonia, (2) Apolloniatis, (3) Chalonitis,^[171. These three make up the old satrapies of Mesopotamia (with Arbelitis) and Babylonia. The whole land between the Euphrates and the Tigris was now put together, and the countries to the east of the Tigris detached, Apolloniatis being taken from Babylonia, and Chalonitis from Arbelitis.] (4) Carina,^[172. In Isid., § 4 (Geog. Min., i. 250), read ΕvτeC0er M77δiα κal χώρα Ύάρινα, τγn,s κaτlχeι σχoivoυs κβ, ή άρχη αύτών.] (5) Cambadene, (6) Upper Media, (7) Lower or Rhagian Media.^[173. Nos. 4 to 7 are all parts of the old satrapy of Media.] The upper kingdoms were eleven—(8) Choarene, (9) Comisene,^[174. The two most eastern parts of Media that were the first Parthian conquests.] (10) Hyrcania, (11) Astauene, (12) Parthyene, (13) Apauarcticene,^[175. Nos. 10 to 13 form the old satrapy of Parthia and Hyrcania.] (14) Margiana, a part of Bactria, (15) Aria, (16) the country of the Anauans (a division of Aria), (17) Zarangiana,^[176. Nos. 15 to 17 belong to the old satrapy of Aria with Drangiana. Sacastane, another part of this satrapy, was not Parthian, but, as Isidore remarks, belonged to the Sacae.] (18) Arachosia, now called “White India.” The eighteen Parthian kingdoms thus correspond to six old satrapies; the new divisions were probably derived from the provinces of Seleucus Nicator (see especially Posidonius in Strabo, xvi. p. 749). But upper and lower provinces have changed their meaning; apart from Arachosia, the upper provinces are the old conquests of the Parthians before they occupied Media and became lords of Iran, and the lower all the later conquests in the west. The Parthians, we see, gave much less attention to the west than did their predecessors, and they still left Mesopotamia as the only great satrapy, and perhaps first added Babylonia to it when Ctesiphon became the residence of the Arsacids. We note also that they cared little for reaching the sea, which they can have touched only for a little way at the mouth of the Euphrates; and even here they allowed the petty Characene quite to outstrip them in competing for the great sea-trade. As compared with the older Macedonian empire, the Parthian realm lacked the east Iranian satrapies, Bactria with Sogdiana, and the Paropanisadae, and also the three Indian ones, which, with Paraetacene, or, as it was afterwards called, Sacastane, remained under the Bactrian Greeks and their successors. In the north they lacked Lesser Media, which had long been an independent state, and in the south they lacked Susiana, which now belonged to Elymais, and the satrapies of Persis and Carmania, which the Persians held along with the western part of Gedrosia (Per. Mar. Er., § 37). In the extreme west they lacked Arbelitis proper, which formed a small kingdom under the name of Adiabene, first mentioned in 69 B.c. (Plut, Lucullus, 27). The kingdom of Mannus of Orrha (Μάκ^ου , 'Oppαs, so read) in north Mésopotamie, which acccrding to Isidore (§ 1) reached a good way south of Edessa, seems also to have been independent, and, like Adiabene, probably existed before the Parthian time. From these small kingdoms the Parthians asked only an acknowledgment of vassalship. When Parthia was vigorous the vassalship was real, but when Parthia was torn by factions it became a mere name (Strabo, xvi. p. 732). The relation was always loose, and the political power of Parthia was therefore never comparable to the later power of the Sasanians. Arsaces Tiridates and his successors called themselves “great king.” Mithradates, as overlord of the minor kingships, first bore the title “great king of kings.” The title seems to have been conferred, not assumed in mere boastfulness; for (apart from a single usurper in times of disorder who calls himself “king of kings”) none of his successors bears it until Phraates III., seventy years later,—a fact clear from the coins, but hitherto unnoticed. The nobility had great influence in all things, and especially in the nomination of the king, who, however, was always an Arsacid. Next to the king stood the senate of probuli, ^[177. For populorum (Just., xli. 2, 2) a synonym of senatus (xlii. 4, 1) is wanted; write, therefore, probulorum.] from whom all generals and lieutenant-governors were chosen. They λvere called the king’s kin, and were no doubt the old Parnian martial nobility. A second senate was composed of the Magians and wise men, and by these two senates the king was nominated (Posidonius, ap. Strabo, xi. p. 515). The Parthians were, in fact, very pious, conscientious in observing even the most troublesome precepts of Zoroastrianism as to the disposal of dead bodies, which were exposed to birds of prey and dogs, the bare bones alone being buried (Justin, xli. 3, 5, 6). When the Parthian prince Tiridates visited Nero he journeyed overland that he might not be forced to defile the sea when he spat, and his spiritual advisers the Magians travelled with him (Plin., xxx. 17). The Magians were not, indeed, so all-powerful as under the Sasanians, but it is quite a mistake to think that the Parthians were but lukewarm Zoroastrians.

The complete annihilation of the Macedonian empire in Iran was closely followed by the destruction of Greek independence in eastern Iran, north of the Paropanisus. The last mention of independent Bactria is in 140; no king of Bactria and Sogdiana is known from coins after the parricide Heliocles. Classical writers give only two laconic accounts of the catastrophe. Strabo says that “the nomadic peoples of the Asii, Pasiani, Tochari, and Sacaraucae (so read for Σακάραυλοι και in xi. p. 511), dwellers in the land of the Sacae, beyond the Jaxartes [in its middle course], opposite to the Sacae and Sogdians, came and took Bactria from the Greeks.” Trogus {Prol., xli.) names the Scythian peoples Saraucae and Asiani.^[178. Modern writers since Bayer make the Greek kingdom in Bactria fall before the Parthians, appealing to Just., xli. 6, 3. But the epitome here contradicts its source, and confounds the fall of the kingdom with the earlier loss of two satrapies to the Parthians under Eucratides. The right account is to be found elsewhere in Justin himself, ii. 1, 3; 3, 6.] Fortunately the lively interest taken by the Chinese in the movements of the nomads of Central Asia enables us to fill up this meagre notice from the report of the Chinese agent in Bactria in 128, as recorded a little later by the oldest Chinese historian, and from other notices collected by the Chinese after the opening of the regular caravan route with the west, about 115, and embodied in their second oldest history.^[179. Comp, the Sseki of Ssematsien (100 b.c.), tr. by Brosset, Nouυ. Journ. As., ii. 418 sq., and the Annals (of the first Han) of Panku (80 λ.d. ), excerpts from which are given by Ritter, Brdk., pt. vii. bk. 3, pp. 604-728; Deguignes, Hist, des Huns, 1, 2, p. lxiv. sq. , 41 sq., and “Recherches sur quelques événements,” &c., in Mem.

Comp, further Richthofen, China, p. 447.] According to these sources the Yue-chi, a nomad people akin to the Tibetans, lived aforetime between Tun-hoang (i.e. i Sha-cheu) and the Kilien-shan mountains, and about 177 were subjugated, like all their neighbours, by the Turkish Hiung-nu. Between 167 and 161 they renewed the struggle without success; Lao-shang, the t r reat khan of the Hiumr-nu. slew their kintr Cha∏E-
[9:18:593]

lun, and made a drinking-cup of his skull,^[180. The Lombards had the same custom, learned, no doubt, in the childhood of the race from their Avariai! neighbours.] and the great mass of the vanquished people (the great Yue-chi) left their homes and moved westward, and occupied the land on Lake Issyk-kul, driving before them another nomad race, the Sse. The Sse took the road by Utch and Kashgar, ultimately reaching and subduing the kingdom of Kipin (the Cabul valley), while their old seats were occupied by the Great Yue-chi, till they in turn were soon attacked by the Usun, who lived west of the Hiung-nu, and forced to move farther west (1C0 or 159). The older Chinese account ignores the residence of the Yue-chi at Lake Issyk-kul, which can at most have lasted only for a few years; the later account goes on to say that, moving westward, they conquered the Ta-hia, i.e., the Bactrians. The language of the older narrative has been held to imply that they went by way of Ferghana and remained there for some time; but in reality it only says that they retired beyond Ferghana and conquered the Ta-hia, thereupon pitching the royal camp north of the Oxus, and so it appears that in 159 they moved straight on Sogdiana, reaching that land just at the time when internal wars were undermining the might of Eucratides. The conquest, however, may have been gradual, since Bactria is still named as independent in 140.

When the Yue-chi were already settled in their new homes the king of China sent a certain Chang-kien to urge them to return and help him to clear the caravan-road by thrusting back the Hiung-nu. He was arrested on his way by the latter, but escaped in 129 to Ferghana, and thence was led to the Yue-chi through the land of the Khang-kiu, on the middle course of the Jaxartes. But the Yue-chi were too happily settled in a rich and peaceful land to listen to his representations, and after a year’s residence (128-127) he returned to China, which he reached in 126, after falling again into the hands of the Hiung-nu on the way. From him are derived almost all the accounts of the country and its inhabitants given by the Chinese historians. There were, we arc told, settled and agricultural peoples in Great Wan (Ferghana), Ta-hia (Bactria), and An-si (Parthia). All the races from Ferghana to Parthia had deep - set eyes and strong beard and moustache; their dialects varied, but as they all understood each other all must have been Iranian in speech. Their manners, too, were much alike; they paid great respect to women, and the men were very complaisant to their wives. This is almost exactly what Bardesanes says of the position of women in his time among the Kusban in Bactria;^[181. See Langlois, Coll. d. hisf. de V Arménie, i. 84.] but it was quite otherwise in Parthia, where the Oriental seclusion of women was carried to the extreme (Just., xli. 3, 1, 2). They were all knowing traders, and understood the preparation of silk and lac, but not metallurgy till they were taught that art by Chinese agents and deserters. They then imported the precious metals from China and made gold and silver vessels, but not money, being in this respect behind the Parthians.^[182. Ssenιatsien, in Putter, vii. 3, p. 642.] Great Wan probably corresponds to the Οΰαρνοι of Ptolemy (though he misplaces them) and the Varena of the Vendidad ; it was a separate kingdom, with a population estimated at 300,000 souls in the 1st century B.c., and seventy subject cities. The king, probably a native who had risen on the fall of the Greeks, lived in Kuei-shan (probably Khojend, at the mouth of the Ferghana valley), and could call out an army of 60,000 men,—lancers, archers, and mounted bowmen. The land was famous for its wine and for horses of divine race which sweated blood, and for the possession of which China went to war with Great Wan in 104-103, and again in 102-98. Lucerne and grapes were exported to China; the name of the latter, “po-tao,”is held tobe the Greek βbτpυs, which would show that the vine was introduced by the Greeks of Alexandria Eschata. South of the Wei or Oxus lies Ta-hia (probably Zend Dahvyu, the land^[183. Certainly not Dahae, for they were never in Bactria.]). Here there was no king, but the several cities were the seats of chiefs, a state of things such as Alexander had found in the country and as reappeared under the Turks in the 7th century λ.d. Chang-kien estimated the population at a million; they were bad and cowardly soldiers, but excelled in trade, and the chief town, Lan-shi, had rich bazaars of many wares. This town must be one of the commercial cities on the river Bactrus, along which lay the trade-route from India to the north (Pliny, vi. 52), i.e., either Bactra or Eucratidia (which, according to Ptolemy, vi. 11, 8 [Codd. B., E., Pal. 1], lay lower down the stream on the left bank). In the latter case Lan-shi may stand for ,, Eλλwεs. North of Ta-hia lav the Great Yue-chi, and west of the latter was An-si towards the Oxus. This was a very great country, whose length might be 1000 li (358 miles), and it had 100 cities great and small. The first caravan from China to An-si passed on its λvay from the east frontier to the capital (called in the 1st century b.c. Fan-teu, i.e., probably Parthau), a dozen walled cities, which lay almost close together, so dense was then the population of the fertile part of Khorasan. The merchants of An-si visited the neighbouring lands with waggons or with ships for distances of Several thousand li. The coinage was silver, with the image of the king, and was called in and restamped on a new accession.^[184. On this point the younger Chinese account falls into a confusion with the coins of the kings of Kipin.] Writing was on skins in horizontal lines. Now, though the money as here described fits Parthia, the mercantile character of the race does not at all correspond to that of the Parthian aristocracy. Both here and in the general description given above, which also contains features not applicable to the Parthians, we see that the Chinese did not distinguish the ruling race from their subjects, and mainly described the latter, who were in point of fact very similár to the people of Bactria and Ferghana. As An-si extends to the Oxus the description is taken from the inhabitants of Margiana, a country which -must have been then subject to Parthia. A later Chinese account, referring to the period 24-220 A.D., places on the cast frontier the city Mo-lu or Little An-si, which is plainly the Mouru of the Vendidad, modern Mervi-rud, and the Greek Antioch ή êvvbpos ; An-si is a corruption of the last name, just as the Persians call the Syrian Antioch Andív, and so came to be a name for the Parthian rulers of the city. West of An-si, on the western (Caspian) sea, lay Tiao-chi (Media), an agricultural country with a dense population, a dependency of An-si, and in part governed by tributary chiefs. Chang-kien is thinking less of the central parts of Media than of Gilan and Mazandaran, for he speaks of the warm moist climate where rice is produced. And in this quarter there were really various petty states; not only Atropatene but Dilem had its own king, as appears for the year 65 B.c. from Plutarch, Pomp., 36 (where for 'V ∖ υμaιωv read ∆eλυμαiωv), and the Gelae and Cadusians doubtless stood under their own mountain chiefs as they had done under the later Achaemenians, and did again under the first Sasanians. It is a proof of the solid power of the empire founded by Mithradates that Parthia was able to assert some kind of supremacy over these hardly accessible districts. North of An-si lay Li-kan (Hyrcania), whose wizards, with those of Tiao-chi, had great reputation. It is clear from this whole account that the centre of the empire was still in the old Parthian lands, and that the lower satrapies were viewed as mere dependencies, “outer lands.” In the following century the Chinese obtained knowledge of the λvest by the caravan-route which passed through Kipin (the Cabul valley) to U-ghe-shan-li (Arachosia); and now we find a changed state of affairs; these two countries are bounded on the west by Tiao-chi, whose powerful king has his capital a hundred days’ journey from the frontier. An-si is now only mentioned incidentally as reached from Arachosia by going first north and then east, which is correct if we take the name in its original sense of the subjects of Parthia in Margiana and its capital Antioch. But the empire of Parthia, which now had its centre in Media and the western lands, is certainly Tiao-chi, a word that is probably connected with the word for “land” in the official language of the Achaemenians, old Persian dalιyaιιs.

As nomadic peoples Chang-kien names the Great Yue-chi in Sogdiana, the Khang-kiu on the middle course of the Jaxartes, and the Yen-tsai in Chorasmia. The Yue-chi could put from 100,000 to 200,000 bowmen in the field; later they were reckoned at 100,000 warriors and their families. The royal camp had been north of the Oxus even after the conquest of Bactria, but they finally withdrew entirely to this district. Their capital is called Lan - shi; and the name of Ta - hia disappeared before that of “Land of the Great Yue-chi.” At the conquest they had a single king; afterwards they formed five principalities. The fifth of these corresponds to Cabul, so that the division is younger than the Scythian invasion of Asia after the death of Phraates II. Immediately north of Ferghana, but separated from the Yue-chi in the south and the Hiung-nu in the east by a series of small kingdoms, were the pasture-grounds of the Khang-kiu on both sides of the Jaxartes; their force was 80,000 to 90,000 bowmen. North-west of these were the Yen-tsai on the Aral, the northern neighbours of the An-si, and east of Hyrcania, that is, in Chorasmia. If there is no error in the writing of the number they mustered but 10,000 warriors; then again considerable changes had taken place when the Chinese made war on the Khang-kiu in 44 B.c. The small kingdoms south and east of the latter have disappeared, so that the Khang-kiu border on the Hiung-nu and the great Yue-chi; but the latter have now moved south, and now, too, the Khang-kiu are the northern neighbours of An-si, and not the Yen-tsai; the latter are their dependants, and a tribute of mouse-skins is even drawn from the kingdom of Yen beyond the Yen-tsai. Such a tribute cannot have come from any place south of the Mukhajar mountains[9:18:594]. The Khang-kiu have risen in number as the Yιιe-chi fall, and have now 120,000 bowmen, or a population of 600,000 souls. Like the Yue chi, they are divided into principalities, which are five in number, and the king is the prince of Su-hiai, with his winter residence in a place of that name east of Ferghana, and his summer court much farther west at Lo-yuei-ni. The east of the Khang-kiu country was often subject to the Hiung-nu, and the pressure of this Turkish tribe seems to have been the cause which pushed the Khang-kiu and Yen-tsai farther west. The latter have now at least 100,000 bowmen, and extend westwards to the limits of Great Tsin or the Roman empire. This compels us to conclude that the Yen-tsai are the Aorsi, the western part of whom ranged between the lower Don and the west coast of the Caspian, while the older upper Aorsi were round the north coast, and so on to the neighbourhood of the lower Jaxartes (Strabo, xi. p. 506; Ptol., vi. 14, 10). When Pharnaces ruled on the Bosphorus (63-47 B.c.) both parts of the Aorsi intervened in the affairs of the neighbouring kingdom with large armies, and as Pharnaces was a client of Rome the Chinese statement is intelligible. Later Chinese accounts relating to the first Christian century give A-lan-na as the later name of the Yen-tsai, which agrees with the fact that the Aorsi appear last in history in 49 a.d. (Tac., Ann., xii. 15 sq. ∖ and that Lucan, ten or fifteen years later, is the first to name the Alans, who succeed to their geographical place. When we understand the Chinese data we can speak with more definiteness about the four nations to whom Strabo ascribes the fall of Greek Bactria, and which Ptolemy also seems to name from a source relating to the time when the invasion began. From these data, compared with our Chinese sources, we can be sure that the Tochari are the great Yue-chi, the former being probably the name of the nation and the latter that of the leading horde. The Asii of Strabo, Asiani of Trogus, Jatii of Ptolemy, will then be all attempts to render the difficult name of the horde which the Chinese call Yue-chi. But, while the classical writers place the Sacaraucae in the west to balance the Tochari in the east, the Chinese know no second great nation between the latter and the Parthians in Margiana. We must therefore suppose that the Sacaraucae are the Scythians who occupied part of the Greek lands, and were in turn conquered by Parthia according to Strabo (xi. 515); that this part was Margiana is known from a drachma of Phraates II. (Gardner, Parthian Coinage, p. 33); the conquest must have taken place a good while before 128, when Chang-kien visited Sogdiana, since by that time the Parthians had again displaced them. But lie must have known and mentioned the Sacaraucae in some form, and they can hardly be other than the most powerful nation known to him in Transoxiana, .the Khang-kiu. These, like the Sacaraucae, came from beyond the Jaxartes; they were the northern neighbours of Parthia just at the time when the Sacaraucae are so described. The only other tribe that can be thought of, the Yen-tsai, are known to the Greeks and Romans by a different name, às the Aorsi; and Trogus {Prol., xlii.) mentions the fall of the Sacaraucae as one of the latest events in Scythian history, which, as he wτote soon after 2 b.c., agrees with the fact that the last mention of the Khang-kiu in Chinese history is in 11 b.c. ; while the Aorsi are mentioned much later. Khang-kiu seems to be properly the name of a country identical with the Kañgha of the Khorda-Avesta and the Gangdiz of Firdausi. Finally, the Pasicae or Pasiani are the same as the Apasiacae of the earlier Parthian history; the Sacaraucae will have conquered them and swept them with them as the Mongols did with many Tatar tribes. The conquest of Bactria probably followed soon after the last hopes of the Eastern Greeks in Demetrius II. came to nothing. It is very remarkable that Chang-kien notices no difference between the Greeks who had been rulers and the Iranians who Avere their subjects. This implies not merely some lapse of time but a marked decrease in the number of the Greeks, and probably also that here, as in other Eastern parts, they had become more and more completely Orientalized.

Phraates II.,^[185. In coins Arsaces Theopator Euergetes Epiphanes Philhellen.] who succeeded his father in 138, and continued his work, wresting Margiana from the Scythians of Bactria in an expedition commemorated on extant coins, had also to meet the last and most formidable attempt to restore the sovereignty of the Seleucids. Antiochus VIL, one of the ablest kings of his race, had put dθAvn the civil Avars in Syria, even taking Jerusalem and compelling the JeAvs to acknowledge his might by paying him military service, and in 130 he marched eastAvard at the head of a force of 80,000 combatants, swollen by camp-folloAvers to a total of 300,000. Many of the small princes, on whom the hand of Parthia lay heavy, joined him as they had joined his brother; the enemy Avas smitten on the Great Zab, and in two other battles; Babylon and then Ecbatana opened their gates to the conqueror; and the subject-nations rose against the Parthians, Avho, Avhen Antiochus took up his winter quarters in Media, Avere again confined to their ancient limits. When the snows began to melt, an embassy from Phraates appeared to ask for peace; but the terms demanded by Antiochus—the liberation of Demetrius, the surrender of all conquests, and the payment of tribute for the old Parthian country—were such as could not be accepted without another appeal to the fortunes of Avar. Demetrius, indeed, Avas released and sent to Syria, but only to stir up a hostile party in his brother’s rear. During the winter the Syrian host had been dispersed over a Avide range of cantonments; the disorderly insolence of the soldiers, for Avhich the general Athenaeus was held to be mainly responsible, and of the levies raised in the towns had disgusted the natives; the Medes made secret terms with Parthia, and all the cantonments were attacked by concert on a single day. Hastening to relieve the nearest corps, Antiochus Avas met by the Parthian with a superior force of 120,000 men; he refused the advice of his officers to fall back to the neighbouring mountains, and accepted battle on a field too narrow for the evolution of his troops. The Syrian soldiers, enervated by luxury, were readier to imitate the flight of Athenaeus than the valour of his master; the whole host Avas involved in the rout and annihilated. Antiochus himself escaped Avounded from the fray and cast himself from a rock that he might not be taken alive. This catastrophe (February 129^[186. The date is fixed by Livy, who, according to Orosius, v. 10, and Obseq., De Prodig. , 28, places the expedition in the consular year 130. With this it agrees that Antiochus came to the throne in 138 and reigned nine years. Too much weight is often attached to Porphyry’s dates by Olympiads, which are merely calculated from the years of reigns.]) freed the Parthians for ever from danger from Syria.

Phraates paid funeral honours to the fallen king, and afterAvards sent his body to Syria in a silver coffin. He entertained his captive family royally, married one of the tAvo daughters, and sent the eldest son Seleucus to Syria to claim the sovereignty, and so serve future plans of his own; for an attempt to follθAv and recapture Demetrius, made immediately after the battle, had proved too late. But dangers in the east soon turned the Parthian’s attention aAvay from enterprises in the west. In his distress he had bribed the Scythians^[187. Justin, xlii. 2, 1-2, plainly distinguishes these Scythians from the Tochari, so the Sacaraucae must be meant.] to send him help; as they arrived too late he refused to pay them, and they in turn began to ravage the Parthian country. Phraates marched against them, leaving his charge at home to his favourite, the Hyrcanian Euhemerus, who chastised the countries that had sided with Antiochus, made war with Mesene, and treated Babylon and Seleucia with the utmost cruelty. But the Scythian Avar proved a disastrous one; the enemy overran the whole empire, and for the first time for five hundred years Scythian plunderers again appeared in Mesopotamia^[188. Jo. Ant., in Müller, iv. 561.]; in a decisive battle Phraates was deserted by the old soldiers of Antiochus, whom he had forced into his service and then treated Avith insolent cruelty; the Parthian host sustained a ruinous defeat, and the king himself was slain (spring 128, or somewhat later).^[189. The remains of Antiochus reached Syria in the reign of Alexander II., who came to the throne in 128 (Justin, xxxix. 1, 6).]

Artabanus I.^[190. Arsaces Theopator Nicator of the coins.] (third son of Phriapatius), who uoav became king, was an elderly man. The Scythians, according to the too favourable account by our chief authority, were content with their victory, and moved homewards, ravaging the country. But we know from John of Antioch (66, 2) that the successor of Phraates paid them tribute; and the southern part of Drangiana must noAv have been permanently[9:18:595] occupied by the Scythian tribes, who gave it the name of Sacastane (Sistan), for that name appears in Isidore of Charax (1 b.c.), which implies that the Scythian occupation was even then of long standing. Finally, the coins reveal the existence of Arsacids who were rival kings to Artabanus I. and Mithradates II., and perhaps borrow from individual successes against the Scythians the proud titles which so strongly contrast with the really wretched condition of the empire. One of these pretenders, Arsaces Euergetes Dicaios Philhellen, resumes the style “king of kings,” which had lapsed since Mithradates I.; and his title “the just,” which seems to be imitated from the Bactrian Heliocles, suggests that he may have come with the Scythians from the land where Heliocles once reigned. Meanwhile it would appear that the men of Seleucia, driven to desperation, had seized the tyrant Euhemerus and put him to a cruel death.^[191. In Diod., Exc. Vat., p. 107, there can be little doubt that évíov is a corruption of Eι⅛√poυ.] Artabanus, when they sought his pardon, threatened to put out the eyes of every man of Seleucia, and was prevented only by his death, in battle with the Tochari, after a very short reign.

His son and successor, Mithradates II. the Great,^[192. On coins Arsaces Theos Euergetes Epiphanes Philhellen.] was the restorer of the empire.^[193. The time of his accession follows approximately from the date 123 on a coin of his rival, Arsaces Nicephorus.] We are briefly told that he valiantly waged many wars with his neighbours, added many nations to the empire, and had several successes against the Scythians, so avenging the disgrace of his predecessors. His successes, however, must have been practically limited to the recovery of lost ground, and the eastern frontier was not advanced. It has been common to connect with his successes the appearance of Parthian names among the Indo-Scythian princes of the Cabul valley; but this must be false, for even Candahar (U-ghe-shan-li), which lies so much farther west, is represented by the Chinese as an independent kingdom in the middle of the 1st century b.c. On the other hand, Mithradates, if not the first to conquer Mesopotamia, was the first to fix the Euphrates as the western boundary of the empire, and towards the end of his reign he was strong enough to interfere with the concerns of Great Armenia and place Tigranes II. on the throne in a time of disputed succession (94), accepting in return the cession of seventy Armenian valleys. Now, too, the Parthians, as lords of Mesopotamia, came for the first time into contact with Rome, and in 92, when Sulla came to Cappadocia as propraetor of Cilicia, he met on the Euphrates the ambassador of Mithradates seeking the Roman alliance.^[194. The ambassador allowed Sulla to take the place of honour, and on his return was punished for this by death.] This embassy was no doubt connected with the Parthian schemes against Syria; Mithradates about this time was at war with Laodice, queen of Commagene or some neighbouring part; and her cousin, Antiochus X.,^[195. The queen τωv Γaλt,κηrωι> of Jos., Ant., xiii. 13, 4 (Leyden MS.— the usual text has “queen of Gilead ”), is doubtless the Laodice Thea Philadelphos, daughter of Antiochus VIII. of Syria, who, as Mommsen has shown {Mitth. Arch. Inst. Athen., i. 32), was ancestress of the later sovereigns of Commagene. The word in Josephus is not perhaps a corruption of Commagene but of some neighbouring place — say Kαλλu'4κτp'ωi'.] who supported her, fell in battle with the Parthians. A few years later Strato, tyrant of Beraea, called in the Arab phylarch Azizus and the Parthian governor of Mesopotamia, Mithradates Sinaces, against Demetrius III., who reigned at Damascus. The Seleucid was compelled to surrender with his whole army and ended his life as a captive at the Parthian court. Mithradates the Great seems to have died just after this event; there is no reason to suppose that he lived to see the disasters which followed so close on his great successes.

Artabanus II. was the next monarch,^[196. In Trogus, Prol., 41, the sentence “successores deinde eius Artabanus et Tigranes cognomine Deus a quo subacta est Media et Mesopotamia dictusque in excessu Arabiae situs” is wrongly referred (after Vaillant) to Mithradates I. of Parthia. It can really refer only to the famous Tigranes, and in that case must have originally belonged to Prol., 42, having dropped out by homoioteleuton, and been restored from the margin in a false place. Artabanus II., therefore, followed Mithradates II., and his probably are the base coins of Arsaces Euergetes Epiphanes Philhellen, which according to Gardner, p. 38, seem to belong to this time.] but after him the style of king of kings was taken by the Armenian Tigranes, one of the most dangerous foes Parthia ever had. In 86 it was still a reason for choosing Tigranes as king of part of Syria that he was in alliance with Parthia (Just., xl. 1, 3), but very soon the latter state was so ruined by civil and foreign war that it was no match for Armenia (Plut., Lucullus, 36). Of the details in this history we know only the last act. In 77 the Arsacid Sinatruces^[197. On coins Arsaces Autocrator Philopator Epiphanes Philhellen.] returned from the land of the Sacaraucae to take the throne at the age of eighty, and reigned seven years. There were probably other usurpers; the silence of the coins does not prove the contrary, but rather that the times were so bad that no money was struck, a case of which Parthian numismatics offer other examples. Tigranes conquered Media—primarily, that is, Atropatene —but he also entered Great Media and destroyed the city of Adrapanan, 7 miles west of Ecbatana, “the castle of those who have their seat in Batana” (Ecbatana),^[198. Isid. Char., in Geog. Gr. Min., i. 250.] i.e., of a line of the Arsacids, for, though Mithradates I. had had his seat in Hyrcania, Phraates II. and his successors down to Mithradates III. held their court in Media (Diod., Exc. Vat., p. 603). The seventy valleys which had been the price of his throne were restored to Tigranes, and he also ravaged the country of Arbela and Nineveh, and compelled the cession of Adiabene, hitherto a Parthian dependency, and of Mesopotamia, with the fortress of Nisibis. This last war was against Sinatruces,^[199. Sallust, Hist., iv. fr. 19, § 3.] and was probably going on in 73 when Mithradates Eupator of Pontus made a vain appeal for help to both combatants (Memnon, in Photius, p. 234 b, 27).

Phraates III. succeeded his father Sinatruces a little before the arrival of Lucullus in the East in 70,^[200. So Memnon, ir Photius, p. 239 a, 13, confirmed by Phlegon, ibid., p. 84 a, 15. These sources, being independent, have more weight than Appian, Mιthr., 104, and Dio Cassius, xxxvi. 45, who speak of the arrival of Pompey. Phraates III. is the “king of kings, Arsaces Dicaios Epiphanes Theos Eupator Philhellen,” whose coins Gardner wrongly ascribes to Mithradates III. λVe have express testimony that Phraates was styled “king of kings” and had the epithet “Theos” (Plut., Pomp., 38; Dio Cass., xxxvii. 6; Phlegon, ut supP.] and in 69 refused a second invitation to give help against Rome which Mithradates and Tigranes addressed to him jointly, the latter offering to reward him by giving up all that he had taken from the Parthians. His hatred of Tigranes made him more disposed to alliance with Rome; and after a period of hesitating neutrality Phraates accepted the overtures of Pompey and prepared to invade Armenia (66), guided by the younger Tigranes, who had quarrelled with his father and taken refuge in Parthia, where he wedded the daughter of the king. Tigranes the elder fled to the mountains; and, after forming the siege of Artaxata, which proved tedious, Phraates turned homeward, leaving young Tigranes with part of the army to continue the war. The latter, who alone was no match for his father, fled after an utter defeat to Pompey, who was just preparing to invade Armenia, and to whom the elder Tigranes presently surrendered at discretion. The Roman, however, gave him very good terms, altogether abandoning his son’s cause and even casting him into chains.
[9:18:596]

Meantime Phraates had occupied the Parthian conquests of Tigranes, which the Romans had promised him, and invaded Corduene (Beth-Kardo, now Jezírat bení 'Omar), whence he sent an embassy to Pompey to intercede for his son-in-law. But the Romans had no further occasion for Parthian help; and, instead of granting his request, Pompey commanded him to leave Corduene, and followed up the command by sending Afranius to clear the country and restore it to Tigranes. Immediately afterwards Pompey’s officer marched into Syria through Mesopotamia, which by treaty had been expressly recognized as Parthian; and it was another grievous insult that Pompey in writing to Phraates had withheld from him the style of “king of kings.” This no doubt was done out of regard to Tigranes, who claimed the sole right to the title, and had probably enforced his claim upon the weak predecessors of Phraates. Of the four subordinate kingships, the patronage of which was held to give a right to the title, Atropatene, Adiabene, Corduene are known, and the fourth was probably Orrhoene. All these had once stood under Parthian suzerainty, and, now that Phraates had recovered the lost territory of his predecessors including these states, he resumed, as his coins show, the proud title which had dropped since the days of Mithradates I., and to which Tigranes had lost his real claim. Nevertheless Phraates at first contented himself with again sending a fruitless embassy to demand that Pompey would observe the treaty and acknowledge the Euphrates as the Parthian frontier, and it was only when Pompey had gone to Syria (64) that he again attacked and defeated Tigranes. Pompey declined to interfere by force and burden himself with a Parthian war while Mithradates of Pontus was still under arms, but, as both sides appealed to him, he sent umpires to settle the dispute (which probably turned on the possession of Corduene), and a peaceable solution was effected.^[201. Dio, using in xxxvii. 6 a different source from that which lay before him at xxxvi. 51, has not observed that the former recapitulates the whole story from the beginning, including the rebellion and defeat of the younger Tigranes as related above.] The Romans had done more than enough to irritate Parthia and not enough to inspire respect, but, as the Parthians were only beginning to recover from the inner and outer troubles of the last two decennia, they were not yet prepared to enter on a struggle with Rome.

For a century and a half up to the death of Mithradates the Great there had been an unusual degree of unity in the house of the Arsacids; but the corruptions to which every Eastern dynasty ultimately falls a prey appeared at length. About 57 Phraates, the restorer of the empire, was murdered by his two sons, one of whom, Orodes or Hyrodes I. (Zend, Huraodha), took the throne, while his brother Mithradates III. got Media;^[202. This is Dio’s account, and, though other writers dissent, it is justified by the coins. The coins of Arsaces Philopator (or Theopator) Euergetes Epiphanes Philhellen belong to Mithradates, — not, as Gardner thinks, to his father, for Theopator denotes a king whose father was Arsaces Theos, and these coins call him only “great king,” while Orodes (Arsaces Philopator—or Euergetes—Dicaios Epiphanes Philhellen) is called “king of kings.” Both princes, it will be observed, ultimately give up the title of Philopator, which marks them as colleagues or recognized heirs of their father,—an indirect confirmation of their guilt as parricides.] but the latter ruled so cruelly that he was expelled by the Parthian nobles, and Orodes reigned alone. Mithradates, with a loyal follower, Orsanes, fled to Gabinius, proconsul of Syria, who had already crossed the Euphrates to restore him by force when he was summoned by Pompey to restore Ptolemy XI. to the throne of Egypt (55). Mithradates, dismissed by the Romans, now tried what he could do without help. Orodes had at first to flee, but soon regained his position, mainly through the help of Surenas, a young noble who had the hereditary right of crowning the king, and was the second person in thè. empire in point of wealth, nobility, and influence, and the first in courage and political skill. Surenas took Seleucia by storm; Babylon received Mithradates, but was reduced by famine; Mithradates then surrendered to his brother and was killed before his eyes. These events carry us far into the year 54.

Meantime Crassus, hoping for a rich and easy prey, had invaded Mesopotamia without a shadow of pretext, had defeated a small Parthian force at Ichnae, and occupied a number of large towns, such as Nicephorium, Ichnae, Carrhae, whose Greek inhabitants welcomed the Romans as liberators. As Mithradates was at this time in arms in Babylonia, we can understand why Crassus was blamed for a grave error of judgment in not marching direct from Nicephorium on Seleucia and Babylon (Plut., Crassus, 17). Instead of this, he retired to winterquarters in Syria, leaving 7000 foot and 1000 horse to garrison the Mesopotamian cities. Thus his hands were tied for the following campaign, and he could not accept the invitation of Artavasdes II. of Armenia to advance through his country and have his co-operation. A Parthian embassy appeared in Syria in spring to remonstrate against the faithlessness of Rome, but at the same time the Parthians were ready for war. Surenas, with Silaces, satrap of Mesopotamia, was pressing the Roman garrisons, and prepared to confront Crassus with an army wholly composed of cavalry, while Orodes in person invaded Armenia. In the spring of 53 Crassus crossed the Euphrates at Zeugma with seven legions and 8000 cavalry and light troops, making up a total of 42,000 or 43,000 men,^[203. Florus says eleven legions and Appian 100,000 men; but Appian lias made the mistake of adding to the legion its auxiliaries and counting the whole at the higher footing adopted under the empire. Seven such legions with the 8000 cavalry and light troops, and the 8000 men in garrison, make up his total. For the campaign of Crassus we have two independent narratives preserved in Plutarch and Dio; Plutarch’s is the older account, full of colour and valuable detail, but lacking in topographical precision; in this respect Dio’s source is much to be preferred, but it has suffered from that author’s somewhat arbitrary way of meddling with his materials. The accounts based on Livy (Perioche lib., 106; Florus, iii. 11; Festus Rufus, Bren, 17, and Orosius, vi. 13) agree in all essential points with Plutarch, who, however, draws not from Livy but from some Greek writer, perhaps Nicolaus of Damascus.] and was persuaded by Abgar of Orrhoene to leave the river and march straight across the plains against Surenas. At midday, 6th May (9th June as the calendar then stood) the Romans had crossed the Balissus (Nahr Belik) and met Surenas half way between Carrhae and Ichnae, or a little nearer the latter town. They were not, therefore, in the desert—as the older account represents—for it begins beyond the Chaboras.^[204. Plutarch himself speaks of marshes (cap. 25); the only modern account that agrees with the facts is that of G. Rawlinson, p. 163 sq.] Surenas kept the mass of his troops concealed by a wooded hill, showing only the not very numerous vanguard of cataphracts till the Romans were committed to do battle. The Roman cavalry under Publius Crassus, son of the proconsul, charged the enemy to prevent a threatening flank movement, and were drawn away from the mass of the army by the favourite Parthian manoeuvre of a simulated flight, and then surrounded and cut to pieces. The mass of the Roman host lost courage at this disaster, and already had suffered terrible loss from the light-armed hordes of Parthian serfs who hovered round the enemy at a safe distance and galled it with arrows shot with deadly precision. The legionaries serried their ranks and covered themselves with their shields; but in this close order they were easily broken by the charge of the Parthian freemen with their long heavy lances and almost impenetrable suits of complete armour. The heat, too, thirst, and dust oppressed the Romans, and this first day would have decided their fate but that the Parthians withdrew before evening, true to their rule of encamping [9:18:597] at a distance from the foe. Crassus retired at night, leaving all who were badly wounded behind him, and reached Carrhae safely; but his army was sadly demoralized, and he himself lost his head, and, though fairly secure at Carrhae, thought only of immediate retreat to Syria.^[205. That he waited for the new moon— i.e., some twenty days, as Dio says—seems to be a mistake. Perhaps it is due to Dio himself; at all events, the older account is preferable.] He marched by night northwards towards the mountains; the several divisions lost one another and each sought only to shift for itself. The quaestor Cassius, one of Crassus’s best officers, returned to Carrhae and thence regained Syria in safety. Crassus himself, after getting dangerously entangled in marshy ground, had almost reached the mountains when he was induced, by the despair of his troops rather than by error of his own judgment, to yield to treacherous proposals of Surenas and descend again into the plain. As he mounted the horse which was to convey him to a meeting with the enemy’s general the gestures of the Parthians excited suspicions of treachery, a struggle ensued, and Crassus was struck down and slain. Scarcely 10,000 men out of the whole host reached Syria by way of Armenia (Appian, B. C., ii. 18); 20,000 had fallen and 10,000 captives were settled in Antioch, the capital of Margiana. The token of victory, the hand and head of Crassus, reached Orodes in Armenia just as he had made peace with Artavasdes and betrothed his eldest son Pacorus to the daughter of the Armenian king. The Roman disaster was due primarily to the novelty of the Parthian way of assault, which took them wholly by surprise, and partly also to bad generalship; but the Romans always sought a traitor to account for a defeat, and in the present case threw the blame partly on Andromachus of Carrhae, who really did mislead Crassus in his retreat, and was rewarded by the Parthians with the tyranny of his native town (Nic. Dam., in Athen., vi. p. 252 D),^[206. The Parthians leaned much on the despots of the Greek cities. Zenodotia, the only Mesopotamian town that Crassus had to storm, had a despot, Apollonius.] but had no great influence on the disaster, and partly on Abgar, whose advice was no doubt bad, but not necessarily treacherous,^[207. The alternative of a march along the Euphrates was also open to serious military objections.] while the silence of the older account disposes of Dio’s improbable assertion that the men of Orrhoene fell on the rear of the Romans. That the Parthians did not count Abgar their friend and punished him Λvith deposition may be fairly inferred from the list^[208. It must be remembered that a correction of four years has to be applied to all the dates in this list.] of kings of Edessa given by Dionysius of Telmahar, which shows that the reign of Abgar II. ended in 53, and was followed by a year of interregnum.

Surenas, the victor of Carrhae, whose fame was now too great for the condition of a mere subject, was put to death a little later, the victim of Orodes’s jealousy; the victory itself was weakly followed up. Not till 52 was Syria invaded, and then with forces so weak that Cassius found the defence easy. In July 51 (Sextilis, according to the old calendar) the attack was renewed with greater forces; the Romans were still weak in troops, their harshness and injustice had alienated the provincials, and some districts— as Judaea—openly sympathized with the foe. Thus all the chances were still favourable to the Parthians, who indeed overran the open country, but were too unskilled in siege to take Antioch. As they drew off, Cassius stopped their way at Antigonia and inflicted on them a defeat in which Osaces, the real leader of their host under the young prince Pacorus, was mortally wounded (August 51). Pacorus wintered in Cyrrhestica, the Romans under the new proconsul Bibulus not venturing beyond the walls of Antioch; but, the satrap of Mesopotamia^[209. The name was Orondapates, corrupted to Όρνοδαπάντη in Dio, xl. 30.] having raised a revolt against Orodes in the name of Pacorus, the latter was recalled by his father and Syria was entirely evacuated by May 50.

Orodes avoided the threatened breach with his son by associating Pacorus in the empire;^[210. So the coins show, Gardner, p. 41.] but the Parthians took little advantage of the civil wars that preceded the fall of the Roman republic. They occasionally stepped in to save the weaker party from utter annihilation, but even this policy was not followed with energy, and Orodes refused to help Pompey in his distress because the Roman would not promise to give him Syria. The Pompeian Caecilius Bassus was saved from Caesar’s general Antistius Vetus by the sudden appearance of a Parthian force under Pacorus, which, however, retired when winter came on (December 45). In 43, again, Cassius had a force of mounted Parthian bowmen with him in Syria, but dismissed them when he marched to join Brutus and face the triumvirs. Labienus was with Orodes negotiating for help on a larger scale when the news of Philippi arrived, and remained with him till 40, when he was at last sent back to Syria, together with Pacorus and a numerous host. The Roman garrisons in Syria were old troops of Brutus and Cassius, who had been taken over by Antony; those in the region of Apamea joined Labienus; Antony’s legate Decidius Saxa was defeated, and fled from the camp afraid of his own men. Apamea, Antioch, and all Syria soon fell into the hands of the Parthians, and Decidius was pursued and slain. Pacorus advanced along the great coast road and received the submission of all the Phoenician cities save Tyre. Simultaneously the satrap Barzaphranes appeared in Galilee; the patriots all over Palestine rose against Phasael and Herod (see Israel, vol. xiii. p. 425); and five hundred Parthian horse appearing before Jerusalem were enough to overthrow the Roman party and substitute Antigonus for Hyrcanus. The Parthian administration was a favourable contrast to the rule of the oppressive proconsuls, and the justice and clemency of Pacorus won the hearts of the Syrians. Meantime Labienus had penetrated Asia Minor as far as Lydia and Ionia; the Roman governor Plancus could only hold the islands; most of the cities opened their gates to Labienus, the “Parthicus Imperator,” Stratonicea alone resisting and successfully standing a siege. But Rome even in its time of civil divisions was stronger than Parthia; in 39 Ventidius Bassus, general for Antony, suddenly appeared in Asia and drove Labienus and his provincial levies before him without a battle as far as the Taurus. Here the Parthians came to Labienus’s help, but, attacking rashly and without his co-operation, they were defeated by Ventidius, and Labienus’s troops were involved in the disaster. Labienus himself escaped to Cilicia, but was captured and executed by the Egyptian governor of Cyprus. In the passes of the Amanus the Romans were again in danger, but Ventidius at length gained a decisive victory at Trapezon, north of the Orontes valley, where Phranipates, the ablest lieutenant of Pacorus, fell; and the Parthians evacuated Syria. Before Ventidius had completed the resettlement of the Roman power in Syria and Palestine, and while his troops were dispersed in winterquarters, the Parthians fell on him again with a force of more than 20,000 men and an unusually large proportion of free cavaliers in full armour. Ventidius, however, gained time to bring up legions from Cappadocia by deceiving a dynast of Cyrrhestica, who was Pacorus’s spy. Then a battle was fought near the shrine of Hercules at Gindarus in Cyrrhestica, on the anniversary, it is said, of the defeat of Crassus (9th June 38), and the Parthians were [9:18:598] utterly routed and Pacorus himself slain. His head was sent round to the cities of Syria which λvere still in revolt to prove to them that their hopes had failed. There was no further resistance save from Aradus and Jerusalem.

Orodes, now an old man and sorely afflicted by the death of his favourite son, nominated his next son, Phraates, as his colleague, and the latter began his reign by making away with brothers of whom he was jealous as the sons of a princely mother, daughter of Antiochus of Commagene, and then strangling his father, who had not concealed his anger at the crime (37). The reign of Orodes was the culminating point of Parthian greatness, and all his successors adopted his title of “king of kings, Arsaces Euergetes” (taken from Phraates II.) “Dicaios” (first borne by the prétendant spoken of at p. 595, who was perhaps father of Sinatruces, and so ancestor of the succeeding princes) “Epiphanes” (like Mithradates I.) “Philhellen”^[211. Orodes indeed knew Greek and cared for Greek literature. The Bacchae was performed at his son’s betrothal.] (like Phriapatius). It was he who moved the capital westward to Seleucia, or rather to Ctesiphon (Taisefún), its eastern suburb.^[212. Ctesiphon was capital at the time of Crassus’s invasion, and Ammianus (xxiii. 6, 23) calls Pacorus the second founder of the city, the first Vardaues being perhaps a mythical person. A coin of Orodes with the title κτιστηs (Gardner, 39) may refer to this.]

Phraates IV. continued his reign in a series of crimes, murdering every prominent man among his brothers, and even his own adult son, that the nobles might find no Arsacid to lead their discontent. Many of the nobles fled to foreign parts, and Antony felt encouraged to plan a war of vengeance against Parthia.^[213. Of this war we have three accounts, all based on one source, probably a monograph by Dellius. The best is Plutarch’s ( l Ank, 37 sq., favourable to Antony). The later minor historians (who drew from Livy) and Dio (xlix. 23 sq.) are hostile to Antony (Octavianist); but the former, while sharing Dio’s general point of view, approach Plutarch in many points of detail. Plutarch drew from the original source, indirectly perhaps through Nic. Dam.; Dio used Livy, but not exclusively. The point in the story where the mutual relations of the several narratives come out most clearly is in what is said of the adviser who saved the Romans from utter destruction.] Antony had no hope of forcing the well-guarded Euphrates frontier, but since the death of Pacorus Armenia had again been brought under Roman patronage, and he hoped to strike a blow at the heart of Parthia through Atropatene. Keeping the Parthians in play by feigned proposals of peace while he matured his preparations, he appeared in Atropatene in 36 with 60,000 legionaries and 40,000 cavalry and auxiliary troops, and at once formed the siege of the capital Phraaspa (Takht-i-Suleimán). The Median king Artavasdes, son of Ariobarzanes,^[214. Mon. Ancyr., col. vi. 1. 12.] had marched to join Phraates, who looked for the attack in another quarter. Phraates had only 40,000 Parthians, including but 400 freemen who never left the king, and probably 10,000 Median cavalry;^[215. Plut., Ant., 44 ; Justin, xli. 2, 6. The number 10,000 is given by Apollonides in Strabo, xi. p. 523.] but these forces were well handled, and the two kings had reached the scene of war before Antony was joined by his baggage and heavy siege-train, and opened the campaign by capturing the train and cutting to pieces its escort of 7500 men under the legate Oppius Statianus. Antony was still able to repel a demonstration to relieve Phraaspa, but his provisions ran short, and the foraging parties were so harassed that the siege made no progress; and, as it was now October, he was at length forced to open negotiations with Phraates. The Parthian promised peace if the Romans withdrew, but, when Antony took him at his word, abandoning the siege-engines, he began a vigorous pursuit, and kept the Romans constantly on the defensive, chastising one officer who hazarded an engagement by a defeat which cost the Romans 3000 killed and 5000 wounded. Still greater were the losses by famine and thirst and dysentery; and the whole force was utterly demoralized and had lost a fourth part of its fighting men, a third of the camp-followers, and all the baggage when, after a retreat of twenty-seven days from Phraaspa to the Araxes by way of Mianeh (276 miles), they reached the Armenian frontier. Eight thousand more perished of cold and from snowstorms in the Armenian mountains; the mortality among the wounded was terrible; the Romans would have been undone had not Artavasdes of Armenia allowed them to winter in his land. The failure of the expedition was due partly to the usual Roman ignorance of the geographical and climatic conditions, partly to a rash haste in the earlier operations, but very largely also (as in the case of Napoleon’s Russian campaign) to the lack of discipline in the soldiers of the Civil War, which called for very stern chastisement even during the siege of Phraaspa, and culminated at length in frequent desertions and in open mutiny, driving Antony to think of suicide. The Romans laid the whole blame on Artavasdes, but without any adequate reason. At the same time the disaster of Antony following that of Crassus seemed to show that within their own country the Parthians could not safely be attacked on any side, and for a century and a half Roman cupidity left them alone.

The Median Artavasdes, whose little country had borne the whole brunt of the war, fell out with the Parthians about the division of booty, and made overtures to Antony for alliance with Rome; and in 33, when the Romans had treacherously seized the person of the Armenian Artavasdes and occupied his land, a treaty was actually concluded by which Symbace, which had once been Median, was again detached from Armenia, and Roman troops were sent to co-operate with the Median king in repelling the efforts of the Parthians to reseat on the throne of his fathers Artaxes, son of the deposed king of Armenia. These troops, however, were recalled before the battle of Actium, and then Media and Armenia Ml before the Parthians; the Romans who were still in the country were slain, and Artaxes II. was raised to the Armenian throne (30). In the very next year, however, the course of Parthian affairs led Artaxes to make his peace with Rome.^[216. See coins in Eckhel, vi. 82, compared with Dio, li. 16, and the reference in Horace, Carin., ii. 9, 20-22.]

Phraates’s tyranny had only been aggravated by his successes, and open rebellion broke out in 33. We have coins of an anonymous pretender dating March to June 32.^[217. Ascribed to Tiridates II. by Gardner, p. 44 sq.] To him succeeded Tiridates II., whose rebellion was at a climax during the war of Actium. Towards the end of 30 Tiridates succumbed and fled to Syria, where Octavian, who was wintering in the province, allowed him to remain. A fresh attempt made from this side, with the help perhaps of the Arabs of the desert, and by crossing the Euphrates at the island now called Koha, had better success. The order of events here given is that deduced by Vaillant and Longuerue, combining the Roman history of Dio with the Parthian of Trogus,—Lachmann, who makes Tiridates be expelled only once and supposes a mistake on the part of Trogus as to place and date of his meeting with Augustus, assigning 1st March 29 as the date of Horace, Carm., iii. 8; but the chronological difficulties of this view are insuperable. Phraates was taken by surprise and fled, slaying his concubines that they might not fall a prey to his victor (Isid. Char., 1). Tiridates seated himself on the throne in June 27,^[218. Daesius, 285 Sei. In this month there are coins of Phraates and also of an Arsaces Euergetes Autocrator Epiphanes Philhellen, who must be Tiridates II.] and Phraates wandered for some time in exile till he persuaded the Scythians to undertake his cause.
[9:18:599]

To understand who his helpers were we must take up again the thread of the history of the far Eastern lands. It was now a century since the Tibetan races who had supplanted the Greeks to the north of the Hindu Kush had first exercised a decisive influence on western affairs, and during most of that time there had been little change in the boundaries of empire in eastern Iran. Since the time of Eucratides the centre of Greek influence had lain more to the south of the Hindu Kush and in India proper, and this was perhaps one reason why Sogdiana and Bactria were lost so early; since that loss Greek power and culture had their chief and most lasting seat in the Cabul valley, where colonies of Alexander were particularly numerous.

The places where coins have been found—and these are almost our only source of knowledge^[219. For the facts used in this paragraph see especially Cunningham, in Num. Chron., new series, x., xii.] —prove that on the death of Eucratides the Indian country fell to Apollodotus and Bactria to Heliocles. Each of these held for a time the greater part of east Iran, but Apollodotus was the last Greek king who ruled over Kandahar and Sistan. For a time there were also separate kingdoms in the Cabul valley under Antialcides, and in the district of Peshawar under Lysias, but after a period of civil wars they were all merged in one great Graeco-Indian realm extending from Cabul to the Sutlej, and at times as far south as Barygaza; the capital was Çákala (officially called Euthydemia). Eight Yavana kings, says the Vâyu-Purána, reigned eighty-two years, and just eight names^[220. Demetrius, Eucratides, Apollodotus, Strato I., Strato II., Zoilus, Menander, Dionysius.] are found on coins whose distribution justifies us in attributing them to kings whose sway extended over the whole Greek realm. This confirms the historical value of the Indian source, and the eighty-two years will have to be reckoned from the time when Demetrius was driven out of Bactria and fixed his residence in the Punjab (c. 175), so that the end of the kingdom will fall about 93. Menander, the most important of the eight (c. 125-c. 95 ?),^[221. He must have had a long reign; see Sallet, Nachfolger Al. d. Gr., p. 34.] carried his arms farther than any of his predecessors, crossed the Hypasis, and pushed as far as the “Isamus,” a locality which must be sought much farther east than used to be supposed, since his coins are common as far as Mathura (Muttra) and Rampur, and Indian sources^[222. “Gárgí-Sanhitá,” in Kern, Varáha-Mihira, p. 37. This is an astronomical work of the 1st century of our era. The Isamus of Strabo, xi. p. 516, is probably the Sambus of Arr., Ind., 4, 4. The name is presumably corrupt, and Cunningham’s conjecture, ∑oαpou∙(the Çóna) for Ίσάμου, would suit best but for the graphical difficulty it involves.] tell us that the Greeks subdued Ayódhyá, the land of the Panchála, and Mathura, and even took the old capital, Pataliputra. The Greeks were too few to hold these exorbitant conquests without much concession to native habits and prejudices, and we learn without very great surprise from a Buddhist book that Menander became a Buddhist. The same source^[223. “Milinda-prasna,” in Hardy, Manual of Buddhism, pp. 516, 440.] tells us that Menander was born at Alasanda (Alexandria ad Caucasum) or at the (neighbouring? ) village of Kalasí. Buddhism was strong in this quarter at an early date, and a Buddhist stupa appears as type on a coin of Agathocles, who reigned in Arachosia and Drangiana about 180-165 (Sallet, op. cit., p. 95). A Greek source praises Menander’s just rule; the Milinda-prasna says, “In the whole of Jam-budipa there was no one comparable to Milinda Rája . . .he was endowed with riches . . . and guarded by military power in a state of the utmost efficiency ” (Jour. As. Soc. Beng., v. 532). When he died in the camp he received every honour paid to a deceased “chakravartti,” and his ashes were divided, as Buddha’s had been, in cenotaphs erected in every town. Perhaps political mingled with pious motives; the struggle for the dust of Menander mentioned by a Greek writer may be compared with that among the “diadochi” for the bones of Alexander, and so will be one phase of the many and long divisions among the Indian Greeks testified to by the coins. In little less than a century we have the names of twenty-three kings all later than Eucratides, and nine of them apparently later than Menander. They appear to belong to four kingdoms, the upper and lower Cabul valley, Peshawar, and the Punjab, and as there are but two names common to more than one king we may conclude that the rapid changes were often violent, that these were not fixed dynasties, perhaps that the kings rose by military election. All this confirms the Indian source (in Kern, ut supra, p. 38), “the fiercely-fighting Greeks did not stay in Madhyadeça; there was a cruel dreadful war in their own kingdom between themselves.”

All the time that the Greek kingdom lasted there was beside it another whose kings bear Scythian or Parthian names; their coins belong chiefly to the western Punjab, the outrunners of the Kashmir Himalayas, and west of the Indus, Bajáwar, and sometimes Bamian. The founder of this kingdom was Maues, a younger contemporary of Demetrius and Apollodotus, whose types are imitated on his coins. The coins confirm the Chinese notice that the Sse, driven from their seats at Balkash and Issi-kul, founded a kingdom in Kipin (Cabul valley) about 161, with the correction that the kingdom did not at once extend so far west, the coins of Maues being found only in the Punjab. Now this is just the country (between the Indus and Hydaspes) which is said to have submitted without a war to Mithradates I. of Parthia, and we must probably assume that it was the Sse who put themselves under the Parthian empire, but that the arrangement was not a lasting one, the parties to it lying so far apart.

The kings of the Sse do not seem to have been Parthians,^[224. Mαι√ιjs differs only by a formative syllable from λϊαυάκης, leader of the Sacae at Gaugamela (Arr., iii. 8, 3). , Gvωvηs is a Parthian name, but really identical with that of Eunones, king of the Aorsi (Tac., Ann., xii. 15); the other five names can hardly be Parthian.] but the nation was one of the many Iranian nomad tribes that once roamed over the steppes north of Sogdiana, while their coins show that they were influenced by the culture of the Indian Greeks, from whom they copied the titles of “satrap” and “strategus.” The kingdom lay north of the Greeks, roughly bounded by the Cabul river and a line continuing eastward in the same latitude, and it is one of the unsolved puzzles of this obscure history how such a strip of mountain-land ever became so prosperous and powerful as it did under the second king, Azes, and how it was able to resist the might of Menander. We know from the Periplus that on the lower Indus the Parthians who fixed themselves there in the first Christian century had been preceded by a Scythian kingdom of sufficient permanency to leave to the district the name of Scythia or Indo-Scythia. But that the Sse were the founders of this remote kingdom is not so certain as is usually supposed; it is quite as possible that at the time when the Scythians overran Iran the founders of the Indo-Scythian kingdom advanced from Sacastane through the Bolan Pass. The Sse certainly did not force themselves wedge-like between the Greek settlements, and the chronology of the coins precludes the easy solution that their power developed only after the fall of the Greeks. The coins name five supreme kings—Maues, Azes, Azilises, Onones, Spalirises; the dynasty began about 161; Azes, the second king, restruck coins of Apollodotus; and there is not the least reason to doubt that he directly followed him, and that the power of the Sse under Azes fell in the time before Menander, when the Greeks were weak and divided. It was probably Menander who again drove the Scythians within narrower limits. The coins show further· a lack of unity in the late^ days of the Scythian kingdom, and, taking this fact with the smallness of the total number of names, we cannot conclude that it lasted much later than the Greek realms.

Hermaeus, the last of the Greek kings, held the lower valley of the Cabul river and Peshawar with the district around it and the belt of the Punjab opposite, and he reigned, as the effigies on his coins show, from youth to old age. These last days of Greek rule in the East fortunately receive light from the Chinese Annals (of the first Han). ^[225. See Ritter, Erdkunde, vii. 3, 682 sq.; and Abel Rémusat, Nouveaux Mélanges Asiatiques, i. 205 sq.] After the opening of trade with the West about 105 B.c. the Chinese also visited Kipin, but their agents in this remote realm were repeatedly plundered by the King U-to-lao (between 105 and 87). At length, under the son of the latter, the Chinese commander on the frontier joined In-mo-fu, son of the king of Yung-khiu, in a sudden attack on the king of Kipin, who was slain and In-mo-fu installed in his place. Difficulties arose between the new king and China, and when In-mo-fu ultimately tried to make his peace the emperor Hiao-yuan-ti had just resolved to break off all connexion with the distant western lands. As the Chinese kept no military guard of the western frontier till 59 b.c., ^[226. Abel Rémusat, Mem. de ΓAc., viii. (1827) p. 119.] and the new policy of Hiao-yuan-ti began soon after 49,^[227. See what is related for the year 46 in Hist. Gén. de la Chine, iii. 161.] In-mo-fu must have begun to reign in Kipin some time between 59 and 51. In 32 he again, but still in vain, sent tribute and attempted to reopen the profitable commerce with China. The coins keep us so well informed of the names of rulers in this period that In-mo-fu must be capable of identification, and no ruler can be meant but Hermaeus, who in the commonest dialect of Prakrit would be Hermaió, a word necessarily mutilated by Chinese inability to pronounce r. Yung-khiu is therefore Yónakí “the city of the Greeks.” The dethroned king of Kipin and his father U-to-lao must, from what the Chinese records tell of the origin of their power, be kings of the Sse; U-to-lao is probably Azó Ráó, “king Azes.”

We have Chinese accounts of the eastern lands of Iran in the time of open trade along the great south road from Phi-shan on the Chinese frontier over the Hanging Pass (beside Lake Yashil-Kul at the west end of the Alichur Pamir),^[228. This identification is obtained by comparing the old description of the Hanging Pass (Rémusat, Nouv. Mel., i. 209) with that of the pass traversed by the Chinese expedition to Badakhshan in 1759 (Hist. Gén., xi. 572).] and so south-west to Hian-tu (the Indians), and then to the fruitful and temperate plain of Kipin. The king of Kipin, a mighty lord, resided at Sün-Sün (perhaps Διονύσου, Dionysopolis or Nagara, now Jalalabad). The inhabitants were industrious and ingenious in carving, building, weaving, and embroidery, and in silk manufacture; vessels of gold and silver, utensils of copper and tin, were found in their bazaars. Their coins of gold and silver had a horseman on one side and a human head on the other. The silver pieces here described may be those of Hippostratus, or of any other of the later Greek, or of the Scythian kings; but as none of these kings struck gold the pieces of [9:18:600] Eucratides with his bust on one side and the mounted Dioscuri on the other will still have had course. South-west of Kipin lay the hot plain of U-ghe-shan-li (Kandahar and Sistan), where the southern road ended (necessarily at a considerable commercial town, therefore at Alexandria in Arachosia). Heiιce a road leads to An-si (in its original sense, supra, p. 593), first northward (to Herat) and then east (to Merv). The inhabitants of U-ghe-shan-li, which was too remote to be often visited from China, hated bloodshed and had weapons adorned with gold and silver. Their coins are described in the same terms as those of Kipin; and probably the latter had course, and there was no native mint. But there was an independent kingdom; and, as it is certain that Drangiana and Arachosia were not at this time (middle of 1st century b.c.) subject to the Greeks—no coins of the successors of Apollodotus having been found there—we conclude that this kingdom was that of the Sacae, who overran Iran in 128. Later Chinese writers say that the country was subject to An-si (Parthia), and Isidore of Charax (1 b.c.) makes Arachosia a Parthian satrapy. It was probably under Orodes that Arachosia was conquered and the Sacae confined to Sacastaue.

The latest coins of Hermaeus bear also the name of a king, Kujula-Kasó, first in the Arianian and finally also in the Greek legend {Koζoυλo-Kaδφιζoυ). Now the Chinese tell us {Mem. de l'Ac., xxv. 27, 29) that about a century after the Tochari (Yue-chi) conquered Bactria— i.e., 39-27 — Kieu-tsieu-khio, prince of Kuei-shuang, conquered the other four principalities of the Tochari and named his whole kingdom Kuei-shuang (Kashan). He then warred against the Parthians and took the great land of Kao-fu (Cabul), which had been subject to India, Kipin, and Parthia, as well as the neighbouring lands of Po-ta (north of U-ghe-shan li; to be identified with the Pactyes or Patans originally settled in Ghór) and Kipin. The last fact shows that Kieu-tsieu-khio is none other than Kofoυλo-Kαδ<∕xfoυ, who indeed is called on the coins Kashana-Yavugo, “king of Kashan,” and “steadfast in the fa,.h,” i.e., in Buddhism, which early found entrance among the Tochari. With this account of the conquest of Cabul it agrees that Isidore names Arachosia but not Cabul as Parthian. Now the war of the king of Kashan with the Parthians is none other than that undertaken by the Scythians to restore Phraates to the throne. Trogus had an excursus in this connexion on the Asianic kings of the Tochari and the fall of the Sacaraucae (doubtless before the increased might of the realm of the Tochari). These intestine conflicts of the Scythians seem to have been at their height during the exile of Phraates, and their issue decided his fortunes. The Romans followed these movements with attention because they threatened Tiridates, and Horace has repeated references to them of a kind that is ιnore than poetic fancy {Ccιrm., i. 26, 3 sq., and especially iii. 29, 26 sq.,— “Tanais discors,” wars of Tochari and Sacaraucae; “plans of the Seres,”lhe Chinese stood in close relation to these lauds and had powerfully intervened in the affairs of the Sacaraucae in 44).

Before the great host of the Scythians Tiridates retired without a contest. On 1st March 26^[229. Hor., Car., iii. 8, 19-20, belongs to this year, as appears from Phraates’s coinage of Daesius, 286 Sei. The reduction of the Cantabrians refers to Augustus’s personal presence in Spain in the end of 27 (Dio, liii. 22), not to their second reduction in 25, which could hardly be known in Rome on 1st March. The retreat of the Scythians refers to the Sarmatian war (Florus, iv. 12, 20).] the news of this had not reached Rome; but in June, as the coins prove,^[230. Prokesch-Osten, Monnaies des Rois Barthes, p. 37.] Phraates again held the throne. Tiridates fled to Augustus, who refused to give him up, but agreed not to support him, and restored to Phraates a son whom Tiridates had carried off and placed in his hands as a hostage. The Parthian in return promised to give up the captives and ensigns taken from Crassus and Antony, and fulfilled his promise in 20, when Augustus was in Syria. He would hardly have done so perhaps had not his throne been again insecure; there is a break in the Parthian coinage after October 23, and it is not resumed for many years —a sure sign of inner troubles. There is just one coin known of Phraates’s later years (October 10 b.c.; Gardner, ρ. 62), which probably marks his return from a second exile; for we know from Josephus (Λnt., xvi. 8, 4) that between 12 and 9 b.c. Mithradates IV. was on the throne of the Arsacids, and that Herod of Judaea was accused of plotting with him against Rome.^[231. Vaillant having missed this passage, no later writer cites it.] The revolt of Media Atropatene, which asked a king from Rome some time between 20 b.c. and 2 a.d., and received Ario barzanes II., son of Artavasdes, was probably about this time (Mon. Anc., vi. 9). In 10 or 9 b.c. Phraates took the precaution of sending his family to Rome so that the rebels might have no Arsacid pretender to put forward, keeping only and designating as heir his youngest son by his favourite wife Thea Musa Urania, an Italian slave-girl presented to him by Augustus. This was mainly a scheme of Urania’s, and she and her son crowned it by murdering the old tyrant. Phraates V., or as he is usually called Phraataces (diminutive), was thus the third Arsacid, in successive generations, to reach the throne by parricide.^[232. Of the Beni Jelláb, who reigned in Tugurt till after the middle of the present century, every sultan is said to have murdered his father, and Mahmud Shah of Guzeτat (1538-54) made all his wives procure abortion as the only possible protection for a king against attempts of sons on his life.]

Phraates V., whose first coin is of May 2 b.c., tried an energetic policy, expelling Artavasdes III. and the Roman troops that supported him from Armenia, and seating on the throne Tigranes IV., who had been a fugitive under Parthian protection. Ariobarzanes of Atropatene was probably expelled at the same time; a little later we find him in exile at Rome, and (in spite of Strabo, xi. p. 523, who perhaps had not the latest news) the old line of Atropates seems now to have been superseded by a line of Parthian princes. As Augustus did not wish to extend the empire, and Phraates was not very secure on his throne, neither party cared to fight, and an agreement was patched up after some angry words, Phraates resigning all claim on Armenia and leaving his brothers as hostages in Rome (1 A.D.). Phraates noλv married his mother, who appears with him on coins from April 2 a.d., a match probably meant to conciliate the clergy, as he knew that the nobles hated him. In fact he was soon driven by a rebellion (after October 4 a.d.) to flee to Roman soil, where he died, it seems, not long afterwards.

The Parthians called Orodes II. from exile to the throne. Of him we have a coin of autumn 6 a.d. ; but his wild and cruel temper soon made him hated, and he was murdered while out hunting. Anarchy and bloodshed now gaining the upper hand, the Parthians sent to Rome (before 9 a.d.), and received thence as king Vonones, the eldest of the sons of Phraates IV., a well-meaning prince, whose foreign education put him quite out of sympathy with his country. He preferred a litter to a horse, cared nothing for hunting and carousals, liked to be with Greeks, and relaxed the stringent etiquette that barred approach to the sovereign, and at the same time he tried to check peculation. A strong reaction of national feeling took place, and the main line of the Arsacids being now exhausted by death or exile, Artabanus, an Arsacid on the mother’s side, who had grown up among the Dahae and had afterwards been made king of Media (Atropatene), was set up as prétendant in 10 or 11 a.d. Artabanus was defeated at first,^[233. A drachma of King Vonones when he had conquered Artabanus is one of the earliest examples of the use of the personal name of the king instead of the throne name. The practice became common, and marks an era of disputed successions, when it was necessary to indicate to which prétendant a coin belonged.] but ultimately gained a great and bloody victory and seated himself in Ctesiphon. Vonones fled to Armenia and was chosen as king of that country (16 a.d.), but Tiberius, who was anxious to avoid war, and did not wish to give Artabanus III. any pretext to invade Armenia, persuaded Vonones to retire to Syria. By and by he was interned in Cilicia, and in 19 a.d. lost his life in an attempt to escape.

The clearest proof of the miserable results of continual civil war in Parthia at this time is that a Jewish robber state maintained itself for fifteen years in the marshes of Nearda and the Babylonian Nisibis a little after 21 a.d., [9:18:601] and that, when some satrapies were in revolt and others threatened it, the great king made a pact with the bandits to keep Babylonia in control in his absence. Yet amidst such constant rebellions Artabanus III., shrewd and energetic, not merely held his own but waged successful foreign wars, set his son Arsaces on the throne of Armenia, and challenged Rome still more directly by raising claims to lordship over the Iranian population of Cappadocia. Through the whole first century of the Roman empire all relations to Parthia turned on the struggle for influence in Armenia, and, much as he loved peace, Tiberius could not suffer this disturbance of the balance of power to pass unnoticed. He persuaded Pharasmanes, king of Iberia, to put forward his brother Mithradates as claimant to the Armenian throne. The Iberians, after having procured the assassination of Arsaces, advanced and took Artaxata, the capital; and, when the Parthians came against them under Orodes, another son of Artabanus, Pharasmanes strengthened himself by opening the Caucasian Gates to the Sarmatians,^[234. Josephus, Ant., xviii. 4, 4 (according to the MSS.), says Alans; ∑κvdαs is an interpolation. In modern as in ancient times Iberian kings have repeatedly followed the same dangerous policy to increase their strength. The power of the Christian kings of Georgia in the 12th century rested wholly on alliance with the mountain tribes.] whose chiefs were easily gained to fight where there was money or booty to be got. A bloody battle ensued; Orodes was wounded in single combat with Pharasmanes, and his troops fled, believing him to be dead. In 36 Artabanus himself took the field, but a widespread revolt, long prearranged by Tiberius with a Parthian party led by Sinnaces, rose behind him in the name of Tiridates, a grandson of Phraates IV., who had been chosen as prétendant from the Parthian princes at Rome, and Artabanus retired to Hyrcania to resume his old relations with the adjacent nomads. The Roman legate of Syria, Lucius Vitellius, with his legions, led Tiridates into Parthia, where his followers joined him; Mesopotamia, Apolloniatis, and Chalonitis did homage; and the Syrian and Jewish population of Seleucia, which hated the party of Artabanus (the oligarchy of the 300 “adi-ganes” drawn from the old Greek families), were gratified by democratic institutions. In Ctesiphon Tiridates was crowned by Surenas, but without waiting for Phraates and Hiero, satraps of two chief provinces (Upper and Rhagian Media?), who became his enemies for this slight. Nor were they alone in their jealousy of the absolute court-influence of Sinnaces and his father Abdagases. Artabanus was called back and appeared from Hyrcania with an auxiliary force of Dahae and Sacae; Tiridates retired to Mesopotamia, where his party was strongest, but his army melted away, and in 36 a.d. he took refuge in Syria. Much as Artabanus hated the Romans, his insecure position at home drove him in 37 to make an accommodation on terms favourable to them and send his son Darius as hostage to Tiberius. Indeed, he was again for a short time an exile with Izates of Adiabene,who, however, effected his restoration and was rewarded by the transference of Nisibis to him from Armenia, which the Parthians had again got in their hands, taking advantage of the foolish policy of Gaius Caesar, who had tempted Mithradates of Armenia to Rome and imprisoned him there. Artabanus died soon after his second restoration, probably in 40 a.d., as Josephus (Λnt., xviii. 7, 2) still mentions him in 39.

In Artabanus’s lifetime the second place in the empire had been held by one Gotarzes, who appears to have been his colleague in the upper satrapies, and perhaps his lieutenant in his flight to Adiabene. But there is monumental evidence^[235. On a Greek inscription at Bisutun he is “satrap of satraps and Γι6πoθρoi ’ (son of Géw); on a coin he probably appears as Góterzés, king of the kings of the Areani (east Iranians), son of Ge, “kalymenos” of Artabanus. The last title seems to mean “alter ego”; it appears miswritten r ιa ∖ iμ,evos in Dio, xl. 12, as applied to Silaces, whom Orodes I. sent against Crassus; comp. New Persian kahermán, “agent.” Philostratus, in his life of Apollonius, which contains much that is useful for this period, regards the expulsion of Gotarzes as a restoration of the Arsacids.] that he was not, as Josephus says and Tacitus implies, Artabanus’s son (except by adoption), and so we find that the succession first fell to Vardanes, who coined money in September 40. But in 41 Gotarzes appears as king. The cruelties of Gotarzes gave Vardanes an opportunity of return; in two days he rode 345 miles, and taking his rival by surprise forced him to flee, and occupied the lower satrapies, where he coins regularly from July 42 onwards. Vardanes now laid siege to Seleucia, which had been in rebellion since it opened its gates to Tiridates in 36, but was presently called away to meet Gotarzes, who had secured the aid of the Hyrcanians and Dahae. The renewal of civil war enabled the emperor Claudius, with the aid of the Iberians, to drive the Parthian satrap Demonax from Armenia and reseat Mithradates on the throne.^[236. In the chronology of what follows Longuerue’s arrangement has been brilliantly confirmed by the coins.] Meantime Gotarzes and Vardanes were face to face in the plain of western or Parthian Bactria, but an attempt on the life of the latter having been disclosed by his foe they made peace, and Gotarzes withdrew to Hyrcania, while Vardanes, confirmed in his empire, returned to Seleucia and took it in 43 after a siege of seven years.

Seleucia was then a city of vast resources; in the time of Pliny it reckoned 600,000 souls, and the neighbourhood of Ctesiphon had not ruined it as Seleucia had ruined Babylon. Indeed Strabo (xvi. p. 743) is probably to be believed when he says that Ctesiphon was founded as the winter residence of the Parthian kings mainly out of consideration for Seleucia, whose merchants would have been incommoded by the quartering on them of the rude hordes of nomads who formed the larger part of the army which surrounded the court. The friendship of the Parthians was necessarily impaired by the long rebellion and the insolence of the Seleucians: in 41 the Syrians and Greeks put aside their own quarrels and united to slaughter the Jews; the survivors fled to Ctesiphon, and even here the hatred of the Seleucians followed them in despite of the great king. Probably, therefore, it was as a rival to Seleucia that Volagases (or Vologeses) I. founded a little later Vologesocerta (near Hira) on a site very favourable for commerce. From the middle of the first Christian century Greek influence declined, and Orientalism revived in Parthia. The types of the Arsacid drachmae —the imperial money—grow more and more barbaric from the time of Artabanus III.; and Pahlavi legends, first found on coins of Volagases I., become predominant with Mithradates VI., the contemporary of Trajan.

Vardanes was deterred from an attempt on Armenia by the threatening attitude of Vibius Marsus, legate of Syria from 42 to 44, and the rest of his reign was fully occupied by internal affairs. In February 45 Gotarzes had renewed his pretensions and struck money, supported by the rebellious nobles, and Vardanes, after defeating him at the passage of the Erindes,^[237. Or Charindas (Ptol., vi. 2, 2), now the Kerind, which separates Mazandaran from Astarabad.] pursued him eastwards through the deserts, driving the nomads before him as far as the Sindes (Tejend), which divided the Dahae from the Arians, and returned boasting “that he had reduced nations who never before had paid tribute to an Arsacid.” The glory that was held to surround these exploits on a stage scarcely different from that on which the oldest Parthian history had been enacted is a striking proof of the neglect of the original home of the monarchy under the pressure of Western affairs; but that Vardanes was a great king is plain from the high praise of Tacitus and the attention which the greatest of Roman historians bestows on a reign which had no direct relations to Rome. Vardanes, whose last coin is of August 45, was murdered while hunting—a victim, we are told, to the hatred produced by his severity to his subjects. But in judging of the charges brought against him and his two predecessors we must remember that the rise of a new dynasty like that of Artabanus is [9:18:602] always accompanied by deeds of violence, and that the oppressed subjects are simply the utterly unruly Parthian nobles who had lost all discipline in the long civil wars, and could only be controlled by force.

After another period of dispute we now find Gotarzes again on the throne and coining regularly from September 46 onwards. But his qualities had not improved, and in 47 a secret embassy of malcontents was at Rome asking Claudius to send them as king Meherdates, son of Vonones. In 49 the legate, Gaius Cassius, did in fact conduct Meherdates (Mithradates V.) as far as Zeugma, where he was met by divers Parthian magnates, and ultimately, after a detour through the snows of Armenia, got as far as Nineveh and Arbela. But his only real strength lay in Carenes, satrap of Mesopotamia; Abgar V. and Izates, the kings of Orrhoene and Adiabene, pretended to be with him, but were in private understanding with Gotarzes, and deserted before the decisive battle in which Carenes was surrounded and Meherdates taken (50 a.d.). Gotarzes cut off his rival’s ears, but spared his life—an act of leniency most unusual in the East, which proves how much the national feeling of the Iranians despised the pretenders foisted on them by Rome.

Gotarzes died of a sickness, not before June 51, and was followed by Vonones II., who had been king in Atropatene, and was probably a brother of Artabanus III. According to the. coins his short reign began before September 51 and did not end before October 54.^[238. Gardner (p. 51) is wrong in ascribing this coin to Volagases I. Tacitus makes Volagases come to the throne in 52 or 53, but if this is right he must have been associated in the empire under Vonones.] He was succeeded by his eldest son, Volagases I., the brothers acquiescing in his advancement, although his mother was only a concubine from Miletus (comp. Tac., Ann., xii. 44, with Plut., Crassus, 32), and receiving their compensation by being nominated to kingdoms which gave them the second and third places after the “king of kings,”—Pacorus to Media or Atropatene and Tiridates to Armenia,^[239. Tac., Ann., xv. 2. There was at this time a fourth monarchy under a Parthian king in east Iran and on the Indus, and a fifth among the Scythians (or rather the Maskhuth) on the northern slopes of the Caucasus, where an Arsacid reigned in 19 a.d. (Tac., Ann., ii. 68). As the Median kingdom was subsequently united to the chief empire, the later Armenian historians, Agathangelus (Langlois, i. 109) and Sebéus (ibid., p. 199), are right in speaking of four Arsacid kingdoms.] which the Parthians invaded (in 52 ?) to expel the usurper Radamistus, murderer of King Mithradates. Radamistus was not finally disposed of till 54, when his own people rose against him. The · Armenians now offered no resistance to the Parthians, but the Romans were not content to lose their influence in the land, and their plans were favoured by the rising of a new prétendant, the son of Vardanes, against Volagases. The latter had marched to chastise Izates of Adiabene, whose conduct had been very ambiguous in previous embroilments with Rome, when a great army of Dahae and Sacae entered Parthia. Of the son of Vardanes^[240. His name was probably Nanes, for BNANO on a copper coin (Gardner, p. 51) must be read B[ασιλ^ωj] NdFo[υ].] we have coins from December 55 to July 58, and as the series of coins of Volagases begins only in 61 it was probably not till then that he had quite mastered his more powerful rival and consolidated his own authority. At first he had to evacuate Armenia, and in 55 he even gave up the chief Arsacids as hostages to Domitius Corbulo, Nero’s commissioner on the frontier. In 58, however, Volagases was again able to commence great operations in Armenia, though direct war between Parthia and Rome was still avoided, both sides accepting the fiction that what was done in Armenia was the private affair of Tiridates. The Parthians, indeed, were still in no condition for a great war; the intestine discords continued, and in 58 Hyrcania, one of the oldest Parthian lands, revolted and sent an embassy to seek alliance with Rome. In the same year, and in that which followed, Corbulo was able with little resistance to destroy Artaxata, occupy Tigranocerta, and set on the Armenian throne, supported by Roman troops, Tigranes V., a prince of that branch line of the Herods which had been established in Cappadocia. At length, in 61, Volagases made peace with the Hyrcanians, acknowledging their independence; then, solemnly crowning Tiridates as king of Armenia, he directed his whole forces against Tigranes. Open war with Rome, however, was still delayed by negotiations with Corbulo, who proposed a peace with a secret condition that the Roman troops should be withdrawn from Armenia. He felt, no doubt, that Tigranes, who had inherited the servility but not the vigour of his ancestor Herod, was not strong enough to secure the obedience of a population which greatly preferred the rule of the Parthians as their brethren in faith, manners, and descent. But Rome refused to confirm the treaty, and war was declared.^[241. Tacitus and Dio in this part of the history are both dependent on the very mendacious memoirs of Corbulo. Tacitus, as appears from Ann., XV. 16, distrusted his source and followed it with more discrimination than Dio, but is still more favourable to Corbulo than a criticism strictly proceeding on the known facts can admit to be right.] The first year of the war (62) was unfortunate for the Romans, and ended with the capitulation of Caesennius Paetus (who now commanded in Armenia) at Randea, on the southern bank of the Arsanias (i.e., Aradzani, the Armenian name for the upper Euphrates), near Arsamosata. The Romans evacuated Armenia and had also to build the Parthians a bridge over the Arsanias. Corbulo meantime was in Syria, and had purposely left Paetus in the lurch, contenting himself with securing the passages of the Euphrates and guarding them by castles on Parthian soil. He now came to an agreement with the Parthian general, Monaeses, to raze the castles in return for the evacuation of Armenia by the Parthians till Rome should be again consulted. Next year the war was resumed, and Corbulo, crossing the Euphrates at Melitene, had penetrated into Sophene when the Parthians earnestly sought peace. It was agreed that Tiridates should lay down his diadem and go to Rome in person to receive it again from the emperor, which was done accordingly in 66. The real advantage of the war lay more with Parthia than with Rome, for, if the Roman suzerainty over Armenia was admitted, the Parthians had succeeded, after a contest which had lasted a generation, in placing an Arsacid on the Armenian throne. After Nero’s death Volagases formed very friendly relations with Vespasian, which endured till 75. Meantime all Iran was sorely troubled by the Alans, who had spread themselves a little before over the plains on the north-west slopes of the Caucasus as far as the Don and the Sea of Azoff. In 72 the king of Hyrcania opened the pass of Derbend to these barbarians, who ravaged Media and drove King Pacorus into the recesses of his mountains, even capturing his harem. Armenia was also plundered, and the bandits retired laden with booty. In 75 the Alans entered Parthia itself and pressed Volagases so hard that he made an ineffectual application for help to Vespasian.^[242. It must have been against the Alans that Vespasian in this year, according to a Greek inscription of Metskheta (Journ. As., ser. 6, xiii. 93), fortified the castles of the Iberian Mithradates and of the Jamasdaites.] Vespasian’s refusal very nearly led to war, and Trajan, who was now governor of Syria, was prepared for a Parthian invasion,^[243. This is all that is meant by “Parthica laurus,” Plin., Pαneg., 14.] but Vespasian’s pacific firmness ultimately averted an outbreak.^[244. In Victor, Caes., 9, 10, read “ab illo” for “ac bello,” comparing the epitome.]

Wehavethe evidence of Tacitus (Ann., xi. 8) and Josephus (Ant., XX. 4, 2) that Bactria was the eastern limit of the Parthian empire [9:18:603] in 42 and 54 a.d., but in 59 the Hyrcanian ambassadors were able to return home from a port on the Persian Gulf without touching Parthian soil (Tac., Ann., xiv. 25). This implies that all the upper satrapies had been lost to the empire. The Hyrcanians were still independent c. 155 during the reign of Antoninus Pius (Victor, Epit., 15, 4). In 72 they held the whole southern coast of the Caspian, and for a time at least bordered on a Parthian kingdom which had succeeded that of the Scythians in Sacastane at a date subsequent to that of Isidore of Charax (1 B.c.). The names of seven kings of this dynasty, beginning apparently with an Arsaces Dicaeus, are known from coins. The most powerful of these was the Gondophares under whom, according to the legendary Acta Thomae ,^[245. See N. Rhein. Mus., xix. 161 sq.] the apostle Thomas came to India in 29 a.d. ; he reigned over a great territory, which in large part had formerly belonged to Parthia, his coins being found mainly in Herat, Sistan, and Kandahar, but also in Begram and sometimes in the Punjab; an inscription at Takht-i-Bahi, north-east of Peshawar, makes his twenty-sixth year the hundredth of an era which is probably that of the introduction of Buddhism in the Cabul valley.^[246. This was 500 years after Buddha (Z. f. K. d. Morgeηl., iii. 129), which would give the date 57 a.d.] The dynasty of Gondophares, however, was but loosely constituted: we often find two kings at one time; and the Periplus (70 a. d. ), which tells us of the possession of old Indo-Scythia by these Parthians, says that one king was constantly displacing another, a sure symptom of a moribund condition. One of the last kings, Sanabares, reigned a little after 78 a.d. (Sallet, op. cit., p. 158). The author of the Periphcs had also heard of the independent and very warlike nation of the Bactrians, i.e., the Tochari, whose greatest conquests fall at this time. Kieu-tsieu-khio, the founder of their power, died, according to Chinese accounts, at the age of eighty, and was succeeded by his son Yen-kao-chin, who conquered the Indus lands. The Tochari were then more powerful than ever, and ruled as far as Shao-ki or Oude. The coins, on the other hand, lead us to distinguish between Kozola - Kadaphes, the immediate successor of Kozulo - Kadρhizu (who borrows the latter’s name and titles, and whose copper money found at Manikyala in the Punjab may be dated by its offering a close imitation of the head of Augustus on denarii struck between 4 B.c. and 2 A.D.), and the real conqueror of India, Ooémo-Kadphisés (Ar. Hima Kapiçó), who reigned from about the middle of the 1st century a.d., and whose might is proved by his striking gold, which no one had done since Eucratides. His coins, frequent in Kabulistan and the Punjab, have been found as far as Benares. This evidence is reconciled with the Chinese account by an Indian notice in Kern, Vardha-Mihira, p. 39, which shows that the conquests of the Tochari were for a time interrupted. It speaks of a robber Çaka king who was very powerful (ι.e., Yen-kao-chin, or Kozola-Kadaphes), after whom there were five native kings. Of these the first four reigned but a few years, while the fifth, who is unnamed, had a reign of twenty years over a happy land, after which the Çakas began their depredations again. The unnamed king may be identified with a king wearing earrings, and therefore Indian, whose coins, found by sackfuls in Begram, and occasionally in the Punjab, Malwa, and even farther east, mark him as a neighbour and probably contemporary of Gondophares; they bear no name, but only the title “king of kings” and “great saviour.”^[247. This is perhaps the king qui regnavit sine nomine of Suetonius, De Regibus (Auson., Ep., 19).] The recommencement of the Çaka conquest will thus begin with Ooémo-Kadphisés, who was the immediate predecessor of Kanérki or Kanishka, the founder of the Turushka dynasty, whose accession in 79 A.D. is the epoch of the Çaka era (Oldenberg, Z.f Num., viii. 290 sq. ), and marks the consolidation of affairs in the East.

Volagases I. died soon after the Alan wars, leaving a just reputation by his friendly relations to his brothers—a thing so long unknown—His patient steadfastness in foreign war and home troubles, and his foundation of a new capital. Perhaps also he has the merit of collecting from fragments or oral tradition all that remained of the Avesta. ^[248. Dinkart, in Haug, Ρahl.-Ρaz. Gloss., p. 144, calls the king who did this only Valkosh (i.e., Volkash), descendant of Ashkan.] From June 78 we find two kings coining and reigning together, Volagases II. and Pacorus II., probably brothers. From 79 there is a long break in the coins of the former, and Artabanus IV. takes his place with a coin struck in July 81. This Artabanus appears as the protector of a certain Terentius Maximus, who pretended to be Nero^[249. Zonaras, xi. 18; Orac. Sib., iv. 124, 137.]; he threatened to restore him and displace Titus by force, and, though the pretender was at length given up, the farce, which was kept up till 88, might have ended in earnest but for the disorders of the times, indicated by a break in the Parthian coinage between 84 and 93, in which latter year Pacorus appears as sole king.^[250. There is a naive personal character about all the feelings of the Arsacids towards the Caesars. Artabanus III. orders deep mourning for Germanicus, and sends Tiberius an insulting letter, advising him to escape the hate of his subjects by suicide. Volagases I. urges the senate to honour the memory of Nero. In the support given to the pseudoNero legitimist sympathies with the Julii may have combined with the wish to pay back in their own coin the Romans who had so often backed Parthian prétendants.]

At this time the political horizon of Parthia was very wide, and its intercourse with the farthest East was livelier than at any other date. In 90 the Yue-chi had come to war with the governor of Chinese Tartary and been reduced to vassalship; in 94 a Chinese expedition slew their king, and, advancing to the “North Sea” (Lake Aral), subdued fifty kingdoms.^[251. Hist. Gên. de la Chine, iii. 393 sq.] The Tochari, one sees, like the Greeks before them, had neglected the lands north of the Hindu-Kush in their designs on India; even of Ooémo-Kadphisés no coins are found north of that range. In 97 Chinese envoys directed to Rome actually reached the Mediterranean, but were dissuaded from going farther by Parthian accounts of the terrors of the sea voyage, and in 101 Muon-kiu, king of the An-si (Parthians), sent lions and gazelles of the kind called “fu-pa” (βούβαλος) to the emperor of China. Muon-kiu reigned in Ho-to, i.e., Carta or Zadracarta in Hyrcania; he was therefore a king of the Hyrcanians, who also held the old Parthian lands east of the Caspian Gate, and may be identical with a king, rival to Pacorus, who struck copper coins in 107 and 108, if the latter is not identical with the later monarch Osroes. But anyhow the representative of the Parthian power in the west was still Pacorus II., who in 110^[252. The third year of Abgar VII. was the fifteenth of Trajan (Cureton, Aηc. Syr. Doc., p. 41); this involves a correction of + 23 years applied to all Dionysius of Telmahar’s dates for the later kings of Edessa, as well as a blank of nineteen years before Abgar VII.] sold the crown of Edessa to Abgar VII. bar ízat, and died soon after, making way for his brother Osroes, who coins in the same year, but had to reckon with two rivals, viz., Volagases II. (who reappears after an interval of thirty-three years), from 112 onwards, and Meherdates (Mithradates) VI. The latter was a brother of Osroes, and so probably was the former. None of the three was strong enough to conquer the others, and continual war went on between them till Osroes was foolish enough to provoke Roman intervention by taking Armenia from Exedares, son of Pacorus, to whose appointment Rome had not objected, and transferring it to another son of Pacorus called Parthamasiris. Trajan, who had quite thrown over the principle of the Julii and Flavii, that the Danube and the Euphrates were the boundaries of the empire, and was fully embarked on the old Chauvinist traditions of the republic, would not let such an occasion slip; and, refusing an answer to an embassy that met him at Athens, he entered Armenia and took Arsamosata^[253. Read μkχpιs Άρσαμοσάτων in Dio, lxviii. 19. Samosata was a Roman town, and if they had lost it first this would have been mentioned.] without battle, after receiving the homage of western Armenia (114). Parthamasiris submitted himself to the emperor, but Trajan declared that Armenia must be a Roman province, appointed an escort to see the Parthian over the border, and when he resisted and tried to escape ordered his execution,— a brutal act, meant to inspire terror and show that the Arsacids should no longer be treated with on equal terms. Armenia and the neighbouring kings to the north having given in their submission, Trajan marched back by Edessa, receiving the homage of Abgar. The campaign of 115 was in Mesopotamia, and the burden of it fell on Mebarsapes of Adiabene and his ally Mannus of Singara. At [9:18:604] its close Mesopotamia was made a Roman province; the Cardueni and the Marcomedi^[254. Entr., viii. 3; Festus Rufus, Breν., 20. Marcomedi are the Medes called Markh, the plural of Mar, “Mede” in Armenian.] of the Armenian frontier had also been reduced, and Trajan received the title of “Parthicus.” In 11G the Tigris was crossed in face of the enemy (probably at Jezírat ibn Omar), and a third new province of Assyria absorbed the whole kingdom of Mebarsapes. Once more the Tigris was crossed and Babylonia invaded, still without resistance from the Parthians, whose intestine disorders continued. A Roman fleet descended the Euphrates and the ships were conveyed across on rollers to the Tigris, to co-operate with the army; and now Ctesiphon fell and Osroes fled to Armenia, the north-east parts of which cannot have been thoroughly subdued. The Roman fleet descended the Tigris and received the submission of Mesene; but now, while Trajan was engaged in a voyage of reconnaissance in the Persian Gulf—plainly aiming at Bahrein—all the new provinces revolted and destroyed or expelled the Roman garrisons. The rebels, whose centre was in Mesopotamia, set Meherdates VI. at their head;^[255. What follows is drawn from Malalas, who has two passages (i. 351- 352 and 357-358) drawn from Arrian’s Pαrthicα, but placed in a wrong context. ' _] and, when he died by a fall from his horse in a foray on Commagene, his son, Sinatruces II., took his place, and was aided by an army which Osroes sent from Armenia under his son Parthamaspates. The reconciliation of the Arsacids among themselves was rewarded by the defeat and death of the Roman general Maximus; but jealousy now sprang up between the cousins, and of this Lusius, a second general sent by Trajan from Babylon, took advantage to draw Parthamaspates to the Roman side by a promise of the Parthian throne. Sinatruces was defeated and slain, Nisibis retaken, Edessa stormed and destroyed, and the whole rebellion put down; but Trajan now saw what it would cost to maintain direct Roman rule over such wide and distant conquests, and Parthamaspates was solemnly crowned in the great plain by Ctesiphon in the presence of Romans and Parthians (winter 117). An unsuccessful siege of Atra (Hatrá) in the Mesopotamian desert was Trajan’s next undertaking; illness and the revolt of the Jews prevented him from resuming the campaign, and after Trajan’s death (7th August 117) Hadrian wisely withdrew the garrisons from the new provinces, which would have demanded the constant presence of the imperial armies, and again made the Euphrates the limit of the empire. Parthamaspates too had soon to leave Parthia, and Hadrian gave him Orrhoene.^[256. He is the Parnathsapat who was king of Edessa from 119 to 123; this fact and its relation to Spart., Hadr., 5, has escaped notice owing to the false chronology of Dion. Telm.] Thus Trajan’s Chauvinist policy had no other result than to show to the world the miserable weakness to which discord had reduced the Parthians.^[257. A proof of this is that very few silver drachmae and no tetradrachms were struck between 96 and 120.] And the discord did not cease even now, for, though Osroes was restored, Volagases still continued to coin, whether as rival or as partner of his rule, in some part of the realm. Hadrian continued to preserve peace, though a war threatened in 123,^[258. δ See Dürr, Reisen des K. Hadrian, p. 48. The removal of Parthamaspates and restoration of the old dynasty of Osrhoene may have been a concession made on this occasion.] and in 130 he restored to Osroes his daughter taken captive by Trajan at Ctesiphon. Osroes died soon after, and Volagases II. became sole monarch, dying in November 148 at the age of about ninety-six, after a reign of seventy-one years.^[259. The Volagaesus who appears in connexion with an Alan invasion of Media, Armenia, and Cappadocia in 135 is from the context a different person, viz., the unnamed king of Armenia who was appointed by Hadrian in 117 (Spart., Hadr., 21), and whose successor took the throne between 140 and 143 (Eckhel, Doct. num. vet., vii. 14).] c

Volagases HL, who succeeded, had designs on Armenia, but an interview between him and Antoninus Pius (spring 155) delayed for a time the outbreak of war.^[260. Aristides, Or. Sacra, i. 493, Cant.; cp. Waddington, in Mém. Ac. Inscr., xxvi. (1867) p. 260 sq.] However, martial preparations went on, and on the death of Antoninus Volagases entered Armenia (162),^[261. For this war cp. the excellent monograph of E. Napp, De rebus imp. Μ. Aur. Ant. in Or. gestis, 1879.] expelled the Arsacid Sohaemus, who was a client of Rome, and made Pacorus king. The destruction of a Roman legion under the legate of Cappadocia (Aelius Severianus), who fell on his own sword, laid Cappadocia and Syria open to the Parthians; Attidius Cornelianus, legate of Syria, was routed, and the provincials were in such distress that they even began to speak of revolt from Rome. When late in the year Aelius Verus arrived from the capital he found the troops so demoralized by defeat that he was ready to offer peace; but, when Volagases refused to treat, the able lieutenants whom Verus directed from Antioch soon changed the face of affairs. The war had two theatres, and was officially called the Armenian and Parthian war.^[262. C. I. L., vi. Nos. 1377, 1457, 1497. For the order of events cp. Lucian, De Consc. Hist., 30.] Armenia was regained and Sohaemus restored by Statius Priscus and Martius Verus (163,164), while Avidius Cassius drove Volagases from Syria in a bloody battle at Europus, and, entering north Mesopotamia, took Edessa and Nisibis, though not without serious opposition.^[263. Details in Suidas, s.v. Zeυyμa; Luc., op. cit., 29; Fronto, Epp. ad Verum, ii. 1, 121, Naber.] At length, deserted by his allies (i.e., by the local kings, who were becoming more and more independent), Volagases abandoned Mesopotamia, and Cassius entered Babylonia, where, on a frivolous pretext, he gave up to rapine and fire the friendly city of Seleucia, still the first city of the East, with 400,000 inhabitants. The destruction of Seleucia was a hideous crime, a mortal wound dealt to Eastern Hellenism by its natural protectors; that Cassius next, advancing to Ctesiphon, razed the palace of Volagases to the ground may, on the other hand, be defended as a symbolical act calculated more than anything else to impair the prestige of the Parthian with his Oriental subjects. Cassius returned to Syria in 165, with his victorious army much weakened through the failure of the commissariat and by the plague, which, breaking out in Parthia immediately after the fall of Seleucia, spread over the whole known world. In the same year Martius Verus won hardly less considerable successes in Media Atropatene, then apparently a separate kingdom.^[264. This seems to follow from the fact that both emperors, who were already called “Armeniacus” and “Parthicus Maximus,” also call themselves “Medicus” (on a coin earlier than 28th August 165), Eckhel, iv. 76; inscr. of Signia, Orelli, No. 859.] The peace which followed in 166 gave Mesopotamia to Rome. This was the greatest of all wars between Rome and Parthia, alike in the extent of the lands involved and the energy of attack shown by the Parthians. The Romans used their victory with moderation, but Parthia, after this last effort, continued steadily to sink.

The Romans at the same time made an effort to compete with Parthia for the Chinese trade (especially in silk), which the latter had jealously kept in their own hands, and in 166 an envoy of An-thun (Μ. Antoninus) reached the court of the emperor Huan-ti, via the sea and Tongking. But the effort to establish a direct trade with China was unavailing, and the trade still flowed in its old channels when a second Roman agent reached China in 226, a little before the fall of the Parthian empire. The Chinese tell us that with India also the Parthians drove a considerable trade.^[265. The “Annals of the Second Han,” in Deguignes, Mem. Ac. Iηscr., xxxii. (1768), p. 358; Pian-i-tian, in Mém. Ac. Inscτ., viii. (1827) p. 124 sq. ; and Jοurn. As., ser. 3, viii. 278, 280 sq.]

Volagases · III. died in 191, having reigned forty-two years without civil war, and was succeeded by Volagases IV. During the civil troubles of Rome which preceded the establishment of the military empire this prince maintained friendly relations with Pescennius Niger ;. and his vassal Barsenius of Atra was permitted to supply a force of bowmen, who took part in the fighting against Septimius Severus at Nicaea (194). When Niger’s cause declined, however, Volagases allowed his clients of Adiabene to join with Orrhoene, now in revolt against the Roman power. The strongholds of Mesopotamia were taken, and their garrisons put to the sword; Nisibis itself was besieged. In truth, the Parthian could no longer pretend to control the policy of the princes on his frontier, who felt themselves their own masters since they had borne the chief brunt of the last two Roman wars. But in summer 195 Severus appeared in Mesopotamia, received the submission of Abgar VIII. of Orrhoene, and from Nisibis (which, with true insight into its strategic importance, he raised to a colony and great military station) directed two successful campaigns against Adiabene^[266. In Dio, lxxv. 3, read -rηv ΆρβηΧίτιν for τ-ηv αρχήν.] (196) and the Arabs of the Singara district, incorporating the latter in the province of Mesopotamia.^[267. Not only Herodian, iii. 9, but Capitol., Macrinus, 12, implies that these Arabs were Yemenites; the great migration of southern Arabs, which led to the foundation of the kingdom of Híra, had therefore already taken place.] The Parthians made no movement till Severus was busy with Albinus, when they ravaged Mesopotamia and besieged Laetus in Nisibis; but in 198 Severus was again on the scene of war, and they fell back without fighting, leaving the emperor free to prepare for next year a campaign on a great scale. In 199 a fleet on the Euphrates co-operated with the Roman army, and Severus, taking up an unaccomplished plan of Trajan, dredged out the old Naarmalca canal, through which his ships sailed into the Tigris, and took the Parthians wholly by surprise. Seleucia and Coche^[268. Dio, Exc., lxxv. 9, has Babylon, but it was a mere heap of ruins in the beginning of the 2d century a.d.] were deserted by their inhabitants; Ctesiphon was taken by the end of the year with terrible slaughter, 100,000 inhabitants being led captive and the place given up to pillage, for the great king had fled powerless at the approach of the foe. Severus, whose force was reduced by famine and dysenteries, did not attempt pursuit, but drew off up the Tigris. The army was again in its quarters by 1st April 200 {C.LL., vi. 225 a), and for some time thereafter Severus was occupied in Armenia. But in 201 he undertook a carefully organized expedition against Atra, from whose walls the Romans had been repulsed with great loss when Severus, returning from the Tigris in the previous year, had attempted to carry it by a coup de main. This city, which in Trajan’s time was neither great nor rich, was now a wealthy place, and the sun-temple contained vast treasures. The classical authors call Atra Arabian, but the king’s name is Syriac, Barsenius, i.e., Bar Sin, son of the moon, and we may suppose that it was really an Aramaean principality,^[269. Cp. Noldeke, Tabari, p. 34.] which, like Palmyra, had its strength from the surrounding Arab tribes that it could call into the field. Severus lay before Atra for twenty days, but the enemy’s cavalry cut off his foraging parties, the admirable archers galled the Roman troops, a great part of the siege train was burned with naphtha; and, when, in addition, two assaults had been repulsed with tremendous loss on two successive days, the emperor was compelled to raise the siege,—a severe blow to Roman prestige in the East, and one that greatly raised the name of Atra and its prince, but did not help the decaying power of Parthia in the least.

In 209 Volagases IV. was succeeded by his son Volagases V., under whom in 212 the fatal troubles in Persis began, while in 213 his brother Artabanus rose as rival claimant of the kingship;^[270. According to Mani, in the book Shaburkan, the 4th year of Ardhaban = 216/217; see Al-Bérúní, tr. by Sachau, pp. 121, 190. This proves that in 216 Artabanus was the recognized sovereign in the district of Ctesiphon to which Mardinu (on Habl Ibrahim) belongs; cf. Nöldeke, Tabari, p. 16.] and the civil war lasted for many years. A fresh danger arose when Tiridates, a brother of Volagases IV., who had long been a refugee with the Romans and had accompanied Severus’s campaign of 199, escaped, in company with a Cilician adventurer, the Cynic Antiochus, to the court of his nephew Volagases; for the emperor Antoninus (Caracalla) demanded their surrender, and obtained it only by a declaration of war (215). About the same time Artabanus gained the upper hand, and in 216 he held Ctesiphon and its district; but Volagases still held out in the Greek cities of Babylonia, as his tetradrachms prove (till 222). Artabanus’s strength lay in the north; the Arab histories of the Sásánians make him king of the Median region, and agreeably with this he coins only drachmae.^[271. See above, p. 601.] Presently Artabanus had a war with Rome on his hands; the pretext was that he had refused his daughter to Antoninus, but the emperor was mindful of his father’s dying advice to enrich the soldiers and despise all other classes, and saw a prospect of rich booty. In 216 the Romans penetrated to Arbela by way of Carduene and Calachene,^[272. Dio says they invaded Media, but Antoninus had not such a hold of Armenia as to open to him the route of the triumvir Antony, and a march from Gazaca to Arbela over Mount Zagrus is incredible. But, if Media at this time extended so far west as to include Arrapachitis and Calachene (the Marcomedians of Trajan’s wars), the campaign is intelligible, and Spartian’s mention of the Cadusians and Babylonians can be explained as a misreading of Kαpδovalas kal 'ApBhywv in a Greek source.] and violated the graves of the kings of Adiabene, which they falsely took for those of the Arsacids. Thus far the Parthians, who had been taken by surprise in full peace, had offered little or no resistance, but Antoninus was murdered (8th April 217) while he was preparing for a new foray, and his successor Macrinus at once found that Artabanus was now armed, and was not the man to let the insult to his territory pass with impunity. An overwhelming Parthian force fell on Mesopotamia and refused to be appeased by the restoration of the captives of the previous year; Macrinus was beaten in two engagements^[273. The lacuna in Dio, lxxviii. 26, is to be supplied by a passage of Xiphilinus, not given in recent editions.] and compelled to retire to Syria, abandoning the Mesopotamian plain; and in the winter of 217/218 he was glad to purchase peace for an indemnity of 50,000,000 denarii (£1,774,298). In or about 222 Artabanus must also have displaced his brother in Babylonia, for he was a patron of Rab Abba, who became head of the Jewish school of Sura in 219.^[274. Jost, Gesch. d. Jud., ii. 139.]

Persis, which dealt the last blow to the Arsacids, had through the whole Parthian period held an isolated position, and is so seldom mentioned that our knowledge of its history and native princes is almost wholly due to recently-found coins.^[275. See Mordtmann in Z. f Num., iv. 152 sq., vii. 40 sq.]

These embrace a triple series of silver coins and a class of copper pieces. The oldest of the latter class bears the name of Camnascires, and his is the only name in the class known to us from other sources, for Hyrodes and Phraates (each of which names was borne by two kings of the series) are not Arsacid great kings, as their title is only “king,” not “king of kings” (against Mordtmann). Nor do they seem to have ruled in the same quarter with the kings who struck silver; the latter were native kings of Persis, the former rather Elymaeans, who in the times after Camnascires were forced back in a south-east direction (as appears from the places in which the coins are found), and ruled parts of Persis side by side with the [9:18:606] native princes. Camnascires appears as an old man on coins of 82 and 81 B.c., and his ten successors whom we know from the coins carry us down to 36 a. d., the latest date at which the Elymaeans are mentioned as independent (Tac., Ann., vi. 44). The older coins have Greek inscriptions and often figurés of Greek gods, but under the fifth successor of Camnascires, i.c., about the time of Christ, Pahlavi takes the place of Greek and Mithras of Serapis.

The silver class, again, has in all three series Pahlavi legends and the fire-altar on the reverse. The first series has seven princes with the unexplained title “Feritkará,” the second has three kings (Malká), the third ten kings; the names are throughout either Achaemenian (Artahshetr, Daryav), pointing perhaps to a claim of Achaemenian descent, or sacred names like those common with the Sásánians (Nerseh, Yezdikert), or are taken from sacred legend (Minúchetr). The second and third series appear to be continuous (against Mordtmann); the last king of the second series is Zatúrdat (II.), the first of the third Dáryav (I.) son of Zatúrdat. With Dáryav I. the kings assume a Parthian costume, and his son Artahshetr II. is the only king of that name who from the number and various types of his coins can be fairly identified with the Artaxerxes of Isidore of Charax, who reigned “in the time of his fathers” (c. 80-50 B.c.), and was slain at the age of ninety-three by his brother Gosithres. As Dáryav I. must also have reigned for a considerable time this datum places him about the commencement of the Parthian supremacy, which naturally explains his Parthian dress. Then the princes of the first silver series will be Seleucid vassals, and the shorter series of kings before Dáryav independent princes falling between the Seleucid and Parthian suzerainty. Finally Gosithres, brother of Artahshetr II., has the same name as Gózihr, the last Bázrangí king before the rise of the Sásánians, so that it was probably one dynasty. The eight kings, in at least six different generations, who appear on coins between Artahshetr II. and Tírdat II., will carry us roughly to the middle of the second Christian century, leaving a space sufficient for Gózihr, the last Bázrangian, and the anarchy of the first days of the Sásánians.

The emblems on the coins show that Persis was always loyally Zoroastrian, and at Istakhr stood the famous firetemple of the goddess Anáhédh. Its priest was Sásán, whose marriage with a Bázrangian princess, Rámbehisht, laid the foundation of the greatness of his house, while priestly influence, which was very strong, doubtless favoured its rise. Pábak, son of Sásán, and Ardashír, son of Pábak, begin the history of the Sásánian dynasty, which occupies the next section of this article. Artabanus did nothing to check the use of the new power till Ardashír had all Persis in his hand (224) and had begun to erect a palace and temple at Gór (Firuzabad). Nírófar, king of Elymais, was then sent against him, but was defeated, and now Ardashír passed beyond Persis and successively reduced Ispahan (Paraetacene), Ahwaz (Elymais), and Mesene.^[276. The flourishing state of Mesene had, as its coins show, been long sinking into barbarism; the latest date they supply is 167 {Z. f. Num., viii. 212 sq.). A little earlier, in 143, they are associated with coins of Meredates, son of Phobas, king of the 0manians. The latter, already known to Pliny as dwelling in the desert west of Charax, must be the Azd from Omán, a part of whom shared the great migration and finally settled in Anbár and Híra.] After this victory Ardashír sent a challenge to Artabanus himself; their armies met by appointment in the plain of Hormizdján, and Artabanus fell (28th April 227). Ctesiphon and Babylonia must have fallen not much later, though Volagases V. seems to have re-established himself there on his brother’s death, and a tetradrachm of 539 Sei. shows that he held the city till autumn 227. The conquest of Assyria and great part of Media and Parthia is assigned by Dio expressly or by implication to the year 228, and so the Parthian empire was at an end.

The part of Parthia of which Dio speaks can only be Choarene and Comisene; it was only in a later expedition that Ardashír reached Sacastane, Hyrcania, Nishapur, and Merv, and these do not seem to have been Parthian. Indeed, from 58 A. τ>. Comisene appears to have been the most eastern satrapy of the Arsacid empire. Eastern Iran was in this period very flourishing under the Tochari of the dynasty which Indian sources call Turushka, and which can be traced on inscriptions till 213 and 259 (or 359). Kanishka, the founder of the dynasty, is said to have ruled Cabul and all Hindustan, and in fact his coins extend over all northern India. The empire of which Kashmir was a main province was wider than that of the Greeks had been, and also more consolidated, for strategi took the place of the native kings (Joum. As., ser. 3, viii. 264, and ser. 4, x. 95). So, too, Kanishka banished the native language from his coins, using Greek letters and his own foreign language. His predecessor had supplanted the Greek gods, except Helios, by Oriental divinities, and now Helios too gives way to the Iranian Mupo or Mtoρo. The motley pantheon on the coins of Kanishka and his successors gives an interesting glimpse of the faiths of the Indo-Iranian frontier. We find here the old Iranian popular deities: Jiao, the moon-god; Mupo, the sun-god; Naea, the goddess of war; Oaδo, the wind-god; Oρ ∖ ayvo, i.e., N érethraghnó (see Benfey, Z. I). Μ. G., viii. 459); Aυρo, identical with the Zoroastrian Ahura-mazda; we find also abstractions like the Izeds of the heavenly hierarchy in official Zoroastrianism, e.ff., Grip, i.e., Λniran, the eternal self-created lights, and Φαppo (Pers.,/arr; synonymous with Zend, hvarénó), the royal majesty, side by side with Indian deities, such as Siva, and a number of unknown deities with barbarous names brought from the old homes of the Tochari. Heracles and Helios appear transformed by barbarous pronunciation or epithets, and ∑αpαττo is the cosmopolitan Serapis, probably introduced, as in Elymais, by Alexandrian sailors. Buddha, too, appears (Sallet, Nachf Al., p. 189 sq.). The Buddhists were the most active religious body in the kingdom, and the king, if not actually a convert, as the legend claims, showed them such favour as gave their faith a wide missionary field and unparalleled success. The kings built many Buddhist meeting-houses, monasteries, and shrines, and it was Kanishka who called together in Kashmir the council of 500 fathers that finally redacted the Tripitaka collection. Ptolemy (vii. 1, 47) speaks of Tocharias the Kαστrιpαioι; the Chinese bear witness to their might in 159; and from 220 to 265 their empire retained its old compass {Journ. As., ser. 3, viii. 263, 268). Kashmir was lost in the course of the 3d century, but the western provinces remained. About 100 a.d. Greek ceased to be understood in east Iran, and from this,time we can trace a growing Iranian influence on the coins of the Tochari, especially in the Sásánian period. The latest coins of the Tochari come mostly from Balkh, so that they seem to have been gradually pushed backwards to the point from which they started. Finally, their empire was overthrown by another branch of their own race, for, early in the 5th century, those of the Great Yue-chi who had remained in their old homes, a little west of Badakhshan, were compelled, by the pressure of the Juan-juan of Tartary, to move west to Po-lo or Balkh, and thence, under their warlike king Ki-to-lo (Kidara; whence they are called Cidaritic Huns by Priscus, in Fr. H. Gr., iv. 102), crossed the Hindu-Kush and destroyed the old empire of the Tochari, founding in its place the kingdom of the Little Yue-chi. The date of this invasion can, from a variety of data, be fixed as c. 430, just about the time when the Sásánians, in 429, destroyed the last of the Arsacids in Armenia; and with this agrees the Indian statement that eighteen Çaka kings reigned 380 years (50-430 a.d. ). Their successors were still powerful in India about 520, and in their old homes their empire fell in 562.

Sources.—1. For the Macedonian Period. —For Alexander the sources are of two classes. (1) Arrian, and for the most part Plutarch also, drew from official Macedonian sources, especially the works of King Ptolemy and Aristobulus of Cassandrea. (2) An unofficial history, written by a Greek Clitarchus for the Greeks, is faithfully excerpted by Diodorus. Curtius and Justin (or rather Trogus) drew from a later work based on the same source but supplemented by extracts from a book of the first class and another book hostile to Alexander and of very indifferent authority. Droysen follows the writings of the first class exclusively, and indeed for military and historical points they alone are to be trusted. Grote uses also the works of the second class, which, though rhetorical, romantic, and uncritical, have the advantage of telling us many things that the official histories pass over, and, though they show little judgment themselves, are rieh in materials to guide our judgment. The historian must deal with tíie material as a philologist would deal with a book preserved in two classes of MSS., one good, the other interpolated but independent. One must first restore as nearly as may be the archetype of the second class and then use it to correct the text—or here the history—based on the first class. For the immediate successors of Alexander, Diodorus, the excerpts from Arrian in Photius, and Plutarch’s lives of Eumenes and Demetrius are our best guides, all three drawing from the excellent Hieronymus of Cardia. Trogus (Justin) makes a defective use of indifferent sources, and is good for little. Droysen’s is the best modern book; Grote is useful because he does not take so purely Macedonian a standpoint, but he deals mainly with the west, we have no really continuous ancient account for 301-220 b.c., for Justin’s narrative is even less worthy of the name of a history than in the preceding period. The scattered material is best collected by Droysen. From 220 onwards we have the excellent work of Polybius, at first complete and then in large excerpts. There are some good modern monographs, but nothing that can be called even a tolerable general history of the latest period of Macedonian rule in Asia.

2. For the Parthian Period. —The only continuous account of Parthian and Bactrian history which has reached us is Justin’s abridgment of Trogus Pompeius, ending with 9 b.c., and having also a lacuna, due to Justin’s carelessness, between 94 and 55 b.c. For the wars with Rome in 53 and 36 b.c., Plutarch’s Crassus and Antonius give full accounts. Under the early Caesars the Parthians were, in a sense, viewed as sharing the empire of the world with Rome (Strabo, xi. p. 515; Just., xli. 1, 1), and Roman historians began briefly to note events in Parthian history which had no direct connexion with Roman affairs. Thus, from 69 b.c. to 72 a.d., Dio, Josephus, and Tacitus give us pretty complete accounts. Between 94 and 69 b.c. and between 72 and 227 a.d. the history is very much lost. The coins are most valuable, especially after 37 B.c., when they begin to be dated; for the later period they are our chief aid, the excerpts from Dio not helping us much.

Aids.—Foy Vaillant, Arsacidarum imperium (Paris, 1728), and Du Four de L·ongucruc, Annales A rsacidarum (Strasb., 1732), are still indispensable compilations, to which G. E. J. Guilhem de Sainte-Croix, “Mem. sur le gouvernement des Parthes,” Afém. Ac Inzer., 1. 48 sq., 755 sq., gives a good supplement. The most important modern books are those that explain the coins historically—

(Paris, 1853)—and the catalogues of coins in Prokesch-Osten's Monnaies des rois Parthes (Paris, 1874-75) and P. Gardner's Parthian Coinage (London, 1877). There are also recent histories of Parthia by Rawlinson, Schneiderwirtħ, and Spiegel, and a book on the coins by Lindsay.

Chron., vols, viii.-xii.; and Sallet, Nachfolger Alexanders des Gr. in Baktrien und Indien (Berlin, 1878). (A. v. G.)

Section III.— Sásánian Empire.

Of the minor kings who ruled in Persis, in the Arsacid period, in real or nominal allegiance to the Parthian “king of kings” we know some names from coins or ancient writers, but we cannot tell whether they were all of one dynasty. In the beginning of the 3d century the kings, who then belonged to a dynasty of which the name probably was Bázrangík, had lost much of their power; lesser potentates ruled in various parts of the land, which, by being all mountainous, falls naturally into ill-connected sections. One of these local princes was Pápak, or, in the more modern pronunciation, Pábak,^[277. The Arabs, having no p, pronounce Bábak; but this is not Persian. In general the forms of proper names followed in this article give the more recent pronunciation, which may have prevailed about the end of the Sásánian period.] son or descendant of Sásán, a native of the village of Klnr on the southern margin of the great salt lake east of Shíráz. Pábak overthrew Gózihr, the last prince of the Bázrangík, and became master of the district of Istakhr (Persepolis), and the coins and inscriptions of his son give him the title of king. His legitimate heir was his son Shápúr, for whom Pábak is said to have asked recognition from the Arsacids; but on Pábak’s death a second son, Ardashír, refused to acknowledge his brother, and was in arms against him when Shápúr died suddenly, and hardly by mere accident. That Ardashír’s claims were opposed by his brothers and that he put them to death are not to be doubted, as we have these facts from a tradition of strictly legitimist tendency.

Tradition names various local princes conquered by Ardashír for himself or for his father, and perhaps Pábak before his death was already lord of all Persis. Ardashír, at least presumably, was so when he struck the coins still extant.^[278. These show a full-face portrait with the legend “Artakhshathr king.” The reverse has his father’s portrait in profile with the legend “son of the divine Pápak.” The older form of Ardashír’s name, Artakhshathr, is the ancient Achaemenian name, which the Greeks write Artaxerxes, and which, singularly enough (together with the name Darius, Dáryáv, Dáráb, Dárá), had survived in the home of the Achaemenians, although genuine Persian tradition had lost all memory of the old empire.] Ardashír, who is to the Sásánian what Cyrus was to the Achaemenian empire, probably came to the throne in 211/212 a.d. ^[279. See A. v. Gutschmid, in Z. D. M.G., xxxiv. 734.] From the first he plainly leaned on the clergy of the Zoroastrian faith, which all through the Macedonian and Parthian eras had undoubtedly continued to be the religion of the people in Irán proper, and especially in Persis. The Parthian monarchs were Zoroastrians, but probably often very lukewarm in the faith. Ardashír, on the contrary, ostentatiously placed symbols of fire-worship on his coins, and on his inscriptions boasts himself a “Mazdayasn,” or orthodox Zoroastrian. From his days onward the often fanatical and persecuting clergy enjoyed great power in the Sásánian empire, and the hierarchical organization of the state church, so similar to that of the Christian clergy, probably dates from Ardashír; it is referred to, at least, on the inscriptions of his immediate successors. Popularity and a certain religious prestige were the natural fruits of this orthodox zeal on the part of Ardashír, but his success was essentially the fruit of his energy and valour. Slowly and not without toil he rose from king of Persis to be king of the kings of Irán. He began by subduing successively Kirinán, Susiana, and the petty states at the mouth of the Tigris. But after this he came into conflict with the great king, whom, according to the contemporary account of Dio Cassius, he smote in three battles. The decisive engagement with Ardaván (Artabanus) in which the last Parthian monarch fell, and where Ardashír gained the title of “king of kings,” seems to have been on 28th April 224 (or 227, according to A. v. Gutschmid), and was probably fought in Babylonia or Susiana, for the next enterprise of Ardashír was an unsuccessful attack on the strong walls of Hatra, which perhaps was not taken and destroyed till the reign of his successor. Ardashír conquered Media, where an Arsacid prince was his adversary, and gained the greater part of the Iránian highlands, but failed in Armenia, whither a son of Ardaván had fled.

The Romans saw with concern the rise of a prince who already directed his aims against their Asiatic possessions, and seems to have had some success in this quarter, till in 233 he was smitten by Alexander Severus in a great battle.^[280. Lampridius, Al. Sev., 56. His statement rests on documentary evidence, and is accepted by Tillemont and by Clinton, who confirms it from coins. The attachment of the troops from Orrhoene for Alexander (Capitol., Maximinus, ii.) was probably connected with his liberation of their country from the Persians. Rawlinson’s and Spiegel’s preference for the statement of the romancer Herodian, that the Persians were the victors, is pseudo-criticism.] Henceforth, though peace was often made between the two powers, they remained constant rivals,—and rivals on equal terms, for, though under able rulers and when the inner condition of the empire was not greatly disturbed, the Europeans of Rome or Byzantium were still too strong for the Asiatics, the tables were not seldom turned, and Rome sustained many a shameful defeat. This struggle fills the chief place in the political history of the Sásánians; and the inner development of the empire, its martial and political institutions, its art and industry, were also most powerfully influenced by the superior civilization of the West.

The nominal capital was always at Istakhr, where, for example, the holy “pyreum” of the royal house stood, and where the heads of conquered foreign kings were hung up. But the real metropolis was the Arsacid capital of Ctesiρhon, with Ardashír’s new foundation of Veh-Ardashír, just across the Tigris on the site of the old Seleucia. The rich alluvial land that surrounded these twin cities was no part of Irán proper, and its inhabitants were mainly Semites; but old example, and probably its vicinity to Roman soil, marked it out for the true seat of government.

The extent of the empire at the time of Ardashír’s death is uncertain, for the national tradition ascribes to him some conquests that were really made by his successors, and others which the Sásánians never made at all. Shápúr, his son, calls himself on his inscriptions king of the kings of Irán and non-Irán, where his father says only “of Irán”; so that it was the son who first extended the realm beyond the bounds of what was then known as Irán. Non-Irán may refer to districts in the far East, where, however, the Sásánian power never reached so far as that of the Achaemenians, and it may also include Armenia. At any rate, Ardashír won a great empire and consolidated it, so that it held together for four centuries. He gave a powerful blow to the system of vassal states, which had become more and more prevalent under the Arsacids, and reduced most of these states to provinces. In this sense he is justly viewed by tradition as the restorer of the unity of Irán;^[281. It must not be supposed that the Persians had a clear recollection of the might and breadth of the Achaemenian empire, though Western writers, who knew the old history from books, sometimes make Persians speak as if they shared in that knoλvledge. No doubt a Sásánian would sometimes hear from a Greek or Syrian how his predecessors had reigned as far as Constantinople, but this was not living tradition. Western scholars again sometimes mixed up the old and the new state, as when Libanius supposes that Susa, the residence of Xerxes and Artaxerxes, must also be the residence of his contemporary Sapor (Shápúr). The Sásánians, however, regarded themselves as successors of the mythical kings of Irán.] but the [9:18:608] unity, of course, was not such as in a modern European state. The great barons in particular were still very powerful, and were more than once a danger to the kings. At bottom they λvere a continuation of the Parthian nobility, falling into divers classes, headed, as in the Achaemenian empire, by the seven noblest houses. There was also a numerous minor nobility. Later generations looked back upon the founder of the empire as the best of lawgivers and the ideal monarch; and, of course, so great a patron of Zoroastrianism left a high reputation for piety. A man of mark he certainly was, but the fratricide that opened his reign, and such a barbarity as tradition itself relates of his conduct to the conquered Ardaván, whose head he spurned with his feet, show him to have been very far from a pattern character. It is interesting to find his memory intertwined with similar romantic legends to those told of Cyrus. He was born of (we are told) a mean father, and lived as a page at the court of Ardaván, as Cyrus lived at that of Astyages, and so forth. Dreams and portents figure in the later as in the earlier legend, and even a mythical conflict with a dragon is recounted.^[282. An abridged extract of the romantic history of Ardashír has been preserved in the original Pahlavi, and has been published by Nöldeke (see p. 135, note 1, above). The same legendary material is used by Firdausi; cp. also Z.D.M.G., xxxiv. 585, 599.] Fortunately a much more historical picture has been preserved by genuine tradition.

Ardashír is said to have adopted his son Shápúr as partner of his throne, and this is confirmed by coins on which a youthful head appears along with Ardashír’s likeness. He died late in 241 or early in 242. Shápúr I. (older form Shahpuhr ; Sapor or Sapores of the Westerns) was probably crowned on 20th March 242. Legendary tradition makes his mother an Arsacid princess taken at the capture of Ctesiphon; but, according to a more probable account, Shápúr was already able to bear arms in the decisive battle with Ardaván. Nor can he have been a mere stripling when his reign began, as his prowess against Rome shows; for in Ardashír’s last years, in the reign of Maximin (236-238), the war had been renexved, and Nisibis and Carrhae (Haran), two fortresses which constantly reappear in this history, had been taken. In 242 Shápúr had penetrated to Antioch, before Gordian III., or rather his father-in-law Timesitheus, drove him back and retook the Mesopotamian strongholds. The Persians were defeated at Réshainá, and Gordian proposed to march on the capital by way of the Euphrates, as Julian subsequently did; when almost on the frontier, a little below the junction of the Euphrates and Chaboras, he was murdered by Philip the Arab (244), who concluded a humiliating peace with Shápúr, and is said—for the details are obscure—to have given up to him Armenia and Mesopotamia. Our whole knowledge of the Perso-Roman tvars in the 3d century is very defective; but there seems now to have been a lull for some years, till in 251 or 252 Shápúr again was in motion, now at length effecting an occupation of Armenia and compelling its king to flee to Roman soil. The Roman world was at this period so shaken that Syria was again and again invaded,—how often we can hardly say; nay, a Syrian, Cyriades, himself led the Persians to Antioch and assumed the purple under their protection. At last the emperor Valerian took the field in person; but, after protracted operations in Mesopotamia, fortune turned against the Romans and Valerian himself became Shápúr’s captive (260), under unknown circumstances, and, according to

Roman accounts, through treachery, but certainly not till he had entered into negotiations and vainly sought to purchase a free retreat for his army with gold. Shápúr now penetrated with an invading host far into Roman territory towards Asia Minor, but he met with not unsuccessful opposition. The general Ballista cut off many Persians; but a heavier blow was struck by Odaenathus at the head of his Palmyrenes, who, in this or a subsequent campaign, smote the retreating Persians and even captured the royal harem; nay, once, if not twice, he laid siege to Ctesiphon itself (for details see Palmyra). Presumably now as in later times the Persian empire proved unable to sustain the cost of prolonged campaigns. These Oriental kingdoms are on the whole poor, though they include some fertile regions, and though the kings accumulate large stores of treasure. The Persians had no great standing army like •the Romans, and the levies summoned to the standard could not long be kept together; hence so many brilliant débuts in warfare without lasting result. Shápúr effected no permanent gain of territory, for even Armenia seems now to have fallen again under Roman suzerainty.^[283. See an essay by Gutschmid, Z. D.M.G., xxxi. 51, which is instinctive as to the relations between Persia and Armenia generally.] But Valerian was not delivered, and died in captivity. The figures of the victorious king and the captive Caesar are still to be seen hewn, perhaps by Roman subjects, on the rocks of Persis, and Persian tradition, which preserves so few historical facts as to the immediate successors of Ardashír, has not forgotten this crowning humiliation of Rome. Some of the traditional deeds of Shápúr I. really belong to Shápúr II., but we may accept him as the author of the great irrigation works at Shúshtar, and it was he who built Gúndév Shápúr (Ar. Jundai-Sábúr, Syr. Béth Lápát), which was often used by the kings as their second residence, and stood to Ctesiphon as its neighbour Susa in Achaemenian times did to Babylon. Shápúr’s sway over non-Iránian peoples has been already referred to; but the Augustan historians are certainly right in speaking of the Bactrians as a nation still independent and often hostile to Persia, and the same is true of the Cadusians (Pollio, Val., ch. i.), i.e., the Délamites of Gílán, who were never subdued by the Sásánians. At the very beginning of Shápúr’s reign Mani, founder of the Manichaean sect (see Manichaeism), began to preach, against which the Persian priests fought for centuries as vigorously as against the various sections of Nicene Christians.

The close of Shápúr’s reign saw great changes in the Roman east (see Palmyra). At the fall of Palmyra Shápúr was probably no longer alive. His son Hormizd (f)hrmazd) I. came to the throne in 272 or 273, having previously been governor of Khorásán. His title, “the hero,” appears to have been gained by prowess against the Romans before his accession, for his reign of one year gave little time for great deeds.

His successor, Bahrám (Varahrán) I., was not his son as tradition represents, but, according to an inscription, his brother. He is said to have been a weak prince, given to pleasure. The execution of Mani falls within his reign, which (subject to a possible error of as much as two years, which affects all dates of reigns between Bahrám I. and Shápúr II.) may be dated between 274 and 277.

Of his son, Bahrám II. (c. 277-294), Persian tradition has next to nothing to tell. To him may be probably ascribed two long but ill-preserved inscriptions, religious in content, almost sermonizing, and of very clerical colour. He had wars with Rome, of which we only know that they were terminated by a peace with Probus (276-282),^[284. Vopiscus, Probus, 17, who, as Tillemont remarks, wrongly puts “Narseus” for “Bahrám.”] and that Probus was murdered before he could renew the conflict[9:18:609]. Carus, however, in 283 led his army as far as the hostile capital, and had taken Ctesiphon and Coche (a part of Seleucia) when he suddenly died (by lightning, it is said), and the Romans drew off. Carus is said to have been favoured by intestine disorders, which at this period were certainly common in Persia. In 291 a rhetorician mentions the rebellion of a certain Hormizd (Ormies) against his brother the king, in alliance with barbarians.

A youthful son, who appears opposite the queen on coins of Bahrám II., seems never to have ascended the throne, which was probably contested between Bahrám III. (a son of Hormizd I. ?) and Narseh (according to an inscription, son of Shápúr I.). Bahrám III., called Sagán Sháh, because he had been governor of Sagastán (Sístán), reigned, or at least held the capital, for a very short time; Narseh reigned from c. 293 to 303, and, following up Shápúr’s policy, occupied Armenia and defeated Galerius (probably in 297) between Carrhae and Callinicus (Rakka) in Mesopotamia. But under Diocletian’s wise rule Galerius soon restored the honour of the Roman arms, totally defeating Narseh in Armenia and taking his wives and children. A brilliant peace (298) rewarded the victors; to recover his family the Persian ceded Armenia and Mesopotamia, and even some districts east of the Tigris as far as Kurdistán. The peace lasted forty years.

Narseh’s son, Hormizd II., came to the throne about 303 and was succeeded early in 310 by his son, Adharnarseh, who was soon deposed, and probably slain, ostensibly for his cruelty. The nobles now held the reins of power, and, having blinded one brother of the fallen king and imprisoned another (JTormizd),^[285. Hormizd escaped to the Romans in 323 and remained with them all his life. As late as 363 he shared the Roman campaign against his half-brother Shápúr.] crowned Shápúr II., the newborn (or unborn) son of Queen Ifrá (?) Hormizd (310). The rule of the queen-mother and nobles was what may be readily imagined in an Oriental empire, which above all things needs a strong man at the head; but such a man young Shápúr, one of the greatest princes of the dynasty, soon proved himself to be. Persian tradition preserves few really historical notices of Shápúr II., but is full of stories of astounding campaigns against the Arabs, highly coloured by hatred of that race; and there is no doubt that Shápúr did devote himself with energy to the always important task of repelling the plundering Bedouins from the civilized lands on which their deserts border. Another notable undertaking was the new foundation of Susa after it had rebelled and been chastised by total demolition, the very ground being stamped down by the king’s elephants. NíshÁpúr (q.vf i i.e., Neυ-shah})uhr, may be his foundation, or that of Shápúr I.

In Shápúr’s youth fell the victory of Roman Christianity over paganism under Constantine, and the Christians of Persia at once threw in their sympathies with the Christian state. These feelings were openly shown when Shápúr in 337 or 338 began a Roman war, as appears in a homily of the Syrian bishop Aphraates, a subject of Persia. The bishop of the capital, too, ventured to use language against the king which no Oriental prince, least of all one like Shápúr, could submit to. And so almost simultaneously with the Roman war a terrible persecution of the Christians broke out (339/340), of which the Syrian Acts of Persian Martyrs give a lively picture,—instructive, too, for the light cast on persons and affairs in the realm. Shápúr was no fanatic, as even the Acts of the martyrs show, and he did not molest the Jews, whom his priests hated quite as much as the Christians. But, like Diocletian, he wished to destroy the organization of the church, and therefore used the utmost rigour against the lower as well as the higher clergy, and destroyed the ecclesiastical buildings. To break up congregations he often constrained prominent church members to stone their own priests. The Persian priests, of course, used the opportunity to gratify their hatred of the Christians, and other impure passions increased the cruelty of Shápúr’s hard measures. The Christians on their part showed much heroic courage mixed with not a little cowardice.

Roman sources tell us that the war was begun by the Persians with an invasion of Mesopotamia. Constantine died on 22d May 337, before he could march against them. But Shápúr’s great preparations, as we learn from Aphraates, fell in the year that begins with autumn 337. With many vicissitudes and long pauses the war endured for twenty-five years, but only for its second part do we possess fuller accounts by contemporaries and in part eye-witnesses. Shápúr’s aim was to drive the Romans from the upper Tigris, where they were dangerously near Ctesiphon, and especially to seize Nisibis, and then to reduce Armenia, that old apple of discord between East and West. Three times Nisibis victoriously resisted a severe siege (338, 346, 350), and other sieges occupy a great place in the story of the war. Constantius, when he took the field in person, was always defeated, as in 348 at the great battle of Singara (Shingár, Ar. Sinjár). Yet Shápúr’s successes bore little fruit, mainly perhaps because Diocletian and Constantine had put the fortresses in the best condition, and in all respects had made wise provisions to cover the threatened districts. Even when victorious the Persians could hardly penetrate into western Mesopotamia, and if Shápúr had taken all the strong places he could hardly have garrisoned them. Thus he took Amida (Amid) after long and costly sieges, and in the very next year (360) the Romans found it ungarrisoned. The Romans were helped, too, by the trouble which Shápúr had with barbarous enemies; the third siege of Nisibis was all but successful when the Persian was called away to Khorásán by urgent affairs there. These eastern conflicts were the prelude to a long pause in the contest (350-358), broken only by small forays. When, however, the Romans opened negotiations (356 to 358) Shápúr had made peace in the east and offered no conditions that could be accepted. In 359 and 360 the war was again hotly renewed, and Shápúr took several important fortresses. Then there was a lull till 363, when the warlike, active, and ambitious Julian, now sole emperor, resolved to strike at the capital of the enemy, as Trajan, Severus, and Carus had done. He left Antioch for Mesopotamia in March and swiftly descended the Euphrates, wasting the enemy’s land with fire and sword and taking several cities by short sieges, among others the royal city of Máhóz Malká, not far from Ctesiphon. Julian now occupied Seleucia, but, finding he was not strong enough to take Ctesiphon, the fortified capital on the opposite bank of the Tigris, he ordered a retreat along the left bank. And now for the first time Shápúr’s troops began to harass him, but the army might have regained Roman soil without serious loss had not Julian fallen mortally wounded in a skirmish (26th June 363). The army chose Jovian emperor, a man too weak for such an occasion, who managed his soldiers and the negotiations so badly that a shameful peace was the result, and Shápúr regained the lands east of the Tigris lost to Galerius, and part of Mesopotamia with Nisibis and Singara. Nisibis was the gravest loss, for in all future wars it was to the Persians a sure base for advance and a bulwark for defence. But a still more shameful condition was that the Romans should not help their ally Arsaces of Armenia against Shápúr. The Persian, nevertheless, did not find Armenia an easy conquest. He took Arsaces captive, but this did not decide the fate of the whole country, divided as it was by nature into a number of separate regions under almost independent [9:18:610] captains. The Christian Armenians leaned on the whole towards Rome, while the Zoroastrians, who still formed a large part of the nation, inclined to Persia, and the personal interests of the great barons, who preferred to recognize no lord, inclined them now to this side, now to that. Papa, son of Arsaces, fled to the Romans and got help from them, first secretly and then openly; but he was only their tool in the design of reducing Armenia to a province. Conflicts between the rival empires took place also to the north of Armenia in Iberia, and after five years they were practically again at war. In 371 Shápúr was openly met by Roman troops in Armenia, which both parties were determined to have by force or by fraud. Once and again negotiations failed, but a general war was still averted by external circumstances (on Rome’s part by the Gothic war) and considerations of prudence.

Shápúr II., who is justly celebrated by the later traditions, died towards the end of the summer of 379, and was succeeded by his brother, Ardashír II., an old man, who was perhaps chosen king for similar reasons to those which governed the choice of Shápúr as an infant. As prince and governor of Adiabene Ardashír had taken an active part in the suppression of Christianity in 344 and as late as 376, but with his accession the persecution ceased —whether of purpose or merely from the Oriental lack of persistency we cannot tell—and a bishop was again admitted even in the capital. Ardashír was deposed in 383 or 384, having taken strong measures against the nobles and put some of them to death.

His successor, Shápúr III., son of Shápúr II., at once sent ambassadors to Constantinople and made a definite treaty of peace (384). In 388 or 389 he was murdered by the nobles. His successor (a son, or perhaps a brother), Bahrám IV., called Kirmán Sháh,^[286. He had ruled in Kirmán, and from him two towns, in Kurdistan and in Kirmán, take the name Kirmánsháhán.] kept peace with Rome and λvas clement to the Christians. In 390 Armenia was divided by treaty, much the larger part becoming a vassal state of Persia and the rest falling to Rome. The division, with various modifications and vicissitudes, lasted into Arab times. Bahrám was shot by a band of “miscreants” in the summer of 399.

Yazdegerd I., son of Shápúr II. or Shápúr III., seems to have been designated heir to the throne while Bahrám IV. was still alive, or at least he held such high dignity that his name appears on coins of his predecessor. Persian tradition makes him wise but very wicked. Christian witnesses, on the other hand, speak very favourably of him, and it appears certain that his surname, “the Sinner,” was gained by a severity, perhaps tyrannical, towards the grandees, by tolerance towards the Christians, and little favour shown to the priests. In 410 the Christians were even allowed to hold a regularly constituted synod in the capital, and the king employed the “Catholicus ”— i.e., the primate of the church, a functionary possessed of full religious autonomy—on a mission to the emperor, and even in settling differences with his own brother, who governed Persis. Yazdegerd had no personal inclination towards Christianity, and he severely punished the fanaticism of Bishop 'Abdá, who had insulted a Zoroastrian sanctuary in Susiana, but his habitual tolerance was enough to make him hated of the Persian priests. The warlike nobles also found cause for dissatisfaction in his earnest endeavours to keep on quiet terms with Rome, with whom he made a treaty of peace and friendship in the summer of 408, when he seems to have pledged himself to support the throne of Theodosius II. during his minority. Over Persian Armenia he set his own son Shápúr. We have every reason to deem Yazdegerd an excellent prince for the time and circumstances, but he was not well pleasing to the god of the

Persians, who smote him with sudden and miraculous death in distant Hyrcania. The explanation of the miracle is no doubt that he was murdered by the magnates (probably late in summer 420).

Shápúr, hurrying from Armenia on the news of his father’s death, was slain by the grandees, who had resolved altogether to exclude from the throne the seed of the hated Yazdegerd. A distant relation, Khosrau, was made king, but had to contest the throne with another son of Yazdegerd, Bahrám, who in his father’s lifetime had dwelt apparently in a sort of exile, with the powerful vassal prince Al-Mondhir (Alamundaros) of Híra, on the borders of the desert to the west of the Euphrates. Mondhir energetically supported the claims of his guest-friend, and appeared with a vast Arab horde before the gates of Ctesiphon, which is only three or four days’ march from Híra. As Bahrám doubtless had support among the Persians also, Khosrau gave way, and Bahrám took the throne, but with a promise to reign in a different spirit from his father and please the magnates and the priests. This is the first important intervention of the Arabs in the affairs of Persia.

Bahrám V., surnamed Gór or Wildass, is the favourite hero of Persian tradition, which tells many incredible stories about him. He came to the throne young, and was always a jolly prince, very fond of women, and whose personal strength and prowess as a huntsman, perhaps also in war, blinded men’s eyes to the real weakness of his sway. The change of policy was at once announced in a systematic persecution of the Christians and in war with Rome. For the latter there were pretexts enough on both sides, but the Romans would not have begun the war merely because the Christians were persecuted; its real authors were presumably the Persian nobles. The chief seat of war was the north of Persian Mesopotamia and the mountain-land above. The Persians were led by one of the greatest nobles, Mihr Narseh, whom Persian tradition represents as taking Constantinople, while we know that he really sustained heavy defeat at the very commencement of the war (August 421). Nisibis was attacked by the Romans, but relieved after a siege of some length. In 422 both parties were glad to make peace; religious freedom was given to Christians in Persia and to Zoroastrians in the Roman empire. There seems to have been no change of frontier, but the Romans promised to receive no Arabs who wished to change their allegiance,^[287. The Bedouin tribes, “nec amici nobis unquam nec hostes optandi” (Ammian., xiv. 4, 1), and the petty states that had been formed out of them, under Roman or Persian suzerainty, were a constant trouble to both empires in war and in peace.] and to pay an annual sum towards the maintenance of the defences of the Caucasian Gates (the pass of Dariel), which protected both powers from the inroads of the northern barbarians. This last condition reappears in almost all treaties and always caused soreness. For, however carefully the provision was worded, both sides looked on the contribution as a tribute, of which the Romans evaded payment whenever they could.

The Persians, we may suppose, were the readier to make peace that they were again embroiled with the nation of Kúshán or Haitál, the Hephthalites or “white Huns,” who then ruled in Bactria and the surrounding lands. Constant wars of Persia with this people went on during the 5th century and gave the Romans repose, and we are hardly bound to believe the Persian tradition that Bahrám had a glorious victory over the Hephthalites. A movement for freedom had taken place in Persian Armenia during the Roman war; but after the peace Bahrám established a new vassal king, till in 429 the conduct of the selfish Armenian nobles led the Persians [9:18:611] to make Armenia a province,—a change which was supported by a strong party among the Armenians themselves. But the Persian governors had as much trouble with barons and clergy as the old kings had had.

Bahrám, dying in 438 or 439, was succeeded by his son, Yazdegerd II., of whom little good can be said. He persecuted both Jews and Christians, abolished the audiences on the first day of each month on which every man of position could approach the king with petitions or complaints, and is recorded to have married his daughter (that, of course, was no crime in a Zoroastrian) and then murdered her.

In 441 he very nearly came to war with Rome, but peace was concluded without further conflict than some harrying of the marches, and it was provided (as in later and probably in earlier treaties) that no new fortresses should be erected on the border by either party. Yazdegerd was much in Khorásán, where he sustained repeated defeats from the Hephthalites; and in 450/451 he had to deal with a serious rebellion in Armenia, mainly produced by persecution of the Christians, which was not quelled till he promised complete freedom of Christian worship.

On the death of Yazdegerd II. (457) the throne was for two years contested between his two sons by Dínak^[288. Dínak’s likeness is preserved on a gem; see B. Dorn, in Compterendu de la Com. Arch, pour 1878, 1879, p. 162 sq. (St Petersburg).] — Hormizd, prince-governor of Sagastán, and Péróz. The latter, who was the younger, proved successful by aid of the Hephthalites and the energy of Rahám of the house of Mihrán, and put his brother and three others of the nearest royal kin to death. Péróz was again a persecutor of Jews and Christians, but had political wisdom enough to favour the reception of Nestorianism by his Christian subjects when that party was driven from the Roman empire. At the synod of Béth Lápát (483 or 484) the old Christian church of Persia adopted the Nestorian confession, and was thus separated from Byzantium by a wide breach. But in truth Christianity in Persia had never been really much of a danger to the state.^[289. The Armenians, on the other hand, joined the Monophysites, who had a large party in the Roman empire and often had the upper hand there.]

The Hephthalites and Péróz soon fell out about the reward for their services, and fierce fighting ensued, in which Péróz gained several victories; but the seat of Avar Avas a desert very unfavourable to his operations, and tAvice he had to make peace on disadvantageous terms, while at least once he Avas himself taken prisoner and released on heavy ransom, leaving his son Kavádh a hostage for its payment for the space of tAvo years. But Péróz always broke faith again with the foe, and at length, in 484, he was among the missing after a terrible battle, in Avhich hls daughter was taken captive and placed in the harem of the Hephthalite king. The conquerors noAv overfloAved Persia, Avhich for a time was Avithout a monarch till order Avas restored by Zarmihr, of the great house of Káren, Avho at the time of Péróz’s death had been successfully dealing with a revolt in «Armenia, and noAv hastened to the capital and made Balásh, Péróz’s brother, king. The Hephthalites seem to have been bought off by a yearly tribute.^[290. Persian tradition makes Sókhrá lj.e., Zarmihr) humble the enemy and compel them to restore their booty.] Balásh’s brother, Zareh, Avho also claimed the croAvn, AA τ as vanquished and put to death. But the new king had little poAver, and secured the obedience of the Armenians only by granting that the Persian state religion should be Avholly excluded from their land. The clemency of Balásh is praised by the Syrians and Armenians, possibly for no other reason than that his relations with the Persian priesthood were unfriendly. Their enmity proved fatal to him; his treasuries were empty, so that he could neither gain a party among the nobles nor secure the support of an army, and in 488 or 489 he Avas deposed and blinded.

His nephew and successor, Kavádh I., son of Péróz, found the land in a very disturbed state; there Avere rebellions among the barbarous mountain tribes and there was another rising in Armenia. Noav Kavádh Avas not disposed to be the humble servant of the priests and nobles to Avhom he OAved the croAvn, and to humiliate them he played the dangerous game of encouraging Mazdak, the energetic priest of a neAv religion, Avhich demanded in the name of justice that he Avho had a superfluity of goods and several Avives should impart to those who had none. This theory Avas actually put in practice to some considerable extent, but then the nobility and clergy rose, deposed Kavádh, and imprisoned him in the “Castle of Oblivion,”^[291. Identified by Sir H. Rawlinson as Gilgerd in northern Susiana.] placing his brother Jámásp on the throne (c. 496). But Kavádh escaped to the Hephthalites, Avhere he had once lived as a hostage, received in marriage the daughter of the king (whose mother Avas the captive sister of Kavádh), and with his help expelled Jámásp and recovered his kingdom (498 or 499).^[292. Kavádh’s escape and restoration seem to have been favoured by some of the greatest nobles, and Persian tradition, Avhich, however, is very confused in this Avhole chapter, makes Zarmihr the companion of his flight.] Kavádh held severe judgment on the traitors, and it Avas probably at this time that he gave up Zarmihr into the hands of his most dangerous rival, Shápúr of the house of Mihrán. He does not seem to have carried his Mazdakite experiment farther, and he had put the realm into fair order Avhen he began a Avar Avith Rome.

BetAveen Rome and Persia there had been such a series of negotiations and compacts, none of Avhich had been scrupulously observed, that either side could find a casus belli at Avili. Kavádh had the will, and in summer 502 he opened that era of hideous strife betAveen Rome and Persia which so exhausted both poAvers as to pave the Avay for the neAv empire of the Arabs. In August he seized Avithout a fight Theodosiopolis (Karin, Erzerúm), capital of Roman Armenia. On 10th January 503 Amida fell after a siege of three months and Avas cruelly chastised for its resistance, tens of thousands of the inhabitants being put to the sword.^[293. Of this Avar we have good accounts in contemporary Syriao sources.] The Romans acted with little energy or unity of plan, and in the course of the Avar Mesopotamia suffered terribly. Amida Avas restored to the Romans by compact, or rather by purchase, after a long siege in 504; and after much fighting a peace was concluded in the autumn of 506, leaving things as they were before the Avar. The Persians, we are told, Avere ready for peace because they had on their hands a Avar Avith the “Huns,”—a very vague Avord in the mouth of a Greek. But Kavádh must have been in considerable difficulty, for he tamely submitted to a gross breach of the treaty when Anastasius raised the village of Dara to a great fortress to hold Nisibis in check. There Avas no more Avar while Anastasius was emperor, but Justin I. (518-527) seems to have ceased the payment for the Caucasian Gates again stipulated in the peace of 506, to Avhich Kavádh replied by letting loose his Arabs on the empire, and the Romans retaliated by forays in Persian Armenia. There Avere also serious disputes about the suzerainty of the lands between Caucasus and Pontus, but Kavádh was still anxious to avert Avar, from which presumably he sa Av that no permanent advantage could Aoav. At the same time he Avas very eager to secure the succession for his favourite son, Khosrau, Avho was not his eldest; and he thought that if he could induce the emperor to adopt Khosrau as his own son this Avould form a sort of guarantee and greatly impress the Persians. A negotiation[9:18:612] on this and other matters at Nisibis (525 or 526) seems, however, to have been badly managed on both sides, and its failure cost the Roman ambassador his place and the Persian his head. War now began on the borders in 527 before Justin’s death {i.e., before 1st August).^[294. The principal sources for this war are Procopius and the Syrian account in Land, Anecdota, iii.] A Roman attack on Nisibis and a Persian on Dara failed. Fighting, broken by negotiations, went on for several years, and in it Belisarius first came to the front as a general.

An important episode in this war is the invasion of Syria by Mondhir of Híra. This prince seems to have been more powerful than was safe for Persia, and Kavádh had stripped him of all or part of his possessions and given them to Hárith, a scion of the widespread house of the kings of the Kinda. When war broke out Mondhir, who was an experienced warrior, was restored to his old sway, and in 529 he fell on Syria, pillaging and holding captives to ransom as far as Antioch. Mondhir was a savage heathen, who on one day sacrificed 400 nuns of a Syrian cloister to his goddess 'Uzzá (the planet Venus). In the same year he slew Hárith in battle and executed in Híra a number of captives of the Kinda house. For half a century he was the terror of the subjects of Rome, little recking whether they were at peace or at war with his master, till in 554 he fell in battle with a Roman vassal, Hárith ibn Jabala, whose son he had also sacrificed to 'Uzzá.

Under Mondhir’s influence Kavádh in 531 undertook a regular campaign against Syria, the first since centuries. The Persians crossed the Euphrates and had pressed far to the north when Belisarius compelled them to turn back. In a battle at Rakka Belisarius was defeated, but the Persians found it expedient to continue their retreat (19th April 531). In Mesopotamia the Persians were this year successful, and had almost reduced the great fortress of Martyropolis (Maiferkat, Arab. Mayáfárikín) when news came of Kavádh’s death, and a truce was made.

In 528 or 529 Kavádh, through his son Khosrau, had made a bloody end of the Mazdakites, whose success proved too dangerous to society to be longer endured.

Kavádh died, eighty-two years old, 13th September 531, and was succeeded by his destined heir, Khosrau (Chosroes), surnamed Anósharván, “the Blessed,” whom his father is said to have caused to be crowned as he lay on his deathbed.^[295. That the nomination of Khosrau surprised the Persian nobles is simply impossible. Procopius, it must be remembered, drew for the events at Khosrau’s accession on the tales of the (true or false) prétendant Kavádh, son of Jam, and grandson of King Kavádh. But it is quite possible that such things as the removal of princes and the execution of valuable officials took place under Khosrau.] Khosrau I. was a great king, and deserved the title of “the Just,” though he was not the ideal prince that Eastern writers make him. By carrying out the regulation of the land-tax already commenced by his father, and by measures to control the collection of taxes, he benefited his subjects as well as the treasury. In Babylonia at least, the richest province, his fiscal ordinances proved productive, and, according to an Eastern standard, not too oppressive, down to the fall of the Sásánian empire; the Arabs themselves contrast the old Persian system with the oppressive taxation of Moslem times, which was ruinous to the finances of the state as well as to the inhabitants. The public welfare, too, was served by the construction or repair of bridges, canals, embankments, and the like. The priests favoured Khosrau for his extirpation of the Mazdakites, which he completed at the beginning of his reign; but they were not permitted to rule his policy. He managed the great nobles with tact, rather strengthening than weakening the aristocratic basis of the realm, but making it serviceable to himself. Measures were taken to relieve the insecurity which the Mazdakites had introduced in relations of property and the family, and the army was the object of special care. Khosrau had a decided leaning to Western civilization; and, though an Oriental despot could not be expected to sympathize with the highest fruits of Hellenic genius at a time when they were little appreciated even in Europe, and the heathen philosophers who came to Persia to seek a philosophic state soon returned undeceived, it is to his honour that the Persian secured for them the free exercise of their faith by a clause in the treaty of 549. The Christians, so long as they obeyed the laws, were unmolested; nay, Khosrau helped to maintain the worship not only of the Nestorians but even of the Monophysites, who had much more friendly relations to the Roman empire. Apostasy from Zoroastrianism was forbidden by ancient law, and proselytizing by Christians was strictly prohibited, yet the Monophysite abbot Ahúdemmeh, who had got a large contribution from the king to build his monastery, and thereafter baptized a son of Khosrau, who presently fled to the Romans, was punished only by a mild imprisonment, in which he was allowed to see his scholars.^[296. This is known from an unprinted Syrian biography by a disciple of Ahúdemmeh, who manages to make the king a tyrant by inventing a silly miracle to explain his clemency. Ahúdemmeh died, after two years’ imprisonment, 2d August 575.] Nor did the Christians suffer for their sympathy with the rebellious prince Anóshazádh; and yet Khosrau was no weakling, but energetic, warlike, and on occasion cruel.^[297. Procopius naturally speaks unfavourably of so dangerous an enemy of the Romans.]

The negotiations begun in 531 issued in September 532 in a “perpetual peace,” the Romans promising a large annual subsidy and other concessions, while the Persians gave back certain castles in Lázistán at the eastern end of the Black Sea. Khosrau had need of peace, and used it probably to protect the frontiers from divers barbarous foes, for tradition speaks of his measures for the safety of the borders towards the Caucasus and on the east. Unmanageable tribes, too, were moved to new homes. In a few years he was strong enough to go to war again, feeling perhaps that Justinian’s successes in Africa and Italy had made the hereditary foe too strong. This danger, no doubt, was forcibly set before him by the emissaries of the Gothic king Vitiges, and a tempting opportunity was presented by an appeal which came to him from the rebel nobles of Roman Armenia, Christians though they were. Pretexts for war were never lacking, if only through the Arab subjects of the two powers. But Khosrau certainly desired the war, and early in 540 he set forth to attack Syria as Shápiir I. had done, and marched through the land to the shore of the “Roman sea,” taking and pillaging such strong cities as did not buy him oft’. Antioch in particular yielded an enormous booty; it was burned and the inhabitants carried captive. Turning homewards, the Persian traversed north Syria and Mesopotamia from west to east, levying a contribution even from the hated fortress of Dara. Carrhae alone, whose population was still mainly heathen, and so presumably inclined to the non-Christian empire, escaped scot free. Ctesiρhon was reached at the close of summer, the whole campaign having come off without a single pitched battle. Khosrau, still more than Shápiir II., sought in the barbarous old usage of wholesale captivities a means of appropriating to his own service the culture and technical skill of the West. Thus he made for the captive Antiochians a new municipality (Khosrau-Antiochia, or “the Roman town”) hard by the royal residence, which was a notable tribute to the superiority of Roman culture and life. The town was made as Western in character as could be, and the inhabitants were established in comfort, and had religious freedom, and even a Christian mayor. They retained their national manners till the fall of the empire. Chariot-races, for example, were as popular as they had been in old Antioch.

Next year Khosrau was invited to Lázistán by the natives, and penetrated to the Black Sea and took the strong place of Petra. In Mesopotamia war went on for several [9:18:613] years with chequered fortune. In 546 the Romans paid a large sum for a five years’ truce, and another five years’ truce followed in 553, though Lázistán was excluded from both truces until 556, when the Romans had gained successes there; but during all this time the Persian and Roman Arabs never laid down their arms. At length, about Christmas 562, a fifty years’ peace was concluded, the Romans again promising a considerable yearly subsidy, and the Persians withdrawing their claims on Lázistán, though the possession of the neighbouring Suania was left an open question. The treaty also provided for religious freedom to the Persian Christians, while all proselytizing among Zoroastrians was strictly forbidden.

During the truces (546-562) great changes had taken place in the East, where a powerful empire had been formed in the northern steppes by the Turks, whose name then, for the first time, became known in the West. The khákán of the Turks, whom the Greeks call Silzibulos and the Arabs (after the Persians) name Sinjibú, took from the Hephthalites the right bank of the Oxus, while Khosrau (seemingly in alliance with the khákán, whose daughter he wedded) occupied the left bank (c. 560). Thus Bactria, from which the Sásánians had suffered so much, was at length embodied in their empire, and Péróz was fully avenged.^[298. A curious proof of the late character of Persian tradition is that it regards the Oxus as having always divided Irán and Túrán, and the Turks as having always been next neighbours of Persia.] But the friendship of Turks and Persians was soon changed to that hostility which has long made the rulers of Turkestán and the deserts appear the natural enemies of the lords of Khorásán. Khosrau must have made other conquests about the same time, for in the negotiations with Rome the Persian representative boasts that his master had conquered ten nations, and tradition enumerates the conquest, or rather recovery, of seven eastern lands. These statements must be taken with some discount, and it is not to be believed that Khosrau really ruled in Afghanistán or Sind, as tradition says, though he doubtless widened and secured the eastern limits of the empire.^[299. Purely fabulous exploits, like the conquest of Ceylon, mean only that to the Persians Khosrau, like Bahrain V., was lord of the whole world.]

About 570 an expedition was sent against Yemen, which the Christian Abyssinians had conquered in 525. A native prince invited Khosrau to expel the Blacks, and, after some hesitation, he sent a small force under Vahriz which easily effected this object. Persian rule was nominally maintained in Yemen till the time of Islám, and tribute was paid more or less irregularly; but, as the Persians were not a seafaring people, this remote province beyond the waters was of no practical use to them in the way of diverting trade from the hands of the Romans. Khosrau had presumably hoped otherwise, for affairs of trade, especially the overland silk trade in inner Asia, had considerable influence on Sásánian policy.

About 551 Khosrau had to deal with a rebellion of his son Anóshazádh, who was then in disgrace in Susiana; hearing that his father was dangerously ill, he claimed the crown, leaning on the Christians, whose religion was that of his mother. The rebel was easily overpowered and taken; his punishment was not death, but such a partial blinding as made him unfit to reign.

In his last years Khosrau had again to face the Romans. The Roman alliance with the Turkish khákán, the efforts of Khosrau to hamper their intercourse with that potentate, now his dangerous foe, the annoyance of the Christian empire at the fall of the Christian realm in Yemen, and the refusal of Justin II. (565-578) to pay the stipulated subsidy were all pretexts for war, but the decisive thing was that all Armenia suddenly threatened to become Roman. There were already plans of rebellion among the

Armenian nobles when an outburst of popular fanaticism was caused by the attempt to erect a fire-temple in the capital Dovin, and the Persian Súrén^[300. A member of the same house with the conqueror of Crassus.] was slain (spring 571). The rebels and the king of Iberia turned to Constantinople, and were taken under the protection of the incapable emperor, who fancied that he could regain both countries. This, of course, was a declaration of war. The events that followed are known from good contemporary sources, but cannot be arranged in clear chronological order. One of the first operations was an unsuccessful siege of Nisibis by the Romans. Khosrau, on the other hand, took Dara in 573, after a siege of six months, and was joined beneath its walls by his captain Adharmahán, returning from a successful campaign in Syria on the model of that of 540, in which he had destroyed Apamea.^[301. Part of the captive Apameans were settled in New Antioch.] Tiberius, who with the empress Sophia held the reins of power in Constantinople and was recognized as co-regent in the end of 574, desired peace; but Armenia was excluded from the three years’ truce that he procured. In 575 Khosrau penetrated through that country into Cappadocia, and, though he had to retire before the Romans and leave his camp to be pillaged, he escaped safely, burning Sebastia and Melitene on the way. The Romans pressed forward and spent the winter in Persian Armenia, but were driven back next year; they had not even secured the sympathy of the Monophysite population. Even beyond Armenia the war broke out again before the truce had expired, and the Romans conducted it with no more humanity than the Persians, leading captive the Christian inhabitants of Arzanene, and making it a special favour to give them a place in Cyprus (577). Negotiations for peace were frequent; the Romans saw that it was vain to try to hold Armenia and Iberia, and might even have consented to give up the temporal and spiritual heads of the rebellion who had taken refuge at Constantinople, but they very naturally would not make peace without recovering Dara. So things stood when Tiberius became sole emperor, and some months later Khosrau died (c. February 579).

Hormizd IV., son of Khosrau by the Turkish princess, was a proud enterprising prince. The Greeks speak ill of him, and indeed were much offended from the first that he neglected the usual courtesy of formally announcing his accession at Constantinople. Persian tradition makes him ill-disposed and a shedder of blood, and we know that he put his brothers to death when he took the throne, but that, as the contemporary Christian narrator says, was a Persian custom. On the other hand, tradition acknowledges the strict impartial justice with which he upheld the cause of the poor against the great. It was the great man who felt his severity. In the army, too, he was careful of the plebeian troops, and lowered the status of the aristocratic cataphracts. Much to his honour is his reply to the priests when they asked him to withdraw his favour from the Christians. “As our royal throne,” he said, “cannot stand on its front legs alone, so our rule cannot stand and be firm if we turn against us the Christians and members of other alien religions. Cease, therefore, your attacks on the Christians and follow zealously good works, that the Christians and others of alien faith may see them, and give praise and be drawn towards your faith.” In many respects Hormizd seems to have resembled Yazdegerd I., whose fate, too, he shared; the misfortune was that he had not his father’s tact in managing the nobles and the clergy.

The war with Rome went on throughout his reign with varying fortune. There was a serious war, too, with the Turks, but over these, or rather over one of their vassals, the Persian general Bahrám Chóbín gained so complete [9:18:614] a victory that he is said to have made the Turks pay instead of receiving tribute. Bahrám was next sent into the lands south of the Caucasus to strike a great blow at Rome (589), but here he was utterly defeated, and Hormizd was foolish enough to dismiss him with disgrace. The general, who was head of the great house of Mihrán, replied by open revolt, feeling, no doubt, that he could reckon on the discontent of the nobles and the other armies. The troops in Mesopotamia which had been driven back on Nisibis by the Romans and were afraid of punishment did in fact mutiny and open communication with Bahrám, who marched against the capital and reached the Great Záb. An army sent forth against him also mutinied, but declared for Hormizd’s son, Khosrau, who was on bad terms with his father. Next, part of the troops rose in Ctesiphon, whither Hormizd had hurried from Media. Bindóe, Khosrau’s maternal uncle, was in prison there, and his brother Bistám (Vistahm) set him free by force. Hormizd was deposed and soon after put to death, and Khosrau, who had probably consented to a crime he could not prevent, was proclaimed king (summer 590).

Khosrau II. Parvéz, “the conqueror,” had now to deal with Bahrám, who sought the crown, or at least the regency, for himself. But the pusillanimous king could not inspire his troops with courage to face the experienced general; he was deserted in the first shock of battle, and fled to Circesium to cast himself on the aid of the emperor Maurice, who undertook to restore Khosrau, but, able prince as he was, missed the great opportunity of securing an adequate equivalent for the service. Himself a man of obscure descent, he seems to have been flattered by the idea of posing as “father” of a legitimate king of ancient stock. The enterprise was not very difficult, for though Bahrám had seized the crown and begun to coin in his own name the nobles would not submit to one of their own peers, and the people were still stricter legitimists than they had been under the Arsacids. In their view the royal majesty {farrahi kaydnTP) was innate in the house of Ardashír, and none outside of it could be king. Bahrám had to put down an insurrection in Ctesiphon itself, and Bindóe escaped and took up his nephew’s cause. In the beginning of 591 a Roman host drew near, and Khosrau caused the gates of Martyropolis^[302. This town had been betrayed to the Persians, and the Romans had lain before it for some time.] and Dara to be opened to them. He was now joined by the Persian army of Nisibis, and Persian and some Armenian grandees came in to him day by day. The other armies took the same side. In Atropatene Bistám, Bindóe’s brother, gathered a host against Bahrám, while the united Persian and Roman forces advanced along the left bank of the Tigris and smote him in a decisive battle near the Záb (summer 591). Seleucia, Ctesiphon, and New Antioch had already been taken by troops sent through the Mesopotamian desert. Thus Khosrau was restored, and peace with Rome followed of course. The Romans ceased to pay tribute, but only recovered their old frontier, Nisibis still remaining Persian. Bahrám fled to the Turks and was honourably received, but was murdered not long afterwards. Khosrau was still so insecure that he asked a bodyguard of 1000 Romans, and now he set himself to remove all dangerous persons, especially Bindóe and the other conspirators who had overthrown his father and set himself on the throne. Bistám was not so easily reached. When he saw himself condemned he made himself king in Media, and held out for almost six years with the help of the remnants of Bahrám’s forces and in alliance with Turks and Délamites. He fell by treachery probably in 595 or 59G.

To a land already weakened by long wars all these disorders were ruinous. Nor was Khosrau II. the king fit for such times. A weak coarse-minded man, at once boastful and timid, avaricious and fond of luxury and splendour, he was at best a very ordinary Oriental despot. He found the treasury empty and left it full, while the empire was impoverished by wars. And in these he won no glory; his victories were those of his generals. To the Christians he long extended protection and favour, and even built them churches; for he fancied that not only the Christian empire but St Sergius himself, the chief saint of the Roman Syrians and Arabs, had a share in his restoration, and he was much under the influence of a Christian wife, Shirin, and of some other Christians, such as his physician Gabriel.^[303. Shirin and the king even took part in the quarrels of Nestorians and Monophysites, and foolishly took the side of the latter, who were the minority and less Persian in sympathy. There are good contemporary Syriac records of all this which in part are still unused.] But in later years his disposition toward the Christians was altogether reversed.

When Maurice fell by treason and the hideous tyrant Phocas seized the throne (November 602) Khosrau felt himself called to avenge his “father” and protect Maurice’s supposed son, Theodosius, who had fled to the Persian court. Narses too, the commandant of Edessa, called for help against Phocas. Khosrau accordingly imprisoned the ambassadors who came to announce the new accession, and a war began, early in 604, which for twenty years laid the Roman lands open to such ravages as had never before been known; so helpless was the empire under the bad rule of Phocas and through the pressure of Avars and other barbarians. Khosrau was present at the taking of Dara (604),^[304. Land, A need. Sur., i. 15.] but had no personal share in the war after that event. After a few years the Persian armies were seen as far west as Chalcedon over against Constantinople. Yet the real weakness of the Sásánian realm was strikingly exposed in these very years (604-610) in the battle of Dhú Kár, a small affair in itself, but very significant. Khosrau had abolished the kingdom of Híra and put King No'mán to death, thus ridding himself of a troublesome vassal, but at the same time losing a very useful means of influencing and checking the desert tribes. And soon after No'mán’s fall the tribe of Bakr ibn Wáil actually defeated a regular army at Dhti Kár near the Euphrates, but a few days’ journey from Ctesiphon, and maintained themselves on the soil in spite of the Persians. Arabic vanity greatly exaggerated this success, and the result was a notable increase of self-confidence on the part of the Arabs, by which the Moslems ultimately benefited when they came to attack Persia.

The Romans still had the worst of the war when in October 610 Phocas gave place to the valiant Heraclius. The new emperor, hard pressed on all sides, vainly asked for peace. In 613 Damascus was taken, and the country round it, on which the Persians had never before set foot, was ravaged in a way of which countless ruins bear witness to this day. In June 614 Jerusalem fell, and, to the horror of all Christendom, the “precious and life-giving cross” went into captivity. Next Egypt was conquered, and Asia Minor swept as far as Chalcedon. Heraclius was not able to strike a counter blow till 622, when an expedition towards Armenia and the Pontine territories from the Gulf of Issus restored respect for the Roman arms. His great campaigns began in the following year and carried him deep into the Persian country, often quite cut off from his base, in a way that could not have succeeded with any leader who was not a great politician as well as a great general. In the first year of these campaigns he destroyed one of the holiest of Persian shrines, the fire-temple of Ganjak, near Lake Urmiyah, and so [9:18:615] avenged Jerusalem. Now we find him near the Caucasus, now in eastern Asia Minor, now again in Mesopotamia, never beaten, often victorious, but offener perhaps outwitting superior forces by adroit movements. In 626 Khosrau attempted a diversion by sending his best general, Shahrbaráz, with a great force directly against Chalcedon. It was an anxious summer in Constantinople, with the Avars behind and the Persians in front, and the emperor almost lost in the depths of Asia. But in the beginning of August the Avars drew off, the Persians, who had no ships, having failed to cross the Bosphorus and effect a junction with them. Heraclius replied by drawing the Khazars {q.v.} down into Persian territory, and in 627 he ventured to strike a blow at the heart of the monarchy. The feast of 6th January 628 he celebrated in Dastagerd, which was but some three days’ march from Ctesiphon, and had been Khosrau’s usual residence for twenty-four years. Khosrau had fled in terror, and did not deem himself safe till he and his harem were over the bridge of Ctesiphon. The capital was, of course, too strong to be carried by the small forces that the Roman had been able to lead by a rapid march from the Caucasus, and Heraclius turned swiftly before any great army could be gathered against him, and cut his way through the enemy’s country back to Ganjak over the Kurdish Alps amid the snows of February and March,—an exploit almost unparalleled in the history of war.

Meantime there was revolution in Ctesiphon. Khosrau’s tyranny and greed had offended high and low; his panic flight had made him contemptible; and, to crown all, his legitimate heir Kavádh and. most of his brothers were pining in prison to leave the heirship open to Mardánsháh, son of Shirin, who, even in advanced years, had retained absolute command of her husband, in spite of his thousands of other wives. Certain nobles liberated Kavádh and proclaimed him king (25th February 628), and Khosrau, deserted by all, was dragged from his hiding-place and executed (29th February). Thus miserably perished a prince whose armies had covered almost the whole breadth of the Achaemenian empire. No hand was raised to help him, and the Christians, who had never forgiven the insult to the true cross, were the first to welcome the elevation of the parricide Kavádh, in which, indeed, one of their own number, Shamtá, son of the farmer-general Yazdín, had a leading part.

The first act of Kavádh II. Shéróe was to murder some eighteen brothers, his second to ask peace from the Romans. A truce was conceded, but Heraclius was too much master of the situation to agree to a final peace at once. Persian troops were recalled from Roman soil, but, when Heraclius, after a hasty reorganization of Mesopotamia, had gone on to Syria, he learned that the -Persian king was already dead after a reign of but six months, in which the chief occurrence was a terrible pestilence.

Ardashír III., son of Kavádh, was now crowned at the age of seven. An era of distress and trouble followed, in which children or women sat on the throne, and the nobles disputed with one another for the reality of power. The holy cross was sent back from Ctesiphon through the primate of the Nestorians; and the feast of the Elevation of the Cross still commemorates the joyful day (14th September 629) when Heraclius solemnly re-erected it in Jerusalem. The Government at Ctesiphon was powerless; the Khazars harried the empire; and it was perhaps at this time that Khosrau, son of Kavádh, and grandson of Hormizd IV., who had been brought up among the Turks, sought to make himself king in Khorásán, but was slain after a few months. A more dangerous prétendant was the victorious general Shahrbaráz, who met with Heraclius in June 629 at Arabissus in Cappadocia, and probably there obtained an approval of his enterprise from the emperor, who naturally favoured the cause of disorder in Persia. Shahrbaráz took Ctesiphon with a small force aided by treason within; Ardashír was put to death (27th April 630); and robbery, murder, and every terror raged in the royal city. But Shahrbaráz, too, fell on the 9th of June a victim to the envy of his peers and the spirit of legitimism. His body was dragged through the streets, and tradition speaks with grotesque irony of the man who sought to be king but could not, because he was not of the lawful house.

Bórán, daughter of Khosrau II., now sat for a time on the throne (till about autumn 631), and appears to have closed the treaty of peace with Heraclius. The conditions are not recorded, but were probably the same as in the peace with Maurice; at all events the Persians kept Nisibis. Bórán was followed in Ctesiphon by her sister Azarmídokht, probably after a short interval in which a certain Péróz reigned. But in Nisibis the soldiery of the slain Shahrbaráz put forward Hormizd V., a grandson of Khosrau II., and he maintained himself in that quarter for a time (631-32). Azarmídokht was dethroned by Rustam, the powerful hereditary marshal of Khorásán, whose father’s death she had procured. Our confused records of this age of disorder do not permit us to give a clear chronological or geographical view of all pretenders who arose in the capital and provinces; but in Ctesiphon, we know, there reigned for a time a certain Ferrukhzádh (or Khorrezádh) Khosrau, apparently a child.^[305. He appears beardless on his only known coin. By some accounts he was the only son of Khosrau II. who had escaped massacre.] But another child, Yazdegerd III., son of Shahriyár, and so a grandson of Khosrau II., was put forward by certain nobles in Persis, and crowned in the fire-temple of Ardashír (second half of 632 or first half of 633). Soon Khosrau was slain and Yazdegerd acknowledged in the capital, and without much resistance in the provinces also.

Fond hopes could now be entertained that the wounds of the monarchy might be healed under a legitimate prince unstained by descent from the parricide Shéróe, consecrated in the cradle of the monarchy, and upheld by the strong hand of Rustam. Some temporary recovery seems actually to have taken place; but a new foe more dangerous than Julian or Heraclius was already knocking at the gates of the monarchy. That Yemen and some tracts in north Arabia had already been lost by Persia to the Moslems had scarcely been observed at Ctesiphon amidst so many greater disasters. But now the Moslems already hovered on the frontier. Mothanná, one of the boldest leaders of those Bedouins who since Dhú Kár had made frequent forays on Persian soil, accepted Islám, and had its strength at his back. These attacks became bolder and bolder. Presently Khálid, in all the prestige of his victory over the revolt of the Arabs against Islám (see vol. xvi. p. 562), appeared with a small force on the lower Euphrates to take the lead of these Bedouins. Persian troops and their Arab allies were repeatedly beaten in small engagements, and soon a number of fron tier-posts were in the hands of the Moslems.^[306. The history of the conquest is here given mainly after Beládhorí, whose short notices stand examination much better than Tabari and the historians who follow him. The chronology is in many points uncertain.] The inhabitants of the western bank of the lower Euphrates, who were all Christians and had little attachment to Persia, submitted themselves and promised to supply the victors with intelligence. Soon the Arabs ventured to cross the river and plunder the villages west of the Tigris.^[307. Baghdad, then such a village, was plundered on a fair tide.] In the early summer of 634, however, Khálid was called away to Syria; his successor, Abú Obaid of Táif, though strengthened by reinforcements[9:18:616], was utterly defeated and slain on his first meeting with a regular Persian host in the hard-fought “battle of the bridge” at the Euphrates, and Mothanná had great difficulty in saving the remains of the army (26th November 634). Not without hesitation the caliph Omar resolved to send a greater force to Trák, calling on his Arabs to win for themselves the treasures of the Khosraus and paradise; and now for the first time a considerable Persian army was defeated at Bowaib (635 or 636), with the loss of its general, a prince of the house of Mihrán. In Sa‘d ibn Abi Wakkás the Moslems had now an energetic and cautious leader, and the Persian court began to see its danger, especially when the news arrived of the battle of Yarmúk, by which Syria was lost to Heraclius. Rustam in person placed himself at the head of a great army, over which, in sign of the gravity of the enterprise, was borne the venerable sacred banner of the empire (dιrafshi kaviyan). Sa ’ d fell back before the Persian advance and posted himself at Kádisíya on the edge of the desert south or south-west of Híra, where the armies lay facing each other for months. The Arab force must have been inferior in strength, for no great army could have long held such a barren post nourished only by forays and what the caliph could send from Medina. At length, towards the close of the year 636, or in 637, battle was joined and raged for several days, Sa'd giving orders to his men in spite of a sickness under which he laboured. The Persians were better armed, but the Arabs fought with desperate energy. The elephants, which formed part of every regular Persian army, greatly terrified them at first, but ultimately these huge beasts, getting out of command, only aided the discomfiture of the Persians. Of the mass of a Persian host no great bravery was to be expected; yet it was only after a hard fight that the victory was decided, Rustam slain, and the sacred banner taken.

The battle of Kádisíya virtually decided the fate of the Tigris valley; but there was still some fighting on the plains of Babylonia, at Birs (Borsippa), and Seleucia was not taken without a lengthy siege. Then the Arabs crossed the Tigris and fell on Ctesiphon, Yazdegerd fleeing before them to Holwán on the Medo-Babylonian frontier. At Jalúlá on the road to Holwán the Arabs gained a fresh victory over Rustam’s brother, Khorrezádh, and Yazdegerd continued his flight. Meantime another body of Arabs had occupied Lower ‘Irák and entered Susiana. A strong and wise leader might still perhaps have saved Irán proper, and Omar, as energetic as cautious, was in fact slow to allow his armies to assail the highlands. It was not till some time between 640 and 642 that the “victory of victories,” as the Arabs rightly call it, was gained at Nehávend (a little south of the old high road from Babylon to Ecbatana), and the last great army of the Persians was shattered by No'mán, who fell on the field, and the Meccan Hodhaifa. Even now many individual provinces and cities did not yield without stubborn resistance, and in many places rebellion after rebellion had to be crushed, especially in the region around Istakhr, the cradle and sacred hearth of the fallen monarchy. Everywhere the great local barons and even the lesser nobility dealt with the Arabs as independent chiefs, and in many cases came to peaceful terms with them.

Yazdegerd fled from one to another of his lieutenants without venturing himself to strike a blow for his crown and his life. He still retained the forms of sovereignty, and coins were still struck in his name; but one host after another dismissed him as a burdensome guest, and at length he was miserably murdered in the remote district of Merv, not, it would appear, without the connivance of Máhóe, governor of that province (651 or 652).

The great similarity in the ends of the Achaemenian and Sásánian empires is no mere accident, but significant of the internal resemblance between the two. Granicus which showed the reality of the danger, Issus which lost Darius his western provinces, Gaugamela which broke up the monarchy and yet did not at once give possession of the several lands of the realm, have their parallels a thousand years later at Bowaib, Kádisíya, and Nehávend. The flight of Darius to the farthest north-east, and his death by the hand of traitors, not of the foe, are repeated in the fate of Yazdegerd, who resembles Darius also in his lack of heroism. The nobles showed more loyalty and patriotism against the Arabs than against Alexander, and indeed religious antipathy and the barbarism of the Arabs made it less easy in the later case for a Persian to accept the foreign yoke; yet even now there were too many traitors and deserters among the nobles high and low. Fully to subdue the Persian monarchy cost the Arabs a much longer time than it had cost the Macedonians; but the conquest went far deeper, —Hellenism never touched more than the surface of Persian life, but Irán, was penetrated to the core by Arabic religion and Arabian ways. See Mohammedanism.

A fragment of the Sásánian empire lasted for a considerable time in the mountains of Tabaristán (Mázandarán), to which the hereditary generals (Spclhpat, IspM>edh) of Khorásán, of the house of Káren, withdrew, and where they reigned for over a hundred years, though sometimes paying tribute to the caliphs. They remained faithful to Zoroastrianism, and apparently viewed themselves as direct successors of Yazdegerd, since the era employed on their coins seems to have his death as its epoch.

Literature.—G. Rawlinson, The Seventh Great oriental Monarchy (London, 1876), is inadequate. Fuller but still inadequate use of Oriental sources is made by Spiegel, Eranische Alterthiimer, vol. iii. (Leipsic, 1878). The documentary evidence is mostly collected in Nöldeke’s translation of Tabari (Geschichte der Perser, <tc., Leyden, 1879). For the relations of the Sásánians with Rome, Tillemont. Hist, des Empereurs, and Clinton, Fasti ll∩mani, must be used, and Saint-Martin’s notes to Lebeau, Hist, du Bas-Empire (Paris, 1828-36), are still useful. A great deal of serviceable matter is to be found in Hoffmann’s translation of excerpts from the Syriac Acts of Persian Martyrs (Syrische Akten Persischer Märtyrer, Leipsic, 1880). (TH. N.)

PART II. —MODERN PERSIA.

Section I.— Geography and Statistics. Long prior to the Christian era the satrapies of Cyrus comprehended roughly an immense range of territory, from the Mediterranean to the Indus and from the Caucasian chain and Jaxartes to the Persian Gulf and Aιabian Ocean. In the 17th and 18th centuries a.d. the conquests of 'Abbás and Nádir kept up these boundaries more or less on the east, but failed to secure them on the west, and were limited to the Caucasus and Oxus on the north. Persia of the present day is not only, in the matter of geographical definition, far from the vast empire of Sacred Writ and remote history, but it is not even the less extensive, though very expansive dominion of the Safawí kings and Nádir Sháh. It may be said, however, to comprise now quite as much settled and consolidated territory as at any period of its political existence of which we can speak with the authority of intimate acquaintance.

If it has less extent of land than before its latest disastrous war with Russia, there is certainly within its recognized limits less rebellion and more allegiance. And, if the true interests of Persia, considered as a living power, were only understood by her kings and ministers, she might reasonably seek to attain a state of security which would amply compensate for the loss of precarious and profitless expanse.

Boundaries.— The region of Ararat presents a good starting-point for the definition of a western and northern boundary to the kingdom of Násru’d-Dín Sháh. East of the Greater Ararat a short oblique line from the Arras to the south-west divides it from Russia. Below this begins the Perso-Turkish frontier, for the settlement of which a mixed commission was appointed in 1843. The outcome of the labours of this commission, which lasted more than twenty-five years, has been rather a careful delineation of the disputed tract than the delimitation of [9:18:617] an exact boundary, while the cession of Kotur to Persia, though part of the general question, must, if carried out at all, be looked upon as a separate result, due only to later diplomacy. The territorial claims of Turkey and Persia bear chiefly upon Kurdistan and the respective tribes which inhabit the plains and valleys of that extensive mountain region. They are founded upon the treaty of Sultan Murád IV. with Sháh Súfí in 1639, a later one of Nádir Sháh with Sultan Mahmúd I. in 1736, and one more recent still between Fath 'Alí Sháh and Mahmúd II. in 1823,—the last two maintaining the status quo established by the first. But, when the Anglo-Russian commission first met, the boundary of possession fell far short of Turkish pretensions. These would have extended the pashalik of Baiyazid (Bayazid) in the province of Arzrum (Erzeroum) to a line including Makú, chief place in the district, and situated on the bank of the river of that name.^[308. Under the treaty of San Stefano (3d March 1878) the old Perso-Turkish became the Perso-Russian frontier as far south as to include the post - road below Baiyazid; but the territory so taken from the Turks was restored under the later treaty of Berlin.] Farther south, again, the sultan insisted on increasing the area of the province of Van by the forcible annexation of Kotur. Such an act, after the assembly of a commission for the demarcation of the disputed frontier, was neither justified by precedent nor could it enhance the merits of the Turkish claim, and the reason alleged, that Kotur was essential to the Ottoman Government for strategical reasons—in other words, that it gave the Turk free access into his neighbour’s territory—could scarcely be taken to account in the estimation of their opponents. The question was submitted on behalf of Persia to the Berlin Conference in 1878, and a special Anglo-Russian commission appointed to consider it in July 1880. The proposed cession, if accepted, would substitute for the present curve eastwards a line more direct but with a westerly inclination, whereby the fort and station of Kotur become embodied in Persian territory. This section of frontier is overlooked on the north by the mountains Bebi Kourgui, Guerdi Beranan, and Khidhr Baba, passes through Tépé Avristan on the west to the Turkish road to Kotur, follows this road to the west for half a mile, and then turns due south between Mount Kevlik and the river Shiva Resh to the sources of the latter, whence it zigzags to the eastward to rejoin the general boundary-line overlooked by the Kára Hisár, Mir Omar, Guéré - Sourava, and Guéré - Berian Mountains. Sir Henry Rawlinson saw difficulty in defining a line of frontier from Ararat to Kotur; for the country was not only intersected by ranges running in every possible direction, but it wanted a fixed population, and was, moreover, liable to the incursions of wild Kurdish tribes, who would have no respect for boundary-marks. Below Kotur, and south-west of the important Persian town of Khoí, the old line of possession inclined considerably to the westward, but Turkey claimed a more advantageous line running nearly north and south to the passes between Súk Bulak and Rowandiz, one of which was crossed in 1875 by Thielmann, who gives an interesting account of the surrounding country. The plain of Lahijan on the Persian side—some 20 miles long and 20 miles broad—he describes to be at an elevation of 5650 feet, “watered by the two sources of the Little Záb, which, several miles after their junction, traverses the mountain range through a deep rent . . . and then flows towards the Tigris.” On the west of this district is the “gigantic wall of the Zagros Mountains, the frontier-line between Turkey and Persia.” Hence, to the latitude of Sulimaniya, or for more than 100 miles, the Turks claimed farther than the ancient limits assigned to them, and sought to include within the Ottoman territory the border-fort of Sardasht, on the left bank of the Aksu.

Continuing the line of disputed frontier to the southward, the same difficult country still presents itself to perplex the decisions of commissioners or arbitrators, but from the’warmly-contested district of Zoháb in the province of Karmansháh up to Dizful on the Diz river the mountains may be said generally to indicate Persian and the plains Turkish territory. Lúristan and Khúzistan (with Arabistan) are the frontier provinces of the sháh, and the Hamrin Hills, with Hawízah, Muhamrah, and the east bank of the Shattu Ι- t Arab, show the Persian possessions to the head of the gulf.

The want of a determined line of demarcation between the tλvo countries for the 700 miles from Ararat to the Shatt, or outlet into the sea of the waters of the Tigris and Euphrates, may have political advantages, but is inconvenient to the geographer and most unfavourable to the cause of order and good government. Even without the evidence of open conflict, it may be assumed that there are few inhabited sections of the strip of disputed frontier (from 20 to 40 miles in breadth) where mutual ill feeling is not the rule, and where the Turkish Sunni does not abstain from friendly association with the Persian Shi'ah. More recently attempts have been made, and apparently with success, to reconcile differences by British and Russian mediation, and a renewal of the days need not be anticipated when telegraph-posts were torn up or destroyed, lands laid waste, and villages plundered, owing to the prevalence of the old spirit of hostility. A fixed boundary would, however, in a great measure facilitate settlements of dispute, because it would more clearly make known the actual transgressors.

From the already-adverted-to point on the Arras east of the Greater Ararat the river itself supplies a northern boundary to Persia up to the fortress of t Abbasabad, where a cession of strategical works to Russia is noted by a loop on the southern bank. Thence the line is generally marked by the bed of the Arras for a distance of about 180 miles, descending as low as 38° 50' N. lat., and rising again to 39° 30' north-east of the steppe of Moghan. An oblique line running south-east to the Bulgaru Chái makes that stream the southern boundary for 13 miles to the confluence of the Adina Bazár and Sairkamish, the former of which then limits the Persian territory on the east. From the source of the Adina Bazár the crest of the mountains towering over the more distant Russian ports on the western shores of the Caspian, and separating the Talish from the Arsha, marks the division of the two territories up to the river of Astara, the port of which name completes the demarcation on the sea-coast. Thus far the result of the treaty of Turkmánchái, dated 10 [22] February 1828, which involved Persia in a serious loss. To the southward all is Persian, and the two large maritime provinces of Gílan and Mazandaran, both laved by the waters of the Caspian, represent the northernmost parts of the sháh’s dominions between the 49 th and 54th meridians of E. long. In the southeastern corneι∙ of the Caspian the island of Ashuráda in the Bay of Astrábád was appropriated by Russia in 1842 as a convenient post for overawing the Túrkmans (Turkomans).

Eastward of the Caspian, from the Hasan Kúlí Gulf, the line of Persian territory cannot be indicated with absolute certainty, because the Russian maps do not correspond with those prepared by the war department in England; and it need hardly be added that the former give to Russia far more land than do the others. According to Colonel Stewart, an officer for some time resident in the vicinity of the Atak, or skirt of the mountains fronting the Black Sand Desert, the line follows the Atrak (Atrek) from its mouth to Shatt, where it leaves the river [9:18:618] and passes obliquely west of the Simba r to a point within 15 miles of Kizil Arvat,^[309. Probably a plural or perversion of ribát, a caravansará.] and then turns towards the Tekke range to Darahgáz, which district it includes in an outer curve, passing on to the Tajand at Sarakhs. The Russian official map, however, brings the line south and east of the Simbar, and otherwise impoverishes Persia to the benefit of her powerful neighbour. But the first article of the Russo-Persian treaty signed in December 1881 at Tehran (Teheran) thus describes the situation :—

“From Chat (Shatt ?) the frontier-line follows in a north-easterly direction the ridges of the Songou Dagh and Sagirim ranges, thence extending northward to the Chandir river, reaching its bed at Cha-kan Kala. From this point it runs in a northerly direction to the mountains dividing the Chandir and Simbar valleys, and extends along the ridge of these in an easterly direction, descending into the bed of the Simbar at the spot where the Ak-Agayan stream falls into it. Hence, eastward, the bed of the Simbar marks the frontier as far as the ruins of Masjid Damanah, where a local road forms the boundary to the ridge of the Kopet Dagh, along which the frontier extends south-eastward, turning south among the mountain heights which divide the valley of the Simbar from the source of the Garmáb. Taking a south-easterly course across the summit of the Misino and Chubest Mountains, it then strikes the road between Garmáb and Ribát at a distance of less than a mile north of the latter, and, following a high ridge, proceeds in a north-easterly direction to the boundaries of Giuk Kaital. Hence, after crossing the gorge of the river Firuzé, it turns south-east till it reaches the summits of the mountain range, bounding the valley on the south, through which the road from the Russian station of Askabad to Firuzé passes, and pursues its course along the crest of these mountains to the most easterly part of the range. The frontier-line now crosses over to the northernmost summit of the Aselm range, whence it seeks out the junction of the mountains called Ziri Kuh and Kizil Dagh, extending south-eastward along the summits of the former until it issues into the valley of the Baba Durmaz stream. It then takes a northerly direction and reaches the oasis at the road from Gawars to Lutfabad, leaving the fortress of Baba Durmaz to the east.”

The distance from Baba Durmaz to Sarakhs is about 185 miles, and the intervening boundary is that of the ataks of Darahgáz and Kelat, both of which districts belong to Persia. The word “atak,” signifying “skirt,” applies to the whole hill-country separating Persia from the Turkman desert, though these mountains and their passes and valleys are not all within the sháh’s present dominion. That they present a formidable barrier and remarkable geographical features may be inferred from the ascertained height of the loftier peaks, which, though inferior to those situated some 50 miles to the south, can still boast a figure varying from 5000 to 10,000 feet. In the Hazár Masjid range is one of 10,500. Adopting Rawlinson’s divisions and distances, the whole Atak, or “Dáman-i-Kuh,” as the Persians call it, is divided into three districts: the Akhal Atak, extending for 160 miles, from Kizil Arvat to Darahgáz, the last Túrkman camp (obah) in which is at Gawars; the Darahgáz Atak, 70 miles, to Abiverd; and the Kelat Atak, 60 miles, to Melina. Thence to Sarakhs another 70 miles may be reckoned, to accomplish which the traveller leaves the mountains on his right and the wonderful natural fortress of Kelat-i-Nádirí in his rear, to strike the Tajand at the crossing point between Merv and Mashhad (Meshed).

The subjection by Russia of the Túrkman tribes and the planting of her standard in the hill-country on the western side of the Atak have immensely strengthened her power in the region east of the Caspian. These new Cossacks of the Black Sand Desert will be a great acquisition to her force, though their antecedents denote propensities rather aggressive than protective. In one respect the Persians should be gainers by the encroachment. It is hardly probable that under the new arrangements in the Atak the north-east frontier of Persia will be so frequently the scene of plunder and invasion as it has been of old, or that the marauders will be allowed by the Russian con querors to continue the unchecked exercise of their infamous profession in Khurásan (Khorásan).

Special mention of Sarakhs, the extreme outpost of Persia in thenorth-east, appears to be appropriate, both on account of its geographical position and of its political importance. This place, situated on the plain of the same name,^[310. West of the Tajand, called by Dr Wolff the “Dariya” (or sea) of Sarakhs.] was fifty years ago a mere outpost of Mazduran, the frontier hill-station on the shortest of three roads (and somewhat more than midway) between Mashhad the capital of Khurásan and Sarakhs. It was visited in 1860 by Μ. de Blocqueville, who found there a recently-constructed Persian fort, with strong walls and protected by a ditch. Some of the towers contained as many as ten guns. He says nothing of the ruins of the old town on the east of the Tajand, though he forded the river; but Burnes, who in 1833 put up in a ruined tomb amid the Túrkman tents or “khargáhs” in that particular locality, had been equally silent regarding it. The last-named traveller speaks of the shrine of a Muhammadan saint, of a small weak fort, and of a few mud-houses only, and states that, at the third mile after leaving his encampment to enter Persia, he crossed the Tajand,—not supposing it, however, to be the Herat river. Sir Charles Macgregor was at New Sarakhs in 1879. He describes the fort as immense,—an irregular polygon, with eleven bastions, and citadel attached. It had a garrison of some 700 infantry, with a few horsemen, and eleven guns of more or less use. From its walls he reviewed the surrounding country. On the north stretched one vast plain almost unbroken by tree, bush, mound, or undulations, for the bed of the Tajand winding round to the north-west was too low to be visible. On the north-east lay the road to Merv stretched out beyond the dark tamarisk foliage of the river. To the east all was clear; south-east were undulating rounded ridges extending towards the Múrgháb; south was Mazduran; and north of west was a confused mass of rugged hills in the direction of Kelat-i-Nádirí. Lastly, we have the testimony of Lessar, the Russian engineer, who, visiting the place in 1882, found it extensively fortified and occupied by a battalion of Persian infantry; the armament of the fortification, however, consisted only of six old guns, which were never discharged, while the artillerymen were ignorant of their duties, and neither drilled nor exercised. Water was supplied from wells inside the walls and by canal from the Tajand.^[311. Other modern travellers have written of Sarakhs, among them an intelligent Indian, Dáúd Khan, but they give no information additional to that of the authorities quoted.]

To define the eastern boundary of Persia, the lower course of the Hari Rúd, under its name of Tajand, may be accepted generally up to Pul-i-Khátún, whence to Tuman Agha the line is continued by the river in its own name. From this point it runs due south across the mountain range overtopped by the conical peak of the Sang-i-Dukhtar, and through the edge of the Salt Desert, leaving Kuhsan and Zangi Suwar, villages near the Hari Rúd, and the more important Ghurian in Afghan territory.^[312. When Mr Forster was at Kháf in 1783, Timur Sháh, the ruler in Afghanistan, bad his boundary between that [dace and Turshiz.] Again crossing the ranges which intersect the desert from the north-east, the line, inclining somewhat to the west of south, is continued to Cháh Sagak (the “dog’s well”), an elevated spot on the old caravan route between India and Persia, as far as which the Afghans have the right of pasturage. To the westward is the Persian province of Káiyan. The surrounding country bears the significant name of Dasht-i-Na-Umaid, or “Waste of Hopelessness.” For 8 miles south-east, 8 miles due east, and 24 miles south, in all about 40 miles, the line is carried to the [9:18:619] Siyáh Kuh, or “Black Hill,” on the border of the district of Nehbandan. Here begins the line of frontier determined by the Sístan arbitration of 1872. The British commissioner (Sir F. Goldsmid) decided that an oblique line drawn from the Siyáh Kuh to the southern limit of the reedy marsh called “Naizár,” and prolonged to the main outlet of the Helmand, would fairly separate and distinguish the possessions of the two states respectively in the north of Sístan. On the east the bed of the Helmand itself would be the boundary up to Kuhak, where was the large “band” or dam which diverted the waters of the river into the more fertile lands to the west. From Kulιak a line south-west to the Kuh Malik Siyáh completed the delimitation by leaving the tλvo banks of the Helmand in the hands of the Afghans, and placing a large tract of partly desert and partly inundated country between the litigants. Subsequent surveys by Sir Charles Macgregor have thrown new light upon the large and little-populated tract to the far south of Sístan, and are suggestive of an Afghan-Baluch as well as of a Perso-Afghan frontier.

In whatever light it be regarded, the line of Persian frontier from the Kuh Malik Siyáh to the sea rather concerns Baluchistan than Afghanistan; but, though roughly delineated by St John and Macgregor, it cannot be described with scientific accuracy until it reaches the district of Jalk, or after a south-easterly passage of 170 miles through the deserts of Pir Kaisar and the Mashkel or Mashkid,—names used as the more likely to identify the region traversed. From Jalk the Perso-Kelat boundary begins, as determined by Major-General Goldsmid, the British commissioner in 1871, and verified in the subsequent year by Captain (now Sir Oliver) St John, R.E. The state of Kelat (Khelat), it should be explained, is now that of western Baluchistan, the western half of that country having become annexed to Persia by a process of gradual encroachment. It was this action of Persia, and the disquiet and mischief which it occasioned in Makran and other parts of Baluch and Brahui territory, that brought about the British mediation.

From Jalk to the sea is about 150 miles as the crow flies. By the line laid down it is very much farther, as the nature of the country and of the claims of the contending parties did not admit of other than a tortuous course. The small district of Kuhak, lying south-east of Jalk, should, in a geographical sense, have been included among the lands on the Persian side, but the evidence of right and possession was insufficient to warrant its separation from Kelat, and, whatever may have been its subsequent fate, it was not made over to the sháh’s governors by the original decision, which was expressed in the following terms :—

“The territory of Kelat is bounded to the west by the large Persian district of Dizak, composed of many dehs or minoι ’ districts, those on the frontier being Jalk and Kalagán. Below these two last-named is Kuhak, including Kunarbasta and Isfandar. This small district belongs to the Naushirwánis, and, as its chief pays no tribute, cannot be included among the conquests of Persia. It therefore remains as a tract of country within the Kelat frontier. Adjoining Kuhak to the east is the district of Panjgúr, with Párum and other dependencies, which are in the possession of Kelat; while on the Persian side Bampusht is the frontier possession. Below Panjgúr the frontier possessions of Kelat to the sea are Bulaida, including Zamrán and other dependencies, Mand, and Dasht. Within the Persian line of frontier are the villages or tracts belonging to Sarbáz and Bahn Dastiári. The boundary of Dasht is marked by a line drawn through the Drabol hill, situated between the rivers Bahu and Dasht, to the sea, in the bay of Gwatar.”

The boundaries of the frontier districts or village-lands named are well known, and may be distinguished by mountains, hills, hillocks, rivers, streams, or cultivation. In some places desert tracts occur which can offer no inducement for encroachment on either side, but through which a line may at any time be declared, if necessary, both by geographical computation and the erection of pillars.

The frontiers of Persia on the west, north, and east have now been described. The southern, or more strictly the south-western merging into the southern boundary, is the coast-line of the Persian Gulf and Arabian Ocean. This extends from the Khor Abdullah west to the port of Gwatar east, and may be held to be comprised between the meridians 49° and 61° 30' E. long. It will be observed that the Caspian Sea boundary, on the immediate north of Persia, is only two-fifths of this extent. On the Persian shores of the gulf are the ports of Bushahr (Bushire), Lingah, and Bandar-'Abbás, with the islands of Karag, Shaikh Sh'ab, Hindarábi, Kais, Kishm, Hangám, Hormuz (0rmus), and Larak, of which the last four are habitually held in lease by the imám of Maskat (Muscat). On the Perso-Baluch coast are the telegraph stations of Jask and the quasi-ports of Chárbár (or Chahbár) and Gwatar. In some parts of the generally dry and barren coast are ranges of rugged mountains, sometimes rising to a very considerable height.

Physical Geography.— Major (now Sir Oliver) St John, R.E., is perhaps the latest recognized authority on the physical characteristics of the large extent of country comprised within the boundaries just described. He has himself surveyed or travelled over no insignificant portion, and has carefully studied the labours of his colleagues and predecessors in a similar field. In the following adaptation of that officer’s account of its orography and hydrography attention has been given to the results of independent observation, as well as to those theories put forward by other travellers which seem to merit acceptance.

Persia—that is, modern Persia—occupies the western and larger half of the great Iranian plateau which, rising to a height of from 4000 to 8000 feet between the valleys of the Indus and Tigris, covers in round numbers more than a million square miles. Taking the Kuren Dagh and Kopet Dagh to form the northern scarp of this plateau east of the Caspian, we find a prolongation of it in the highlands north of the political frontier on the Arras, and even in the Caucasus itself. In St John’s own words:—“The Caucasian provinces of Russia are but an excrescence of the great elevated mass to the south-east; differing from it only in characteristics produced by the more bounteous rainfall which has scooped out the valleys to a greater depth.” On the north-west Persia is united by the highlands of Armenia to the mountains of Asia Minor; on the north-east the Paropanisus and Hindu Kush connect it with the Himalayas of ancient India. The lines of boundary on the western and eastern faces are to be traced amid high ranges of mountains broken here and there by deserts and valleys. These ranges lie for the most part northwest and south-east, as do those in the interior, with a marked exception between Tehran (Teheran) and Bújnúrd, and in the more recently acquired territory of Baluchistan, where they lie rather north-east and south-west, or, in the latter case, sometimes east and west. The real lowlands are the tracts near the sea-coast belonging to the forestclad provinces of the Caspian in the north and the shores of the Persian Gulf below Basrah and elsewhere.

With regard to the elevation of the Persian mountains, the Russian Caspian survey gives to the highest, Damávand, 18,600 feet, and to Mount Savalan in Adarbaijan (Azerbijan) 14,000. St John estimates the Kuh Hazár and summits of the Jamal Báriz in the province of Karman (Kirman) at a greater figure than the last, but he believes the chain of the Kuh Dinár—snow-clad mountains in Fárs, visible from the sea at a distance of 130 miles, and over ranges known to be 10,000 feet high—to present the highest continuous range in Persia. To the Kúrú range, between Ispahan and Kashan, he gives an elevation of above 11,000 feet, and notes the absence of prominent spurs in all ranges [9:18:620] except the Alburz (Elburz), and to a lesser extent in the Khurásan hills.

The Khúzistan delta is cited as the only plain of extent and importance at sea-level. In the north-west, that part of the Moghan steppe which belongs to Persia and the delta of the Safíd Rúd are large and fertile tracts. St John writes :—

“Inland the long and narrow plains between the ridges rise gradually from 1000 feet to eight times that height in the valleys between the ridges on the east side of the western water-parting, and 4, 5, and 6000 farther south and east. The plains of Isfahan, Shíráz, and Persepolis are about 5000 feet; that of Karman somewhat higher. The valleys of Adarbaiján present alluvial slopes furrowed by torrents, and the only extensive tableland in Persia, that of Sultáuiah.

“As they recede from the east and north, the intervals between the ridges are wider, and the rainfall smaller, till grassy valleys are replaced by gravelly deserts, which culminate in wastes of shifting sand. The valley between Abádah and Yazd, a prolongation of the Zaindarúd valley, contains the first of these sandy wastes, which, under the influence of the strong south-easterly winds, occasionally invade the neighbouring cultivated tracts. The· original city of Rhages, south-east of Tehran, is said to have been abandoned on this account.”

Estimating the extent of Persia proper at 610,000 square miles, St John thus distributes the drainage :—(1) into the Arabian Sea and Persian Gulf, 130,000; (2) into the Caspian and Aral Seas, 100,000; (3) into the Sístan Lake, 40,000; (4) into the large lake of Urmíya or Úrumíyah, 20,000; (5) interior drainage, 320,000. No. (1) comprises the south-west provinces and the whole of the coast-region up to the small port of Gwatar in Baluchistan; (2) relates to the tracts south, south-west, and south-east of the Caspian; (3) is the tract adjudicated to Persia, including the Hámún and part of the Helmand basin; (4) is a comparatively small area on the western frontier containing the basin of Lake Urmíya, shut off from the rest of the inland draining of Persia; (5) takes in Ispahan, Karman, and the province of Khurásan, with the Dasht-i-Kavír, or “Great Salt Desert.” He points out that the area draining into the ocean consists of a long strip nearly parallel to the Tigris and sea-coast without a single protrusion inland, but is uncertain whether an outlet exists from the Bampúr plain in Persian Baluchistan to the sea. A later traveller, Floyer, mentions the names of two rivers debouching on the coast, namely the Sadaich and Gabrig, λvhich might represent such outlets, but their courses have not been traced with sufficient completeness to supply a solution to the problem. If the native evidence taken by Major Goldsmid at Fanoch in 1866 can be relied on, the river entering the pass of that name from the highlands of Bampúr, after undergoing two or three changes of nomenclature, passes out into the ocean as the Kálig.

According to St John, a narrow strip of land, not more than 30 to 50 miles wide, along the southern coast of the Caspian, drains into that sea. On the west it suddenly widens out to a depth of 250 miles, meeting the watershed of the Tigris on the one side and that of the Euphrates and Lake Van on the other, and embracing between the two the basin of Lake Urmíya, which forms with the basin of Lake Van what may be termed the supplementary plateau of Armenia, differing only from the Persian and Helmand basins in its superior altitude and smaller area. On the east the watershed of the Caspian gradually increases in breadth, the foot of the scarp extending considerably to the north of the south-east angle of that sea, three degrees east of which it turns to the south-east, parallel to the axis of the Kuren and Kopet ranges, which, as before stated, are a prolongation of the Caucasus. A little short of Herat the Caspian water-parting turns eastward, separating the valleys of the Hari Rúd and Hárút rivers. West of Herat the desert plateau of Kháf divides the Caspian from the Helmand basin.

The three rivers belonging essentially to Persia, in reference to the Caspian watershed, are the Kizil L τ zain or Safíd Rúd on the south-west and the Atrak and Gurgan at the south-eastern corner of that inland sea. The first is stated by St John to drain about 25,000 square miles of country east and south of the Urmíya basin. According to Colonel Stewart, the Atrak has its source in the Hazár Masjid range of mountains, a distance, probably, of 250 miles as the crow flies, from the river mouth. The Gurgan rises to the west of it and passes to the sea south of the Atrak. Observing that the Tajand, taking a sweep round Sarakhs, forms a swamp in the Atak about the 58th meridian, the same authority explains that as far south as 30° N. lat.—

“the eastern slopes of the ranges which shut off the valley of the Helmand from the deserts of eastern Persia drain directly towards the Sistán Lake. South of that parallel the surplus water flows hy several channels in a south-easterly direction, or away from the lake. About latitude 29°, the water-parting of the Balúchistán mountain-system, running east and west, changes the direction of these streams, and collects them into a single channel, which, under the name of the Mashkíd river, bursts through the northern scarp of the Balúch hills into the Khárán desert. Here it takes a northwesterly course, thus reversing the original direction of its waters, which are lost in the desert not far from their most northern sources. It is very probable that these, finding a subterranean channel some distance farther to the north, aid to fill the Zirreh swamp, the southern of the three depressions which, united by flood-waters, form the Hámún or Sistán Lake.”

The great central area of Persia, included in the watersheds he has described, “forms a figure nearly triangular, with a base running south-west about 1000 miles long, and nearly equal sides north and east of 700 miles.”

St John observes that the streams draining southern and western Persia into the sea diminish regularly in importance from north-west to south-east. He notes the Diyálah and Karkhah flowing into the Tigris from the mountains of Kurdistan; the Diz and Kárún, which unite below Shústar (Shuster), and reach the Shattu Ί-'Arab at Muhamrah; and the Jaráhi and Táb, which with the Kárún form “the delta of Persian Arabistan, the most extensive and fertile plain in Persia.” After these he lays stress upon the fact that not a single stream unfordable at all seasons bars the passage of the traveller along the coast till he reaches the Indus. Those rising amid the high mountains north of Bushahr and Bandar-'Abbás are, with the exception of the Mira, which debouches at 60 miles below Bushahr, nameless in the most trustworthy maps; and in Persian Baluchistan we have the Jagín, Gabrig, Sadaich, Rábij, Kair, and Káju.

The Kárún merits especial notice as a navigable river for small steamers up to within a mile or two of Shústar, though not favourable to the establishment of a regular service, owing to the existence of rapids at Ahwaz. By land there are perhaps somewhat more than 100 miles from Muhamrah to Shústar; and Colonel Chamρain, an excellent authority, states that from Shústar to Ispahan the distance is as nearly as possible the same as from Shíráz to Ispahan, the high road for ordinary travellers passing to and fro between Tehran and the sea-coast. Little need be said on the streams having no outlet to the sea, the water of which is utilized by cultivators both before they reach the alluvial plain between the ranges and afterwards in irrigating the banks. Referring to these St John notes the constant affluents which prevent the rapid exhaustion of water, and the salt swamps or lakes formed by the rivers at points far removed from their source. Six of these inland streams he mentions by name, viz., the Aji Chái and Jaghatu, flowing into the salt-lake of Urmíya; the Hamadan Rúd or Kára Sú and the Shúráb, flowing eastwards to the Salt Desert; the Zainda Rúd, a river of Ispahan, lost in an unexplored swamp; and the Kúr or Bandamir, which forms the salt-lake of Nírís. He sees [9:18:621] cause for believing the lakes of Shíráz and Kazrún to be fed mainly by springs.

St John writes further :—

“It will be readily believed that the rainfall on the Oceanic and Caspian watersheds is far in excess of that on the interior. Wherever the water-parting is formed, as it is in most parts, by a lofty mountain ridge, it intercepts the moisture-bearing clouds from the sea which are discharged from its outer slopes. The Älbúrz chain, which shuts off the plateau from the Caspian, may be taken as the typical instance of this. Its northern face is furrowed into deep valleys by the constant and heavy showers which have clothed them in forests of almost tropical luxuriance, while the southern generally presents a single abrupt scarp, rising above long gravel slopes, unchannelled by anything worthy the name of a river, and bare of any vegetation rising to the dignity of a tree. At the most moderate estimate the rainfall of Gilán and Mazandarán may be taken as five times that of the adjoining districts across the ridges to the south.

“In other parts, however, we find the water-parting considerably below the level of the summits farther inland; and here the interior has a more plenteous rainfall than the coast. This is particularly the case in south-eastern Persia, where the Khurasan, Sarhad, and Dízak hills, far exceeding in altitude the ranges to the south, attract to themselves the major portion of the scanty supply of moisture borne inland from the sea. Again the rainfall differs very much in different parts of the country, under apparently similar conditions as regards mountains and distance from the sea; the east and south being far drier than the north and west, while the dampest parts of the Tigris valley have not half the rainfall of the southern and south-eastern shores of the Caspian.

“Two palpable causes unite to produce the prevailing winds throughout Persia and the Persian Gulf. These are, with an extraordinary uniformity, north-west or south-east. The first cause is the position of the Black Sea and Mediterranean on the north-west, and of the Arabian Sea on the south-east. The second is the bearing of the axes of the great mountain chains, which lie mainly in the same direction, and thus tend to guide the currents of air in a uniform course. The south-west, moreover, is not felt, except as moderating the temperature of the Makrán coast inside a line from Rás-al-Hadd, south of Maskat, to Karachi.

“The effect of the sun on the great Iranian plateau is to produce a heated stratum of air, which, when it rises, is succeeded by a current from the colder atmospheres above the seas to the southeast or north-west. Naturally the latter is the colder, and therefore, as might be expected, north-west winds are most prevalent. But in southern Persia and the gulf it often occurs that the two currents meet, and that a north-westerly gale is raging at Bushahr while a south-easter is blowing at Bandar-Abbas. This latter wind is the rain-bearer throughout the greater part of Persia, the exception being the north-west, where occasional rain-clouds from the Black Sea and the Caspian find their way across the Kúrdish mountains or the Albúrz. It is true that it often rains even on the gulf during a north-wester, but only when this has followed a succession of south-easterly gales, the moisture borne by which is returned from the opposite quarter.”

There are no sufficient statistics available accurately to estimate the rainfall in Persia, but St John, himself a resident of some years in the country, was of opinion that in no part of it excepting the watersheds of the Caspian and Persian Gulf (north of 28° lat.) and their immediate reverse slopes, with perhaps the Urmíya basin, is there an average of 10 inches, taking mountain and hill together. He believed that throughout the greater part of central and south-eastern Persia and Baluchistan the annual rainfall could not be much more than five inches, and that, were it not for the snow stored on the lofty hills, nine-tenths of the country would be the arid desert which one-half was found to be when he wrote (1876). Cultivation is carried on mainly by artificial irrigation, the most approved arrangement being an underground tunnel called “kanát,” whereby wells are connected and supplies of water ensured.

One remarkable feature in the plains of Persia which naturally engaged St John’s attention was the salt-swamp called “kavír.” He applied the term to those bogs of slimy mud found in the lowest depressions of the alluvial soil, where the supply of water, though constant, was insufficient to form a lake. In winter they are covered with brine, and in summer with a thick crust of salt. The principal kavír is that in Khurásan, and marked in the maps as the Great Salt Desert. St John describes it as “the eastern part of what is probably the most extensive plain in Persia, that intercepted between the Alburz and its parallel ridges on the one hand and the heads of the ranges of the central plateau which run southeast on the other. Westward, it is divided into two valleys, originating, one in the Sultániah plateau, and the other north of and near Hamadan. These are drained by rivers named respectively the Shúráb and the Kára Sú, which, with another considerable affluent from Turshiz, on the east, unite to form the great kavir.” He was unable to determine the altitude of this extensive swamp further than that it might be below the level of the sea, but could not be much above it.

Other kavírs he finds in the Sarjan or Sayidábád plain west of Karman and in the neighbouring valley of Kútrú. Among ordinary kavírs, which are “innumerable,” he considers the largest to be on the south of Kháf, and the best known that north of Kúm.

It is clear, from the description given, that the range of these particular salt-swamps or kavírs is confined to the actual depression which has been directly affected by the passage of water, and that the term is not intended to apply to the surrounding wastes. But it seems to have been otherwise understood by the generality of travellers, and the better-known writers on Persia have seldom made the actual distinction here implied. Malcolm in 1800 crossed a “salt-desert” between Pul-i-Dallak and Hauz-i-Sultan, which, he says, was called Dariya-i-Kabir, or “the great sea.” Morier, nine years later, calls the place the " swamp of kαveer, . . . part of the great desert which reaches unto Khurasan, the soil of which is composed of a mixture (at least equal) of salt and earth.” Colonel Johnson, passing over precisely the same road in 1817, describes it as leading “over a saline plain, leaving here and there hollows of considerable magnitude, white with salt; . . . eastward it stretches as far as the eye can see, and is said to reach to Mausila, distant 40 miles.” The writer would probably have been surprised to learn that it extended for at least ten times the distance named. He does not, however, use the word “kavír,” which, while duly recorded as a Persian word in the dictionary, meaning salsuginous ground, is strangely like the Arabic adjective “kabir,” which Malcolm, as just mentioned, has coupled with “dariya” in his Sketches of Persia. St John states that in the south the saltswamps are called “kafeh.”

The last writer asserts that but one European, Dr Biihsé, a Russian, had seen the true kavír, having crossed it in about 34° lat., when going from Damghan to Yazd. Sir Charles Macgregor must have been close upon this traveller’s track in 1875, for in the district of Biabának (the “little desert ”), which he visited, one of the eight villages, Jandak, is marked in St John’s map as an oasis just above the parallel mentioned. Biabának is, according to Macgregor, situated “south of the kaνeer," but it is joined to Semnan (on the Tehran-Mashhad highway) by a “regular road” which “crosses a bit of kaveer of about 80 miles without water.”

The drier deserts of Karman and Bampúr cannot be included in the category of swamps; and the term “lút,” made use of by the Russian geographer Khanikoff in reference to the former, whatever its original derivation, must simply be accepted as the common local expression, in eastern Persia and western Baluchistan, for a waste waterless tract.

Geology.— Mr W. T. Blanford has given us an interesting sketch of the geology of Persia. He found that by far the greater number of those who had treated the same subject before him had restricted their inquiries to the north-western provinces, and that few had penetrated east of Damávand or south of Tehran. Mr Loftus had imparted a fair knowledge of western Persia, and Russian and German explorers had made students tolerably acquainted with Adarbaijan, Gilan, and Mazandaran. Khurásan and eastern Persia generally were, however, in a geological sense unknown, and the south was almost equally a terra incognita, unless exception were made for certain stray observations on the shores of the Persian Gulf. The following passages are extracted from his paper.

“The most striking circumstance noticed during a journey in Persia is the great prevalence of formations, such as gravel, sand, and clay, of apparently recent origin; the whole of the great plains, covering at least one-half the surface of the country, consist either [9:18:622] of a fine, pale - coloured alluvial loam, which covers the lowest portion of the surface, or of gravel, fine or coarse, which usually forms a long gentle slope from the surrounding hills to the alluvial flat, and fills up with long slopes the broad valleys opening into the larger plains. All these deposits are more conspicuous than they are in most countries in consequence of the paucity of vegetation and the absence of cultivation throughout the greater part of the surface. Nor is this prevalence of recent or sub-recent detrital accumulations confined to the plains, for the slopes of the hills up to a considerable elevation are in some cases composed of similar unconsolidated formations, from which only occasional peaks of solid rock emerge. This, however, is by no means universally the case, many ranges consisting entirely of rock. Again, the descent in Balúchistán from the plateau to the sea-coast is over broad terrace-like flats of gravel and sand, separated from each other by ranges of hills running parallel to the coast-line.

“The mountains and hill-ranges of Persia comprise a considerable variety of geological formations, a few of which, however, prevail over large areas of country. So far as our knowledge at present extends, the great mass of the Zagros chain (the term being used in the widest sense for the whole mountain-range from Mount Ararat to Shiraz, together with the numerous parallel minor ranges north-east of the main chain) consists of cretaceous (hippuritic) and tertiary formations, the former constituting the north-east half of the range and its slope towards the central plain of Persia, whilst the nummulitic and later formations prevail almost exclusively on the south-west watershed overlooking the Tigris valley. Older rocks occur, but they are of subordinate importance, and it appeared probable, both to Mr Loftus and myself, that part at least of the altered rocks which form no inconsiderable portion of the range to the north-east is very probably of cretaceous origin. Old granite rocks, however, form a great band, extending from Lake Urumiah to a point nearly due west of Isfahan, and the same crystalline masses appear in the ranges between Isfahan and Káshán.”

The general direction of the Persian mountains north-west to south-east has already been noticed. Speaking of these, Blanford says that, so far as they have been examined, “they have the same geological features as the Zagros, and consist similarly in the main of cretaceous and nummulitic rocks, the former prevailing to the north-east towards the desert, the latter to the south-west near the sea. Here, again, metamorphic rocks occur, some of them granite, others but little altered, and closely resembling in facies the cretaceous beds in their neighbourhood. Volcanic formations also occupy an extensive area, and whilst some appear of very late origin, others are possibly contemporaneous with the cretaceous epoch.”

Of the southern border-land of the Persian plateau he writes— “Where crossed by Major St John and myself, between Gwádar and Jalk, it consisted of low ranges running east and west, and, except near the sea, was almost entirely composed of unfossiliferous sandstones and shales, associated with a few beds of nummulitic limestone. So far as could be ascertained, these ranges appear to belong entirely to the older tertiary epoch. Here and there a few isolated masses of basaltic igneous rock have been introduced through the strata, but their occurrence is exceptional. Along the sea-coast, however, from the frontier of Sind to the Persian Gulf, and probably throughout a large portion of the north-east shores of the gulf, a newer series of rocks rests upon the nummulitics. This newer series is easily recognized by the presence of thick beds of hardened clay or marl; it is of great thickness, and abounds in fossils, a few of which appear to be living forms, whilst others are extinct. The exact age has not been ascertained; the mineral character is very different from that described by Loftus as characteristic of the gypseous series, and it is therefore premature to class these beds of the Persian coast, for which I have proposed the name of Makrán group, more definitely than as newer tertiaries. It is highly probable that they represent a portion at least of the gypseous series. Along the coast itself are a few mud-volcanoes.”

Remarking that hippuritic limestone had not been noticed on the eastern frontier,^[313. It has since been found extensively in southern Afghanistan and around Kwatta.] he turns to north-western Persia, a region “widely explored by various Russian and German travellers.”

“There would appear, both in Adarbaiján and the Alburz range, to be a greater development of older Mesozoic and Palaeozoic formations than in any other parts of western or in southern Persia. From the very brief visits I was enabled to pay to the Alburz and the small area examined, I can form but an imperfect conception of the range as a whole, but the impression produced by my visits is that the geological composition of this mountain-chain presents a striking contrast to that of all other parts of Persia which I had previously seen. It appears probable that a very considerable portion of this range consists of carboniferous and Devonian beds, and that Jurassic or Liassic rocks are also extensively developed. The same formations extend to Adarbaiján, but here, as well as in the eastern parts of the Alburz, cretaceous and nummulitic rocks are also found. Metamorρhics (granite, &c.) exist in several places, whilst volcanic outbursts occupy a considerable area, and the highest mountain in Persia, Damavand, in the Alburz chain, about 60 miles east-north-east of Tehran, is a volcano which, although dormant in the historical period, is of recent formation, and still gives vent to heated gases. The volcanic masses of Ararat, Sahend, south of Tabriz, and Savalán are also, in great part at least, of geologically recent origin.”

Minerals, <fcc.—Of the value and extent of minerals in Persia much still remains a matter of surmise. Iron and lead are to be found, copper and coal also, but gold and silver have not yet become substantial results, and the turquoise is perhaps the only product of high price and estimation. This gem, however, is not readily procurable at Níshápúr, its birthplace, but should rather be sought for at Tehran or Ispahan, where it comes into the market with other exotics. The mines are situated at the base of the hill of Sulaimaniyah, lying north of Zamánabad, a village on the highroad from Mashhad to Tehran. When the Sístan mission was at Níshápúr in 1872 they were farmed by the Government for 8000 “tumans” per annum, or about £3200 in English money.

In Malcolm’s days, though coining was held to be a choice privilege of royalty, foreign piastres and ducats were in considerable vogue. Accounts are kept in “tumáns,” “kráns,” and “sháhís,” of which the value of the first has deteriorated to 8s., the second is barely the French franc, and the third is about a halfpenny. Less than the last is called “pul-siyáh,” or black money. The “sháhí” and the “panabat,” a silver coin worth about 5d., have for long been in common circulation. In late years the manufacture of false money and forging the royal seals had become such common practices that the old rough hammer-struck coinage was called in, and medals in gold and silver with milled edges were substituted. But these also were counterfeited, and a head of police was called in from Austria to endeavour to check the evil.

The Yazd marble has a watered appearance with yellowish tinge. A handsome specimen is to be seen in the tomb of Hátìz at Shiraz. There is a quarry on the road from Yazd to Karman. The petrifactions called Tabriz or Marágha marble are found on the road between those two places.

Eastwick describes the coal obtained from the pits at Hit, in the hill-country west of Tehran, as light, brittle, glittering, and with occasional red stains. There were no large blocks visible.

Though petroleum and naphtha appear indigenous to Persia, and Floyer visited an oil-spring in Báshakard, the produce of which was burnt in lamps at Mináb near Bandar-Abbás, the produce of the oil-wells at Baku has found its way to Mashhad, and meets there with a ready sale. In connexion with this circumstance, Lovett states that a great number of lamps of the most trumpery German manufacture are imported into Khurasan and sold at large profits.

Dr Beilew, referring to the twelve divisions of the district of Níshápúr, and to its 1200 villages and hamlets, mentions the report that it possesses also twelve different mines, yielding turquoise, salt, lead, copper, antimony, iron, together with marble and soap-stone. The statement needs, however, verification.

Climate.— The climate of Persia varies much according to locality. In the Caspian provinces, where rain is frequent, it is hot, humid, and unhealthy for the greater part of the year. In the tablelands it is intensely cold in winter, and, though it is hot in summer, its dry clear heat is temperate in comparison with that of Sind and the Punjab. The spring and autumn are the best seasons. In the south and south-west, towards the Persian Gulf and in Baluchistan, the heat is intense throughout the summer and often in the spring and autumn. The three regions of Nearchus and the old travellers—illustrated by parching heat, sand, and barrenness in the south, a temperate climate, pastures, and cultivation in the centre, and severe cold with bare or snow-clad mountains in the north—may still be accepted as conveying a fairly accurate description of the tracts lying generally between Bushahr and Tehran; but of course there are seasons and seasons, and it may be very hot as well as very cold in the north as elsewhere. In June the traveller, starting from the former place en route to the capital (Tehran), will for more than 50 miles, or up to the bridge of Dálaki, experience a fierce heat during the day, and not always find relief in a cool night. Reaching the plateau of Kunár Takhtah, 12 miles farther, at an elevation of 1800 feet, he will not then necessarily have escaped the influence of hot winds and a thermometer ranging to 100°. Some 50 miles farther he will have felt a most agreeable change at an altitude of 7000 feet; and in another 24 miles, at Khan-i-Zanian, he will [9:18:623] have had every cause to be grateful for a delightful temperature. Shíráz, though some 4750 feet above sea-level, and in respect of climate so belauded by the native poets, can be hot enough in the summer, and is subject to drought, scarcity, and other contingencies of Persia.

Mounsey considers May the finest month, when the plains are fresh and green, the gardens filled with roses and nightingales, the cherries ripe, and the green almonds in vogue. Binning, writing from Ispahan on the 1st of July, had not seen the thermometer higher than 87° in his room; in the morning at sunrise it was generally 70°. Sleeping, as others, on the roof of his house, he described the air to be very dry, and the nights clear and bright, the little dew which fell being so pure as to be innocuous. He expected hotter weather towards the close of the month, but a long autumn would make amends for a little heat. Many years before Binning, Mr Jukes had recorded that, from the average of 27 days, including the end of May and beginning of June, the thermometer at Ispahan at sunrise was 56°, at 2 p.m. 87°, and at 9 p.m. 67°. Sir John Malcolm remarked that this city appeared to be placed “in the happiest temperature” that Persia could boast. Lady Sheil, whose experiences were chiefly gained in Tehran, limits the “glorious weather of Persia” from the “Náu-ruz” oι∙ New Year (21st March) to the middle of May; but most persons would perhaps prefer the autumn in the highlands of the north, as in many other parts of the country. September and October are beautiful months. The blue sky, with its tempering haze, as it were a veil of reflected snow gathered from the higher peaks and ridges of continuous mountain chains, is too exquisite a sight to be readily forgotten; and the enjoyment is all the more complete when the temperature is that of October. To those who come from India direct, or to whom an Indian heat is habitual, the change to Persia is most grateful. In the late spring, fashion moves out a few miles from Tehran to the “yalaks of Shamiran,” or cooler residences near the hills, and summer rendezvous of the various foreign legations, returning in the late autumn to the precincts of the capital, which, it may be noted, have been considerably extended of late years, and are designed for yet further extension. On the 5th of June 1871 the thermometer in Tehran was at 1 A. μ. at 62° and at 2 p.m. at 75°. On the two following days it was at 6 a.μ. at 62° and at 2 p.m. at 80°. In February the traveller across the plains of Sulimaniya, or approaching the capital from Tabriz, will sometimes experience the most bitter cold.

Bushahr and the Caspian provinces have already been mentioned, but the heat of the former place is fairly shared by other ports on the seaboard to the south,—among them, Lingah, Bandar-'Abbás, and Chárbár. When the Sístan mission was at Bandar-'Abbás in December 1871, malarious fevers were prevalent, and enlarged spleen was a common complaint. The average maximum temperature was then only 72° and the minimum 52°; but the summer and winter heats are in this locality extreme. More than a month later the officers of the mission slept out on the desert plains south of Sístan, and woke in the morning to find their beds and bedding covered with frost and icicles. With reference to the Caspian provinces the consular report to the English Foreign Office for 1881 is available. Major ’ Lovett, remarking that the “minimum isotherms passing through the north of continental Europe are deflected considerably to the south on approaching the longitude of the Caspian,” calls attention to the fact that, while during the winter the northern part of that large inland sea is frozen over, farther south, at only 10° distance, the climate of Astrábád (if there be no wind from the north and the sun shine) is like that of Madeira at the same time of the year. Though the preceding cold season had been unusually severe, and heavy snow had fallen at Bákú and lower down, the lowest reading of the thermometer was 25° Fahr., and the maximum during the months of December, January, and February was 62° in the shade.

The following extract from the report is interesting, as it bears on the products as well as the climate of the north of Persia.

“It must be remembered, in connexion with the influence the Caspian Sea has on the climate of its shores, that its surface is 84 feet below the level of the ocean; and, consequently, the superincumbent strata of air being denser than, caet cris paribus, elsewhere, it is also more capable of absorbing solar heat and moisture than the air at ocean-level. This partly accounts for the mildness as well as for the dampness of the climate. I cannot give the amount of rainfall, having no gauge; but it rained, during the 245 days of recorded observations, forty-five times, and the sky was overcast seventy times besides. This tolerable proportion of rain and cloud is doubtless due to the action of cold northerly blasts impinging on the warm and moisture-laden air shrouding the slopes of the Elburz, and hemmed in, as it were, between them and the icy northern wind. Currents thereupon are set up from the central region of the southern shores of the Caspian that blow to the east and to the west. The central region is a zone of much greater rainfall than the districts more remote. The westerly current, passing over this province, has its fertilizing influence expended on reaching the Goklan hills, 100 miles from the sea. The breadth and intensity of this moisturebearing current is well marked by the gradually proportionate denseness of the vegetation extending from the sands of the Atrak steppe to the mountain summits. The action of these damp winds is distinctly traceable on all portions of the mountain-range exposed to the sea-breeze, even by the channels afforded by the valleys of the rivers that debouch on to the Caspian. Such are densely clothed with forest of a type similar to that found in southerly temperate climates. The flora is distinctly not tropical. In addition to the trees already mentioned, I should add that wild hops and plums are to be found. In the spring the hillsides are covered with thick excellent pasture. In the gardens and orchards of Astrabad are to be found vines, fig trees, orange trees, pomegranate, and lemon trees, and the vegetables chiefly cultivated are melons, pumpkins, marrows, lettuce, aubergines, &c., that form at their seasons food-staples for the people. Tobacco, used for manufacturing cigarettes, is also grown here on a small scale.

“The Turkman steppe lying north of Astrabad is, as far as the Atrak, a prairie of exceeding fertility. Wheat reproduces itself more than a hundredfold without artificial irrigation or any trouble beyond sowing.”

Soil and Products.— Where there is irrigation the productiveness of the soil in Persia is remarkable, but unfortunately there is too much truth in the notion that two-thirds of the tablelands of the country are sterile from want of water. The desert is the rule, fertility the exception, and generally in the form of an oasis. Yet wheat, barley, and other cereals are grown in great perfection; there are the sugar-cane and rice also, especially in Mazandaran, where the soil is favourable and water procurable; opium, tobacco, and cotton, madder roots, henna, and other dyes, are as well-known exports as the woollen goods of Persia; and the first may become of importance in its bearing upon the Indian market.^[314. In 1881 the crop at Karmansháh yielded about 13,500 lb; Ispahan claimed to have produced 3000 chests; in Khurasan it was reported that the cultivation of the poppy had increased tenfold, and so extended was the area that the opium realized was estimated at an eighth of the whole produce of the province, the yield for 1882 being reckoned at 33,750 lb. At Yazd it was largely cultivated, at Tehran to a small extent only.] In Gílan, famous for its mulberry plantations, silk has been one of the most valuable of products. Yazd and Mazandaran contribute also the same material, but of late years the worm has comparatively failed to do its office, and disease has destroyed crop after crop. According to Mr Secretary Dickson’s report of August 1882 the peasants of Gílan had turned their attention to the cultivation of rice, and, though a marked improvement was perceptible in the silk produce, they were not disposed to revert to this branch of culture on the former large scale. “Silk, once the staple produce of Persia, upon which it mainly depended for repaying the cost of its imports, is not likely,” he fears, “to resume its former importance. In its flourishing days about 20,000 bales, or 1,400,000 lb, representing a value of £700,000, were annually exported. Now not more than a fourth of that quantity can be obtained.” Rice was found to suit the cultivators better; it gave them less trouble and provided them with an article of daily food. The production of silk, on the other hand, profited the richer landed proprietors, and subjected the cultivators to oppression.

Consul Beresford Lovett, in his report before quoted, says that at Astrábád the soil is so productive, and subsistence is practicable on so small a piece of land and with so little labour and expense, that many very poor emigrants come [9:18:624] there to settle from distant parts of Persia, Afghanistan, and the Indian border. “Rice,” he writes, “is husked under tilt-hammers worked by a water-wheel apparatus, a rude and clumsy contrivance, but strong, simple, and cheap. Corn and barley are ground by water-mills of primitive construction; the best wheat-flour produced is inferior to English ‘ middlings.’ They are careless as to the use of rusty corn; the effect of eating bread made with flour containing any of the noxious element is to render those unused to it very giddy.”

Sir John Malcolm considered the shores of the Persian Gulf to be sandy and unproductive in comparison with the rich clayey soil on those of the Caspian. Yet at Bushahr, and elsewhere on the lowlands of the southern border, patches of luxuriant vegetation may be found and a soil producing wheat and barley.

Vines are abundant, and the Persian grapes are not only of a good flavour and kind, but the wines made from them by the Jews and Armenians have more than a mere local reputation. That of Shíráz is the most universally known and celebrated; but a description of port manufactured at Ispahan is equally palatable and less astringent. It might not, however, bear the vicissitudes of export. A light wine made at Hamadan, diluted with water, is found very drinkable by European visitors and residents. Other cities in Persia could be cited where the juice of the grape is turned to similar account. Samuel Gottlieb Gmelin, who explored the southern shores of the Caspian in 1771, observed that the wines of Gílan and Mazandaran were all made from the wild grape only.

Flora.— Eastwick refers to the trees in the low country of Gílan as “part of that great forest which extends some 400 miles from Astarabad to Talish.” No longer do the sparse olive and occasional plantation of fruit-trees here meet the eye of the traveller descending from the Persian plateau, but his path will be through dense thickets of “jangal,” amid which the birch and the box and many familiar friends are recognized. There is an oak-forest in the vicinity of Shíráz, but no part of the country is so thickly wooded as the tract south of the Caspian. For the greater part of the province of Astrábád, Lovett surmises that nine-tenths of the surface is covered with forest. He excepts the pasture-lands of Sháh Kuh, a high mountainrange between Sháh Rúd and the sea. The trees are mostly deciduous. He had counted forty different kinds, including shrubs, but was unable to identify all. There were the oak, beech, elm, walnut, plane, sycamore, ash, yew, box, and juniper, but no pine, fir, or cedar,—though these last were said to exist in the dense forests of Fin-derisk, and on the slopes of the Goklan Hills to the eastward. He applies to the oak, beech, and elm used in building the native names of “mázú,” “nús,”and “azad.”

Fruits and flowers are abundant, and are fully appreciated in Persia. Poets sing of them, and prince and peasant delight in them. Of fruits the variety is great, and the quality, though not always the best, is in some cases unrivalled. There is perhaps no melon in the world superior to that of Nusrabad, a village between Kashan and Kúm. It were easier to name the few English fruits —such as the gooseberry, strawberry, raspberry, currant, and medlar—that are seldom, if at all seen, than the many that are commonly enjoyed by Persians. Apples and pears, filberts and walnuts, musk-melons and watermelons, grapes, peaches, plums, nectarines,—all these are to be had in profusion and so cheap as to be within reach of the poorest inhabitant.

Among the flowers are roses of many kinds, the marigold, chrysanthemum, hollyhock, narcissus, tulip, tuberose, convolvulus, aster, wallflower, dahlia, white lily (much valued), hyacinth, violet, larkspur, pink, and many ornaments of the European parterre. Of the roses, Lady Sheil observes that they are so profuse during the spring at Tehran that some are cultivated in fields as an object of trade to make rosewater. The double-coloured orange rose at Níshápúr is exceptionally attractive and fragrant.

As with fruits and flowers, so also with vegetables for the table. If the parsnip be excepted, which is probably not found because not wanted, all those commonly used in England are to be had in Persia.

Fauna.— Mr W. T. Blanford has described with great care and minuteness the zoology of Persia. In company with Major St John, R.E., he made a large collection of the vertebrate fauna in a journey from Gwatar to Tehran in 1872. Having added to this a previous collection made by the same officer with the assistance of a native from Calcutta, he had before him the principal materials for his work. Before commencing his analysis he adverted to his predecessors in the same field, i.e., Gmelin (whose travels were published in 1774-84), Olivier (1807), Pallas (1811), Ménétries (1832), Belanger (1834), Eichwald (1834-41), Aucher Éloy (1851), Loftus, Count Keyserling, Kok-schy, Chesney, the Hon. C. Murray, De Filippi (1865), Hume (1873), and Professor Strauch of St Petersburg. All of these had, more or less, contributed something to the knowledge of the subject, whether as writers or as collectors, or in both capacities, and to all the due meed of credit was assigned. Blanford divided Persia into five zoological provinces: (1) the Persian plateau, or from the Kopet Dagh southwards to nearly 28° N. lat., including all Khurásan to the Perso-Afghan border, its western limit being indicated by a long line to the north-west from near Shíráz, taking in the whole upper country to the Russian frontier and the Alburz; (2) the provinces south and south-west of the Caspian; (3) a narrow strip of wooded country south-west of the Zagros range, from the Diyáh river in Turkish Arabia to Shíráz; (4) the Persian side of the Shattu Ί-'Arab, and Khúzistan, east of the Tigris; and (5) the shores of the Persian Gulf and Baluchistan. The fauna of the Persian plateau he described as “Palaearctic, with a great prevalence of desert forms; or, perhaps more correctly, as being of the desert type with Palaearctic species in the more fertile regions.” In the Caspian provinces he found the fauna, on the whole, Palaearctic also, “most of the animals being identical with those of southeastern Europe.” But some were essentially indigenous, and he observed “a singular character given to the fauna by the presence of certain Eastern forms, unknown in other parts of Persia, such as the tiger, a remarkable deer of the Indo-Malayan group, allied to Cervus axis, and a pit viper (Halys)P Including the oak-forests of Shíráz with the wooded slopes of the Zagros, he found in his third division that, however little known was the tract, it appeared to contain, like the second, “a Palaearctic fauna with a few peculiar species.” As to Persian Mesopotamia, he considered its fauna to belong to the same Palaearctic region as Syria, but could scarcely speak with confidence on its characteristic forms. The fifth and last division, Baluchistan and the shores of the Persian Gulf, presented, however, in the animals common to the Persian highlands “for the most part desert types, whilst the characteristic Palaearctic species almost entirely disappear, their place being taken by Indian or Indo-African forms.” Blanford adds: “Just as the fauna of the Persian plateau has been briefly characterized as of the desert type with a large admixture of Palaearctic forms, that of Baluchistan and the shores of the Persian Gulf may be described as being desert with a small admixture of Indian species.” Irrespective of scientific classification and detail, it may be stated that among the tame animals of Persia the horse, mule, and camel occupy an important position, and, jointly [9:18:625] perhaps with oxen (used for tilling purposes), are first and foremost in usefulness to man. The Persian-Gulf Arab, though not equal to the pure Arabian, is a very serviceable animal, and has always a value in the Indian market. Among others, the Kashgais, or those wandering semiTurkish tribes brought down from Turkestan to the neighbourhood of Shíráz, have the credit of possessing good steeds. The Túrkman horse of Khurásan and the Atak is a large, bony, and clumsy-looking quadruped, with marvellous power and endurance. Colonel C. E. Stewart speaks of a “splendid breed of camels” in the northeastern district, of which Radkan, a small town of 4000 inhabitants with a deputy-governor, is the capital. He also states that the Khurásan camel is celebrated for its size and strength, that it has very long hair, and bears cold and exposure far better than the ordinary Arabian or Persian camel, and that, while the ordinary Persian camel only carries a load of some 320 lb and an Indian camel one of some 400 It>, the Khurásan camel will carry from 600 to 700 tt>. The best animals, he notes, are a cross between the Bactrian or two-humped and the Arabian or onehumped camel. Sheep, goats, dogs, and cats are good of their kind; but not all the last are the beautiful creatures which, bearing the name of the country, have arrived at such distinction in Europe. Nor are these to be obtained, as supposed, at Angora in Asia Minor. Lake Van or Ispahan is a more likely habitat. The cat at the first place, called by the Turks “Van kedisi,” has a certain local reputation.

Among the wild animals are the lion, tiger, leopard, lynx, wolf, jackal, fox, hare, wild ass, wild sheep, wild cat, mountain-goat, gazelle, and deer. The tiger is peculiar to the Caspian provinces. Lovett says they are plentiful in Astrábád; “they do not attack men, but hardly a week passes but some cow belonging to this town is reported to have fallen a victim to the tiger’s rapacity.” He measured two specimens, one 10 feet 8 inches, the other 8 feet 10 inches from the tip of the nose to the end of the tail. Lynxes and bears were to be found in the same vicinity, and the wild pig was both numerous and destructive.

Poultry is good and plentiful, and the game birds, if not of many varieties, have admirable representatives in the “durráj” (black partridge) and the three kinds of partridge called respectively the “kabk,” “kabk darah,” and “tihú.” The “hubára,” a kind of bustard, is well known to the sportsman in northern India.

Commerce, <kc.— The most direct and accurate information obtainable in England on the trade of Persia must be looked for in the reports of the secretary of H.M. Legation at Tehran, the resident at Bushahr (Bushire), and the consul-general at Tabriz.

Mr Secretary Dickson’s report of the 30th August 1882 is hopeful as to the general prospects of trade and improvement of the condition of the people. There had been a good harvest; but money was scarce at the capital, cash sales were difficult operations, and considerable failures had occurred to render the native bankers cautious. Manchester goods, however, still sold Avell at Ispahan and elsewhere.

The comparative failure of silk had given an impetus to the cultivation of opium, the greater part of which, when prepared for the market, was shipped to China. Carpets had found new favour in Europe, and the value of those exported was estimated at ten times the amount of former days. But a fear was expressed that the introduction of European designs and dimensions, and deterioration in quality of the articles supplied, would eventually prove prejudicial to the trade.

The larger traffic in opium effected both in 1880 and immediately preceding years is remarkable, and will be seen in the following table—
[table]

Persian opium was, it appears, first exported from Ispahan in

1853. Since that period it has been grown in several parts of the country. The destination is usually China. In 1879, for instance, eighteen steamers took 4971⅜ chests from Bushahr, of which all but 236—for London—were for Hong-Kong. Except in Ispahan, there is every probability of extended cultivation, and that the production will increase to an appreciable degree year by year. In the statement of a private firm, quoted by Mr Baring in his report from Tehran in September 1881, is the following passage:— “The Persian drug has already succeeded in throwing out Turkish sorts from the China market, and, with due abstinence from adulteration, it can at any moment command a large outlet in Europe, America, and in the Dutch colonies.” Mr Baring himself says: “λVhether the Persian opium trade in its present conditions constitutes a danger to the Indian revenue is, of course, a question to which I can furnish no reply. It depends upon circumstances respecting which I have no information. As matters at present stand, we have a trade that has been increasing steadily for several years past, and which the majority of persons think will continue to increase. The cultivation pays, and the limit of land and labour has not yet been reached. There are so many reasons, in fact, why it should extend, so few why it should fall oil’.”

Carriageable roads were still a desideratum, and the Avant of these obstructed the development of trade. On the other hand, it Avas remarked that a fair road had been constructed between Kazvín and Tehran, a supply of carriages and carts had been obtained from Russia, and postal stations had been built at regular distances of 12 miles from each other. In the capital also the streets had been put into repair, and the palace, square, and main streets lit Avith gas; and there was a greater number of private carriages. A concession had been granted for a railway from Rasht to Tehran; Mr Dickson, Avhile approving of this line as a step in the right direction, Avas very strongly in favour of another to join Tehran to Baghdad. A branch from Karmansháh or Hamadan to Shústar or Dizful, whence goods could be exported by the Kárún, would, he argued, give Persia an independent outlet for her commerce; but he doubted whether Baghdad, Avith its prestige and advantages of climate, would not be accepted as the main commercial entrepôt. The navigability of the Kárún river has been already noticed.

The Bushahr reports on the trade of the Persian Gulf for 1880 shoAV that, as regards southern Persia, the year Avas unfavourable from a commercial point of vieAV. Large imports from India served to avert famine; but the seed so provided for 1881 Avas not at hand in time to alloAv full advantage being taken of an unusually good rainfall in autumn and winter. Increased imports in sugar from France and Java, the introduction of tea from Japan, and a decrease in exports of cotton and other ordinary produce oAving to drought were all noticed.

The table shθAving the total estimated value of imports into Bushahr during the year 1882 gives a total of 10,188,980 rupees, —say something less than £1,000,000. Of this about four-ninths are from England and more than a third is from India. Of the exports, amounting to 6,566,220 rupees, — say £650,000—more than tAVO-fifths are for China, not a fifth is for England, and more than a fifth is for India. The most valuable items of import are the piece-goods and brass,—the last from England and India only; and of export, opium, of which just three-fourths go to China, and Avheat, of which more than tAvo-thirds go to England.

As regards the trade of Lingah, the year 1882 shoAved a decrease. The total value of imports was 6,922,000 rupees, of Avhich pearls formed the largest portion. These Avere brought chiefly from Bahrain and the Arab coast, but some from the Persian Gulf and Makran and Aden. Rice, almost wholly from India, Avas the next most valuable item. The total value of exports was 5,999,945 rupees. In this also pearls formed by far the largest item. Next in value mother-of-pearl shells exemplified a traffic almost entirely carried on Avith England.

From Gez on the Caspian, Consrd Lovett gives to the exports of 1881 a value of £86,280. These consisted of silk, cotton, aaoo1s, furs and skins, dried fruits, rice, corn, and miscellaneous articles. Silk represented nearly the half, and furs and skins nearly a quarter of the total figure. The imports he valued at £287,640, of which the amount for piece goods was entered at £256,000. The remaining articles specified were sugar, tea, iron, copper, steel, crockery, hardιvare, and brass utensils.

Manufactures, <kc.— The handbook on Persian art published by Colonel Murdoch Smith, R.E., in 1876, Avith reference to the collection purchased and sent home by him for the South Kensington Museum, has an instructive account of the more common manufactures of the country. They are classified under the respective heads of “porcelain and earthe∏Avare,” “tiles,” “arms and armour,” “textile fabrics,” “needleAAOrk and embroidery,” “metal-work,” “Avood caιwingand mosaic-painting,” “manuscripts,” “enamel,” “jewelry,” and “musical instruments.” Specimens of the greater number are not only to be procured in England, but are almost familiar to the ordinary Londoner. It need scarcely be said that the tiles have rather increased in value than deteriorated in the eyes of the connoisseur, that the ornamentation of metal-work, Avood carving and inlaying, [9:18:626] gem and seal engraving, are exquisite of their kind, and that the carpets manufactured by the “ustáds” or skilled workmen of local repute, when left to themselves and their native patterns, are to a great extent unrivalled. One shown to Colonel Golds∏ιid at Karman, under preparation for the tomb of Shah Niy'amat L llah, situated at the neighbouring village of Mahun, would have been greatly prized in Europe. In company with Murdoch Smith that officer visited the carpet manufactories of the city in I860. Of this interesting branch of Persian art Smith writes :—“Carpets are now made in many parts of Persia, but chiefly in Kurdistan, Khurasan, Feraghan (in Irak), and Karman; each of these districts producing a distinctive kind both in texture and style. The finest are unquestionably those of Kurdistan, of which· good specimens exist in the museum. The pattern does not represent flowers, bouquets, or other objects thrown up in relief from a uniform ground, like so many of the inappropriate designs of Europe, but looks more like a layer of flowers strewn on the ground, or a field of wild flowers in spring; a much more suitable style of ornament for a fabric meant to lie under foot. The borders are always well marked and usually of brighter colours than the centre. Besides the ordinary ‘ kali,’ or pile carpet, others, called ’ do-ru, ’ very thin and smooth and alike on both sides, are made in Kurdistan, of which there is a specimen in the museum. These ‘do-ru,’ from their portability, are much used in travelling for spreading by the roadside during the halts for pipes and tea. The carpets of Feraghan resemble those of Kurdistan in style, although the texture is looser and the pattern simpler. They are consequently much cheaper and in more general use. . . . The Khurasan carpets are somewhat superior in texture to those of Feraghan, but the patterns are generally more realistic; the flowers, &c., being represented as standing out of the ground. There is a fine Khurasan carpet in the museum made by the Kurdish settlers on the Turkman frontier. Karman carpets are the next in value to those of Kurdistan, but the designs are usually still more realistic than those of Khurasan. Besides flowers, figures of men and animals are not uncommon.” Referring to the Túrkman carpet he says: “The texture is very good and the pile is peculiarly velvety to the touch. The design, however, is crude, and the colours although rich are few in number. Still it is astonishing to think that, such as they are, these carpets are woven in the tents of a wild nomadic race like the Turkmans. Of late years there has been unfortunately a slight importation from Europe into Persia both of colours and designs which are far from being an improvement. The carpets of every description are made without even the simplest machinery, the loom being simply a frame on which the warp is stretched. The woof consists of short threads woven into the warp with the fingers without a shuttle. When a row of the woof is thus completed, a sort of comb is inserted into the warp and pressed or hammered against the loose row of woof until it is sufficiently tightened to the rest of the web. The pile is formed by merely clipping the ends of the woof until an even surface is obtained. The weaver sits with the reverse side of the web towards him, so that he depends solely on his memory for the formation of the pattern. . . .

“Felts or namads are made in many parts of Persia, but chiefly at Ispahan and Yazd. The material consists of all kinds of wool mixed together, that of the camel predominating. The colour is generally brown, but the surface on one side, and sometimes on both, is ornamented with geometric and other designs in different colours which are inlaid (so to speak) in the namad, and not simply stamped on the surface.

‘ ‘ The shawls of Karman are not much inferior to those of Kashmir. They are woven by hand similarly to the carpets. The material called ‘kúrk’ of which the shawls are made is the under wool of a particular kind of white goat: numerous flocks of this animal are in the neighbourhood of Karman. Like the merino sheep in Spain, these flocks migrate annually according to the season, in which respect they are like almost all the flocks and herds of Persia. I therefore made enquiries at Karman why the ‘kúrk’-producing goats were only to be found in that neighbourhood, and was informed that in that district the rapid descent from the high plateau of Persia to the plains near the sea afforded the means of keeping the flocks throughout the year in an almost even temperature and in abundant pastures, with a much shorter distance between the summer and winter quarters than in other parts of Persia, and that such an even climate without long distances to traverse in the course of migration was necessary to the delicate constitution of the animal, or rather to the softness of its wool. The whole of the ‘kúrk’ is not made use of in the looms of Karman, a large quantity being annually exported to Amritsar in upper India, where it is manufactured into false Kashmir shawls. Besides the ordinary long shawls of which men’s and women’s tunics are made, others of a single colour are made at Karman, which are afterwards richly ornamented with needlework. Of these there are in the museum several specimens, in which the softness of the shawl and the richness of the embroidery are both to be admired. Shawls of a coarser kind are also made at Yazd, of which a specimen may be seen in the museum in a pair of door curtains.”

Political Divisions.— According to the latest information obtained, or up to 1884, the 36th year of the reign of Násru , d-Din Sháh, Persia is found to be portioned out into four large divisions and six smaller governments, of which governors-general or governors are appointed by the king. The four divisions are:—(1) Adarbaijan (Azerbijan) in the west; (2) the North Central Districts; (3) Khurasan in the east, including Sístan; (4) Southern Persia, or from the Shattu Ί-Arab to the Mashkid. The minor governments are :—(5) Astrábád, (6) Mazandaran, (7) Gílan, (8) Khamsah with Zanjan, (9) Kazvín, (10) Gerrus.

Adarbaijan, the ancient Atropatene, is under the “wali-'ahd,” or heir-apparent, Muzaffaru’d-Dín Mirza, second son of the sháh, who resides at Tabriz, and appoints governors to the several districts within his range. Among the more important of these are Ardabil, Saráb, and Khalkhál towards the Caspian, Maku, Khoí, and Úrumíya in the west, Marágha in the centre, and Solduz, Saujbulák, and Sain Kalah in the south. Adarbaijan is about 250 miles in length from the Little Ararat to Sardasht, and the same distance in breadth from Kotur to the Talish. It is separated from Armenia in the north by the Arras, which rises in the mountains to the westward, and from 'Irak in the south by the Kizil Uzain, which, after a long winding course from Kurdistan, and union with other streams, empties itself into the Caspian under the name of Safíd Rúd. On the west it is enclosed by the Kurdish mountains, and to a great extent on the east by those overlooking the Caspian shores. It is a land of mountains, ravines, plains, and plateaus. Lake Úrumíya, about 75 miles in length by an average breadth of 30, is one of its most remarkable geographical features. In parts it is fertile, and produces wheat, barley, and maize, also cotton and tobacco. Markham says that its villages “are embosomed in orchards and gardens, which yield delicious fruits,” and that its most picturesque and flourishing portion is aroun<l the towns of Úrumíya (west of the lake) and Khoí. Tabriz, the capital, has long been the most populous city of Persia. The other chief towns of the province are Ardabil, Úrumíya, Khoí, and Marágha.

The North Central Districts is a name given to the country under the immediate supervision of the naibu ’ s-sultanah, or “deputy of the kingdom,” the shah’s third son, who appoints governors to Tehran and Firúzkuh in the north, to Zarand, Sawah, Kúm, Kashan, and Natanz, south of Tehran, and to Mahálát, Sultanabad in 'Irak, Malaiyir, Naháwand, Hamadan, and Túsirkán, west of Kúm and Kashan. The places named will serve to indicate the range of this division, one of some 150 miles in length, but of very irregular breadth. There are included in it remarkable centres of population, besides Tehran. Kúm is held in high repute as a sacred city, second in importance to Mashhad only. It contains the tomb of Fátima, the sister, or, as some affirm, the daughter of the imam Riza, and the bones of thousands of Muhammadans, bequeathed to its honoured soil by the affection or superstition of sorrowing friends and relatives. It is a large, straggling, ill-kept, semiruined, uninviting place, relieved by patches of a new and well-built bazaar. The. many domes of Kúm recall it readily to memory, but they are more characteristic than striking. Kashan has not much more attraction as a residence, but is held in good estimation for its silks, and is deservedly famous, above all towns in Persia, for its tiles and potteries.

The large province of Khurasan is perhaps not less than 500 miles in length from the Perso-Túrkman frontier to the southern limit of Persian Sístan. In breadth it is irregular, but from Pul-i-Khátún or the Lady’s Bridge on the Tajand to Pul-i-Abrishm or the Bridge of Silk on the Kal Mura—a fair limitation for Khurasan proper, exclusive of Sístan—it is about 260 miles. The mountainous character of its northern frontier has been noticed in the description of the general boundaries of Persia. It is, however, worthy of remark that the supposed connexion of the Alburz range and that of the Parapanisus does not prevent an easy passage into Herat by the valley of the Hari Rúd. The mention of rivers east and west of Khurasan must not lead to the inference that the water-supply is abundant; one, the Tajand, has to fertilize the desert tracts of the Persian Atak; at the other, the Kal Mura, the bridge is often useless, owing to the dryness of the river-bed. Central and southern Khurasan are more or less a vast desert with kavírs. Parts of Káiyan and Sístan on the Afghan border are fertile, though barren mountains and desert plains abound in the former, and the second has no lack of waste, notwithstanding the proximity of the Helmand.

The principal city in Khurasan proper is Mashhad, the capital, which may be said to contain, without contradiction, the most venerated and popular shrine in the whole of Persia, that of the eighth imam, Riza. A pilgrimage to this spot has, owing to its convenient site, become a duty more essential if not more important than one to Karbala in Turkish Arabia, or even to Mecca and Medina; and the thousands who year by year win the privilege of becoming “Mashhadis” testify to the value set upon it. Mashhad, built on the perpetual Persian plain, and admirably situated as to roads of traffic with Búkhára (Bokhara), Khiva, Herat, and Kandahar, has little in its general exterior, except the imam’s golden dome, to distinguish[9:18:627] it from other cities in the shah’s territory; but it can boast also the tomb of the famous Hárún al-Raslrid and of Gauhar Sháh Agha, the favourite wife of Sháh Rukh; and its canal and quays merit at least a passing remark from their rarity. It is divided into two towns, the sacred and the secular, each of which has its distinct governor—the first called the “mutawali,” the second being also governor of the whole province of Khurasan, and often a prince of the blood-royal. After Mashhad, among the chief towns of Khurasan are Níshápúr and Sabzawár on the highroad to Tehran, the first an ancient city within walls, the second notable for its surrounding cultivation; Bújnúrd on the north, which in Burnes’s time was “a rather large place standing in a spacious valley”; Túrbat-i-Haidari, the chief town of a populous district with ten villages, visited by Conolly in 1830, by Goldsmid in 1872, and by Stewart in 1880; Sultanabad, capital of the Turshiz district (in which there is no specific “Turshiz ”), called by Colonel Stewart “a small and flourishing town of some 5000 inhabitants”; Káiyan, once capital of the district of that name, and still a town of some importance, much frequented by “mullas” and “sáiyids”; Tún, which Macgregor describes as “decidedly a picturesquely situated town, surrounded by a wall (of irregular outline), which goes outside all the houses, and encloses besides a space—quite equal to that occupied by the houses—taken up with cultivation and gardens. Thus it is,” he adds, “that Tun may be said to be a town 4 miles in circumference, though, if only the space occupied by houses was calculated, it would dwindle to one-eighth of this. There are no buildings of any note in the place, but a few mosques and colleges are to be found, while most of the better houses, of which there is a total of about 1500, have badgírs ^[315. Literally “wind-catchers,”—towers erected on the roofs of houses for purposes of ventilation.] Coupled with Tún is Tabas, to which the same writer gives no importance; then come Birjand, picturesque and clean, with a better class of mud buildings, well situated at the foot of hills, and having rather high mountains to the westward, the modern capital of the Káiyan district; and finally, Sikuha, the true but somewhat insignificant chief town of Sístan, here chosen in preference to Nasrabad, its military headquarters. Mr Rozario, medical attaché to the mission of 1872, described Sikuha as “composed of 200 arch-roofed mud-built houses, connected with each other without any kind of woodwork about them,” the land wanting in rice and timber, but producing wheat, barley, beans, and cotton in abundance.

The fourth, Southern Persia, is a very extensive division, embracing not only the whole seaboard between 48° and 61° 30' E. long, but a great part of the country as far north as 32° 40', the parallel of Ispahan. Nothing could better illustrate the arbitrary and uncertain mode of parcelling out a kingdom than the separation of natural and the combination of abnormal elements of union to be found in this vast territory entrusted to the charge of the “zil-i-sultan,” or “shadow of the monarch,” the title given to the sháh’s eldest son. That such an arrangement can work at all is one of many strange truths which are intelligible only to persons acquainted with the centralizing power exercised in Tehran. General Schindler, an officer of great local knowledge and experience, has guaranteed the correctness of the statement that the prince-governor or govern or-general of Southern Persia—residing himself at Shíráz (or at Ispahan)—appoints governors to the following places :—Kurdistan, Karmansháh, Lúristan, Búrújird, Dizful, Shústar, Muhamrah, Behbahan, and Ram Hormuz in the west; the tracts occupied by the Bakhtiáris, Gulpáigan, Khonsar, Fari-dun, Chahár Mahál, Yazd (with Nain, Baft, and Shahr-i-Babek); Fárs (with Fasa, Darab, Lar, Paruni, and Kázarun) in the centre; Bushahr and Lingah on the coast; and Karman (with Bam, Bampúr, Rafsinjan, Khabís, Sirjan, Jiruft, and Rudbar) to the east. Among the more prominent cities or towns within this range are: — Ispahan, a fine city, still worthy from its site, buildings, gardens, river, and surroundings to be the royal residence; Shiráz, happily situated with pleasant neighbouring resorts and the ordinary requirements of a first-class Persian town,—possessing, moreover, a special national prestige for high and low, yet not a genial residence for strangers, who can accomplish its lions in a couple of days; Yazd, a large and fairly populated city, with one remarkable mosque and a handsome new bazaar, but somewhat gloomy in character and drearily situated on a flat plain in an amphitheatre of hills; Karman, a place of pleasant recollection to those English travellers who experienced the genuine kindness and hospitality of the λvakilu ’l-mulk, Muhammad Ismail Khán, its governor in 1865-66, and not wanting in material attractions of its own; lastly, Bam and Bampúr, visited by Lieutenant Pottinger in 1810, more than half a century afterwards by Colonel Goldsmid, and later still by Majors St John and Lovett,—the one a frontier town with associations of border warfare, the other a mere Perso-Baluch cantonment λvith a fort and mud buildings, long the residence of Ibrahim Khán, a chief of notoriety serving the interests of Persia. Muhamrah, Bushahr, Lingah, and Bandar-Abbás are ports, but there is no real harbour between Fáo at the mouth of the Shattu ’l-'Arab and Karáchi (Kurrachee) in British India.

Astrabad is a town and district near the entrance of the bay of the same name on the Caspian. In 1884 it was governed by Habib Ullah Khán, the “sá'idu ’l-daulah,” or “arm of the state.”

Mazandaran and Gílan are the Caspian provinces, par excellence, of Persia. General Schindler makes them distinct governments, but they appear to have once formed part of the northern division under the prince-governor.

Khamsah, a district on the high road between Tabriz and Tehran, of which the chief town, Zanjan, is a place of some importance. The governor’s name in 1884 was Násr Kúlí Khán, the “'amídú Ί-mulk,” or “prop of the kingdom.”

Kazvín, a considerable town, with surrounding district, in the plains south of the Alburz, and not a hundred miles from Tehran, was governed in 1884 by Mirza Riza, the “mu'ayinu ’l-sultanah,” or “helper of the kingdom.”

Gerrus is a district on the south of Khamsah.

Population.— Although the present section deals with statistics only, the following well-considered remarks of Mr Robert Grant Watson, formerly a secretary in the Persian legation, form an appropriate preface to the record of population.

“Persia is peopled by men of various races. A very great proportion of the population is composed of wandering tribes, that is, of a large number of families who pass a portion of the year on the hills. It is in this sense only that they can be considered wanderers. They invariably occupy the same pasture-grounds one year after another. Their chiefs are possessed of great authority over the tribesmen, and all dealings between the Government and the tribes are carried on through the heads of these divisions. Through the chief the taxes, whether in money or in kind, are paid, and through him the regiments which his tribe may furnish are recruited. The office of chief is hereditary. The tents in which the tribesmen dwell are for the most part composed of a light framework of the shape of a beehive. This is covered with a coating of reeds, and above it is placed a thick black felt. It has but one door, and no window or chimney. This is the Turkman tent, which is used by the Shahsavand and other tribes, but the Iliyáts in central Persia make use of tents of another construction, with flat or slightly-sloping roofs.

“The provinces near the Persian Gulf contain many Arabs and men of Arab extraction. Such are for the most part the inhabitants of Laristan and of the country lying to the left of the Shattu’l-Arab and of the lower part of the Tigris. The Bakhtiári mountains, between the valley of the lower Tigris and the plain of Ispahan, are the dwelling-place of tribes of another race, and of whom and their country very little is known. The mountains of Kurdistan give birth to a λvarlike people, who are attached to their own tribechiefs, and who never go far from the borders of Turkey and of Persia, sometimes proclaiming themselves subjects to the Porte, and sometimes owning allegiance to the Shah. At the foot of one part of these mountains, on the borders of the lake of Urúmía, there is a plain on which dwell many Christian families who hold the tenets of Nestorius. At Ispahan, at Tehran, at Tabriz, and in other parts of Persia, there is a more or less considerable population of Armenians. At Hamadan, at Ispahan, at Tehran, at Mashhad, at the town of Damávand, and elsewhere in Persia, Jews are found in considerable numbers. The province of Gilan is inhabited by a race of men peculiar to itself, the descendants of the ancient Gelae. The people of Mazandaran speak, as do the Gileks, a dialect of their own. The province of Astrabad is partly inhabited by Turkmans; and in the districts claimed by Persia, which border on Afghanistan and Baluchistan, the Afghan and Baluch elements are prominent in the population. At Karman a few Hindus reside, and at Yazd there are about 2000 families of the original fire-worshippers of Iran.^[316. Since greatly reduced in numbers.] But the two principal races to be met with in Persia are the Turks and the Persians or Mongols. The former are, as a general rule, spread over the northern provinces; the latter over the southern. The Persians of Mongol extraction for the most part speak only the Persian language, while those of Turkish race speak the Turkish language in preference to Persian.

“The inhabitants of Persia may be divided into two classes,— those who inhabit the towns and villages, and those who dwell exclusively in tents. The former class remain stationary during the greater part of the year, the richer orders only leaving the towns for two months during the summer heats, when it is possible to obtain cool air in the hills or upper grounds close by. The tribes who dwell in tents move from place to place with the varying seasons of the year. In the springtime they drive their flocks and herds to their accustomed pasture-grounds, and if they have a right to the pasture of mountains which are inaccessible in spring, they move up to their summer quarters as soon as the snow disappears. Winter finds them on the plains, prepared, in their black tents, to brave its utmost rigour. These Iliyat tribes serve each a separate chief., For the Iliyáts of Fars there is a hereditary chief called the ílkhání, to whom they all owe allegiance; from whom they receive the laws that rule their conduct; and to whom they pay the revenue imposed upon them. Thev contribute a certain number [9:18:628] of soldiers to the Shah’s army. Very little is known as to the numbers and the peculiarities of these nomads. The Iliyát tribes of Turkish descent have an Ílkhání appointed by the Shah. Besides these tribes there are wanderers who are less numerous, and who occupy a less prominent position,—the gipsies common to so many countries.”

It is difficult to form an estimate of the population of Persian towns or districts. In the first place, opinion is divided upon the approximate figure to be accepted for the kingdom at large. According to St John, the discrepancy is between ten and four millions; and if the smaller one were made a basis there would be but a scanty number indeed for partition among the cities and principal centres. The famine of 1870 was, moreover, severe and fatal enough to cause a considerable diminution in the totals calculated prior to its occurrence. When returning through Mashhad in the spring of 1872 the British commissioner for the Sístan boundary settlement was informed that no less than 100,000 persons had been carried off within the limits of the prince-governor’s rule, of whom 24,000 were from the city itself, where, exclusive of passing pilgrims, reckoned by thousands, a population of 70,000 might well be supposed. In Yazd and Ispahan the losses were also very great, and must have sensibly affected the figures.

The official estimate for 1881 is recorded as follows :—inhabitants of cities, 1,963,800; wandering tribes, 1,909,800; inhabitants of villages and country, 3,780,000; total, 7,653,600. It is probable that 8,000,000 would, be a fair estimate in round numbers; and this should include the comparatively new accessions of territory in Sístan and western Baluchistan.

The population of certain cities may be recorded as follows. Those figures marked with an asterisk are from the official returns given in the Statesman’s Year Book for 1884. Tehran, *100,000; Astrábád (city), 8000 — in the province, 26,000 (Lovett, 1881); Tabriz, *120,000; Úrumíya, *40,000; Hamadan, *30,000; Karmansháh, 25,000; Rasht, 20,000; Kazvín, 25,000; Zanjan or Zanjánah, 20,000 (Eastwick, 1860); Kúm, 20,000 (Euan Smith said in 1871 that out of 20,000 houses which it originally possessed only 4000 were then habitable); Ispahan, 60,000; Shiraz,*30,000; Bushahr, 11,000; Yazd, *40,000; Karman, 40,000; Birjand, 12,000 (Sístan mission, 1872); Ardakan (Khurasan desert), 20,000 (Colonel Stewart, 1880); Bam, 600C (Goldsmid, 1866-72).

With regard to three interesting places in eastern Persia visited by Macgregor in 1875, this active explorer gives no clue to the population of Tabas, beyond the fact that it is a wall-enclosed town about half a mile in length by a quarter in breadth, with an “ark” or citadel, but no bazaars; of Tún, his 1500 “better houses” may imply aboút 6000 well-to-do people only; and Bashruyah, between Tabas and Tún, he calls a village of some 600 houses, equivalent to a population of between 3000 and 4000.

Government.— The sháh is regarded as vicegerent of the Prophet, and, as such, claims implicit obedience so long as his commands do not go against the Koran and the sacred law. The executive government is carried on by a ministry of which the personnel is subject to constant change, and the distribution of duties depends much upon the standing in royal favour of individual ministers. It may be said, as a rule, that those who fill the more important functions and do the most real work are better known by their family names than the official titles accorded them. The somewhat common prefix “mirza” is usually taken by high functionaries of state,—a word which invariably denotes a member of the royal house when used as an affix.^[317. In 1884 the following were among the more prominent ministers :— War.—Naibu's-Saltanah, Kamran Mirza. Interior and Finance.—Mustofíu Ί-Mamálik, Mirza Yúsuf Khán. Foreign A/føír.«. —Násru Ί-Mulk, Mirza Mahmúd Khán. Justice.—Mushira ’ d-Daulah, Mirza Abdul Waháb. Worship and Telegraphs.— Makhbaru ’ d-Daulah, 'Ali Kúlí Khán. Of these, Mirza Mahmúd Khán, the “násru Ί-mulk,” had been minister in London. His predecessor in the cabinet had been always known as simply Mirza Sa'íd Khan.]

The division of the country for administrative purposes has been mentioned above, p. 626. Provinces are further subdivided into districts under “hakims,” or chiefs, who collect the revenue as well as exercise a general superintendence. In villages the “kat-khudá,” or magistrate, administers justice.

Of the Armenians under Persian rule there are said to be 43,000, chiefly in Julfa near Ispahan, and of Nestorians and Chaldaeans 23,000, chiefly in Úrumíya and Salmas. There are probably 70,000 Christians of every denomination. The number of Jews given is 19,000, and of Gabars (Guebres) or Parsís 8000. Perhaps the Nestorians have been under-estimated; but the Parsís have greatly diminished in recent years. However tolerant the declared principles of the Governmeìit towards aliens in religion, there is no doubt that much could yet be done to improve the condition of the sháh’s nonMoslem subjects in respect of taxation, civil and social rights, and general treatment by local authorities. Efforts on behalf of the Nestorians have from time to time been made in late years, with the support of the British Government, and special agents have been deputed to Úrumíya to report upon supposed grievances with a view to their alleviation or removal. The temporary appointment of a Christian governor was an indication of the sháh’s good wishes, but can hardly be said to have attained the desired end. It is just possible that the desire awakened in England in the second half of the 19th century to know more of the Eastern churches may result in the exercise of a beneficial influence over the fortunes of a people who have suffered various forms of oppression for five centuries or more. See Nestorians, vol. xvii. p. 357 sq., where statistics, &c., are given.

Army. — Military service is not popular, and could not be provided for at all but by compulsory enrolment. Pay is always kept in arrears, generally for two or three years; and, when issued, it is reduced from its legitimate amount by the exactions of distributing officers, from the “sarhang,” or lieutenant-colonel, downwards. The native officers are, as a rule, incapable and ignorant of military affairs; and the European drill-instructors, whatever their local rank, have no actual command in the native army. The common “sarbaz,” or Persian infantry soldier, might with good officers and good training be made very efficient. In the performances of his long marches—24 or even 40 miles a day—lie has very often a companion, his donkey, without which adjunct no picture of a Persian infantry soldier would be complete. Setting such aid aside, the marching and endurance of the sarbaz are wonderful, and, though better food might in some respects improve hisphysiquc, his frugality is such as to account in some measure for his bodily strength. If wanting in the discipline that is considered in England essential to the well-being of the service, the fault is that of his superiors, by whom he is ill-commanded, ill-taught, and ever accursed with an evil example. In fact, the moral value of the soldier deteriorates as the social grade rises. It is much the same in Turkey, where the state of tilings is perhaps Oriental rather than national. The post of “wakíl,” or non-commissioned officer, becomes thus the first step to demoralization. Above this person is the “naib,” or lieutenant, corresponding to the Turkish “mulázim”; then comes the “sultán,” or captain, the Turkish ‘ ‘ yuzbashi”; “yáwar,” or major, the Turkish “binbashi”; “sarhang,” or lieutenant-colonel, the Turkish “káim - makám”; and the ‘ ‘ sartip,” or colonel, the Turkish ‘ ‘ mír-alai”; such are roughly the respective grades which represent the commissioned ranks.

The most business-like cavalry the present writer can recall in the sháh’s dominions were the stray horsemen met with in the Karman province. Their dress, brown from top to toe, with the κυρβaσιa of Herodotus and the carbine slung over the back, appeared simple and soldier-like; and nothing but hereditary aptitude could make the horseman so fitted to the horse. Both in 1866 and in 1871 the governor of Bampúr, in Baluchistan, had good stuff to discipline into irregular cavalry in his mounted Baluchis as well as Persians; and the same remark applies to the Persian governor of Sístan in 1872. The “istikbal,” or motley troop of cavaliers, sent out to meet the writer by either chief, presented a singular specimen of rough but sufficiently formidable-looking satellites— men who had, clearly, fighting propensities, and might be moulded, without much effort, into very serviceable soldiers. Colonel (now Sir Charles) Macgregor found the few irregular cavalry incidentally brought under his observation in Khurasan very fairly mounted in a working sense. Over the saddle and behind it they seemed to carry all that belonged to them. With less than £2 a year - in pay, over and above a grain allowance, he says truly of these cavaliers, that, “if not the best light horsemen in the world, they are the very cheapest.” At Mashhad he saw several Persian regiments encamped outside the city. They were composed of men generally of fine physique, hardy and muscular; but their small pay of seven “tumáns” (not £2, 16s.) per annum was seldom realized up to half the amount, and they ha<l to subsist chiefly on their rations. Their uniform consisted of a black lamb’s-wool busby, with a lion and sun in brass on the front, a dark-blue tunic, on the European model, with white bands across the breast, blue trousers with red stripe, and shoes (if they like to wear them). They had “clumsy percussion, smooth-bore muskets and bayonets, with locks of French manufacture”; but they did not clean them, and it was probable that more than half were unfit for actual use. The artillery he states to be probably the most efficient branch of the service, not smart, but rough and ready.

Although there were no English officers employed in training the Persian troops during any of the present writer’s visits to Tehran, there were two Englishmen connected with the arsenal to whom the local Government was indebted for useful service. The chief control of the arsenal, however, and indeed the direction of the whole Persian artillery, was in the hands of an Armenian; the two principal drill-instructors were Italians, a Florentine and a Neapolitan; while that vital part of the public works department comprising roads and bridges was under an Austrian officer holding the rank of general. There were, besides, two or three other Europeans holding quasi-military posts.

Sir Henry Rawlinson, who was for five years in the sháh’s.army, believes that, “if the Persian material were placed at the disposal of a European power who would encourage and take care of the [9:18:629] men, and develop their military instincts, a fine working army, very superior to anything that Turkey could produce, might be obtained in a very short period of time.”

It is difficult to rely on statistics in the present case, but the following are found in the latest and most trustworthy records.^[318. Statesman's Year Book, 1884, pp. 796, 797.]

“The Persian army, according to official returns of the minister of war, numbers 105,500 men, of whom 5000 form the artillery,’ 53,900 the infantry, 31,000 the cavalry, regular and irregular, and 7200 militia. Of these troops, however, only one-third are em-ρloyed in active service, the standing army of Persia consisting, on the peace footing, of a total of 30,000 men. By a decree of the Sháh, issued in July 1875, it was ordered that the army should for the future be raised by conscription, instead of by irregular levies, and that a term of service of twelve years should be substituted for the old system, under which the mass of the soldiers were retained for life; but the decree has not been enforced to any extent. The organization of the army is by provinces, tribes, and districts. A province furnishes several regiments; a tribe gives one, and sometimes two, and a district contributes one battalion to the army. The commanding officers are almost invariably selected from the chiefs of the tribe or district from which the regiment is raised. The Christians, Jews, and Guebres in Persia are exempt from all military service. In recent years the army has been under the training and organization of European officers.”

Revenue.— According to the Statesman's Year Book for 1884 the revenue and expenditure of the Government are known only from estimates. If we accept these as based on consular reports, the total receipts of the Government amounted, on the average of the years 1872 to 1875, to £1,900,000 per annum, while the expenditure during the same period was at the rate of £1,756,000 per annum. The receipts of the year 1882 amounted to £1,600,000 in money, besides £280,000 in kind, consisting of barley, wheat, rice, and silk, making the total revenue equal to £1,880,000; and of this sum £1,520,000 came from direct taxes and £353,600 from customs. The expenditure amounted to £1,800,000, of which £760,000 was for the army; £360,000 for the regal court; the priesthood, &c., £240,000; foreign affairs, £28,000; other departments, £60,000; education, £12,000. The surplus is paid into the sháh’s treasury. About one-fourth of the receipts are constituted by payments in kind, mostly reserved for the use of the army and the sháh’s own household. The whole revenue is raised by assessments upon towns, villages, and districts, each of which has to contribute a fixed sum, the amount of which is changed from time to time by tax - assessors appointed by the Government. Almost the entire burthen of taxation falls upon the labouring classes, and among these upon the Muhammadan subjects of the sháh. The amount of revenue collected from the Christian population, the Jews, and the Gabars is reported to be very small. The Government has no public debt. The Almanach de Gotha adds to the above items of expenditure in 1882 the sum of £80,000 for the priesthood, &c.

In 1868 the revenue demanded from each province, under the divisions then made, was Adarbaijan, £248,000; Gílan, £176,000; Ispahan, £168,000; Fárs, £152,000; Khurásan, &c., £88,000; Arabistan, £86,000; Tehran, &c., £84,000; Karman, £84,000; Karmansháh, &c., £80,000; Khamsah, £72,000; Yazd, £68,000; Mazandaran, £44,000; Kazvín, £28,000; Kashan, £28,000; Búrújird, £24,000; Gulpáigan, £24,000; Kurdistan, £20,000; Hamadan, £12,000; Astrábad, £10,000; Kúm, £6000; total, £1,502,000. The customs were £214,664, and the value of income received in kind was £220,336,—making a total revenue of £1,937,000, or something less than two millions.

A prince-royal appointed to a province is often little more than a nominal ruler. On the other hand, some governors, such as Muhammad Isma'íl Khán, the late wakilu ’ l-mulk of Karman, attend to even the minute details of administration, and pay especial attention to the collection of revenue. It is not always an easy matter to pay into the royal treasury the sum insisted on, oι - even voluntarily offered for the government of a province.

National Character.— Malcolm’s Sketches and Morier’s Hajji . Baba are still, after more than half a century, unsuperseded as standard records of accurate information on the manners and customs of an Oriental people. A clever volume^[319. wills, In the Land of the Lion and Sun, 1S83.] published in 1883, which is also worth quoting, contains, among many other faithful delineations, the following.

‘ ‘ The character of the Persian is that of an easy-going man with a wish to make things pleasant generally. He is hospitable, obliging, and specially well disposed to the foreigner. His home virtues are many: he is very kind and indulgent to his children, and, as a son, his respect for both parents is excessive, developed in a greater degree to his father, in whose presence he will rarely sit, and whom he is in the habit of addressing and speaking of as ‘ master. ’ The full stream of his love and reverence is reserved for his mother; he never leaves her to starve, and her wishes are laws to him. The mother is always the most important member of the household, and the grandmother is treated with veneration. The presence of the mother-in-law is coveted by their sons-in-law, who look on them as the guardians of the virtue of their wives. The paternal uncle is a much nearer tie than with us; while men look on their first cousins on the father’s side as their most natural wives.

“Black slaves and men-nurses or ‘ lallaks ’ are much respected; the ‘ dyah ’ or wet nurse is looked on as a second mother and usually provided for for life. Persians are very kind to their servants; a master will often be addressed by his servant as his father, and the servant will protect his master’s property as he would his own. A servant is invariably spoken to as * bacha ’ (child). The servants expect that their master will never allow them to be wronged. The slaves in Persia have a good time; well fed, well clothed, treated as spoiled children, given the lightest work, and often given in marriage to a favourite son or taken as ‘ segah ’ or concubine by the master himself, slaves have the certainty of a well-cared-for old age. They are looked on as confidential servants, are entrusted with large sums of money, and the conduct of the most important affairs; and seldom abuse their trust. The greatest punishment to an untrustworthy slave is to give him his liberty and let him earn his living. They vary in colour and value: the ‘ Habshi ’ oi' Abyssinian is the most valued; the Suháli or Somáli, next in blackness, is next in price; the Bombassi, or coal-black negro of the interior, being of much less price, and usually only used as a cook. The prices of slaves in Shiráz are, a good Habshi girl of twelve to fourteen £40, a good Somáli same age, half as much; while a Bombassi is to be got for £14, being chosen merely for physical strength. They are never sold, save on importation, though at times they are given away. . . . I have never seen a Persian unkind to his own horse or his slave, and when overtaken by poverty he will first sell his shirt, then his slave.

“In commercial morality, a Persian merchant will compare not unfavourably with the European generally. . . . To the poor, Persians are unostentatiously generous; most of the rich have regular pensioners, old servants, or poor relations who live on their bounty; and though there are no workhouses, there are in ordinary times no deaths from starvation; and charity, though not organized, is general. . . . Procrastination is the attribute of all Persians, ‘ to-morrow ’ being ever the answer to any proposition, and the ‘ to-morroλv ’ means indefinite delay. A great dislike is shown generally to a written contract binding the parties to a fixed date; and, as a rule, on breaking it the Persian always appeals for and expects delay and indefinite days of grace. . . .

“Persians are clean in their persons, washing themselves and their garments frequently. The Persian always makes the best of his appearance; he is very neat in his dress, and is particular as to the sit of his hat and the cut of his coat. All Persians are fond of animals, and do not treat them badly when their own property.

“Cruelty is not a Persian vice; torture and punishments of an unusual and painful nature being part of their judicial system. There are no vindictive punishments, such as a solitary confinement, penal servitude for long terms of years, &c. Seldom, indeed, is a man imprisoned more than twelve months, the rule being that there is a general jail delivery at the New Year. Royal clemency is frequently shown, often, perhaps, with want of judgment.”

The close adherence to ceremony and etiquette, the ready adaptation to foreign habits, together with the capacity for using and love of receiving the grossest forms of flattery—which in the days of Herodotus were found to be notable features of the national character—are still to be seen in the 19th century.

Morier, in his Second Journey through Persia, relates how on arrival at Bombay his fellow-traveller, the Persian ambassador, returning from a mission to the court of St James’s, would not call at Government House until the governor had visited him, on the plea that, when in London, the chairman and deputy-chairman, whom he styled the father and grandfather, of the East India Company, as well as the “viziers” and “grand vizier” himself (Mr Spencer Perceval), had made the first call upon him,—clothed, moreover, in the very dress they had worn before their own sovereign! The present writer, when discussing the necessary conduct of British diplomatists accredited to Persia, said:^[320. Lecture at the Royal United Service Institution, 26tlι May 1876.] “In some courts . . . there is a meaning in ridiculous minutiae, the comprehension of which is of vital importance to the envoy and the cause he advocates. . . . A chair pushed one inch or two forward or backward, so as to transgress the border of a particular carpet marked for its limit, may cause serious offence; a cup of tea, or a tobacco pipe missing from the conventional number offered to a guest, may awake hostile feelings, there may be hidden mischief in a misapplied word of welcome or farewell, in a clumsy gesture, in a new-fashioned article of wearing apparel. Trifles could hardly go further in the way of puerility; but it is a part of common-sense diplomacy to acknowledge with gravity things which are to all seeming the most opposed to common-sense.”

Forms of compliment and adulation are in such constant requisition with him that a Persian is never at fault to find occasion for their use. If the following examr>le be too characteristic to be [9:18:630] admitted, be it understood that it indicates a grosser kind of procedure than that which, at the present day, is known to the higher classes. It is a common custom on the arrival at the gate of a town of a distinguished traveller for some duly appointed official to strike off the head of a sheep, and roll it, with the blood dripping, across the path of the new-comer. Morier gives a revolting illustration of the length to which this ceremony was carried on the arrival of the sháh at the halting-place of Morchikar. The head man of the village went so far as to strip his own son naked from the waist upwards, and, having tied the lad’s hands behind his back, to lift his knife as though to cut the victim’s throat. The conclusion of the story is not told; but it is to be hoped that the sháh exercised his prerogative of preventing any evil results.

Costume.— The costume^[321. Dr. wills’s instructive volume again supplies this information.] of the Persians may be shortly described as fitted to their active habits. The men invariably wear an unstarched shirt of cotton, sewn with white silk, often, particularly in the south of Persia, elaborately embroidered about the neck. It fastens in front by a flap, having two small buttons or knots at the left shoulder, and seldom comes below the hips. It has no collar, and the sleeves are loose. The lower orders often have it dyed blue; but the servant and upper classes always prefer a white shirt. Silk shirts are now seldom seen on men. Among the very religious during the mourning month (“Muharram ”) the shirt is at times dyed black. The “zír-jámah,” or trousers, are of cloth among the higher classes, particularly those of the military order, who affect a garment of a tightness approaching that worn by Europeans. The ordinary “zír-jámah” are of white, blue, or red cotton, very loose, and are exactly similar to the “pái-jámahs” worn by Europeans in India. They are held up by a thin cord of red or green silk or cotton round the waist, and the labouring classes, when engaged in heavy or dirty work, or when running, generally tuck the end of these garments under the cord, which leaves their legs bare and free to the middle of the thigh. The amplitude of this part of his attire enables the Persian to sit without discomfort on his heels; chairs are only used by the rich, great, or Europeanized. Over the shirt and “zír-jámah” comes the “arkhálik,” generally of quilted chintz or print, a closely-fitting garment, coïlarìess, with tight sleeves to the elbow, whence, to the wrist, are a number of little metal buttons, fastened in winter, but not in summer. Above this is the “kamarchín,” a tunic of coloured calico, cloth, Kashmir or Karman shawl, silk, satin, or velvet (gold embroidered, or otherwise), according to the time of year and the purse and position of the wearer. This, like the “arkhálik,” is open in front, and shows the shirt. It sometimes has a small standing collar, and is double-breasted. It has a pocket-hole on either side, giving access to the pockets which are always in the “arkhálik,” where also is the breast-pocket in which watch, money, jewels, and seals are kept. The length of the “kamarchín” denotes the class of the wearer. The military and official classes and the various servants wear it short, to the knee, while fops and sharpers wear it even shorter. Priests, merchants, villagers, especially about Shíráz, townsmen, shopkeepers, doctors, and lawyers wear it very long, often nearly to the heels. Over the “kamarchín” is worn the “kulájah,” or coat. This is, as a rule, cast off in summer, save on formal occasions, and is often borne by a servant, or carried over the shoulder by the owner. It is of cloth, shawl, or camel-hair cloth and is lined with silk or cloth, flannel or fur. It has, like the Turkish frockcoat, a very loose sleeve, with many plaits behind. It has lapels, as with us, and is trimmed with gold lace, shawl, or fur, or is worn quite plain. It has a roll collar and false pockets.

Besides these garments there are others: the long “jubba,” or cloth cloak, worn by “mirzas” (secretaries), Government employes of high rank, as ministers, farmers of taxes, courtiers, physicians, priests; the “abba,” or camel-hair cloak of the Arab, worn by travellers, priests, and horsemen; the “pustín,” or Afghan skin-cloak, used by travellers and the sick or aged; the “nímtan,” or common sheepskin jacket, with short sleeves, used by shopkeepers and the lower class of servants, grooms, &c., in winter; the “yápanjah,” or woollen Kurdish cloak, a kind of felt, having a shaggy side, of immense thickness, worn generally by shepherds, who use it as greatcoat, bed, and bedding. There is also the felt coat of the villager, very warm and inexpensive, the cost being from 5 to 15 krans (a krau = 1-0d. ). The “kamarband,” or girdle, is also characteristic of class. It is made of muslin, shawl, or cotton cloth among the priests, merchants, bazaar people, the secretary class, and the more aged Government employes. In it are carried, by literati and merchants, the pen-case and a roll of paper; its voluminous folds are used as pockets; by the bazaar people and villagers, porters and merchants’ servants, a small sheath knife is stuck in it; while by “farrashes,” the carpet - spreader cláss, a large “khanjar,” or curved dagger, with a heavy ivory handle, is earned. The headgear is very distinctive. The turban worn by priests is generally white, consisting of many yards of muslin. When the wearers are “sáiyid” of the Prophet, a green turban is worn, also a “kamarband” of green muslin, or shawl or cotton cloth. Merchants generally wear a turban of muslin embroidered in colours, or of a yellow pattern on straw-

coloured muslin, or of calico, or shawl. The distinctive mark of the courtier, military, and upper servant class is the belt, generally of black varnished leather with a brass clasp; princes and courtiers often replace this clasp by a huge round ornament of cut stones. The “kuláh,” or hat, is of cloth or sheepskin on a frame of pasteboard. The fashions in hats change yearly. The Ispahan merchant and the Armenian at times wear the hat very tall. (The waist of the Persian is generally small, and he is very proud of his fine figure and broad shoulders.)

The hair is generally shaved at the crown, or the entire head is shaved, a “kákul,” or long thin lock, being sometimes left, often 2 feet long, from the middle of the crown. This is to enable the prophet Muhammad to draw up the believer into paradise. The lower orders generally have the hair over the temporal bone long, and brought in two long locks turning backwards behind the ear, termed “zúlf”; the beaux and youths are constantly twisting and combing these. The rest of the head is shaven. Long hair, however, is going out of fashion in Persia, and the more civilized affect the cropped hair worn by Europeans, and even have a parting in it. The chin is never shaved, save by “beauty men,” or ‘ ‘ kashangs,” though often clipped, while the moustache is usually left long. At forty a man generally lets his beard grow its full length, and cherishes it much; part of a Persian’s religious exercises is the combing of his beard. Socks, knitted principally at Ispahan, are worn; they are only about 2 inches long in the leg. The rich, however, wear them longer. They are of white cotton in summer and coloured worsted in winter. Villagers only wear socks on state occasions. Shoes are of many patterns. The “úrússi,” or Russian shoe, is the most common; next, the “kafsh” or slipper of various kinds. The heel is folded down and remains so. The priests wear a peculiar heavy shoe, with an ivory or wooden lining at the heel. Green shoes of shagreen are common at Ispahan. Blacking is unknown to Persians generally. Boots are only used by horsemen, and are then worn much too large for ease. Those worn by couriers often come up the thigh. With boots are worn “shalwárs,” or baggy riding breeches, very loose, and tied by a string at the ankle; a sort of kilt is worn by couriers. Pocket-handkerchiefs are seldom used, save by the rich or the Tehranis. Most Persians wear a “shab kuláh,” or night hat, a loose baggy cap of shawl or quilted material, often embroidered by the ladies.

Arms are usually carried only by tribesmen. The natives of the south of Persia and servants carry a “kammah,” or dirk. The soldiery, on or off duty, always carry one of these or their sidearms, sometimes both. They hack but never thrust with them. On the road the carrying of weapons is necessary.

The costume of the women has undergone considerable change in the last century. It is now, when carried to the extreme of fashion, highly indecent and must be very uncomfortable. The garment doing duty as a chemise is called a ‘ ‘ píráhan”; it is, with the lower orders, of white or blue calico, and comes down to the middle of the thigh, leaving the leg nude. Among the upper classes it is frequently of silk. At Shíráz it is often of fine cotton, and elaborately ornamented with black embroidery. With the rich it is often of gauze, and much embroidered with gold thread, pearls, &c. The head is usually covered with a “chár-kadd,” or large square of embroidered silk or cotton, folded so as to display the corners, and fastened under the chin by a brooch. It is often of considerable value, being of Kashmir shawl, embroidered gauze, &c. A “jika,” a jewelled feather-like ornament, is often worn at the side of the head, while the front hair, cut to a level with the mouth, is brought up in love-locks on either cheek. Beneath the “chár-kadd” is generally a small kerchief of dark material, only the edge of which is visible. The ends of the “chár-kadd” cover the shoulders, but the gauze “píráhan” is quite transparent. A profusion of jewellery is worn of the most solid description, none hollow; silver is worn only by the very poor, coral only by négresses. Necklaces and bracelets are much affected, and chains with scent-caskets attached, while the arms are covered with clanking glass bangles called “alangú,” some twenty even of these being on one arm. Jewelled “bázúbands,” containing talismans, are often worn on the upper arm, while among the lower orders and south Persian or Arab women nose-rings are not uncommon, and bangles or anklets of beads.

The face on important occasions is usually much painted, save by young ladies in the heyday of beauty. The colour is very freely applied, the cheeks being as much riddled as a clown’s, and the neck smeared with white, while the eyelashes are marked round with “kuhl.” This is supposed to be beneficial to the eyes, and almost every woman uses it. The eyebrows are widened and painted till they appear to meet, while sham moles or stars are painted on the chin and cheek; even spangles are stuck at times on the chin and forehead. Tattooing is common among the poor and in villages, and is seen among the upper classes. The hair, though generally hidden by the “chár-kadd,” is at times exposed and plaited into innumerable little tails of great length, while a coquettish little skull-cap of embroidery, or shawl, or coloured silk is worn. False hair is common. The Persian ladies’ hair is very luxuriant, and never cut; it is nearly always dyed red with henna, or rvith indigo [9:18:631] to a blue-black tinge; it is naturally a glossy black. Fair hair is not esteemed. Blue eyes are not uncommon, but brown ones are the rule. A full-moon face is much admired, and a dark complexion termed “namak” (salt) is the highest native idea of beauty. Most Persian women are small, with tiny feet and hands. The figure is always lost after maternity, and no support of any kind is worn.

A very short jacket, of gay colour, quite open in front, having tight sleeves with many metal buttons, is usually worn in summer, and a lined outer coat in cold weather. In winter a pair of very short white cotton socks are used, and tiny slippers with a high heel; in summer in the house ladies go often barefoot. The rest of the costume is composed of the “túmbún” or “shalwár,” short skirts of great width, held by a running string,—the outer one being usually of silk, velvet, or Kashmir shawl, often trimmed with gold lace, or, among the poor, of loud-patterned chintz or print. Beneath are innumerable other garments of the same shape, varying in texture from silk and satin to print. The whole is very short, among the women of fashion extending only to the thigh. In winter an over-mantle like the “kulájah,” or coat of the man, with short sleeves, lined and trimmed with furs, is worn. Leg-coverings are now being introduced. In ancient days the Persian ladies always wore them, as may be seen by the pictures in the South Kensington Museum. Then the two embroidered legs, now so fashionable as Persian embroideries (“nakoh”), occupied a girl from childhood to marriage in making; they are all seτoing in elaborate patterns of great beauty, worked on muslin in silk. The outdoor costume of the Persian women is quite another thing. Enveloped in a huge blue sheet, with a yard of linen as a veil perforated for two inches square with minute holes, the feet thrust into two huge bags of coloured stuff, a wife is perfectly unrecognizable, even by her husband, when out of doors. The dress of all is the same; and, save in quality or costliness, the effect is similar.

As for the children, they are always when infants swaddled; when they can walk they are dressed as little men and women, and with the dress they generally ape the manners. It is a strange custom with the Persian ladies to dress little girls as boys, and little boys as girls, till they reach the age of seven or eight years; this is often done for fun, or on account of some vow,— offener, to avert the evil eye.

A summary of personal impressions of Persia may serve to convey a tolerably correct idea of the country, without the necessity of serious study or the aid of science and statistics. The reader is asked to suppose a tableland dropping to the Caspian Sea for nearly one-third of its northern frontier, and to the Persian Gulf for its southern limit. The lowlands, naturally, are the coast-tracts. In the north these are covered with forest, and the climate there is damp, feverish, relaxing; in the south they are dry and barren, and the winds are hot and violent, yet a relief to the scorching summer atmosphere. In the central highlands (that is, Persia generally) there are few rivers, and the country is either composed of parallel mountainranges and broad intervening plains, or of irregular mountain-masses with fertile valleys, basins, and ravines. One plain on the last is of exceptionally large extent, and is called the Salt Desert of Khurásan. The theory that this was once a sea is supported by the circumstance that at one of its extreme edges is the village of Yunsi, so called because the prophet Jonah (Yúnas) is locally believed to have been cast up there by the whale. For irrigation the plains and valleys depend on the mountains, and at the base of these are “kanáts,” or underground canals, with watercourses on the surface. Yet where rain and snow fail during the year there is scarcity of water, and where both are wanting there is always distress and sometimes famine. The valleys and ravines are more fertile than the plains, affording often bright, picturesque, and grateful prospects, while the latter are for the most part barren and sandy wastes, scored or streaked, as it "were, rather than ornamented with patches of green oases. Forests are rare and, except in Gílan, not dense; numerous gardens are commonly found in the neighbourhood of large towns, not cared for as in Europe, yet pleasant in their wildness; and there are many beautiful trees usually also near the centres of population. Persian cities are not like cities in Europe. The passing stranger sees no street or house in any of them at all comparable to a respectable street or building, as England, France, or Germany rate structural respectability. Blank mud-walls and narrow ill-paved thoroughfares are the rule; the windowed or terraced front of a Persian house is for the inner court or inner precincts of the abode, and not for the world without. Some mosques are handsome, some caravansarás solid, some bazaars highly creditable to the designer and builder; but everything is irregular, nothing is permanent, and architectural ruin blends with architectural revival in the midst of dirt, discomfort, and a total disregard of municipal method. Even Constantinople and Cairo cannot bear the ordeal of close inspection. Beautiful and attractive as they may be from without—and the first has a charm beyond description, while the second is always interesting in spite of her barbarous boulevard—they are palpably deficient in completeness within; and yet Tehran, Baghdád, Ispahan, Tabriz, Mashhad, Shíráz are far behind them in civilized construction and order.

Section II.— History.

Oriental history, as told by Oriental historians, is for the majority of readers in Europe a study of little attraction. Its genealogies and oft-repeated names are wearisome; its stories of battle, murder, and rapine are monotonous and cast in one mould; the mind cannot readily impart life to the dry bones of the more prominent dramatis personae by conceiving for them any flesh-and-blood individuality. The court-chronicler of an Eastern potentate writes to order, and in accordance with a precedent which fetters style and expression; and even the painter of state-portraits strives rather to turn out a conventional and model monarch than the likeness of an original human being. In the palace of Kirich, near Tehran, is a picture of Fath 'Alí Sháh and his sons. There may be a certain waxwork beauty in some of the faces, but they give no more signs of innate character or mental idiosyncrasy than do the kings and knaves of a pack of cards.

The Timurides in these respects were exceptionally fortunate. Tímúr himself, their great progenitor, though not the distinct figure of an English king as delineated by Macaulay, has been handed down to us in some kind of personality in the history called Zafarnáma ^[322. Unfortunately, perhaps, there are two histories bearing this title. In the one, as Sir William Jones explains, “the Tartarian conqueror is represented as a liberal, benevolent, and illustrious prince”; in the other he is “as deformed as impious, of a low birth and detestable principles.” The authenticity of the Malfúzát is disputed.] in his Malfúzát or utterances, and in the Tuzúkat or institutes.^[323. Both these last terms, however, are indifferently applied to the writings of Tímúr. Tuzuk is the passive participle of tuzmak, “to arrange,” hence tuzûkát, “arrangement.”] There are, moreover, portraits of him in existence which are professed likenesses. Bábar, Akbar, and Jahángír were either their own chroniclers or had comparatively competent men to write for them; and, to illustrate the period in which they lived, we obtain—in addition to records of events—biography, memoirs, and something also of the current sayings, writings, and doings. But the reigns of these three monarchs rather concern the annals of India than of Persia, whereas Tímúr has so much to do with the latter that a brief retrospect of the career of that conqueror and his immediate descendants as it affected the countries generally south of the Caspian will be an appropriate opening to the present history.
[9:18:632]

The Tiιnurides and Turkmans (1405-1499).—Tímúr died in 1405, when in the seventieth year of his age and about to enter upon a new war,—an invasion of China. Besides exercising sovereignty over Transoxiana and those vast regions more or less absorbed in Asiatic Russia of the 19th century, inclusive of the Caucasus, Astrakhan, and the lower Volga, and overrunning Mesopotamia, Syria, Asia Minor, Afghanistan, and India, he had at this time left his indelible mark upon the chief cities and provinces of Persia. Khurásan and Mazandaran had submitted to him in 1381, Adarbaijan had shortly after followed their example, and Ispahan was seized in 1387. If the chroniclers are to be trusted, the occupation of this place was accompanied by the slaughter of 70,000 inhabitants,—a number in excess of its whole population as officially estimated in 1868. From Ispahan he passed on to Shíráz, and thence returned in triumph to his own capital of Samarkand. Five years later his cruel hand was stretched out to subdue a formidable resistance in Mazandaran, and later still he was again at Shíráz, having effected the subjugation of Lúristan and other provinces in the west. It may be said that from north to south, or from Astrábád to Hormuz, the whole country had been brought within his dominion.

The third son of Tímúr, Miran Sháh, had ruled over part of Persia in his father’s lifetime; but he was said to be insane, and his incapacity for government had caused the loss of Baghdád and revolt in other provinces. His claim to succession had been put aside by Tímúr in favour of Pir Muhammad, the son of a deceased son, but Khalil Sháh, a son of the discarded prince, entered the lists against the nominee and won the day. The reign of this chief, however, was not of any duration. His lavish waste of time and treasure upon a fascinating mistress named Shádu Ί-Mulk, the “delight of the kingdom,” soon brought about his ruin and deposition, and in 1408 he gave way to Sháh Rukh, who, with the exception of Miran Sháh, was the only surviving son of Tímúr. In fact the uncle and nephew changed places,—the one quitting his government of Khurásan to take possession of the Central-Asian throne, the other consenting to become governor of the vacated Persian province and abandon the cares of the empire at Samarkand. In the following year Khalil Sháh died; and the story goes that on his death Shádu Ί-Mulk stabbed herself and was buried in the same tomb with her royal lover at Rhé, one of the towns which his grandfather had passed through and partly destroyed.

Sháh Rukh, the fourth son of Tímúr, reigned for thirtyeight years, and appears to have been a brave, generous, and enlightened monarch. He removed his capital from Samarkand to Herat, of which place he rebuilt the citadel, restoring and improving the town. Merv also profited from his attention to its material interests. Sir John Malcolm speaks of the splendour of his court and of his encouragement of men of science and learning. He sent an embassy to China; and an English version of the travels to India of one of his emissaries, 'Abdu ’r-Razzák, is to be found in the volumes of the Hakluyt Society. As regards his Persian possessions, he had some trouble in the north-west, where the Túrkmans of Asia Minor, known as the Kára Koiyún,^[324. They were commonly called Kára Koiyún-lú and the “White Sheep” Turkmans Ak Koiyún-lú, the affix “lú” signifying possession, i.e., possession of a standard bearing the image of a black or white sheep.] or “Black Sheep,” led by Kára Yúsuf^[325. According to Erskine, this chief killed Miran Sháh, whose dwellingplace was Tabriz.] and his sons Iskandar and Jahan Sháh, had advanced upon Tabriz, the capital of Adarbaijan, a province in which they had supplanted the settlers of Halaku, called, after him, 'Hkhání. The distance from Herat—supposing that city to represent the centre of imperial power—was favourable to intrigue and revolt in these parts. On the death of Sháh Rukh in 1446 he was succeeded by his son Ulugh Bey, whose taste for scientific pursuits and active patronage of scientific men are practically demonstrated in the astronomical tables bearing his name, quoted by European writers when determining the latitude of places in Persia. He was, moreover, himself a poet and patron of polite literature, and built a college as well as an observatory at Samarkand. On the other hand, there is no evidence to show that he did much to consolidate his grandfather’s conquests south of the Caspian. Ulugh Bey was put to death by his son 'Abdu Ί-Latíf, who, six months later, was in his turn slain by his own soldiers. Bábar—not the illustrious founder of the Mughal dynasty in India, but an elder member of the same house—next obtained possession of the sovereign power, and established himself in the government of Khurásan and the neighbouring countries. He did not, however, achieve any special reputation, and died after a short rule, from habitual indulgence in intemperate habits,—an abuse which he had vainly striven to check by the registry of a solemn vow. After him Abú Sa'íd, grandson of Miran Sháh, and once governor of Fárs, became a candidate for empire, and was to a great extent successful. This prince allied himself with the Uzbek Tatars, seized upon Búkhára, entered Khurásan, and waged war upon the Túrkman tribe aforesaid, which, since the invasion of Adarbaijan, had, under Jahan Sháh, overrun 'Irák, Fárs, and Karman, and pillaged Herat. But he was eventually taken prisoner by Uzun Hasan, and killed in 1468.

It is difficult to assign dates to the few events recorded in Persian history for the eighteen years following the death of 'Abdu Ί-Latif; and, were it not for the happy intervention of chance European missions, the same difficulty would be felt in dealing with the period after the death of Abú Sa'íd up to the accession of Isma'íl Súfí in 1499. Nor can the chain of events within the range of Persia proper be connected with certainty for the period specified by the aid of native annals or histories. Sultan Ahmad, eldest son of Abtí Sa'íd, reigned in Búkhára; his brother, 'Umar Shaikh, in Farghána; but the son of the latter, the great Bábar, was driven by the Uzbeks to Kabul (Cabul) and India. More to the purpose is it that Sultan Husain Mirza, great-grandson of 'Umar Shaikh, son of Tímúr, reigned in Herat from 1487 to 1506. His siege and capture of the fort of that city are incidentally told in Bábar’s Commentaries, where he is described as an old and experienced soldier. He was a patron of learned men, and as such his reign is remarkable for many brilliant names inscribed as visitors to his court. Among others are those of the historians Mírkhund and Khún-damír, and the poets Jámí and Hátifí. But at no time could the control exercised by this scion of a far-famed stock have extended over central and western Persia. The nearest approach to a sovereignty in those parts on the death of Abú Sa'íd is that of Uzun Hasan just mentioned, who achieved his greatness by individual prowess and the force of circumstances. He was the leader of the Ak Koiyún, or “White Sheep” Túrkmans, and conqueror of the “Black Sheep,” whose chief, Jahan Sháh, he defeated and slew. Between the two tribes there had long been a deadly feud. Both were composed of settlers in Asia Minor, the “Black Sheep” having consolidated their power at Van, the “White” at Diarbekir.

Sir John Malcolm states that at the death of adú Sa'íd, Sultan Husain Mirza “made himself master of the empire,” and, a little later, that “Uzun Hasan, after he had made himself master of Persia, turned his arms in the direction of Turkey”; but the reader is left to infer [9:18:633] for himself what was the real “empire” of Husain Mirza, and what the limit of the “Persia” of Uzun Hasan. The second could not well be included in the first, because the Túrkmans were in possession of the greater part of the Persian plateau, as understood in modern geography, while the “sultan” was luxuriating in Herat, to which Khurásan belonged. It may be assumed as a broad fact that an empire like that acquired by Tímúr could not long be maintained by his descendants in its integrity, even though separate kingdoms or sovereignties were formed in its more important divisions. The retention of particular provinces, or groups of provinces, must have depended not only on the loyalty but on the capability of particular rulers and their subordinate governors; and it was manifestly impossible for an emperor at Samarkand or Herat to know what revolutions were taking effect at Baghdád, Tabriz, or similarly remote places, inland or on the seaboard, which passed away from the original “empire” through the weakness or treachery of unfit agents, even when these were lineal descendants of its distinguished founder.

The Turkish adjective uzun, e ∣5Jjl “long,” applied to Hasan, the Túrkman monarch of Persia (called also by the Arabs Hasanu ’t-Tawíl), is precisely the qualifying Persian word used in the compound designation of Artaxerxes Longimanus; and Malcolm quotes the statement of a Venetian envoy in evidence that Uzun Hasan was “a tall thin man, of a very open and engaging countenance.” This reference, and a further notice in Markham’s more recent history, supply the clue to a store of valuable information on the place and period made generally available by the publications of the Hakluyt Society. The narratives of Caterino Zeno, Barbaro, and Contarini, envoys from Venice to the court of Uzun Hasan, are in this respect especially interesting, and throw much light on the personality of one who was a genuine sháh of Iran. Zeno was sent in 1471 to incite this warlike ruler against the Ottoman sultan, and succeeded so far in his mission as to bring the two powers into open warfare. That the result was disastrous to the sháh is not surprising, but the whole affair seems to hold a comparatively unimportant place in the annals of Turkey.

Uzun Hasan had married Despina (Gr. Δ∈cr7r0ιvα), daughter of the emperor of Trebizond, Calo Johannes of the house of the Comneni; and Zeno’s wife was niece to this Christian princess. The relationship naturally strengthened the envoy’s position at the court, and he was permitted to visit the queen in the name of the republic which he represented. Barbaro and Contarini met at Ispahan in 1474, and there paid their respects to the sháh together. The description of the royal residence—“in the middle of a field, through which a river flowed, in a very delightful locality ”—recalls the palaces in that city, such as the Haft Dast, where strangers of distinction are lodged in the present day. Moreover, the continual and excessive instalments of “good confections” brought to satisfy the travellers’ appetites show that the lavish hospitality of the local authorities is a time-honoured institution. Kúm and Tauris or Tabriz (then the capital) were also visited by the Italian envoys following in the royal suite; and the incidental notice of these cities, added to Contarini’s formal statement that “the extensive country of Ussun-cassan [sic] is bounded by the Ottoman empire and by Caramania,” and that Siras (Shíráz) is comprehended in it, proves that at least Adarbaijan, 'Irák, and the main part of the provinces to the south, inclusive of Fárs, were within the dominions of the reigning monarch.

There is good reason to suppose that Jahan Sháh, the Black Sheep Túrkman, before his defeat by Uzun Hasan, had set up the standard of royalty; and Zeno, at the outset of his travels, calls him “king of Persia”^[326. See also Ramusio’s preface.] in 1450. Chardin alludes to him in the same sense; but, even admitting the validity of his precarious tenure, the limits of his sovereignty were too confined to warrant more than casual mention of his name in an historical summary.

Hasan the Long is a far more prominent figure, and has hardly received justice at the hands of the historian. Indeed, his identity seems to have been lost in the various modes of spelling his name adopted by the older chroniclers, who call him indiscriminately^[327. Knolles, Purclιas, Zeno.] Alymbeius, Asembeius, Asembec, Assimbeo, or Ussan Cassano. He is said to have earned the character of a wise and valiant monarch, to have reigned eleven years, to have lived to the age of seventy, and, on his death in 1477 or (according to Krusinski and Zeno) 1478, to have been succeeded on the throne of Persia by his son Ya'kúb. This prince, who had slain an elder brother, died by poison, after a reign of seven years. The dose was offered to him by his wife, who had been unfaithful to him and sought to set her paramour on his throne. Krusinski thus tells the story.

“Notwithstanding the assurance she put on at the very moment she was acting the crime, the king her husband fancying he saw an air of confusion in her countenance, had a suspicion of her, and required her to drink first. As she could not get off of it without condemning herself, she swallowed the poison with an affected intrepidity; which deceived the king, and so encouraged him that after he had drunk of it himself, he commended it to the lips of the prince his son, then with him, who was eight years of age. The poison was so quick, that all three died of it that night in the year 1485.”

Writers differ as to the succession to Ya'kúb. Zeno’s account is that a son named Allamur (called also Alamut, Alvante, El-wand, and Alwung Bey) was the next king, who, “besides Persia, possessed Diarbekir and part of greater Armenia near the Euphrates.” On the other hand, Krusinski states that, Ya'kúb dying childless, his relative Julaver, one of the grandees of the kingdom, seized the throne and held possession of it for three years. Baisingar, it is added, succeeded him in 1488 and reigned till 1490, when a young nobleman named Bustan (Rustam?) obtained the sovereign power and exercised it for seven years. This account is confirmed by Angiolello, a traveller who followed his countrymen Barbaro and Contarini to Persia; and from the two authorities combined may be gathered the further narration of the murder of Rustam and usurpation of the throne by a certain Ahmad, whose death, under torture, six months afterwards, made way for Alamut, the young son of Hasan. These discrepancies can be reconciled on reference to yet another record bound up with the narratives of the four Italians aforesaid, and of much the same period. In the Travels of a Merchant in Persia the story of Ya'kúb’s death is supplemented by the statement that “the great lords, hearing of their king’s decease, had quarrels among themselves, so that for five or six years all Persia was in a state of civil war, first one and then another of the nobles becoming sultan. At last a youth named Alamut, aged fourteen years, was raised to the throne, which he held till the succession of Shaikh Ismail.” Who this young man was, is not specified; but other writers call Alamut and his brother Murád the sons of Ya'kúb, as though the relationship were unquestioned.

Now little is known, save incidentally, of Julaver or Rustam; but Baisingar is the name of a nephew of 'Umar Shaikh, king of Farghána (Ferghana) and contemporary of Uzun Hasan. There was no doubt much anarchy and confusion in the interval between the death of Ya'kúb and the restoration, for two years, of the dynasty of the White Sheep. But the tender age of Alamut would, even in civilized countries, have necessitated a regency; and it may be assumed that he was the next legitimate and more [9:18:634] generally recognized sovereign. Markham, in designating this prince the last of his house, states that he was dethroned by the renowned founder of the ÍJafawi dynasty. This event brings us to one of the most interesting periods of Persian history, any account of which must be defective without a prefatory sketch of Isma'íl Çúfí.

The Súfí or Safawí Dynasty ( 1499-1736).—Shaikh ξ>aifu ’d-Dín Izhák^[328. According to Langlès, the annotator of Chardin, his real designation was Abú ’ 1-Fath Izhák, the Shaikh Saifu Ί-Hakk wu ’d-Dín or “pure one of truth and religion.”] —lineally descended from Músá, the seventh imám—was a resident at Ardabil, south-west of the Caspian, some time during the 14th century. It is said that his reputation for sanctity attracted the attention of Tímúr, who sought him out in his abode, and was so charmed by the visit that he released, at the holy man’s request, a number of captives of Turkish origin, or, as some affirm, Georgians, taken in the wars with Baiyazid, who had been probably reserved for some more cruel end. The act ensured to the shaikh the constant devotion and gratitude of these men,—a feeling which was loyally maintained by their descendants for the members of his family in successive generations. Morier’s description of the mausoleum erected to the memory of Shaikh Súfí in Ardabil enables the reader to form some idea of the extraordinary veneration in which he was held. Among the offerings on the tomb,^[329. Langlès finds 1334 to be the year of his death. This is impossible if he was contemporary with Tímúr, who was born in 1336. Malcolm’s opinion, derived from the Znbdαtu ’t-tawárikk, that the conqueror’s visit was paid to Sadru ’d-Dín, is, however, the more credible theory.] which was covered with brocades and shawls, bunches of feathers, ostrich eggs, and other ornaments, was a golden ewer set with precious stones, said to have been presented by the Indian emperor Humáiyún.

His son Sadru ’d-Dín and grandson Kwájah 'Alí (who visited Mecca and died at Jerusalem) retained the high reputation of their pious predecessor. Junaid, a grandson of the last, and not a whit less prominent in the pages of history, married a sister of Uzun Hasan, and by her had a son named Shaikh Haidar, who married his cousin Martha, daughter of Uzun Hasan and Queen Despina. Three sons were the issue of this marriage, Sultan 'Alí, Ibráhím Mirza, and the youngest, Isma'íl, the date of whose birth is put down as 1480 for reasons which will appear hereafter. So great was the influence of Shaikh Haidar, and so earnestly did he carry out the principles of conduct which had characterized his family for five generations, that his name has become, as it were, inseparable from the dynasty of his son Isma'íl; and the term “Haidari” (leonine) is applied by many persons to indicate generally the Safawís of Persia. As to the nature of his teaching, and the peculiar tenets professed, this is hardly the place for their discussion; but it may be broadly stated that the outcome was a division of Muhammadanism vitally momentous to the world of Islám. The Persian mind was peculiarly adapted to receive the form of religion prepared for it by the philosophers of Ardabil.

The doctrines presented were dreamy and mystic; they rejected the infallibility of human wisdom, and threw suspicion on the order and arrangement of human orthodoxy. They breathed in harmony with the feelings of a people who, partly in the Athenian spirit and wholly with Athenian perversity, were ever ready “to tell or to hear some new thing.” There was free scope given for the indulgence of that poetical imagination which revels in revolution and chafes at prescriptive bondage. As Malcolm truly and happily remarks, “the natives of Persia are enthusiastically devoted to poetry; the meanest artisan of the principal cities of that kingdom can read or repeat some of the finest passages from their most admired writers; and even the rude and unlettered soldier leaves his tent to listen with rapture to the strain of the minstrel who sings a mystic song of divine love, or recites the tale of a battle of his forefathers.” And he adds, “the very essence of Çúfí-ism is poetry . . . the Masnavi. . . the works of the celebrated Jámí . . . the book of moral lessons of the eloquent Sa'di, and the lyric and mystic odes of Háfiz . . . to them they (the $úfís) continually refer; and the gravest writers who have defended their doctrine take their proofs from the pages of these and other poets whom they deem to have been inspired by their holy theme.”

Those authorities who maintain that Ya'kúb Sháh left no son to succeed him consider valid the claim to the vacant throne of Shaikh Haidar Súfí. At any rate, he could not be otherwise than formidable to a usurper such as Rustam, both from relationship to the deceased monarch and position as one of the most noted of Súfí teachers. Purchas says that Ya'kúb himself, “jealous of the multitude of Aidar’s disciples and the greatness of his fame, caused him to be secretly murthered”; but Krusinski attributes the act to Rustam a few years later. Zeno, the anonymous merchant, and Angiolello affirm that the devotee was defeated and killed in battle,—the first making his conqueror to be Alamut, the second a general of Alamut’s, and the third an officer sent by Rustam named Sulaiman Bey. Malcolm, following the Zubdatu , t-tawαrikh, relates that Shaikh Haidar was vanquished and slain by the governor of Shirwan. The subsequent statement that his son, Sultan 'Alí, was seized, in company with two younger brothers, by Ya'kúb, “one of the descendants of their grandfather Uzun Hasan, who, jealous of the numerous disciples that resorted to Ardabil, confined them to the hill fort of Istakhr in Fars,” seems to indicate a second interpretation of the passage just extracted from Purchas, and. that there is confusion of persons and incident somewhere. One of the sons here alluded to was Isma'íl, whom Malcolm makes to have been only seven years of age when he fled to Gílan in 1492. Zeno states that he was then thirteen, which is much more probable,^[330. So thinks the editor and annotator of the Italian Travels in Persia, Mr Charles Grey.] and the several data available for reference are in favour of this supposition.

The life of the young Súfí from this period to his assumption of royalty in 1499 was full of stirring adventure; and his career as Isma'íl I. was a brilliant one for the annals of Persia. According to Zeno, who seems to have carefully recorded the events of the time, he left his temporary home on an island of Lake Van before he was eighteen, and, passing into Karabagh,^[331. Possibly Kára-dágh, as being the more direct road.] between the Arras and Kur, turned in a south-easterly direction into Gílan. Here he was enabled, through the assistance of a friend of his father, to raise a small force, with which to take possession of Bákú on the Caspian, and thence to march upon Shumakhi in Shirwan, a town abandoned to him without a struggle. Hearing, however, that Alamut was advancing to meet him, he was compelled to seek new levies from among the Jengian Christians and others. In this he was quite successful. Finding himself at the head of an army of 16,000 men, he thoroughly routed his opponents, and, having cleared the way before him, marched straight upon Tabriz, which at once surrendered. He was soon after proclaimed sháh of Persia (1499), under the designation which marked the family school of thought.

Alamut had taken refuge at Diarbekir; but his brother Murád, at the head of an army strengthened by Turkish auxiliaries, was still in the field with the object of contesting the paternal crown. Isma'íl lost no time in moving against him, and won a new victory on the plains of Tabriz. Murád fled with a small remnant of his soldiers to Diarbekir[9:18:635], the rallying-point of the White Sheep Turkmans. One authority (Zeno) states that in the following year Isma'íl entered upon a new campaign in Kurdistan and Asia Minor, but that he returned to Tabriz without accomplishing his object, having been harassed by the tactics of Alau’d-Daulah, a beylarbey, or governor in Armenia and parts of Syria. Another, ignoring these movements, says that he marched against Murád Khán in 'Irák-'Ajmi (Trák-'Adjemi) and Shíráz. This last account is extremely probable, and would show that the young Túrkman had wished to make one grand effort to save Ispahan and Shíráz (with Kazvín and the neighbouring country), these being, after the capital Tabriz, the most important cities of Uzun Hasan’s Persia. His men, however, apparently dismayed at the growing prestige of the enemy, did not support him, and he was defeated and put to flight. One writer says that he was slain in battle; and, since he appears to have made no further attempt on Persia, the statement is perhaps correct. There is similar evidence of the death of Alamut, who, it is alleged, was treacherously handed over to be killed by the sháh’s own hands.

Isma'íl returned again to Tabriz (1501) “and caused great rejoicings to be made on account of his victory.” In 1503 he had added to his conquests Baghdád, Mosul, and Jazirah on the Tigris. The next year he was called to the province of Gílan to chastise a refractory ruler. Having accomplished his end, he eame back to his capital and remained there in comparative quiet till 1507.^[332. Angiolello.] Malcolm’s dates are somewhat at variance with the above, for he infers that Baghdád was subdued in that particular year; but the facts remain. All writers seem to agree that in 1508 the king’s attention was drawn to an invasion of Khurásan by Shaibáni, or Sháhi Beg, the Uzbek, a descendant of Jenghiz and the most formidable opponent of Bábar, from whom he had, seven years before, wrested the city of Samarkand, and whom he had driven from Turkestan to Kabul. Since these exploits he had obtained great successes in Tashkand, Farghána, Hissar, Kunduz, and Khwárizm (Kharezm), and, at the time referred to, had left Samarkand intent upon mischief south and west of the Oxus, had passed the Múrgháb, and had reached Sarakhs. Isma'íl encamped on this occasion at Ispahan, and there concentrated the bulk of his army,—strengthening his northern (and probably north-eastern) frontier with large bodies of cavalry. Zeno’s statement that the royal troops were kept for the whole year in a state of suspense and preparation for encountering their powerful adversaries derives a colour of truth from the circumstance that, before the Uzbek army of invasion could have quite overrun the Khurásan of Husain Mirza, it found occupation to the eastward in Herat and Kandahar; and it must have been represented, even in Mashhad, Níshápúr, Astrábád, and Turshiz—all named as the scenes of conflict—rather by lieutenants than by the leader in person. Such diversion from any direct invasion of his own territories may have caused the sháh to maintain an attitude of simple watchfulness. In 1510, when Shaibáni had invaded Khurásan the second time, and in person, and had entered the fine province of Mazandaran—then in the possession of an independent chief—it was discovered that his troops, in the wantonness of success, had ravaged the Persian province of Karman. Sháh Isma'íl had asked for redress, referring to the land encroached on as “hereditary”; and Shaibáni had replied that he did not understand on what was founded the claim “to inherit.” Mutual taunt and recrimination followed; and eventually the Persian troops were put in movement, and the Uzbeks, having been divided into small detachments scattered over the country, fell back and retreated to Herat. Their leader, however, not being in a position to oppose the sháh in the field, repaired to Merv, where he could obtain sufficient reinforcements, or M’hence he could, if hard pushed, retire across the Oxus. Isma'íl quickly followed him there, and enticed him out to battle by the use of taunt and reproach at his remaining within walls. Shaibáni was defeated and fled, but was overtaken in his flight, surrounded, and put to the sword, together with numerous relatives and companions (see Mongols, vol. xvi. p. 749).

The next remarkable event in Isma'íl’s reign is his war with Sultan Salim I. Its origin may be traced to the Ottoman emperor’s hatred and persecution of all heretical Moslems in his dominions, and the sháh’s anger at the fanaticism which had urged him to the slaughter of 40,000 Turks suspected to have thrown off the orthodox Sunni doctrines. The declaration of war sent by Salim in the form of a letter is one of the most singular of documents, and breathes the true spirit of the age: “I, the glorious Sultan . . . address myself to thee, Amir Isma'íl, chief of the Persian troops, who art like in tyranny to Zohak and Afrasiab, and art destined to perish like the last Dara.” Words such as these might well provoke a less haughty potentate than the Súfí; and, when to them was added the accusation of iniquity, perjury, blasphemy, impiety, heresy, and schism, it is not surprising that the response was a ready resort to arms.^[333. Creasy’s History of the Ottoman Turks.] As a preliminary, however, to this decisive step Isma'íl replied to the sultan in a calm and dignified letter, denying the existence of a casus lelli, expressing willingness to resume peaceful relations, and regretting the mode of address it had been thought fit to adopt towards himself; but he nullified the conciliatory passages by the ironical conclusion that the sultan’s communication must have emanated from the brain of a secretary who had taken an overdose of narcotics,—a remark the significance of which was aggravated by the accompaniment of a box of opium, and the popular belief that Salim was addicted to the use of the drug.

The sultan’s army advanced into Adarbaijan and western Persia through Tokat and Arzinjan. Isma'íl had at this time the greater number of his soldiers employed in his newly-conquered province of Khurásan, and was driven to raise new levies in Kurdistan to obtain a sufficient force to resist the invasion. It is asserted by some that his frontier then extended westward to Sivas, a city situated in a large high plain watered by the Kizil Irmak, and that thence to Khoí, 90 miles west of Tabriz, he followed the approved and often successful tactics of ravaging and retreating, so as to deprive his advancing enemy of supplies. There is good evidence to show that the Turkish janissaries were within an ace of open revolt, and that but for extraordinary firmness in dealing with them they would have abandoned their leader in his intended march upon Tabriz. In fine, at or near Khoí, the frontier-town of Adarbaijan, the battle (1514) was fought between the two rival monarchs, ending in the defeat of the Persians and the triumphant entry of Salim into their capital.

There are stirring accounts of that action and of the gallant deeds performed by Salim and Isma'íl, both personally engaged in it, as well as by their generals.^[334. Knolles, Malcolm, Creasy, Markham, &c.] Others maintain that Isma'íl was not present at all.^[335. Zeno. Angiolello says that “the Sophi monarch had left for Tauris [Tabriz] in order to assemble more troops.” Krusinski infers much to the same effect, for he notes that “Selim came in person and took Tauris from Ismail, but at the noise of his approach was obliged to retreat with precipitation.” The battle must thus have been fought and the victory gained when the sháh was himself absent. Yet Markham quotes a journal which thus records his feats of prowess: “It was in vain that the brave Sháh, with a blow of his sabre, severed a chain with which the Turkish guns were fastened together to resist the shock of the Persian cavalry.”] It is tolerably [9:18:636] certain that the Turks won the day by a better organization of the arms of the military service, superiority of numbers, and more especially the use of artillery. On the side of the Persians the force consisted of little more than cavalry.

Salim remained at Tabriz no more than eight days. Levying a contribution at that city of a large number of its skilled artisans, whom he sent oft' to Constantinople, he marched thence towards Karabagh with intent to fix his winter quarters in those parts and newly invade Persia in the spring, but the insubordination of his troops rendered necessary his speedy return to Turkey. His expedition, if not very glorious, had not been unproductive of visible fruits. Besides humbling the power of an arrogant enemy, he had conquered and annexed to his dominions the provinces of Diarbekir and Kurdistan.

From 1514 to 1524, although the hostile feeling between the two countries was very strong, there was no serious· nor open warfare. Salim’s attention was diverted from Persia to Egypt; Isma'íl took advantage of the sultan’s death in 1519 to overrun and subdue unfortunate Georgia, as Jahan Sháh of the “Black Sheep” had done before him; but Sulaiman had not won without cause his attribute of “great,” and was too strong a successor to the imperial throne to admit of retaliatory invasion being carried out with impunity at the cost of Turkey.

In 1524 Isma'íl died^[336. Malcolm says 1523, Krusinski 1525; Angiolello heard of his death at Cairo in August 1524. Krusinski adds that he was forty-five years of age.] at Ardabil when on a pilgrimage to the tomb of his father. “The Persians dwell with rapture on his character,” writes Sir John Malcolm, for they deem him “not only the founder of a great dynasty, but the person to whom that faith in which they glory owes its establishment as a national religion. He is styled in their histories Shah Shian, or ‘king of the Shiahs,’ an appellation which marks the affection with which his memory is regarded. Though he may not be entitled to their extravagant praises, he certainly was an able and valiant monarch.” And he quotes a note handed down by Purchas from a contemporary European traveller which reports of him thus. “His subjects deemed him a saint, and made use of his name in their prayers. Many disdained to wear armour when they fought under Ismail; and so enthusiastic were his soldiers in their new faith that they used to bare their breasts to their enemies and court death, exclaiming, ‘ Shiah! Shiah! ’ to mark the holy cause for which they fought.”

The proposition has been already laid down that Oriental celebrities, whether heroes or tyrants, as depicted by native limners, bear commonly so strong a family resemblance one with another that the European reader is unable to discriminate between the 'Abbáses and Akbars, the Tímúrs and the Nádirs; and it cannot be pleaded that Isma'íl Sháh Súfí is an exception to the rule. He is belauded and reviled according to the lights or prejudices of his historian. “Reputed one of the greatest and most famous kings that ever ruled in the East,”^[337. Krusinski.] he is at the same time charged with acts of the greatest cruelty and most flagrant vice.^[338. See chaps, xiv. and xxii. of Travels of a Merchant in Persia, Hakluyt reprint, 1873.] Purchas, apparently guided by the “Italian merchant” and Angiolello, has described him as “of faire countenance, of reasonable stature, thicke and large in the shoulder, shauen al but the mustaches; left-handed, and stronger than any of his nobles.”

Sháh Tahmásp,^[339. Angiolello calls him “Shiacthemes.” As an instance of the absurd transliterating current in France as in England the word “Ach-tacon” may be mentioned. It is explained in Chardin’s text to mean “les hôpitaux à Tauris: c’est-à-dire lieux ou l'on fait profusion de vivres. " Chardin’s editor remarks, “La dernière partie de ce mot est méconnaissable, et je ne puis deviner quel mot Persan signifiant profusion a pu donner naissance à la corruption qu’on voit ici.” In other words, the first syllable “ach” (Anglice ash) was understood in its common acceptance for “food” or “victuals”; but “tacon” was naturally a puzzler. The solution of the whole difficulty is, however, to be found in the Turco-Persian Λ> l A- khastah khánah, pronounced by Turks hasta hona, or more vulgarly asta khon and even to a French ear ash-tacon, a hospital, literally a sick-house. This word is undoubtedly current at Tabriz and throughout northern Persia.] the eldest of the four sons of Isma'íl, succeeded to the throne on the death of his father.^[340. The other brothers were Ilkhás, Bahráin, and Sám Mirza, each having had his particular apanage assigned him.] The principal occurrences in his reign, placed as nearly as possible in chronological order, were a renewal of war with the Uzbeks, who had again invaded Khurásan, and the overthrow of their army (1527); the recovery of Baghdád from a Kurdish usurper (1528); the settlement of an internal feud between Kizil-básh tribes (Sháinlu and Tukúlu), contending for the custody of the royal person, by the slaughter of the more unruly of the disputants (1529); the rescue of Khurásan from a fresh irruption, and of Herat from a besieging army of Uzbeks (1530); a new invasion of the Ottomans, from which Persia was saved rather by the severity of her climate than by the prowess of her warriors (1533); the wresting of Baghdád from Persia by the emperor Sulaiman (1534); the king’s youngest brother’s rebellion and the actual seizure of Herat, necessitating the recovery of that city and a march to Kandahar (1536); the temporary loss of Kandahar in the following year (1537), when the governor ceded it to Prince Kamran, son of Bábar; the hospitable reception accorded to the Indian emperor Humáiyún (1543); the rebellion of the sháh’s brother next in age, Ilkhás, who, by his alliance with the sultan, brought on a war with Turkey (1548);^[341. Professor Creasy says that “Suliman led his armies against the Persians in several campaigns (1533, 1534, 1535, 1548, 1553, 1554), during which the Turks often suffered severely through the difficult nature of the countries traversed, as well as through the bravery and activity of the enemy.” All the years given were in the reign of Tahmásp I.] and finally a fresh expedition to Georgia, followed by a revengeful incursion which resulted in the enforced bondage of thousands of the inhabitants (1552).

Baiyazid, a son of the Turkish emperor, rebelled, and his army was beaten in 1559 by the imperial troops at Koniah in Asia Minor. He fled to Persia and took refuge with Sháh Tahmásp, who pledged himself to give him a permanent asylum. Sulaiman’s demand, however, for extradition or execution was too stern and peremptory for refusal; the pledge was broken, and the prince was delivered up to the messengers sent to take him. Another account ignores the pledge and makes the surrender of the guest to have been caused by his own bad conduct. Whatever the motive, the act itself was highly appreciated by Sulaiman, and became the means of cementing a recently-concluded peace between the two monarchs, which theretofore, perhaps, had been more formal than real. Perhaps the domestic affliction of the emperor and the anarchy which in his later years had spread in his dominions had, however, more to do with the maintenance of tranquillity than any mere personal feeling. It is to be feared that at this time not only was there religious fanaticism at work to stir up the mutual hatred ever existing between Sunni and Shí'ah, but the intrigue of European courts was probably directed towards the maintenance of an hostility which deterred the sultan from aggressive operations north and west of Constantinople. “’ Tis only the Persian stands between us and ruin” is the reported saying of Busbecq, ambassador at Sulaiman’s court on the part of Ferdinand of Austria; “the Turk would fain be upon us, but he keeps him back.”

In 1561 Anthony Jenkinson arrived in Persia with [9:18:637] a letter from Queen Elizabeth to the sháh. He was to treat with his majesty of “Trafique and Commerce for our English Marchants,”^[342. Purclιas.] but his reception was not encouraging, and led to no result of importance.

Tahmásp died in 1576, after a reign of about fifty-txvo years. He must have been some sixty-six years of age, having come to the throne at fourteen. Writers describe him as a robust man, of middle stature, widelipped, and of tawny complexion. His long reign was hardly a profitable or glorious one to Persia, especially in respect of the losses to Turkey. He was not wanting in soldierly qualities; but his virtues were rather negative than decided. While one writer acquits him of any remarkable vices, and even calls him prudent and generous, another taxes him with love of ease, avarice, and injustice. If it be true that he abandoned his old capital, Tabriz, for Kazvín because the former was too close to Ardabil, his birthplace, and reminded him too keenly of the mean condition of his grandfather, Shaikh Haidar, his morale must have been low indeed.^[343. Krusinski.]

The deceased sháh had a numerous progeny, and on his death his fifth son, Haidar Mirza, proclaimed himself king, supported in his pretensions by the Kizil-básh tribe of Ustújulú. Another tribe, the Afshár, insisted on the succession of the fourth son, Isma'íl. Had it not been that there were two candidates in the field, the contention would have resembled that which arose shortly after Tahmásp’s accession. As it was, the claim to guardianship of the royal person was put forward, but each tribe declared for its own particular nominee. Finally Isma'íl, profiting from his brother’s weak character and the intrigues set on foot against him, obtained his object, and was brought from a prison to receive the crown.

The reign of Isma'il II. was a short one,—less than two years. He was found dead in the house of a confectioner in Kazvín, having left the world either drunk, drugged, or poisoned. No steps were taken to verify the circumstances, for the event itself was a cause of general relief and joy. He has been represented as a tyrant of the worst type, but it is only right to observe that his youth and part of his manhood had been embittered by injustice and ill-treatment. A prisoner in a dreary fort for years, if his accession to power was marked by cruelties such as disgraced the name of Tiberius, he had, like Tiberius, been brutalized by a hard and continuous provocation.

He was succeeded by his eldest brother, Muhammad Mirza, otherwise called Muhammad Khudábanda, whose claim to sovereignty had been originally put aside on the ground of physical infirmity. A few words will dispose of this prince’s career as a sovereign of Persia. Historians are divided as to his qualities, though he certainly failed to prove, in any shape, equal to the opportunity opened to him. He had the good sense to trust his state affairs almost wholly to an able minister; but he was cowardly enough to deliver up that minister into the hands of his enemies. His kingdom was distracted by intestine divisions and rebellion, and the foe appeared also from without. On the east his youngest son, 'Abbás, held possession of Khurásan; on the west· the sultan’s troops again entered Adarbaijan and took Tabriz. His eldest son, Hamza Mirza, nobly upheld his fortunes to the utmost of his power, reduced the rebel chieftains, and forced the Turks to make peace and retire; but he was stabbed to death by an assassin. On the news of his death reaching Khurásan, Murshid Kúlí Khán, leader of the Ustújulú Kizil-básh, who had made good in fight his claims to the guardianship of 'Abbás, at once conducted the young prince from that province to Kazvín, and occupied the royal city. The object was evident, and in accordance with the popular feeling. 'Abbás, who had been proclaimed king by the nobles at Níshápúr some two or three years before this occurrence, may be said to have now undertaken in earnest the cares of sovereignty. His ill-starred father, at no time more than a nominal ruler, was at Shíráz, apparently deserted by soldiers and people. Malcolm infers that he died a natural death, but when^[344. Krusinski says in 1585.] or where is not stated. Alluding to him at this period, he writes, “He was never afterwards mentioned.” The stories originated by Olearius that Hamza and a second son, Isma'íl, each reigned a few months may refer to attempts on the part of the Kizil-básh chiefs to assert, for one or the other, a share of sovereign power, but do not seem to merit particular consideration.

Sháh 'Abbás, the Great, commenced his long and glorious reign (1586) by retracing his steps towards Khurásan, which had been reinvaded by the Uzbeks almost immediately after his departure thence with the Kizil-básh chief. They had besieged and taken Herat, killed the governor, plundered the town, and laid waste the surrounding country. 'Abbás advanced to Mashhad, the provincial capital and great resort of Persian pilgrims as the burial-place of Imám Riza, but owing to internal troubles he was compelled to return to Kazvín without going farther east. In his absence 'Abdul Munim Khán, the Uzbek commander, attacked the sacred city, obtained possession of it while the sháh lay helplessly ill at Tehran, and allowed his savage soldiers full licence to kill and plunder. The whole kingdom was perplexed, and 'Abbás had much work to restore confidence and tranquillity. But circumstances rendered impossible his immediate renewal of the Khurásan warfare. He was summoned to Shíráz to put down rebellion in Fárs; and, that being over, before he could give his individual attention to drive out the Uzbeks, he had to devise the best means of securing himself against Turkish inroads threatening from the west. He had been engaged in a war with Murád III. in Georgia. Peace was concluded between the two sovereigns in 1590; but the terms were unfavourable to Persia, who lost thereby Tabriz and one or more of the Caspian ports. A somewhat offensive stipulation was included in the treaty to the effect that Persians were not to curse any longer the first three khalifs, —a sort of privilege previously enjoyed by Shí'ahs as part and parcel of their religious faith.

In 1597 'Abbás renewed operations against the Uzbeks, and succeeded in recovering from them Herat and Khurásan. Eastward he extended his dominions to Balkh, and in the south his generals made the conquest of Bahrain (Bahrein), on the Arabian side of the Persian Gulf, and the territory and islands of the Persian seaboard, inclusive of the mountainous province of Lar. He strengthened his position in Khurásan by planting colonies of Kurdish horsemen on the frontier, or along what is called the “atak” or skirt of the Túrkman mountains north of Persia. In 1601 the war with the Ottoman empire, which had been partially renewed prior to the death of Sultan Murád in 1595, with little success on the Turkish side, was now entered upon by 'Abbás with more vigour. Taking advantage of the weakness of his ancient enemy in the days of the poor voluptuary Muhammad III., he began rapidly to recover the provinces which Persia had lost in preceding reigns, and continued to reap his advantages in succeeding campaigns under Ahmad I., until under Othman II. a peace was signed restoring to Persia the boundaries which she had obtained under the first Isma'íl. On the other side Kandahar, which Tahmásp’s lieutenant had yielded to the Great Mughal, was recovered from that potentate in 1609. The following slightly abridged extract from Clements Markham’s history of Persia, relating to distinguished Englishmen of the period, will be an appropriate[9:18:638] conclusion of the narrative of events as above summarized.

“In 1598 Sir Anthony and Robert Shirley, two English gentlemen, arrived at the Shah’s court at Kazvín with a numerous retinue. They were well received, and after some months Sir Anthony returned to Europe with credentials to several Christian princes.” Robert, with five Englishmen, remained at the court of the Sháh. He married a Circassian lady named Teresia, and in 1607 was sent by 'Abbás as his ambassador to James I. of England. After travelling through Europe and remaining a long time at Madrid, Sir Robert Shirley and his Circassian wife landed in his native country in 1611, and was received by James I. with every respect, as the ambassador of a powerful sovereign. His object was to open a trade between England and Persia, but he did not meet with success, owing to the opposition of the Levant merchants. He sailed from Dover with his wife in 1613, and after visiting the court of the Great Mogul, reached Isfahan in 1615. He was soon afterwards sent as ambassador to Spain, where he remained until 1622. In 1618, while Shirley was residing at Madrid, the government of Philip III. of Spain sent an embassy to Persia,' at the head of which was Don Garcia de Silva y Figueroa, an able and learned diplomatist, who made good use of his time in collecting information, and in writing a detailed account of his mission and of Persia, including a Life of Timúr. Garcia de Silva landed at Ormuz, and proceeded thence to Shíráz, where he was roost hospitably entertained. The ambassador was forwarded to Kazwín in June, and had an audience of the Sháh, who received him very graciously. Many conversations afterwards took place between 'Abbás and the stately Spaniard, touching Spanish victories over the Turks, and otheι ’ matters of state. But the main object of the embassy, namely, security for Ormuz, which was now, through the absorption of Portugal, a Spanish possession, was not obtained. Garcia de Silva returned home by way of Aleppo, and embarked at Tripoli for France on 12th November 1619, devoutly praying that his friend the Sháh might be victorious over the Grand Turk.

“In the meanwhile Sháh 'Abbás was occupied in establishing and regulating the important trade of the Persian Gulf. Lar had previously been completely subdued; and Fars was ruled by one of the Sháh’s most trusty and faithful servants. In 1622 the Sháh determined on the expulsion of the Portuguese from the Persian Gulf. They had seized upon the Isle of Ormuz in 1507, under the famous Albuquerque, and in their hands it had attained great prosperity, and become the emporium of all the commerce of the gulf. But they were quite independent of the Sháh of Persia, whose jealousy and resentment they excited. Assisted by the English East India Company, 'Abbás collected a fleet at Gombroon, and embarked a Persian force under Imám Kúly Khán. They laid siege to Ormuz, and the Portuguese, having no hope of succour, were forced to surrender. The island is now covered with desolate heaps of ruins. The port of Gombroon, on the mainland, and sheltered by the islands of Kishm and Ormuz, rose on the fall of the Portuguese city. It received the name of Bandar 'Abbás, and both the English and Dutch were allowed to establish factories there.

“In 1623 Sir Robert Shirley again arrived in England on an embassy from the Sháh; and in 1627 sailed for Persia, in company with Sir Dormer Cotton, who was sent as envoy from Charles I. of England to the Sháh of Persia. They landed at Gombroon in 1628, and Sir Dormer obtained a very gracious reception from 'Abbás, at Kazvín, where he soon afterwards died. Sir Robert Shirley had now grown old in the service of Persia. On his return he was slighted by the Sháh and his favourite, Muhammad 'Aly Beg, and he died at Kazvín in July 1628. Of all the brave and gallant adventurers of the glorious age of Elizabeth, Sir Robert Shirley was by far the greatest traveller, with the exception, perhaps, of Anthony Jenkinson.’

At the age of seventy, after a reign of forty-two years, 'Abbás died at his favourite palace of Farahabad, on the coast of Mazandaran, on the night of the 27th January 1628. Perhaps the most distinguished of all Persian kings, his fame was not merely local but world-wide. Ispahan was his capital, and he did much for its embellishment and enlargement. At his court were ambassadors from England, Russia, Spain, Portugal, Holland, and India. To his Christian subjects he was a kind and tolerant ruler. His conquests have been already mentioned; but there are few sovereigns of an age so closely following the mediaeval who have done such real good to their country by material improvement and development of resources. The establishment of internal tranquillity, the expulsion of interlopers and marauders like Turks and Uzbeks, the introduction of salutary laws, and the promotion of public works of utility— these alone would render remarkable his two-score years of enlightened government. Even in the last quarter of the 19th century the gratified traveller admires the magnificent caravansarás which afford him rest and shelter, and the solid bridges which facilitate his “chapar” (posting), and of which, if he ask particulars, he invariably hears that they were constructed by Sháh 'Abbás.^[345. It would be unfair, however, to forget that there are, in parts of Persia, especially Kannan, some fine caravansarás whose construction is due to the munificence of governors or private individuals. 'Abbás seems certainly to have set the example, and to have furnished the best specimens.] With a fine face, “of which the most remarkable features were a high nose and a keen and piercing eye,”^[346. Malcolm.] he is said to have been below the middle height, robust, active, a sportsman, and capable of much endurance. It is, however, to be regretted that this monarch’s memory is tarnished by more than one dark deed. The murder of his eldest son, Súfí Mirza, and the cruel treatment of the two younger brothers, were stains which could not be obliterated from the page of history by an after-repentance. All that can be now said or done in the matter is to repeat the testimony of historians that his grief for the loss of Súfí Mirza was profound, and that, on his death-bed, he nominated that prince’s son (his own grandson) his successor. Krusinski adds that, on being told at that time by his confidential officers of a prophecy which some astrologers had made to the effect that the new king would reign but three months at most, he replied, “Let him reign as long as he can, though it be but three days. I shall be glad of the assurance that one day, at least, he will have that crown upon his head which was due to the prince, his father.”

Sám Mirza was seventeen years of age when the nobles, in fulfilment of the charge committed to them, took him from the “haram” and proclaimed him king under the title of Sháh Súfí. He reigned fourteen years, and his reign was a succession of barbarities, which can only be attributed to an evil disposition acted upon by an education not only wanting the ingenuae artes but void of all civilizing elements and influences. Taught to read and write, his diversions were to shoot with the bow and ride upon an ass. There was a rumour, moreover, that his father, to stunt the possible growth of wit, ordered him a daily supply of opium. When left to his own devices, he became a drunkard and a murderer, and is accused of the death of his mother, sister, and favourite queen. Among many other sufferers Imám Kúlí Khán, conqueror of Lar and Ormuz, the son of one of 'Abbás’s most famous generals, founder of a college at Shíráz, and otherwise a public benefactor, fell a victim to his savage cruelty. During his reign the Uzbeks were driven back from Khurásan, and a rebellion was suppressed in Gílan; but Kandahar was again handed over to the Mughals of Dehli (Delhi), and Baghdád retaken from Persia by Sultan Murád,—both serious national losses. Tavernier, without charging the sháh with injustice to Christians, mentions the circumstance that “the first and only European ever publicly executed in Persia was in his reign.” He was a watchmaker named Rodolph Stadler, who had slain a Persian on suspicion of intrigue with his wife. Offered his life if he became a Moslem, he resolutely declined the proposal, and was decapitated. His tomb is to be recognized at Ispahan by the words “Cy git Rodolphe” on a long wide slab. Sháh Çúfí died (1641) at Kashan and was buried at Kúm.

His son, 'Abbás II., who succeeded him, appears to have possessed some good qualities, and to have been actuated by liberal sentiments; but his accession to the throne in extreme youth, and the restraint put upon him by his advisers, were fatal to healthy development, and on arriving at an age which should have been that [9:18:639] of discretion he became wilfully indiscreet. Beyond the credit of regaining Kandahar, an operation which he is said to have directed in person when barely sixteen, there is not much to mark the period of his life to the outer world. As to foreign relations, he received embassies from Europe and a deputation from the French East India Company; he sought to conciliate the Uzbeks by treating theiι∙ refugee chiefs with unusual honour and sumptuous hospitality; he kept on good terms with Turkey; he forgave the hostility of a Georgian prince when brought to him a captive; and he was tolerant to all religions,—always regarding Christians with especial favour. But he was a drunkard and a debauchee, and chroniclers are divided in opinion as to whether he died from the effects of drink or licentious living. That he changed the system of blinding his relatives from passing a hot metal over the open eye to an extraction of the whole pupil is indicative of gross brutality. 'Abbás II. died (1668) at the age of thirty-eight, after a reign of twenty-seven years, and was buried at Kúm in the same mosque as his father.

'Abbás was succeeded by his son, Sháh Súfí II., crowned a second time under the name of Sháh Sulaiman.

Sir John Malcolm remarks that from the middle of the reign of 'Abbás II. till the elevation of Nádir Sháh, or for about eighty years, there are but few Persian histories which give particular or authentic accounts of current events; and he attributes this circumstance to the absence for nearly a century of any one political event of magnitude. “And yet,” he writes—

“this extraordinary calm was productive of no advantage to Persia. The princes, nobles, and high officers of that kingdom were, it is true, exempt from the dangers of foreign or internal war; but their property and their lives were the sport of a succession of weak, cruel, and debauched monarchs. The lower orders were exposed to fewer evils than the higher, but they became every day more unwarlike; and what they gained by that tranquillity which the state enjoyed, lost almost all its value when they ceased to be able to defend it. This period was distinguished by no glorious achievements. No characters arose On which the historian could dwell with delight. The nation may be said to have existed upon the reputation which it had before acquired till all it possessed was gone, and till it became, from the slow but certain progress of a gradual and vicious decay, incapable of one effort to avert that dreadful misery and ruin in which it was involved by the invasion of a few Afghan tribes, whose conquest of Persia affixed so indelible a disgrace upon that country, that we cannot be surprised that its historians have shrunk from the painful and degrading narration.” Though weak, dissolute, and cruel, Sulaiman is not without his panegyrists. Chardin, whose testimony is all the more valuable from the fact that he was contemporary with him, relates many stories characteristic of his temper and habits. The statement that on one occasion he compelled his grand wazir to drink to intoxication, and on another to have his hair cut by a barber after the unorthodox fashion of the day, contrary to the old man’s religious prejudices, belongs to the record of unworthy and disgraceful acts. He kept up a court at Ispahan which surprised and delighted his foreign visitors, among whom were ambassadors from European states; and one learned writer, Kaempfer, credits him with wisdom and good policy. Au reste, during his reign Khurásan was invaded by the ever-encroaching Uzbeks, the Kapchak Tatars plundered the shores of the Caspian, and the island of Kishm was taken by the Dutch; but the kingdom suffered otherwise no material loss. He died in 1694, in the forty-ninth year of his age and twenty-sixth of his reign.

About a year before his death he is described by Sanson,^[347. Present State of Persia, London, 1695.] a missionary from the French king Louis XIV., as tall, strong, and active, “a fine prince,—a little too effeminate for a monarch,” with “a Boman nose very well proportioned to other parts,” very large blue eyes, and “a midling mouth, a beard painted black, shav’d round, and well turn’d, even to his ears.” His air was “affable, but nevertheless majestic”; he had a masculine and agreeable voice, and sweet manner of speaking, and was “so very engaging that when you but bow’d to him he seem’d in some measure to return it by a courteous inclining of his head, and which he always did smiling.” The same writer greatly praises him for his kindness to Christian missionaries.

Krusinski’s memoir is full of particulars regarding Sháh Husain, the successor· of Sulaiman. He had an elder and a younger brother, sons of the same mother, but the eldest had been put to death by his father’s orders, and the youngest secreted by maternal precaution lest a similar fate should overtake him. There was, however, a second candidate for power in the person of a half-brother, 'Abbás. The latter prince was the worthier of the throne, but the other better suited the policy of the eunuchs and those noblemen who had the right of election. Indeed Sulaiman himself is reported to have told the grandees around him, in his last days, that “if they were for a martial king that would always keep his foot in the stirrup they ought to choose Mirza 'Abbás, but that if they wished for a peaceable reign and a pacific king they ought to fix their eyes upon Husain.” But he himself made no definite choice.

Husain was selected, as might have been anticipated. On his accession (1694) he displayed his attachment to religious observances by prohibiting the use of wine,— causing all wine-vessels to be brought out of the royal cellars and destroyed, and forbidding the Armenians to sell any more of their stock in Ispahan. The sháh’s grandmother, by feigning herself sick and dependent upon wine only for cure, obtained reversal of the edict; and the process by which the venerable lady made her son, in pure regard to herself, drink the first glass with her (and thereby become a confirmed tippler) is woven into a story good enough to attract a writer of vaudevilles. For the following account of Sháh Husain and his successors to the accession of Nádir Sháh, Markham’s abstract history has been mainly utilized.

The new king soon fell under the influence of mullas, and was led so far to forget his own origin as to persecute the Súfís. Though good-hearted, he was weak and licentious; and once out of the hands of the fanatical party he became ensnared by women and entangled in harem intrigues. For twenty years a profound peace prevailed throughout the empire, but it was the precursor of a terrible storm destined to destroy the Safawí dynasty and scatter calamity broadcast over Persia. In the mountainous districts of Kandahar and Kabul the hardy tribes of Afghans had for centuries led a wild and almost independent life. They were divided into two great branches—the Ghilzáis of Ghazni and Kabul and the Sáduzáis of Kandahar and Herat. More than one fanciful explanation is given of the etymology of the first name; the most probable one is perhaps that which connects them with a Turki tribe of Khalji or Khilagi, a word not impossibly derived from the Turkish kilij, “a sword,” the affix “chi” or “ji” always denoting possession. The second take their name from Sádu, their leader in the time of Sháh 'Abbás. In 1702 a newly-appointed governor, one Sháh Nawáz, called Gúrji Khán from having been “wálí” or ruler of Georgia, arrived at Kandahar with a tolerably large force. He was a clever and energetic man, and had been instructed to take severe measures with the Afghans, some of whom were suspected of intriguing to restore the city to the Dehli emperor. At this time Kandahar had been for sixty years uninterruptedly in the sháh’s possession. The governor appears to have given great offence by the harshness of his proceedings, and a Ghilzái chief named Mir Wá'iz, who had complained of his tyranny, was sent a prisoner to Ispahan. This person had much ability and no little cunning. He was permitted to go on a pilgrimage to Mecca, and on his return in 1708 he so gained upon the confidence of the Persian court that he was allowed to go back to his country. At Kandahar he planned a conspiracy against the Government, slew Gúrji Khán and his retinue, seized the city, defeated two Persian armies sent against him, and died a natural death in 1715. His brother, Mir 'Abdallah, succeeded him in the government of the Afghans; but after a few months, Mahmúd, a son of Mir Wá'iz, a very young man, murdered his uncle and assumed the title of a sovereign prince.

In the meanwhile dark clouds were rising all round the horizon [9:18:640] ready to overwhelm the doomed Safawí dynasty. The Sáduzái tribe revolted at Herat, and declared itself independent in 1717; the Kurds overran the country round Hamadan; the Uzbeks desolated Khurásan; and the Arabs of Maskat seized the island of Al-Bahrain and threatened Bandar-'Abbás. Thus surrounded by dangers on all sides the wretched sháh was bewildered. He made one vain attempt to regain his possessions in the Persian Gulf; but the Portuguese fleet which had promised to transport his troops to Al-Bahrain was defeated by the imám of Maskat and forced to retreat to Goa.

The court of Ispahan had no sooner received tidings of this disaster than Mahmúd, with a large army of Afghans, invaded Persia in the year 1721, seized Karman, and. in the following year advanced to within four days’ march of the city of Ispahan. The sháh offered him a sum of money to return to Kandahar, but the Afghan answered by advancing to a place called Gulnabad, within 9 miles of the capital. The effeminate and luxurious courtiers were taken completely by surprise; no preparation had been made, and the capital was unprovided with either provisions or ammunition. The ill - disciplined Persian army, hastily collected, advanced to attack the rebels. Its centre was led by Shaikh 'Alí Khán, covered by twenty-four field-pieces. The wálí of Arabia commanded the right, and the 'itimádu d-daulah, or prime minister, the left wing. The whole force amounted to 50,000 men, while the Afghans could not count half that number.

On 8th March 1722 the richly-dressed hosts of Persia appeared before the little band of Afghans, who were scorched and disfigured by their long marches. The wálí of Arabia commenced the battle by attacking the left wing of the Afghans with great fury, routing it, and plundering their camp. The prime minister immediately afterwards attacked the enemy’s right wing, but was routed, and the Afghans, taking advantage of the confusion, captured the Persian guns and turned them on the Persian centre, who fled in confusion without striking a blow. The wálí of Arabia escaped into Ispahan, and Mahmúd the Afghan gained a complete victory. Fifteen thousand Persians remained dead on the field. A panic now seized on the surrounding inhabitants, thousands of country people fled into the city, and the squares and streets were filled with a helpless multitude. Ispahan was then one of the most magnificent cities in Asia, containing more than 600,000 inhabitants. After his victory Mahmúd seized on the Armenian suburb of Julfa, and invested the doomed city; but Tahmásp, son of the sháh, had previously escaped into the mountains of Mazandaran. Famine soon began to press hard upon the besieged, and in September Sháh Husain offered to capitulate. He agreed to abdicate in favour of Mahmúd, and to deliver himself up as a prisoner. Having been conducted to the Afghan camp, he fixed the royal plume of feathers on the young rebel’s turban with his own hand; and 4000 Afghans were ordered to occupy the palace and gates of the city.^[348. We have an account of the Afghan invasion and sack of Ispahan from an eye-witness, Father Krusinski, procurator of the Jesuits at that place, whose interesting work was translated into English in the last century.] Mahmúd entered Ispahan in triumph, with the captive sháh on his left hand, and, seating himself on the throne in the royal palace, he was saluted as sovereign of Persia by the unfortunate Husain. When Tahmásp, the fugitive prince, received tidings of the abdication of his father he at once assumed the title of sháh at Kazvín.

Turkey and Russia were not slow to take advantage of the calamities of Persia. The Turks seized on Tiflis, Tabriz, and Hamadan, while Peter the Great, whose aid had been sought by the friendless Tahmásp, fitted out a fleet on the Caspian.^[349. In 1721 Sultan Husain sent an embassy to the Russians, seeking aid against the Afghans. In May 1722 a flotilla descended the Volga commanded by Czar Peter, and on 19th July the Russian flag first waved over the Caspian. Gílan was occupied by 6000 men under General Matuschkin.] The Russians occupied Shirwan, and the province of Gílan on the south-west corner of the Caspian^[350. The Russians remained in Gílan until 1734, when they were obliged to evacuate it, owing to the unhealthiness of the climate.]; and Peter made a treaty with Tahmásp II. in July 1722, by which he agreed to drive the Afghans out of Persia on condition that Darband (Derbend), Bákú, Gílan, Mazandaran, and Astrábád λvere ceded to Russia in perpetuity. These were all the richest and most important northern provinces of Persia.

Meanwhile the cruel invader was deluging Ispahan with the blood of its citizens. Dreading rebellion, in 1723 he invited three hundred of the principal Persian nobility to a banquet and massacred them. To prevent their children rising up in vengeance they were all murdered also. Then he proceeded to slaughter vast numbers of the citizens of Ispahan, until the place was nearly depopulated. Not content with this, in February 1725 he assembled all the captives of the royal family, except the sháh, in the courtyard of the palace, and caused them all to be murdered, commencing the massacre with his own hand. The wretched Husain, frantic with grief, rushed to this scene of horror, and was himself wounded in endeavouring vainly to save his infant son, only five years of age. All the males of the royal family, except Husain himself, Tahmásp, and two children, are said to have perished. At length the inhuman miscreant Mahmúd died, at the early age of twenty-seven, on 22d April 1725." With scarcely any neck, he had round shoulders, a broad face with a flat nose, a thin beard, and squinting eyes, which were generally downcast.

Mahmúd was succeeded in his usurpation by his first cousin Ashraf, the son of Mir 'Abdallah. He was a brave but cruel Afghan. He gave the dethroned sháh a handsome allowance, and strove, by a mild policy, to acquire popularity. In 1727, after a short war, he signed a treaty with the Turks, acknowledging the sultan as chief of the Moslems. But the fortunate star of Tahmásp II. was now beginning to rise, and the days of Afghan usurpation were numbered. He had collected a small army in Mazandaran, and was supported by Fath 'Alí Khán, the powerful chief of the Kajár tribe. In 1727 the fugitive sháh was joined by Nadir Kúlí, a robber chief, who was already famous for his undaunted valour, and who was destined to become the mightiest conqueror of the age. He murdered Fath 'Alí, and, having easily appeased the sháh, received the command of the royal army. In 1729 Ashraf became alarmed at these formidable preparations in the north, and led an Afghan army into Khurásan, where he was defeated by Nádir at Damghan, and forced to retreat. The Persian general followed close in his rear, and again entirely defeated him outside Ispahan in November of the same year. The Afghans fled through the town; and Ashraf, murdering the poor old sháh Husain on his way, hurried with the wreck of his army towards Shíráz. On 16th November the victorious Nádir entered Ispahan, and was soon followed by his master, the young sháh Tahmásp 11., who burst into tears when he beheld the ruined and defaced walls of the palace of his ancestors. His mother, who had escaped the numerous massacres by disguising herself as a slave, and performing the most degrading offices, now came forth and threw herself into his arms. Nadir did not give his enemies time to recover from their defeat. He followed them up, and again utterly routed them in January 1730. Ashraf tried to escape to Kandahar almost alone, but was murdered by a party of Baluch robbers; and thus, by the genius of Nádir, his native land was delivered from the terrible Afghan invaders.

The ambition of Nádir, however, was far greater than his loyalty. On the pretext of incapacity he dethroned Tahmásp II. in 1732, and sent him a prisoner into Khurásan, where he was murdered some years afterwards by Nádir’s son, while the conqueror was absent on his Indian expedition. For a short time the wily usurper placed Tahmásp’s son on the throne, a little child, with the title of 'Abbas HL, while he contented himself with the office of regent. Poor little 'Abbás died at a very convenient time, in the year 1736, and Nádir then threw off the mask. He was proclaimed sháh of Persia by a vast assemblage on the plain of Moghan.

By the fall of the Safawí dynasty Persia lost, as it were, her race of national monarchs, considered not only in respect of origin and birthplace but in essence and in spirit. The Persians have never been governed by more truly representative kings than Isma'íl, Tahmásp, and 'Abbás; and, whatever their faults and failings, they were Persian and peculiar to Persians. Thoroughly to realize this truth we must endeavour for a moment to change our own for the Oriental standpoint, and accept even the murders and excesses committed as an outcome of the age, place, and circumstances, and as natural as are the freaks of unrestrained childhood. Regarded in a sober English spirit, the reign of the great 'Abbás is rendered mythical by crime. No sovereign could be great in the estimation of civilized Europe who acted as he did on certain occasions. No victory or healthy legislation could compensate for moments of madness, which, under Western orthodoxy, must mar a whole career. But something liberal in the philosophy of their progenitors threw an attractiveness over the earlier Safawí kings which was wanting in those who came after them. In course of time the old philosophical element disappeared; and one of Sháh Husain’s immediate predecessors not only disavowed all sympathy with Súfism but threatened to crush it where detected. The fact is that, two centuries after Sháh Isma'íl’s accession to the throne, the Safawí race of kings was effete; and it became necessary to make room for a more vigorous if not a more lasting rule. Nádir was the strong man for [9:18:641] the hour and occasion. He has been designated a “robber chief”; but his antecedents, like those of many others who have filled the position, have redeeming points of melodramatic interest. He was driven to this mode of life by injustice, and raised to consideration above ordinary banditti by ability as much as by physical force. It was the repute he had thus obtained which caused Saifu ’d-Dín Beg, a general of Sháh Tahmásp, and chief of a tribe, to unite his fortunes to Nádir’s, and so enable him to rise on the ladder of his ambition. That Nádir misused his advantages by acts of treachery is not to be denied. Such was, unfortunately, one of the visible roads to success in those barbarous times.

A map attached to Krusinski’s volumes (see Plate VIII.) illustrates the extent of Persian territory in 1728, or one year before Ashraf was finally defeated by Nádir, and some eight years prior to the date on which Nádir was himself proclaimed king. It shows, during the reign of the Safawís, Tiflis, Erivan, Khoí, and Baghdád to have been within the limits of Persia on the west, and in like manner Balkh and Kandahar to have been included within the eastern border. There is, however, also shown, as a result of the Afghan intrusion and the impotency of the later Safawí kings, a long broad strip of country to the west, including Tabriz and Hamadan, marked “conquests of the Turks,” and the whole west shore of the Caspian from Astrakan to Mazan daran marked “conquests of the czar of Muscovy”; Makran, written Mecran, is designated “a warlike independent nation.” If further allowance be made for the district held by the Afghan invaders as part of their own country, it will be seen how greatly the extent of Persia proper was reduced, and what a work Nádir had before him to restore the kingdom to its former proportions.

But the former proportions had been partly reverted to, and would doubtless have been in some respects exceeded, both in Afghanistan and the Ottoman dominions and on the shores of the Caspian, by the action of this indefatigable general, had not his sovereign master, Tahmásp II., acting on his own account, been led into a premature treaty with the Turks. Nádir’s anger and indignation had been great at this weak proceeding; indeed, he had made it the ostensible cause of the sháh’s deposition. He had addressed letters to all the military chiefs of the country, calling upon them for support; he had sent an envoy to Constantinople insisting upon the sultan’s restoration of the Persian provinces still in his possession—that is, Georgia and part of Adarbaijan,-—and he had threatened Baghdád with assault. As regent, he had failed twice in taking the city of the khalifs, but on the second occasion he had defeated and killed its gallant defender, Topal Othman, and he had succeeded in regaining Tiflis, Kars, and Erivan.^[351. Malcolm.]

Russia and Turkey, naturally hostile to one another, had taken occasion of the weakness of Persia to forget their mutual quarrels and unite to plunder the tottering kingdom of the Safawí kings. A partition treaty had been signed between these two powers in 1723, by which the czar was to take Astrábád, Mazandaran, Gílan, part of Shirwan and Daghistan, while the acquisitions of the Porte were to be traced out by a line drawn from the junction of the Arras and Kur rivers, and passing along by Ardabil, Tabriz, and Hamadan, and thence to Karmansháh. Tahmásp was to retain the rest of his paternal kingdom on condition of his recognizing the treaty. The ingenious diplomacy of Russia in this transaction was manifested in the fact that she had already acquired the greater part of the territory allotted to her, while Turkey had to obtain her share by further conquest. But the combination to despoil a feeble neighbour was outwitted by the energy of a military commander’ of remarkable type.

Nádir Sháh.— Nádir, it has been said, was proclaimed sháh in the plains of Moghan in 1736. Mirza Mahdi relates how this event was brought about by his address to the assembled nobles and officers on the morning of the t Náu-ruz,” or Persian New-Year’s Day, the response to that appeal being the offer of the crown. In the spirit of the third English Richard, he refused to accept the high dignity, but eventually suffered his petitioners, on certain conditions, to “buckle fortune on his back.” The conditions were that the crown should be hereditary in his family, that the claim of the Safawís was to be held for ever extinct, and that measures should be taken to bring the Shí'ahs to accept uniformity of worship with the Sunnis. The mulla báshi (or high priest) objecting to the last, Nádir ordered him to be strangled, a command which was carried out on the spot. On the day following, the agreement having been ratified between sovereign and people, he was proclaimed emperor of Persia. At Kazvín the ceremony of inauguration took place. Having girt on the royal scimitar and put the crown on his head, he took the accustomed oath. The edict expressing the royal will on the religious question is dated in June, but the date of coronation is uncertain. From Kazvín Nádir moved to Ispahan, where he organized an army for a proposed expedition against Kandahar, then in the possession of a brother of Mahmúd, the conqueror of Sháh Husain. But before setting out for Afghanistan he took measures to secure the internal quiet of Persia, attacking and seizing in his stronghold the chief of the marauding Bakhtiáris, whom he put to death, retaining many of his men for service as soldiers. With an army of 80,000 men he marched through Khurásan and Sístan to Kandahar, which city he blockaded ineffectually for a year; but it finally capitulated on the loss of the citadel. Balkh fell to Riza Kúlí, the king’s son, who, moreover, crossed the Oxus and defeated the Uzbeks in battle. Besides tracing out the lines of Nadirabad, a town since merged in modern Kandahar, Nádir had taken advantage of the time available and of opportunities presented to enlist a large number of men from the Abdáli and Ghilzái tribes. It is said that as many as 16,000 were at his disposal. His rejection of the Shí'ah tenets as a state religion seems to have propitiated the Sunni Afghans, and it is not to be otherwise wondered at that a man of his warlike habits should have succeeded in attaching many of the rough mountaineers to his person. Such a force, in addition to his own army, rendered him a truly formidable foe, and the prospect which now opened out before him must have fired his heart and the hearts of his warriors with restless exultation.

He had sent an ambassador into Hindustan requesting the Mughal emperor to order the surrender of certain unruly Afghans who had taken refuge within Indian territory, but no satisfactory reply was given, and obstacles were thrown in the way of the return of the embassy. The Persian monarch, not sorry perhaps to find a plausible pretext for encroachment in a quarter so full of promise to booty-seeking soldiers, pursued some of the fugitives through Ghazni to Kabul, which city was then under the immediate control of Násr Khán, governor of eastern Afghanistan, for Muhammad Sháh of Dehli. This functionary, alarmed at the near approach of the Persians, fled to Pesháwar. Kabul had long been considered not only an integral part but also one of the main gates of the Indian empire; notwithstanding a stout resistance on the part of its commandant, Shir or Shírzah Khán, the place was stormed and carried (1738) by Nádir, who, after slaughtering the greater part of the garrison, took possession of it and moved on to the eastward. Mirza Mahdi relates [9:18:642] that from the Kabul plain he addressed a new remonstrance to the Dehli court, but that his envoy was arrested and killed, and his escort compelled to return by the governor of Jalálabád. The same authority notes the occupation of the latter place by Persian troops and the march thither from Gandamak. There are some doubts as to the exact route now taken, but it was probably through the Khaibar (Khyber) Pass that he passed into the Peshawar plain, for it was there that he first defeated the imperial forces.

The invasion of India had now fairly commenced, and its successful progress and consummation were mere questions of time. It will not do to cite a triumphal march of an irresistible horde in example of what may still be achieved by an inroad upon modern Hindustan. The prestige of this Eastern Napoleon was immense. It had not only reached but had been very keenly felt at Dehli before the conquering army had arrived. There was no actual religious war; all sectarian distinction had been disavowed; the contest was between vigorous Muhammadans and effete Muhammadans. Nádir had not, like Caesar, come, and seen, and conquered. His way had been prepared by circumstances, and as he progressed from day to day his army of invaders increased. There must have been larger accessions by voluntary recruits than losses by death or desertion. The victory on the plain of Karnál, whether accomplished by sheer fighting or the intervention of treachery, was the natural outcome of the previous situation; it was the shifting of the scene as anticipated and prepared, and the submission of the emperor followed as a matter of course. But the coming and going of Nádir are studies quite as interesting and instructive as the coming and going of Alexander, and belong to comparatively recent days.

Dehli must have experienced a sense of relief at the departure of its conqueror, whose residence there had been rendered painfully memorable by carnage and riot. The marriage of his son to the grand-daughter of Aurangzíb and the formal restoration of the crown to the dethroned emperor, both prominent parts of the first pageant, were doubtless politic, and his parting counsels to the wretched Muhammad Sháh were, it is probable, good and appropriate; but the descendant of Bábar could not easily forget how humiliating a chapter in history would remain to be written against him. The return march of Nádir to Persia is not recorded with precision. On the 5th May 1739 he left the gardens of Shalimar, north of Dehli, to proceed, by Lahore and Pesháwar, through the passes to Kabul. Thence he seems to have returned to Kandahar and, either in person or by his lieutenants, to have recrossed the Indus into Sind. But the subjection of Núr Muhammad, the Kalhora chief then ruling in that provincé, would hardly have been a sufficient inducement to bring back the great Nádir Kúlí so far as 'Umarkot; and in May 1740—just one year after his departure from Dehli—he was in Herat displaying the imperial throne and other costly trophies to the gaze of the admiring inhabitants. Sind was certainly included in the cession to him by Muhammad Sháh of “all the territories westward of the river Attok,” but only that portion of it, such as Thattah (Tatta), situated on the right bank of the Indus.

From Herat he moved upon Balkh and Búkhára, and at a short distance from the latter city received the submission of Abú Ί-Fáiz Khán, the Uzbek ruler, whom he restored to his throne on condition that the Oxus should be the acknowledged boundary between the two empires. The khán of Khwárizm was his next opponent; and, as this chief rejected conciliation, and had given serious cause of offence by repeated depredations in Persian territory, he was made prisoner and doomed, with some of his officers, to execution. Nádir then visited the strong fortress of Kelat, a place which now bears his name and to which he was greatly attached as the scene of his boyish exploits, and Mashhad, which he constituted the capital of his empire. Here he spent three months in festivity; and if extension of dominion be a cause for gratulation he could well justify the demonstration, for he had extended his boundary on the east to the Indus, and to the Oxus on the north.

On the south he was restricted by the Arabian Ocean and Persian Gulf; but the west remained open to his further progress. He had in the first place to revenge the death of his brother Ibráhím Khán, slain by the Lesghians; and a campaign against the Turks might follow in due course. The first movement was unsuccessful, and indirectly attended with disastrous consequences. Nádir, when hastening to the support of some Afghan levies who were doing good service, was fired at and wounded by a stray assailant; suspecting his son, Riza Kúlí, of complicity, he commanded the unfortunate prince to be seized and deprived of sight. From that time the heroism of the monarch appeared to die out. He became morose, tyrannical, and suspicious. An easy victory over the Turks gave him but little additional glory; and he readily concluded a peace with the sultan which brought but insignificant gain to Persia.^[352. Professor Creasy says the war broke out in 1743, but was terminated in 1746 by a treaty which made little change in the old arrangements fixed under Murád IV.] Another battle won from the Ottoman troops near Diarbekir by Násr Ullah Mirza, the young prince who had married a princess of Dehli, left matters much the same as before. “It was agreed that prisoners on both sides should be released, that Persian pilgrims going to the holy cities of ‘Mecca and Medina should be protected, and that the whole of the provinces of Irak and Adarbaijan should remain with Persia, except an inconsiderable territory that had belonged to the Turkish Government in the time of Sháh Ismail, the first of the Suffavi kings.”^[353. Malcolm.]

The last years of Nádir’s life were full of internal trouble. On the part of the sovereign, murders and executions ; on that of his subjects, revolt and conspiracy,—these were the ordinary topics of common interest throughout the country. Such a state of things could not last, and certain proscribed persons plotted together for the destruction of a sovereign who had now become a half-demented tyrant. He was despatched by Salah Bey, captain of his guards, to whom, with three others, was committed the work of his assassination (1747). He was some sixty years of age, and had reigned eleven years. About the time of setting out on his Indian expedition he was described as a most comely man, upwards of 6 feet high, well-proportioned, of robust make and constitution; inclined to be fat, but prevented by the fatigue he underwent; with fine, large black eyes and eyebrows ; of sanguine complexion, made more manly by the influence of sun and weather; a loud, strong voice; a moderate wine-drinker; fond of simple diet, such as piláos and plain dishes, but often neglectfid of meals altogether, and satisfied, if occasion required, with parched peas and water, always to be procured.^[354. Fraser’s History of Nádir Sháh (1742).]

Malcolm winds up a long account of his idiosyncrasies with the following.

“The character of this wonderful man is, perhaps, exhibited in its truest colours in those impressions which the memory of his actions has left upon the minds of his countrymen. They speak of him as a deliverer and a destroyer; but while they expatiate with pride upon his deeds of glory, they dwell with more pity than horror upon the cruel enormities which disgraced the latter years of his reign; and neither his crimes, nor the attempt he made to abolish their religion, have subdued their gratitude and veneration for the hero, who revived in the breasts of his degraded countrymen [9:18:643] a sense of their former fame, and restored Persia to her independence as a nation.”

During the reign of Nádir an attempt was made to establish a British Caspian trade with Persia. The names of Jonas Hanway and John Elton were honourably connected with this undertaking; and the former has left most valuable records of the time and country.

From Nadir Sháh to the Kajar Dynasty.— After the death of Nádir Sháh something like anarchy prevailed for thirteen years in the greater part of Persia as it existed under Sháh 'Abbás. No sooner had the crime become knoλvn than Ahmad Khán, chief of the Abdáli Afghans, marched off rapidly with his men to Kandahar and took possession of that city and a certain amount of treasure. The chief of the Bakhtiáris, Rashid, also with treasure, fled to the mountains, from which his people had been drawn prior to the Indian expedition; and the conspirators who had done the murderous deed invited 'All, a nephew of the deceased monarch, to ascend the vacant throne. By the action of Ahmad Abdáli, Afghanistan was at once lost to the Persian crown, for this leader was strong enough to found an independent kingdom. The Bakhtiári encouraged his brother, 'Alí Mardan, to compete for the succession to Nádir; and the nominee of the disaffected party hastened from Sístan to Mashhad to take advantage of his nomination. The prince was welcomed by his subjects; he told them that the murder of his uncle was due to his own instigation, and, in order to conciliate them towards him in a practical manner, remitted the revenues of the current year and all extraordinary taxes for the two years following.

Taking the title of 'Adil Sháh, or the “just’’king, he commenced his reign by putting to death the two princes Riza Kúlí and Násr Ullah, as well as all relatives who could, in his estimation, be considered his competitors, with the exception of Sháh Rukh, son of Riza Kúlí, whom he spared in case a lineal descendant of Nádir should at any time be required by the people. His calculations proved, however, no wiser than beneficent. He had not removed all dangerous members of the royal house, nor had he gauged the temper of the times or people. 'Adil Sháh was soon dethroned by his own brother, Ibráhím, and he in his turn was defeated by the adherents of Sháh Rukh, who made their leader king.

This young prince had a better and more legitimate title than that of the grandson of Nádir, whose usurpation λvas too recent an occurrence to have eradicated and supplanted a comparatively ancient dynasty of national kings. He was also grandson, on the mother’s side, of the Safawí Sháh Husain. Amiable, generous, and liberal-minded, and of prepossessing exterior, he proved to be a popular prince. But his friends and supporters had done well to have left him in honourable obscurity; for he was neither of an age nor character to rule over a people led hither and thither by turbulent and disaffected chiefs, ever divided by the conflicting interests of personal ambition. No sooner had his claim to succession been admitted than his authority was subverted. Sa'íd Muhammad, son of Mirza Dáúd, a chief mulla at Mashhad, whose mother was the reputed daughter of Sulaiman, collecting a body of men, and assuming the name of his maternal grandfather, declared himself king, and imprisoned and blinded Sháh Rukh. Yúsuf 'Alí, the general commanding the royal troops, came to the rescue, defeated and slew Sulaiman, and replaced his master on the throne, reserving to himself the protectorship or regency. A new combination of chiefs, of which Ji'afir the Kurd and Mir 'Alam the Arabian are the principal names handed down, brought about the death of Yúsuf 'Alí and the second imprisonment of Sháh Rukh. These events were followed by a quarrel terminating in the supremacy of the Arab. At this juncture Ahmad Sháh Abdáli reappeared in Persian Khurásan from Herat; he attacked and took possession of Mashhad, slew Mir 'Alam, and, pledging the local chiefs to support the blinded prince in retaining the kingdom of his grandfather, he returned to Afghanistan. But thenceforward this unfortunate young man was a mere shadow of royalty, and his purely local power and prestige had no further influence whatever on Persia as a country.

The land was partitioned among several distinguished persons, who had of old been biding their opportunities, or were born of the occasion. Foremost among these was Muhammad Hasan Khán, hereditary chief of those Kajárs who were established in the south-east corner of the Caspian. His father, Fath 'Alí Khán, after sheltering Sháh Tahmásp II. at his home in Astrábád, and long acting as one of his most loyal supporters, had been put to death by Nádir, who had appointed a successor to his chiefdom from the “Yukári” or “upper” Kajárs, instead of from his own, the “Ashágha,” or “lower.”^[355. There were three branches of the Kajár tribe, i.e., the Suldús, Túngkút, and Jaláiyar. The last, according to Watson, became settled in Iran and Turan, and seem at first to have given their name to all the tribe.] Muhammad, with his brother, had fled to the Túrkmans, by whose aid he had attempted the recovery of Astrábád, but had not succeeded in regaining a permanent footing there until Nádir had been removed. On the murder of the tyrant he had raised the standard of independence, successfully resisted Ahmad Sháh and his Afghans, who sought to check his progress in the interests of Sháh Rukh, and eventually brought under his own sway the valuable provinces of Gílan, Mazandaran, and Astrábád,^[356. Watson. Malcolm says that Gilan was under one of its own chiefs, Hidáiyat Khán.] —quite a little kingdom in itself. In the large important province of Adarbaijan, Azad Khán, one of Nádir’s generals, had established a separate government; and 'Alí Mardan, brother of the Bakhtiári chief, took forcible possession of Ispahan, empowering Sháh Rukh’s governor, Abú Ι-Fatlι Khán, to act for the new master instead of the old.

Had 'Alí Mardan declared himself an independent ruler he would have been by far the most important of the three persons named. But such usurpation at the old Safawí capital would have been too flagrant an act for general assent; so he put forward Isma'íl, a nephew of Sháh Husain, as the representative of sovereignty, and himself as one of his two ministers,—the other being Karim Khán, a young chief of the Zend Kurds. Sháh Isma'íl, it need scarcely be said, was a mere nominal king, and possessed no real authority; but the ministers were strong men in their way, and the Zend especially promised to be useful in his generation, for he had many high and excellent qualities. After a time 'Alí Mardan was assassinated, and Karim Khán became the sole living power at Ispahan. The story of the period is thus told by Watson.

“The three rivals, Karim, Azad, and Muhammad Hasan, proceeded to settle, by means of the sword, the question as to which of them was to be the sole master of Persia. A three-sided war then ensued, in the course of which each of the combatants in turn seemed at one time sure to be the final conqueror. Karim, when he had arranged matters at Ispahan, marched to the borders of Mazandaran, where the governor of that province was ready to meet him. After a closely-contested battle victory remained with Muhammad Hasan; who, however, was unable to follow up the foe, as he had to return in order to encounter Azad. That leader had invaded Gilan, but, on the news reaching him of the victory which the governor of Mazandaran had gained, he thought it prudent to retrace his steps to Sultaníyah. Karim reunited his shattered forces at Tehran, and retired to Ispahan to prepare for a second campaign. When he again took the field it was not to measure himself once more with the Kajar chief, but to put down the pretensions of Azad. The wary Afghan, however, shut himself up in Kazvín, a position from which he was enabled to inflict much injury on the army of Karim, while his own troops remained unharmed [9:18:644] behind the walls of the town. Karim retired a second time to Ispahan, and in the following spring advanced again to meet Azad. A pitched battle took place between them, in which the army of Karim was defeated. He retreated to the capital, closely pressed by the foe. Thence he continued his way to Shiráz, but Azad was still upon his traces. He then threw himself upon the mercy of the Arabs of the Garmsir, or hot country, near the Persian Gulf, to whom the name of the Afghans was hateful, and who rose in a body to turn upon Azad. Karim, by their aid, once more repaired his losses and advanced on Ispahan, while Muhammad Hasan with fifty thousand men was coming from the opposite direction, ready to encounter either the Afghan or the Zend. The Afghan did not await his coming, but retired to his government of Tabriz.

“The Zend issued from Ispahan, and was a second time defeated in a pitched battle by the Kajar. Karim took refuge behind the walls of Shiráz, and all the efforts of the enemy to dislodge him were ineffectual. Muhammad Hasan Khan in the following year turned his attention to Adarbaijan. Azad was no longer in a position to oppose him in the field, and he in turn became master of every place of importance in the province, while Azad had to seek assistance in vain—first from the Pasha of Baghdad, and then from his former enemy, the Tsar of Georgia. Next year the conquering Kajar returned to Shiráz to make an end of the only rival who now stood in his way. On his side were 80,000 men, commanded by a general who had twice defeated the Zend chief on an equal field. Karim was still obliged to take shelter in Shiraz, and to employ artifice in order to supply the place of the force in which he was deficient. Nor were his efforts in this respect unattended with success: seduced by his gold, many of the troops of the Kajar began to desert their banners. In the meantime the neighbourhood of Shiráz was laid waste, so as to destroy the source from which Muhammad Hasan drew his provisions; by degrees his army vanished, and he had. finally to retreat with rapidity to Ispahan with the few men that remained to him. Finding his position there to be untenable, he retreated still further to the country of his own tribe, while his rival advanced to Ispahan, where he received the submission of nearly all the chief cities of Persia. The ablest of Karim’s officers, Shaikh 'Ali, was sent in pursuit of the Kajar chief. The fidelity of the commander to whom that chieftain had confided the care of the pass leading into Mazandarán, was corrupted; and, as no further retreat was open to him, he found himself under the necessity of fighting. The combat which ensued resulted in his complete defeat, although he presented to his followers an example of the most determined valour. While attempting to effect his escape he was recognized by the chief of the other branch of the Kajar tribe, who had deserted his cause, and who had a blood-feud with him, in pursuance of which he now put him to death.

“For nineteen years after this event Karim Khan ruled λvith the title of wakíl, or regent, over the whole of Persia, excepting the province of Khurásán. He made Shiráz the seat of his government, and by means of his brothers put down every attempt which was made to subvert his authority. The rule of the great Zend chief was just and mild, and he is on the whole, considering his education and the circumstances under which he was placed, one of the most faultless characters to be met with in Persian history.”

Karim Khán died at his capital and favourite residence in 1779 in the twentieth year of his reign, and, it is said, in the eightieth of his age. He built the great bazaar of Shíráz, otherwise embellishing and improving the city, had a tomb constructed over the remains of Háfiz, and repaired the “túrbat” at the grave of Sa'di, outside the walls. He encouraged commerce and agriculture, gave much attention to the state of affairs along the shores of the Persian Gulf, and carefully studied the welfare of the Armenian community settled in his dominions. In his time the British factory was removed from Gombroon to Bushahr (Bushire). It would be pleasant, if space allowed, to repeat the anecdotes creditable to his memory; for it is unusual to find so worthy a figure in Oriental annals.

On Karim’s death a new period of anarchy supervened. His brother, Zaki, a cruel and vindictive chief, and withal a pardoned rebel—for, when governor of Ispahan, he had revolted against Karim—assumed the government. At the same time he proclaimed Abú Ί-Fath Khán, second son of the deceased monarch, and his brother Muhammad 'Alí, joint-successors to the throne. The seizure of the citadel at Shíráz by the adherents of the former, among whom -were the more influential of the Zends, may have induced him to adopt this measure as one of prudent conciliation. But the garrison held out, and, to avoid a protracted siege, he had recourse to treachery. The suspicious nobles were solemnly adjured to trust themselves to his keeping, under promise of forgiveness. They believed his professions, tendered their submission, and were cruelly butchered. Zaki did not long enjoy the fruits of his perfidious dealing. The death of Karim Khán had raised two formidable adversaries to mar his peace, who could not fail to bring on a dénoûcment of some kind seriously affecting his interests.

Agha Muhammad, son of Muhammad Hasan, the Kajár chief of Astrábád, a prisoner at large in Shíráz, was in the environs of that city awaiting intelligence of the old king’s decease, and, hearing it, instantly escaped to Mazandaran, there to gather his tribesmen together and put himself in a condition to compete for the crown of Persia. Taken prisoner by Nádir and barbarously mutilated by 'Adil Sháh, he had afterwards found means to rejoin his people, but had surrendered himself to Karim Khán when his father was killed in battle. On the other hand, Sádik, brother to Zaki, who had won considerable and deserved repute by the capture of Basrah from the Turkish governor, abandoned his hold of the conquered town on hearing of the death of Karim, and appeared with his army before Shíráz. To provide against the intended action of the first, Zaki detached his nephew, 'Alí Murád, at the head of his best troops to proceed with all speed to the north; and, as to the second, the seizure of such families of Sádik’s followers as were then within the walls of the town, and other violent measures, struck such dismay into the hearts of the besieging soldiers that they dispersed and abandoned their leader to his fate. From Karman, however, where he found an asylum, the latter addressed an urgent appeal for assistance to 'Alí Murád. This chief, encamped at Tehran when the communication reached him, submitted the matter to his men, who decided against Zaki, but put forward their own captain as the only master they would acknowledge. 'Alí Murád, leaving the pursuit of Agha Muhammad, then returned to Ispahan, where he was received with satisfaction, on the declaration that his one object was to restore to his lawful inheritance the eldest son of Karim Khán, whom Zaki had set aside in favour of a younger brother. The sequel is full of dramatic interest. Zaki, enraged at his nephew’s desertion, marched out of Shíráz towards Ispahan. On his way he came to the town of Yezdikhast,—a singular place, steep and rugged, something like a section, or three upper stories, of the old town of Edinburgh set upon a natural foundation of crumbling stone. It comes upon the traveller as an abrupt elevation in a dreary vale, and the surrounding scenery savours of the weird and romantic. Here he demanded a sum of money from the inhabitants, claiming it as part of secreted revenue; the demand was refused, and eighteen of the head men were thrown down the precipice beneath his window · a “sáiyid,” or holy man, was the next victim, and his wife and daughter were to be given over to the soldiery, when a suddenly-formed conspiracy took effect, and Zaki’s own life was taken in retribution for his guilt (1779).

When intelligence of these events reached Karman, Sádik Khán hastened to Shíráz, proclaimed himself king in place of Abú Ί-Fath Khán, whom he declared incompetent to reign owing to dissipation and indolence, and put out the eyes of the young prince. He despatched his son Ji'afir to assume the government of Ispahan, and watch the movements of 'Alí Murád, who appears to have been then absent from that city; and he gave a younger son, 'Alí Naki, command of an army in the field. A campaign ensued with success from time to time on either side, but ending in the capture of Shíráz and assumption of sovereignty by 'Alí Murád, who caused Sádik Khán to be put to death.
[9:18:645]

From this period up to the accession of Agha Muhammad Khán the summarized history of Markham will supply the principal facts required.

'Alí Murád reigned over Persia until 1785, and carried on a successful war with Agha Muhammad in Mazandaran, defeating him in several engagements, and occupying Tehran and Sari. He died on his way from the former place to Ispahan, and was succeeded by Ji'afir, son of Sádik,^[357. A five days’ usurpation of Bakir Khán, governor of Ispahan, is not taken into account.] who reigned at Shíráz, assisted in the government by an able but unprincipled “kalántar,” or head magistrate, named Hajji Ibrahim. This ruler was poisoned by the agency of conspirators, one of whom, Sáiyid Murád, succeeded to the throne. Hajji Ibráhím, however, contriving to maintain the loyalty of the citizens towards the Zend reigning family, the usurper was killed, and Lutf 'Alí Khán, son of Ji'afir, proclaimed king. He had hastened to Shíráz on hearing of his father’s death and received a warm welcome from the inhabitants. Hajji Ibráhím became his chief adviser, and a new minister was found for him in Mirza Husain Shírází. At the time of his accession Lutf 'Alí Khán was only in his twentieth year, very handsome, tall, graceful, and an excellent horseman. To his fearless bravery and indomitable perseverance he united the nobler virtues of generosity and magnanimity. He formed many enduring friendships; and, though false-hearted traitors forsook him in the hour of adversity, others loyally stood by him to the last. While differing widely in character, he was a worthy successor of Karim Khán, the great founder of the Zend dynasty. Lutf 'Alí Khán had not been many months on the throne when Agha Muhammad advanced to attack him, and invested the city of Shíráz, but retreated soon afterwards to Tehran, which he had made the capital of his dominions. The young king then enjoyed a short period of peace. Afterwards, in the year 1790, he collected his forces and marched against the Kajárs, in the direction of Ispahan. But Hajji Ibráhím had been intriguing against his kind young sovereign, to whose family he owed everything, not only with his officers and soldiers but also with Agha Muhammad, the chief of the Kajárs, and arch-enemy of the Zends. Lutf 'Alí Khán was suddenly deserted by the whole of his army, except seventy faithful followers; and when he retreated to Shíráz he found the gates closed against him by Hajji Ibráhím, who held the city for the Kajár chief. Thence falling back upon Bushahr, he found that the shaikh of that town had also betrayed him. Surrounded by treason on every side, basely deserted alike by his dearest friends and by those who had been raised’from the dust by his family, yet, still undaunted by the black clouds that gathered round him, with his little band he boldly attacked and routed the chief of Bushahr and blockaded the city of Shíráz. His unconquerable valour gained him many followers, and he defeated an army sent against him by the Kajárs in 1792.

Agha Muhammad then advanced in person against his gallant young rival. He encamped with an army of 30,000 men on the plain of Mardàsht, near Shíráz. Lutf 'Alí Khán, in the dead of night, suddenly attacked the camp of his enemy with only a few hundred followers. The Kajárs were completely routed and thrown into confusion; but Agha Muhammad, with extraordinary presence of mind, remained in his tent, and at the first appearance of dawn his “muazzin,” or public crier, was ordered to call the faithful to morning prayer as usual. Astonished at this, the few Zend cavaliers, thinking that the whole army of Kajárs had returned, fled with precipitation, leaving the field in possession of Agha Muhammad. The successful Kajár then entered Shíráz, and promoted the traitor Hajji Ibráhím to be his wazír. Lutf 'Alí Khán took refuge with the hospitable chief of Tabas in the heart of Khurásan, where he succeeded in collecting a few followers; but, advancing into Fárs, he was again defeated, and forced to take refuge at Kandahar.

In 1794, however, the undaunted prince once more crossed the Persian frontier, determined to make a last effort, and either regain his throne or die in the attempt. He occupied the city of Karman, then a flourishing commercial town, half-way between the Persian Gulf and the province of Khurásan. It had a very fine bazaar and was well fortified. Agha Muhammad besieged it with a large army in 1795, and, after a stout resistance, the gates were opened through treachery. For three hours the gallant young warrior fought in the streets with determined valour, but in vain. When he saw that all hope was gone he spurred his faithful horse against the ranks of the enemy and, with only three followers, fought his way through the Kajár host and escaped to Bam-Narmashir, the most eastern district of the province of Karman on the borders of Sístan.

Furious at the escape of his rival, the savage conqueror ordered a general massacre; 20,000 women and children were sold into slavery, and 70,000 eyes of the inhabitants of Karman were brought to Agha Muhammad on a platter. The monster counted them with the point of his dagger, then, turning to his minister, he exclaimed, “If one had been wanting I would have made up the number with your own eyes.” Karman has never fully recovered from the effects of this fiend’s atrocities.

Lutf 'Alí Khán took refuge in the town of Bam; but the governor of Narmashir, anxious to propitiate the conqueror, basely surrounded him as he was mounting his faithful horse Kúran to seek a more secure asylum. The young prince fought bravely; but, being badly wounded and overpowered by numbers, he was secured and sent to the camp of the Kajár chief. The spot where he was seized at Bam, when mounting his horse, was marked by a pyramid, formed, by order of his revengeful enemy, of the skulls of the most faithful of his adherents. The most hideous indignities and atrocities were committed upon his person by the cruel Kajár, in whose breast not one spark of generous or humane feeling had ever found a place. Finally, the last reigning prince of the house of Zend was sent to Tehran and murdered, when only in his twentysixth year. Every member of his family and every friend was ordered to be massacred by Agha Muhammad; and the successful but guilty miscreant thus founded the dynasty of the Kajárs at the price of all the best and noblest blood of Iran.

The Zend is said to be a branch of the Lak tribe, dating from the time of the Kaianian kings, and claims to have been charged with the care of the Ze,n<TAvesta by Zoroaster himself.^[358. Markham. Morier says of Karim Khán’s family, “it was a low branch of an obscure tribe in Kurdistán.”] The tree attached to Markham’s chapter on the dynasty contains the names of eight members of the family only, i.e., four brothers, one of whom had a son, grandson, and great-grandson, and one a son. Four of the eight were murdered, one was blinded, and one cruelly mutilated. In one case a brother murdered a brother, in another an uncle blinded his nephew.

Kajár Dynasty. —Agha Muhammad was undoubtedly one of the most cruel and vindictive despots that ever disgraced a throne. But he was not without care for the honour of his empire in the eyes of Europe and the outer world, and his early career in Mazandaran gave him a deeply-rooted mistrust of Russia, with the officers of which power he was in constant contact. The following story, told by Forster,^[359. Journey from Bengal to England (1798), vol. ii. p. 201; see also Markham, pp. 341, 342.] and varied by a later writer, is characteristic. A party of Russians having obtained permission to build a “counting-house” at Ashraf, in the bay of that name, erected instead a fort with eighteen guns. Agha Muhammad, learning the particulars, visited the spot, expressed great pleasure at the work done, invited the officers to dine with him, imprisoned them, and only spared their lives when they had removed the whole of the cannon and razed the fort to the ground. As this occurrence must have taken place about 1782, when he was engaged in family feuds, and the sovereign power was vested in the hands of 'Alí Murád, it may be received as an illustration not only of his patriotism but of the independent action he was ever ready to exercise when opportunity offered.

Forster was travelling homeward by the southern shores of the Caspian in January 1784, and from him we gather many interesting details of the locality and period. He calls Agha Muhammad chief of Mazandaran, as also of Astrábád and “some districts situate in Khurasan,” and describes his tribe, the Kajár, to be, like the Indian Rajput, usually devoted to the profession of arms. Whatever hold his father may have had on Gílan, it is certain that this province was not then in the son’s possession, for his brother, Ji'afir Kúlí, governor of Balfrush (Balfroosh), had made a recent incursion into it and driven Hidáiyat Khán, its ruler, from Rasht to Enzali, and Agha Muhammad was himself meditating another attack on the same quarter. The latter’s palace was at Sari, then a small and partly fortified town, thickly inhabited, and with a plentifully-supplied market. As “the most powerful chief in Persia” since the death of Karim Khán, the Russians were seeking to put their yoke upon him, and he was naturally averse to the infliction. It is not clear, however, from the context [9:18:646] what Forster means when he writes that Agha Muhammad is “the only Persian chief bordering on the Caspian Sea whom the empire of Russia has yet made tributary, or rendered subservient to its policy.”

As Agha Muhammad’s power increased, his dislike and jealousy of the Muscovite assumed a more practical shape. His victory over Lutf 'Alí was immediately followed by an expedition into Georgia. After the death of Nádir the wálí or prime ruler of that country had looked around him for the safest and surest means of shaking off the offensive yoke of Persia; and in course of time an opportunity had offered of a promising kind. In 1783, when the strength of the Persian monarchy was concentrated upon Ispahan and Shíráz, the Georgian czar Heraclius entered into an agreement with the empress Catherine by which all connexion with the sháh was disavowed, and a quasi-vassalage to Russia substituted,—the said empire extending her aegis of protection over her new ally. Agha Muhammad now demanded that Heraclius should return to his position of tributary and vassal to Persia, and, as his demand was rejected, prepared for war. Dividing an army of 60,000 men into three corps, he sent one of these into Daghistan, another was to attack Erivan, and with the third he himself laid siege to Shishah in the province of Karabagh. The stubborn resistance offered at the last-named place caused him to leave there a small investing force only, and to move on with the remainder of his soldiers to join the corps Tannée at Erivan. Here, again, the difficulties presented caused him to repeat the same process and to effect a junction with his first corps at Ganja, the modern Elisabethpol. At this place he encountered the Georgian army under Heraclius, defeated it, and marched upon Tiflis, which he pillaged, massacring and enslaving^[360. Lady Sheil says (1849): “I saw a few of these unhappy captives, who all had to embrace Mahommedanism, and many of whom had risen to the highest stations, just as the Circassian slaves in Constantinople.”] the inhabitants. Then he returned triumphant to Tehran, where (or at Ardabil on the way) he was publicly crowned sháh of Persia. Erivan surrendered, but Shishah continued to hold out. These proceedings caused Russia to enter the field. Darband was taken possession of by Imhoff, Bákú and Shumakhi were occupied, and Gílan was threatened. The death of the empress, however, caused the issue of an order to retire, and Darband and Bákú remained the only trophies of the campaign.

In the meantime Agha Muhammad’s attention had been called away to the east. Khurásan could hardly be called an integral part of the sháh’s kingdom so long as it was under even the nominal rule of the blind grandson of Nádir. But the eastern division of the province and its outlying parts were actually in the hands of the Afghans, and Mashhad was not Persian in 1796 in the sense that Dehli was British at the outbreak of the Indian mutiny. Sháh Rukh held his position, such as it was, rather under Ahmad Sháh and his successors in Afghanistan than under any other sovereign power. Agha Muhammad determined to restore the whole province to Persia, and, after a brief residence in Tehran on his return from the, Georgian expedition, he set out for Mashhad. It is important to note that on the occasion of his coronation he had girded on the sabre consecrated at the tomb of the founder of the ⅛afawis,—thus openly pledging himself to support the Shí'ah faith.

But there had been continual dissatisfaction in the capital of Khurásan, and there had been constant inroads upon it from without, which the powerless royal puppet was unable to prevent. His popularity was real, but wholly wanting in political vigour. It never seemed to have effect outside the limited sphere of personal sympathy and regard. Owing to the frequent revolutions in the holy city the generals of Tímúr Sháh, king of the Afghans, had made three expeditions on Sháh Rukh’s behalf. Mashhad had been taken and retaken as though he were not a resident in it, much less its de jure king. Moreover, his two sons Nádir Mirza and Wálí Ni'amat had been long waging, one with the other, a predatory war, and the former was practically in 1796 the actual ruler of the place. Three years before Tímúr had died, and his third son, Zaman Sháh, by the intrigues of an influential sardár, Paiyanda Khán, had been proclaimed his successor at Kabul.

Agha Muhammad’s entry into Mashhad was effected without a struggle on the part of those in possession. The Kajár sháh walked on foot to the tomb of Imám Riza, before which he knelt and kissed the ground in token of devotion, and was recognized as a Shí'ah of Shiahs. Sháh Rukh submissively followed in his train. Then began the last act of the local tragedy. The blind king’s gradual revelation, under horrible torture,’ of the place of concealment of his several jewels and treasures, and his deportation and death (of the injuries thus received, at Damaghan, en route to Mazandaran), must be classed among the darkest records of Oriental history.

From Mashhad Agha Muhammad sent an envoy to Zaman Sháh, asking for the cession of Balkh, and explaining his invasion of Khurásan; but the Afghan monarch was too perplexed with the troubles in his own country and his own insecure position to do more than send an unmeaning reply. It is not shown what was the understood boundary between the two countries at this particular period; but Watson states that on the sháh’s departure he had received the submission of the whole of Khurásan, and left in Mashhad a garrison of 12,000 men.

Agha Muhammad had now fairly established his capital at Tehran. On his return thither in September 1796 he dismissed his troops for the winter, directing their reassembly in the following spring. The reinvasion by Russia of the provinces and districts he had recently wrested from her west of the Caspian had made great progress, but the circumstance does not seem to have changed his plans for the army. Olivier, who had in those days come to the Persian court on a commercial and political mission from the French republic, and whose book is quoted by Watson, expressed his surprise to the prime minister that, while his majesty thought it necessary to strangle some twenty-seven Russian sailors sent in as prisoners, he took no immediate measures to check the Muscovite forces in the field. The reply was that there was no hurry in the matter. Although, when the spring arrived and the sháh led his forces to the Arras, the Russians had, it is true, retreated, yet territory had been regained by them as far south as the Talish. Agha Muhammad had now arrived at the close of his career. He was enabled, with some difficulty, to get his troops across the river, and take possession of Shishah, which had given them so much trouble a year or two before. There, in camp, he was murdered (1797) by his own personal attendants,— men who, singularly enough, were under sentence of death, but allowed to be at large. He was then fifty-seven years of age, and had ruled over part of Persia for more than eighteen years,—over the kingdom generally for about three years, and from his coronation for about one year only.

The brutal treatment he had experienced in boyhood under the orders of 'Adil Sháh, Nádir’s wretched nephew, and the opprobrious name of “eunuch” which attached to him, and with which he was taunted by his enemies, no doubt contributed to embitter his nature. His vindictiveness and inhumanity were notorious, and exemplified at almost every period of his life. On the other hand, his contempt of luxury and frugality of diet, his avoidance [9:18:647] of hyperbole and dislike of excessive ceremony, his protection to commerce and consideration for his soldiers, the reluctance with which he assumed the crown almost at the close of his reign, his positive refusal to wear any royal headgear but the small circular pearl-adorned diadem in which he is commonly represented by the native painter,—all these would have been praiseworthy in another man; but the fearful weight of evil on the other side of the scales made them of comparatively small consideration, and on his death the memory of his atrocious tyranny alone survived. Those who have seen his portrait once will recognize the face wherever presented. “Beardless and shrivelled,” writes Sir John Malcolm, “it resembled that of an aged and wrinkled woman, and the expression of his countenance, at no time pleasant, was horrible when clouded, as it very often was, with indignation. He was sensible of this, and could not bear that any one should look at him.”

Agha Muhammad had made up his mind that he should be succeeded by his nephew Fath 'Alí Sháh, son of his full brother, Husain Kúlí Khán, and governor of Fárs, a young prince with whom he had always been on good terms, and to whom he had proved himself exceptionally well disposed. There was a short interval of confusion after the murder. The remains of the sovereign were exposed to insult, the army was disturbed, the recently-captured fort on the left bank of the Arras was abandoned; but the wisdom and resolution of the minister, Hajji Ibráhím, and of Mirza Muhammad Khán Kajár, a high functionary, prevailed to secure order and acceptance of the duly-appointed heir. The first, proclaiming his own allegiance, put himself at the head of a large body of troops and marched towards the capital. The second closed the gates of Tehran to all comers until Fath 'Alí Sháh came himself from Shíráz. Though instantly proclaimed on arrival, the new monarch was not crowned until the spring of the following year (1798).

The so-called rebellions which followed were many, but not of any magnitude. Such as belong to local history are three in number, i.e., that of Sádik Khán Shakáki, the general whose possession of the crown jewels enabled him, after the defeat of his army at Kazvín, to secure his personal safety and obtain a government; of Husain Kúlí Khán, the sháh’s brother, which was compromised by the mother’s intervention; and of Muhammad, son of Zaki Khán, Zend, who was defeated on more than one occasion in battle, and fled into Turkish territory. There may have been other names mixed up with these, but of aiders and abettors rather than principals. Later, Sádik Khán, having again incurred the royal displeasure, was seized, confined, and mercilessly bricked up in his dungeon to die of starvation.

Another adversary presented himself in the person of Nádir Mirza, son of Sháh Rukh, who, when Agha Muhammad appeared before Mashhad, had taken refuge with the Afghans. This prince, hearing of the death of his father’s destroyer, gathered around him a military force and made a show of independence. Fath 'Alí sent to warn him of the consequences of his act, but without the desired effect. Finally, he advanced into Khurásan with an army which appears to have met with no opposition save at Níshápúr and Túrbat, both of which places were taken, and when it reached Mashhad Nádir Mirza tendered his submission, which was accepted. Peace having been further cemented by an alliance between a Kajár general and the prince’s daughter, the sháh returned to Tehran.

Now that the narrative of Persian kings has been brought up to the period of the consolidation of the Kajár dynasty and commencement of the 19th century, there remains but to summarize the principal events in the reigns of Fath 'Alí Sháh and his immediate successors, Muhammad Sháh and Nasru ’ d-I)in Sháh.

Fath 'Alí Sháh came to the throne at about thirty-two years of age, and died at sixty-eight, after a reign of thirty-six years. The period was an eventful one. It was that of George III., George IV., and William IV. in England, of Napoleon I. from first consul to emperor, of the restoration of the Bourbon kings and the interposition of the house of Orleans, in France. The sons of Paul, Alexander and Nicholas, were emperors of Russia; and, except for the last few years of Salim II., the second Mahmúd ruled over the Turkish dominions. No other European nations had any direct concern with Persia. In Afghanistan it was the epoch of the revolution which broke up its short-lived unity as a kingdom. The struggles of Mahmúd Sháh and Shuj'au ’ 1-Mulk enabled them to be quasi-sovereigns for a time; but Kabul was divided from Kandahar, and Kandahar from Herat, andthe work of Ahmad Abdáli was all undone. Among the governors-general of India in those days are the distinguished names of Wellesley, Cornwallis, Hastings, and William Bentinck.

Persia’s great aim was to recover in the north-west, as in the northeast of her empire, the geographical limits obtained for her by the Safawí kings; and this was no easy matter when she had to contend with a strong European power whose territorial limits touched her own. Fath 'Alí Sháh undertook, at the outset of his reign, a contest with Russia on the western side of the Caspian, which became constant and harassing warfare. Georgia was, clearly, not to revert to a Muhammadan suzerain. In 1800 its czar, George, son and successor of Heraclius, notwithstanding his former professions of allegiance to the sháh, renounced his crown in favour of the Russian emperor. His brother Alexander indignantly repudiated the act and resisted its fulfilment, but he was defeated by General Lazeroff on the banks of the Lora. Persia then re-entered the field. Among the more notable occurrences which followed were a three days’ battle, fought near Etchmiadzin near Erivan, between the crown prince, 'Abbás Mirza, and General Zizianoff, in which the Persians suffered much from the enemy’s artillery, but would not admit they were defeated; unsuccessful attempts on the part of the Russian commander to get possession of Erivan; and a surprise, in camp, of the sháh’s forces, which caused them to disperse, and necessitated the king’s own presence with reinforcements. On the latter occasion the sháh is credited with gallantly swimming his horse across the Arras, and setting an example of energy and valour. In the following year 'Abbás Mirza advanced upon Shishah, the chief of which place and of the Karabagh, though an old foe to Agha Muhammad, had declared for Russia; much fighting ensued, and Erivan was formally taken possession of in the name of the sháh. The Russians, moreover, made a futile attempt on Gílan by landing troops at Enzali, which returned to Bákú, where Zizianoff fell a victim to the treachery of the Persian governor. Somewhat later Ibráhím Khalil of Shishah, repenting of his Russophilism, determined to deliver up the Muscovite garrison at that place, but his plans were betrayed, and he and his relatives put to death. Reprisals and engagements followed with varied success; and the crown prince of Persia, after a demonstration in Shirwan, returned to Tabriz. He had practically made no progress; yet Russia, in securing possession of Darband, Bákú, Shirwan, Sheki, Ganja, the Talish, and Moghan, was probably indebted to gold as well as to the force of arms. At the same time Persia would not listen to the overtures of peace made to her by the governor-general who had succeeded Zizianoff.

Relations had now commenced with England and British India. A certain Mahdi 'Alí Khán had landed at Bushahr, entrusted by the governor of Bombay with a letter to the sháh. His mission had reference to the politics of Afghanistan, and appears to have been fairly successful; but he was followed shortly by an English envoy from the governor-general, Captain Malcolm of the Madras army. He had not only to talk about the Afghans but about the French also, and the trade of the Persian Gulf. The results were a political and commercial treaty, and a return mission to India from Fath 'Alí Sháh. To him France next sent her message. In 1801 an American merchant from Baghdád had appeared as the bearer of credentials from Napoleon, but his mission was mistrusted and came to nothing. Some five years afterwards Jaubert, after detention and imprisonment on the road, arrived at Tehran and went back to Europe with a duly-accredited Persian ambassador, who concluded a treaty with the French emperor at Finkenstein. On the return of the Persian diplomatist, a mission of many officers under General Gardanne to instruct and drill the local army was sent from France to Persia. Hence arose the counter-mission of Sir Harford Jones from the British Government, which, on arrival at Bombay in April 1808, found that it had been anticipated by a previously-sent mission from the governor-general of India, under Malcolm again, then holding the rank of brigadier-general.

The home mission, however, proceeded to Bushahr, and Malcolm’s return thence to India, from pressure of circumstances, enabled Sir Harford to move on and reach the capital in February 1809. A few days before his entry General Gardanne had been dismissed, as the peace of Tilsit debarred France from aiding the sháh against Russia. However open to criticism may have been the after-conduct of the British diplomatist, his diplomacy was so far successful that he [9:18:648] concluded a treaty with Persia the month after his arrival at the capital; but the Government of India were not content to leave matters in his hands: notwithstanding the anomaly of a double mission, Malcolm was in 1810 again despatched as their own particular envoy. He brought with him Captains Lindsay and Christie to assist the Persians in the war, and presented the sháh with some serviceable field-pieces; but there was little occasion for the exercise of his diplomatic ability save in his non-official intercourse with the people, and here he availed himself of it to the great advantage of himself and his country.^[361. The “wakílu ’l-mulk,” governor of Karman, told Colonel Goldstnid, when his guest in 1866, that “his father had been Sir John Malcolm’s Mihmandár. There never was such a man as ‘ Malcolm Sahib.’ Not only was he generous on the part of his government, but with his own money also” (Telegraph and Travel, p. 585). v y *] He was welcomed by the sháh in camp at Ujani, and took leave a month afterwards to return via Baghdád and Basrah to India. The next year Sir Harford Jones was relieved as envoy by Sir Gore Ouseley.

Meanwhile hostilities had been resumed with Russia: the crown prince vainly attempted to penetrate Georgia; and one or two engagements ensued with more or less assertion of success on either side. In 1812 the British envoy used his good offices for the restoration of peace between the belligerents, and a Russian officer of high rank was sent to the Persian camp to propose the appointment of deputies. But there was no possibility of agreement, and the endeavour failed. To add to the Persian difficulty, it so happened that in July of this year a treaty was concluded between England and Russia “for re-establishing the relations of amity and good understanding between the two kingdoms respectively”; and this circumstance caused the envoy to direct that British officers should take no further part in Russo-Persian military operations. Christie and Lindsay, however, resolved to remain at their own risk, and advanced with the Persian army to the Arras. On the 31st October the force was surprised by an attack of the enemy, and retreated; the next night they were again attacked and routed at Aslandúz. Christie fell bravely fighting at the head of his brigade; Lindsay saved two of his nine guns; but neither of the two Englishmen was responsible for the want of proper disposition of the troops which mainly caused the disaster. Lankuran was taken by Persia, but retaken by Russia during the next three months; and on the 13th October 1813, through Sir Gore Ouseley’s intervention, the treaty of Gulistan put an end to the war. Persia formally ceded Georgia and the seven provinces before named, with Karabagh.

On the death of the emperor Alexander in December 1825 Prince MenschikofΓ was sent to Tehran to settle a dispute which had arisen between the two Governments regarding the prescribed frontier. But, as the claim of Persia to a particular district then occupied by Russia could not be admitted, the special envoy was given his congé, and war was recommenced. The chief of Talish struck the first blow, and drove the enemy from Lankuran. The Persians then carried all before them; and the hereditary chiefs of Shirwan, Sheki, and. Bákú returned from exile to co-operate with the sháh’s general in the south. In the course of three weeks the only advanced post held by the governor-general of the Caucasus was the obstinate little fortress of Shishah. But before long all was again changed. Hearing that a Russian force of some 9000 men was concentrated at Tiflis, Muhammad Mirza, son of the crown prince, advanced to meet them on the banks of the Zezam. He was defeated; and his father, seeking to repair the loss, was routed more seriously still at Ganja. The sháh made great efforts to renew the war; but divisions took place in his son’s camp, not conducive to successful operations, and new proposals of peace were made. Ardabil, and even Tabriz, had been threatened, and, although the threat had been rather signified than expressed, the presence of Russian troops south of the Arras was calculated to strike terror’ in Adarbaijan. But Russia demanded Erivan and Nakhtchivan (Nakhichevan) as well as the cost of the war; and in 1827 the campaign was reopened. Briefly, after successive gains and losses, not only Erivan was taken from Persia but Tabriz also, and finally, through the intervention of Sir John Macdonald, the English envoy, a new treaty was concluded at Turkmánchái, laying down the boundary between Russia and Persia very much as it has been formed in 1884. Among the hard conditions for the latter country were the cession in perpetuity of the khanates of Erivan and Nakhtchivan, the inability to have an armed vessel in the Caspian, and the payment of a λvar indemnity of some £3,000,000.

After Russia, the neighbouring state next in importance to the wellbeing of Persia was Turkey, with whom she was united on the west by a common Jine of frontier. Fath 'Alí Sháh was fortunate in having had but one war with the sultan during his whole reign, and that one of no duration. Salim had not scrupled, it is true, in 1804 and 1805, to allow the Russians to make free use of the south-eastern coasts of the Black Sea, to facilitate operations against the sháh’s troops; and there had been a passage of arms between the king’s eldest son, Muhammad 'Alí Mirza, and Sulaiman Pasha, son-in-law of the governor-general of Baghdád, which is locally credited as a battle won by the former. But there was no open rupture between the two sovereigns until 1821, when the frontier disputes and com plaints of Persian travellers, merchants, and pilgrims culminated in a declaration of war. This made 'Abbás Mirza at once seize upon the fortified places of Toprak KaΓah and Ak Sarai within the limits of the Ottoman empire, and, overcoming the insufficient force sent against him, he was further enabled to extend his inroads to Mush, Bitlis, and other known localities. The Turkish Government retaliated by a counter-invasion of the Persian frontier on the south. At that time the pasha of Baghdád was in command of the troops. He was defeated by Muhammad 'Alí Mirza, then prince-governor of Karmansháh, who drove his adversary back towards bis capital and advanced to its immediate environs. " Being attacked with cholera, however, the Persian commander recrossed the frontier, but only to succumb under the disease in the pass of Kirind. In the sequel a kind of desultory warfare appears to have been prosecuted on the Persian side of Kurdistan, and the sháh himself came down with an army to Hamadan. Cholera broke out in the royal camp and caused the troops to disperse.

In the north the progress of'Abbás Mirza was stopped at Baiyazid by a like deadly visitation; and a suspension of hostilities was agreed upon for the winter season. At the expiration of four months the sardár of Erivan took possession of a Turkish military station on the road to Arzrum (Erzeroum), and the crown prince marched upon that city at the head of 30,000 men. The Ottoman army which met him is said to have numbered some 52,000; but victory was on the side of their opponents. Whether the result was owing to the defection of 15,000 Kurds or not the evidence adduced is insufficient to decide. In the English records of the period it is stated that “the defeat of the Turks was complete; the greater part of their army fled in disorder from the field, abandoning all their tents and baggage, and fourteen pieces of artillery.” It is added: “the prince royal followed up his successes, and advanced within two days’ march of Arzrum, but the cholera morbus is said to have again broken out in his army, and in such a manner as effectually to arrest its further advance.”^[362. Annual Register, “History of Europe” (1822). There is a note in connexion with the text from which these extracts are taken, on the state of Anglo-Persian relations and the predominance of Russian influence at Tehran, well worthy the reader’s perusal.]

Profiting from this victory, 'Abbás Mirza repeated an offer of peace before made without avail to the pasha of Arzrum; and, in order to conciliate him more effectually, he retired within the old limits of the dominions of the sháh, his father. But more troubles arose at Baghdád, and other reasons intervened to protract negotiations for a year and a half. At length, in July 1823, the treaty of Arzrum closed the war between Turkey and Persia. It may be remarked that this document is sensible and business-like, and provides especially against a recurrence of the proved causes of war, such as interference in one another’s frontier districts, extorting taxes from Persian travellers or pilgrims, disrespect to the ladies of the royal harem and other ladies of rank proceeding to Mecca or Karbala (Kerbela), irregular levies of custom - duties, non-punishment of Kurdish depredators transgressing the boundary, and the like. Fath ’ Ali Sháh in it is styled “King of kings, the Sultan son of a Sultan— the Conqueror,” and Mahmúd II. is “Protector of the Faith, Guardian of the Holy Cities, Ruler by Sea and Land, the Sultan son of a Sultan —the Conqueror.”

With respect to the eastern boundaries of his kingdom, Fath 'Alí Sháh was fortunate in having to deal with a less dangerous neighbour than the Muscovite of persistent policy and the Turk of precarious friendship. The Afghan was neither a contemptible foe nor a sure ally, but he was not tainted with that fictitious civilization of semi-Oriental people which makes duplicity the essence of diplomatic intercourse. He had seen too little of Europeans to imitate them in their worst and weakest points; and, though equal to the Persian in physical force and prowess, he was his inferior in worldly knowledge and experience. Quite as dishonest as his neighbours and more treacherous than most, he had not the polished ingenuity to conceal his dishonesty and double-dealing. Moreover, the family divisions among the ruling houses of Afghanistan grew from day to day more destructive to that patriotism and sense of nationality which Ahmad Sháh had held out to his countrymen as the sole specifics for becoming a strong people.

The revolt of Nádir Mirza had, as before explained, drawn the sháh’s attention to Khurásan in the early part of his reign; but, although quiet had for the moment been restored at Mashhad by the presence of the royal camp, fresh grounds of complaint were urged against the rash but powerless prince, and recourse was had to extreme measures. Charged with the murder of a holy sáiyid, his hands were cut off and his tongue was plucked out, as part of the horrible punishment inflicted on him.

It does not appear that Nádir Mirza’s cause was ever seriously espoused by the Afghans, nor that Fath 'Alí Sháh’s claim to Mashhad, as belonging to the Persian crown, was actively resisted. But the large province of Khurásan, of which Mashhad was the capital, and which included Darahgáz and Kelat-i-Nádirí in the north and Káiyan in the south, had never been other than a nominal dependency of the crown since the death of Nádir; and in the autumn of 1830 [9:18:649] the sháh, under Russian advice, assembled a large force to bring into subjection all turbulent and refractory chiefs on the east of his kingdom. Yazd and Karman were the first points of attack; Khurásan was afterwards entered by Semnan, or the main road from Tehran. The expedition, led by 'Abbás Mirza, involved some hard fighting and much loss of life. A considerable extent of ground was traversed; several forts and places were captured, among them Kabushan and Sarakhs; and it may be concluded that the objects contemplated were more or less attained. An English officer, Colonel Shee, commanded what was called the “British detachment” which accompanied the prince. Thus far as regards Yazd, Karman, and Khurásan. It was otherwise with Herat.

Hajji Firúzu’d-Dín, son of Tímúr Sháh, reigned undisturbed in that city from 1800 to 1816. Since Fath 'Alí Sháh’s accession he and his brother Mahmud had been, as it were, under Persian protection; and, when the king retraced his steps homeward after his expedition to Mashhad, at the commencement of the century, it is supposed that he did so at the request of an ambassador from Zaman Sháh of Kabul. Persia claimed the principality of Herat as part of the empire of Nádir, but her pretensions had been satisfied by payments of tribute or evasive replies. Now, however, that she marched her army against the place, Firúzu , d-Din called in the aid of his brother Mahmud Sháh of Kabul, who sent to him the famous wazír, Fath Khan Bárakzái. The latter, intriguing on his own account, got possession of the town and citadel; he then sallied forth, engaged and defeated the Persian forces, and forced them to retire into their own country. There are various accounts of this action, and the Persian story is that the Afghans were defeated; but no one disputes the result, z.e., the retreat of the invading army. In 1824, on a solicitation from Mustafa Khán, who had got temporary hold of Herat, more troops were despatched thither, but, by the use of money or bribes, their departure was purchased. Some eight or nine years afterwards 'Abbás Mirza, when at the head of his army in Mashhad, invited Yar Muhammad Khán of Herat to discuss a settlement of differences between the two Governments. The meeting was unproductive of good. Again the Persian troops advanced to Herat itself under the command of Muhammad Mirza, son of 'Abbás; but the news of his father’s death caused the commander to break up his camp and return to Mashhad.

Sir Gore Ouseley returned to England in 1814, in which year Mr Ellis, assisted by Mr Morier—whose “Hajji Baba” is the unfailing proof of his ability and deep knowledge of Persian character —negotiated on the part of Great Britain the treaty of Tehran. England was to provide troops or a subsidy in the event of unprovoked invasion, while Persia was to attack the Afghans should they invade India. Captain Willock succeeded Mr Morier as charge d’affaires in 1815, and since that period Great Britain has always been represented at the Persian court. It was in Fath 'Alí Sháh’s reign that Henry Martyn was in Persia, and completed his able translation of the New Testament into the language of that country. He had met Malcolm and Mackintosh at Bombay, and Sir John had recommended him to Sir Gore Ouseley, to whose mission he officiated as chaplain prior to departure from Shíráz in 1812. Martyn died at Tokat in Asia Minor, on his homeward journey. Little more remains to be here narrated of the days of Fath 'Alí Sháh. Among the remarkable occurrences may be noted the murder at Tehran in 1828 of Μ. Grebayadoff, the Russian envoy, whose conduct in forcibly retaining two women of Erivan provoked the interference of the mullas and people. To repair the evil consequences of this act a conciliatory embassy, consisting of a young son of the crown prince and some high officers of the state, was despatched to St Petersburg. Shortly afterwards the alliance with Russia was strengthened, and that with England slackened in proportion. There were reasons why this should be the outcome of the previous situation, some of which will be self-evident to the reader of blue-books, while others will remain mere matters of opinion.

As an Oriental despot Fath 'Alí Sháh was neither cruel nor unjust, but acts of cruelty and injustice were committed under his sanction. The treatment of Nádir Mirza has been mentioned. That of the old minister, Hajji Ibráhím, was perhaps more barbarous still. His fondness for sport and his literary tastes gave him the capacity of suiting his conversation to visitors of different kinds; but the love of money was a drawback to the exercise of his sympathies, and the loss of territory to Russia, involving as it did loss of revenue, was not calculated to arouse any strong sentiment of friendship towards the czar’s European allies. Morier’s description of the king’s person was thus given in 1809.

“He is a man of pleasing manners and an agreeable countenance, with an aquiline nose, large eyes, and very arched eyebrows. His face is obscured by an immense beard and mustachios, which are kept very black; and it is only when he talks and smiles that his mouth is discovered. His voice has once been fine, and is still harmonious; though now hollow, and obviously that of a man who has led a free life. . . . He was seated on a species of throne called the takht-i-táùs, or the throne of the peacock, which is raised 3 feet from the ground, and appears an oblong square of 8 feet broad and 12 long, we could see the bust only of his majesty, as the rest of his body was hidden by an elevated railing, the upper work of the throne, at the corners of which were placed several ornaments of vases and toys. The back is much raised; on each side are two square pillars, on which are perched birds, probably intended for peacocks, studded with precious stones of every description, and holding each a ruby in their beak. The highest part of the throne is composed of an oval ornament of jewelry, from which emanate a great number of diamond rays.”

One passage may be added as not only significant of the individual monarch but also of the national character.

“When the audience was finished, the king desired one of his ministers to inquire from Ji ’ afir ’ Ali Khan (the English Agent) what the foreigners said of him, and whether they praised and admired his appearance.”

Fath 'Alí Sháh had a numerous family. Agreeably to the Persian custom, asserted by his predecessors, of nominating the heir-apparent from the sons of the sovereign without restriction to seniority, he had passed over the eldest, Muhammad 'Alí, in favour of a junior, 'Abbás; but, as the nominee died in the lifetime of his father, the old king had proclaimed Muhammad Mirza, the son of 'Abbás, and his own grandson, to be his successor. Why a younger son had been originally selected, to the prejudice of his elder brother, is differently stated by different writers. The true reason was probably the superior rank of bis mother. Markham’s estimate of the character of the crown prince, based upon conflicting evidence, but apparently correct, is that “he possessed enlightened views,” was “desirous of improving the condition of his country,” yet “was deficient in talent, rather weak-minded, and loved flattery.”

It is worthy of remark that the selection of Muhammad Mirza was made with the express concurrence of the British and Russian Governments, communicated to their respective representatives at the sháh’s court; and the British minister at St Petersburg was instructed to express to the Government of the czar the gratification of his own Government at finding that the two powers were “acting with regard to the affairs of Persia in the same spirit,” and were “equally animated by a sincere desire to maintain not only the internal tranquillity but also the independence and integrity of Persia.”^[363. Correspondence relating to Persia and Afghanistan, London, 1839.]

Muhammad Sháh was twenty-eight years old when he came to the throne in 1834. He died at the age of forty-two, after a reign of about thirteen and a half years. His accession was not publicly notified for some months after his grandfather’s death, for it was necessary to clear the way of all competitors, and there were two on this occasion,—one 'Alí Mirza, governor of Tehran, who actually assumed a royal title, and one Hasan 'Alí Mirza, governor of Shíráz. Owing to the steps taken by the British envoy, Sir John Campbell, assisted by Colonel Bethune, at the head of a considerable force, supplied with artillery, the opposition of the first was neutralized, and Muhammad Sháh, entering Tehran on 2d January, was proclaimed king on the 31st of the same month. It cost more time and trouble to bring the second to book. Hasan 'Alí, “farmán-farmá,” or commander-in-chief, and his brother and abettor, had an army at their disposal in Fárs. Sir Henry Lindsay Bethune marched his soldiers to Ispahan to be ready to meet them. An engagement which took place near Kumisháh, on the road between Ispahan and Shíráz, having been successful, the English commander pushed on to the latter town, where the two rebel princes were seized and imprisoned. Forwarded under escort to Tehran, they were, according to Watson, ordered to be sent on thence as state prisoners to Ardabil, but the farmán-farmá died on the way, and his brother was blinded before incarceration. Markham, however, states that both 'Alí Mirza and Hasan 'Alí were allowed to retire with a small pension, and that no atrocities stained the beginning of the reign of Muhammad Sháh. It is presumed that the fate of the prime minister, or “káim-makám,” who was strangled in prison, was no more than an ordinary execution of the law. This event, and the prevalence of plague and cholera at Tehran, marked somewhat gloomily the new monarch’s first year.

The selection of a premier was one of the first weighty questions for solution. A member of the royal family, the “asafu ’d-daulah,” governor of Khurásan, left his government to urge his candidature for the post. The king’s choice, however, fell on Hajji Mirza Aghási, a native of Erivan, who in former years, as tutor to the sons of 'Abbás Mirza, had gained a certain reputation for learning and a smattering of the occult sciences, but whose qualifications for statesmanship were craftiness and suspicion. Such a counsellor was hardly fitted for Muhammad Sháh, whose natural bigotry could scarcely fail to accept the short-sighted policy which the minister would be sure to advocate. As might have been anticipated, the hajji fell into the hands of Russia, represented by Count Simonich, who urged him to a fresh expedition into Khurásan and the siege of Herat. There was no doubt a plausible pretext for both proposals. The chiefs, reduced to temporary submission by 'Abbás Mirza, had again revolted; and Sháh Kamran, supported by his wazír, Yar Muhammad, had broken those engagements and pledges on the strength of which Fath 'Alí Sháh had withdrawn his troops. In addition to these causes of offence he had appropriated the province of Sístan, over which Persia had long professed to hold the rights of suzerainty. But the king’s ambition was to go farther than retaliation or chastisement. He refused to acknowledge any right to separate government whatever on the part of the Afghans.
[9:18:650]

and Kandahar and Ghazni were to be recovered, as belonging to the empire of the Safawí dynasty. The advice of the British envoy was dissuasive in this respect, and therefore distasteful.

Sir John Campbell, in less than a year after the sovereign’s installation, went home, and was succeeded as British envoy by Mr Henry Ellis. The change in personnel signified also a transfer of superintendence of the Persian legation, which passed from the Government in India to the authorities in England. In 1836, on the return home of Mr Ellis, Mr Μ‘Neill became charge d’affaires.

About this time the arrangements for the expedition were matured. It was to commence with a campaign against the Turkmans,—Herat being its later destination. The king would command in person, and the army would be formidable in numbers aud war material. Such counter-proposals as Mr Ellis had suggested for consideration, in his earnest endeavours to divert the sháh from his purpose, had been politely put aside, and the counsels of the war-party had prevailed. Should the main operations designed be successful, and Herat fall to Persia, it was impossible to foretell the result; and the case was now more than ever complicated by the action of the Bárakzái chiefs of Kandahar, who had sent a mission to Tehran to offer assistance against their Sáduzái rival at Herat. Fresh provocation had, moreover, been given to the shah’s Government by the rash and incapable Kamran.

About the close of the summer the force moved from Tehran. The royal camp was near Astrábád in November 1836. Food was scarce: barley sold for ten times the usual price, and wheat was not procurable for any money. The troops were dissatisfied, and, being kept without pay and on short rations, took to plundering. There had been operations on the banks of the Gurgan, and the Turkmans had been driven from one of their strongholds; but little or no progress had been made in the subjection of these marauders, and the Heratis had sent word that all they could do was to pay tribute, and, if that were insufficient, the sháh had better march to Herat. A military council was held at Shahrud, when it was decided to return to the capital and set out again in the spring. Accordingly the troops dispersed, and the sovereign’s presence at Tehran was taken advantage of by the British minister to renew his attempts in the cause of peace. But remonstrance was vain, and, although on the present occasion Count Simonich ostensibly aided Mr Μ‘Neill, no argument was of any avail to divert the monarch from his purpose. He again set out in the summer, and, invading the Herat territory in November 1837, began the siege on the 23d of that month.

Not until September in the following year did the Persian army withdraw from before the walls of the city; and then the movement only took place on the action of the British Government. Ordinary pressure and argument had failed. It had become necessary to use strong language, and to resort to strong measures, the purport of which could not be mistaken. Mr M‘Neill, who had joined the Persian camp on 6th April, left it again on 7th June. He had in this interval done all in his power to effect a reasonable agreement between the contending parties by personal communication with Afghans in Herat as well as with the sháh and his minister; but both in this respect and in the matter of a commercial treaty with England, then under negotiation, his efforts had been met with evasion and latent hostility, and this last feeling had been notably evinced in the seizure and violent treatment of a messenger bearing an official communication from a foreign Government to the British minister at Tehran. The Russian envoy, who had appeared among the tents of the besieging army almost simultaneously with his English colleague, no sooner found himself alone in his diplomacy than he resumed his aggressive counsels, and little more than a fortnight had elapsed since Mr M'NeilΓs departure when a vigorous assault, planned, it is asserted, by Count Simonich himself, was made upon Herat. The Persians attacked at five points, at one of which they would in all likelihood have been successful had not the Afghans been aided by Eldred Pottinger, a young Englishman, who with the science of an artillery officer combined a courage and determination which inevitably influenced his subordinates. Through his exertions the assailants were beaten back, as they were also independently at the other points noted. Still the garrison was disheartened; and, had not Colonel Stoddart’s arrival on 1 ltb August to threaten the sháh with British intervention put a stop to further action, there is no knowing what mischief might have resulted from the incompetence and intrigues of Kamran and his advisers. As it happened, Colonel Stoddart’s firm attitude and refusal to allow any but British mediators to decide the pending dispute won the day; and that officer was able to report that on 9th September Muhammad Sháh had “mounted his horse” and gone from before the walls of the beleaguered city.

The siege of Herat was the great event in the reign of Muhammad Sháh. It lasted for nearly ten months; and the story of its progress is a strange record of a desultory campaign in which intrigue and conspiracy were the continuously working agencies, while military action was spasmodic. The British expedition in support of Sháh Shuj'a, which may be called its natural consequence, involves a question foreign to the present narrative. Persia’s connexion with Afghanistan can only be partial, and confined to Herat, Kabul, Kandahar, or one section of the country only. A united Afghanistan would always be distasteful to her. ·

The remainder of the king’s reign was marked by new difficulties with the British Government; the rebellion of Agha Khán Mahláti, otherwise known as the chief of the Assassins; a new rupture with Turkey; the banishment of the asafu , d-daulah, governor of Khurasan, followed by the insurrection and defeat of his son; and the rise of the sect of the Bábís. The first of these only calls for any detailed account.

In the demands of the British Government was included the cession by Persia of places such as Ghurian, Farah, and Sabzawár, which had been taken during the war from the Afghans, as well as reparation for the violence offered to the courier of the British legation. The sháh, in ill-humour at his fruitless expedition to Herat, deferred compliance with these requisitions, and indeed sought to evade them altogether. Μ‘Neill gave a certain time for decision, at the end of which, no satisfactory reply having reached him, he broke off diplomatic relations, ordered the British officers lent to the sháh to proceed towards Baghdád en route to India, and retired to Arzrum with the members of his mission. On the Persian side, charges were made against M’Neill, and a special envoy, sent to England to support them, was instructed to represent the so-called injuries which British diplomatic action had inflicted on the sháh. An endeavour was at the same time made to interest the cabinets of Europe in influencing the British Government on behalf of Persia. The envoy managed to obtain an interview with the minister of foreign affairs in London, who, in July 1839, supplied him with a statement, fuller than before, of all English demands upon his country. Considerable delay ensued, but the outcome of the whole proceedings was not only acceptance but fulfilment of all the engagements contracted. In the meantime the island of Karak had been taken possession of by an expedition from India.

On 11th October 1841 a new mission arrived at Tehran from London, under Mr (now Sir) John M’Neill, to renew diplomatic relations. It was most cordially received by the sháh, and it need scarcely be added that, as one of its immediate results, Karak was evacuated by the British-Indian troops.

There had been a long diplomatic correspondence in Europe on the proceedings of Count Simonich and other Russian officers at Herat. Among the papers is a very important letter from Count Nesselrode to Count Pozzo di Borgo in which Russia declares herself to be the first to counsel the sháh to acquiesce in the demand made upon him, because she found “justice on the side of England” and “wrong on the side of Persia.” She withdrew her agent from Kandahar and would “not have with the Afghans any relations but those of commerce, and in no wise any political interests.” She recalled to the English cabinet her wishes before expressed.

“To re-establish promptly the relations of friendship between the courts of London and of Tehran; to put an end to the hostile measures adopted in the Persian Gulf; to abstain from disturbing the tranquillity of the people of the centre of Asia by nourishing their animosities; to be contented with competing in industry in those vast countries, but not to engage there in a struggle for political influence; to respect the independence of the intermediate countries which separate” her own from British territory. Such, it was emphatically stated, was “the system which England and Russia have a common interest invariably to pursue, in order to prevent the possibility of a conflict between these two great powers, which, that they may continue friends, require to remain each within its own limits, and not to advance against each other in the centre of Asia.”^[364. Correspondence relating to Persia and Afghanistan, London, 1839. The annexation of Sind and the Panjab will, it is presumed, be given as excuses for the partial absorption of Turkestan. But the cases are in no way analogous. The occupation by Russia of the Persian island of Ashuráda in the south-east corner of the Caspian followed the British reverses in Kabul of 1841.]

Agha Khán’s rebellion was fostered by the defection to his cause of a large portion of the force sent against him; but he yielded at last to the local authorities of Karman and fled the province and country. He afterwards resided many years at Bombay, where, while maintaining among natives a quasi-spiritual character, he is better known among Europeans for his doings on the turf.

The quarrel with Turkey, though specific in the case of individual actors, was generally about frontier relations and transgressions of the border. Eventually the matter was referred to an Anglo-Russian commission, of which Colonel Williams (since Sir Fenwick Williams of Kars) was president. A massacre of Persians at Karbala might have seriously complicated the dispute, but, after a first burst of indignation and call for vengeance, an expression of the regret of the Ottoman Government was accepted as a sufficient apology for the occurrence.

The rebellion of the asafu ’ d-daulah, maternal uncle of the sháh, was punished by exile, while his son, after giving trouble to his opponents, and once gaining a victory over them, took shelter with the Turkmans.

Sa'íd Muhammad 'Alí, founder of the Bábís, was born at Shíráz about 1810.^[365. Lady Sheiî. Gobineau says 1824.] Adopting a life of seclusion, and practising a kind of exaggerated Súfism, he followed for some time the calling of a dervish, and when at Kázimain near Baghdád he openly asserted his pretensions as a prophet. The Turkish authorities [9:18:651] would have put him to death, but the Persian consul, claiming him as a subject, saved his life, and sent him to his native place. Thenceforward his career is strange and adventurous; and even when he himself had been committed to prison his agents λvere employed in promulgating his doctrine, with sufficient success to occasion the issue of -a decree making it a capital crime to profess the tenets of Bábism. More will be said on the subject shortly.

Before closing the reign of Muhammad Sháh note should be taken of a prohibition to import African slaves into Persia, and a commercial treaty with England,—recorded by Watson as gratifying achievements of the period by British diplomatists. The French missions in which occur the names of MM. de Lavalette and de Sartiges were notable in their way, but somewhat barren of results.

In the autumn of 1848 the sháh was seized with the malady, or combination of maladies, which caused his death. Gout and erysipelas had, it is said,^[366. Watson.] ruined his constitution, and he died at his palace in Shamiran on 4th September. He was buried at Kúm, where is situated the shrine of Fátima, daughter of Imám Riza, by the side of his grandfather, Fath 'Alí, and other kings of Persia. In person he is described as short and fat, with an aquiline nose and agreeable countenance.^[367. Markham.]

On the occasion of his father’s death, Násru ’d-Dín Mirza, who had been proclaimed wálí 'ahd, or heir-apparent, some years before, was absent at Tabriz, the headquarters of his province of Adarbaijan. Colonel Farrant, then charge d’affaires on the part of the British Government, in the absence of Colonel Sheil, who had succeeded Sir John Μ‘Neill, had, in anticipation of the sháh’s decease and consequent trouble, sent a messenger to summon him instantly to Tehran. The British officer, moreover, associated himself with Prince Dolgorouki, the representative of Russia, to secure the young prince’s accession; and there was no doubt in the minds of the wiser lookers-on that, if the two diplomatists were really of one mind in the matter, they would attain their end in spite of all obstacles.

They did so after a time, and with the aid of the queen-mother, who, as president of the council, showed much judgment and capacity in conciliating adverse parties. But the six or seven weeks which passed between the death of the one king and the coronation of the other proved a disturbed interval, and full of stirring incident. 'Γhe old minister, Hajji Mirza Aghási, incurred the displeasure of the influential part of the community by shutting himself up in the royal palace with 1200 followers, and had to take refuge in the sanctuary of Sháh ‘Abdu Ί-'Azim near Tehran. On the other hand Mirza Agha Khán, a partisan of the asafu ’d-daulah, and himself an ex-minister of war, whom the hajji had caused to be banished, was welcomed back to the capital. At Ispahan, Shíráz, and Karman serious riots took place, which were with difficulty suppressed. λVhile revolution prevailed in the city, robbery was rife in the province of Yazd; and from Kazvín the son of 'Alí Mirza, otherwise called the “zillu ’s-sultan,” the prince - governor of Tehran, who disputed the succession of Muhammad Sháh, came forth to contest the crown with his cousin, the heir-apparent. The last-named incident soon came to an inglorious termination for its hero. But a more serious revolt was in full force at Mashhad when, on the 20th of October 1848, the young sháh entered his capital and was crowned at midnight king of Persia.

The chief events in the long reign of the present sháh, Násru ’d-Dín, may be reviewed under four heads: (1) the insurrection in Khurásan, (2) the insurrection of the Bábís, (3) the fall of the amíru ’n-nizám, and (4) the war with England.

It has been stated that the asafu ’ d - daulah was a competitor with Hajji Mirza Aghási for the post of premier in the cabinet of Muhammad Sháh, that he was afterwards, in the same reign, exiled for rising in rebellion, and that his son, the salár, took shelter with the Turkmans. Some four months prior to the late king’s decease the latter chief had reappeared in arms against his authority; he had gained possession of Mashhad itself, driving the prince-governor, Hamza Mirza, into the citadel; and so firm was his attitude that Yar Muhammad of Herat, who had come to help the Government officials, had retired after a fruitless co-operation, drawing away the prince - governor also. The salár now defied Murád Mirza, Násru ’d-Dín’s uncle, who was besieging the city; he found secret means of obtaining money and supplies; and, by occasionally repelling an assault or effecting a skilful sortie, he kept up a prestige of power, which, added to his personal popularity, commanded the sympathy and good wishes of the multitude. In April 1850, after a siege of more than eighteen months, fortune turned against the bold insurgent, and negotiations were opened between the citizens and besiegers for the surrender of the town and citadel. Treachery may have had to do with the result, for when the sháh’s troops entered the holy city the salár sought refuge in the mosque of Imám Riza, and was forcibly expelled. He and his brother were seized and put to death, the instrument used being, according to Watson, “the bowstring of Eastern story.” The conqueror of Mashhad, Murád Mirza, became afterwards himself the prince-governor of Khurásan.

Lady Sheil has written a graphic account of the death of SaTd Muhammad 'Alí. After repeated arrests and warnings to no purpose the spread of his doctrines had become so rapid among all classes that it was thought necessary to remove him by the severest punishment of the law. He was conveyed to Tabriz, and brought out in the great square for execution.

“A company of soldiers was ordered to despatch Báb by a volley, when the smoke had cleared away Báb had disappeared from sight. It had so happened that none of the balls had touched him, and, prompted by an impulse to preserve his life, he rushed from the spot. Had Báb possessed sufficient presence of mind to have fled to the bazar . . . he would in all probability have succeeded in effecting his escape. A miracle palpable to all Tabriz would have been performed, and a new creed would have been established. But he turned in the opposite direction, and hid himself in the guard room, where he was immediately discovered, brought out, and shot. His body was thrown into the ditch of the town, where it was devoured by the half-wild dogs which abound outside a Persian city. Báb possessed a mild and benignant countenance, his manners were composed and dignified, his eloquence was impressive, and he wrote rapidly and well.”

Later on she wrote—

“This year (1850) seven Bábis were executed at Tehrán for an alleged conspiracy against the life of the prime minister. Their fate excited general sympathy, for every one knew that no criminal act had been committed, and suspected the accusation to be a pretence. . . . Previously to decapitation they received an offer of pardon, on the condition of reciting the kalama (or Muhammadan creed). . . . It was rejected, and these visionaries died stedfast in their faith. ... In Zanján the insurrection, or the religious movement, as the Bábis termed it, broke out with violence. This city is only 200 miles from Tehran, midway to Tabriz. At its head was a mulla of repute and renown, who, with his associates, retired into an angle of the city, which they strengthened as best they could. For several months they defended themselves with unconquerable resolution against a large force in infantry and guns, sent against them from Tehrán. It was their readiness to meet death that made the Bábís so formidable to their assailants. From street to street, from house to house, from cellar to cellar, they fought without flinching. Alí were killed at their posts, excepting a few who were afterwaιds bayoneted by the troops in cold blood.”

In the summer of 1852 his majesty was attacked, while riding in the vicinity of Tehran, by four men, one of whom fired a pistol and slightly wounded him. This man was killed, and two others were captured by the royal attendants; the fourth jumped down a well. The existence of a conspiracy was then discovered, in which some forty persons were implicated; and ten of the conspirators (one a young woman) were put to death,—some under cruel torture. A short reign of terror then ensued which is well illustrated in the following extract from Watson’s History.

“The prime minister . . . was fearful of drawing down upon himself and his family the vengeance of the followers of the Báb; and, in order that others might be implicated in these executions, he hit upon the device of assigning a criminal to each department of the state; the several ministers of the Shah being thus compelled to act as executioners. The minister for foreign affairs, the minister of finance, the son of the prime minister, the adjutant-general of the army, and the master of the mint, each fired the first shot, or made the first cut with a sabre, at the culprits assigned to their several departments, respectively. The artillery, the infantry, the camel-artillery, and the cavalry, each had a victim.^[368. “Even the Shah’s admirable French physician, the late lamented DrCloquet, was invited to show his loyalty by following the example of the rest of the court. He excused himself, and pleasantly said that he killed too many men professionally to permit him to increase their number by any voluntary homicide on his part” (Lady Sheil).]. . . But the result of all this slaughter was, as might have been expected, to create a feeling of sympathy for the Bábís, whose crime was lost sight of in the punishment which had overtaken them. They met their fate with the utmost firmness, and none of them cared to accept the life which was offered to them on the simple condition of reciting the Muslim creed, while the lighted candles were burning the flesh of one follower of the Báb, he was urged by the chief magistrate of Tehrán to curse the Báb and live. He would not renounce the Báb; but he cursed the magistrate who tempted him to do so, he cursed the Shah, and even cursed the prophet Muhammad, his spirit rising superior to the agony of his torture."

The movement, however, was not only felt in Tehran and Zanjan but also in Mazandaran, Fárs, Karman, and Tabriz; and, in spite of the fearful punishments with which the professors of the doctrine have been visited, the complete extinction of Bábism by fire and sword is a consummation hardly to be set within the range of human probability.

Mirza Taki, the amíru ’n-nizám (vulgarly amir nizám), or commander-in-chief, was a good specimen of the self-made man of Persia. He was the son of a cook of Bahrám Mirza, Muhammad Sháh’s brother, and he had filled high and important offices of state and amassed much wealth when he was made by the young sháh Násru ’d-Dín, on his accession, both his brother-in-law and his prime minister. The choice was an admirable one; he was honest, hard-working, and liberal according to his lights; and the services of a loyal and capable adviser were secured for the new régime. For the rebellion in Khurásan and all emergencies that occurred during his three years’ tenure of office, he was the same active and intelligent mentor that he had been when associated with the prince in his government of Adaτbaijan. Unfortunately, he did not boast the confidence of the queen-mother; and this circumstance greatly strengthened the hands of those enemies whom an honest minister must ever raise around him in a corrupt Oriental state. For a time the sháh closed his eyes to the accusations and insinuations breathed against him; but at last he fell under the evil influence of designing counsellors, and acts which should have redounded to the minister’s credit became the charges on which he lost his office and his life. He was credited with an intention to grasp in his own hands the royal power; his influence over the army was [9:18:652] cited as a cause of danger; and on the night of 13th November 1851 he was summoned to the palace and informed that he was no longer premier. Mirza Agha Khán, the “'itìmádu ’d-daulah,” was named to succeed him, and had been accordingly raised to the dignity of “sadr'azim.” As the hostile faction pressed the necessity of the ex-minister’s removal from the capital, he was offered the choice of the government of Fárs, Ispahan, or Krün. He declined all; but, through the mediation of Colonel Sheil, he was afterwards offered and accepted Kashan. It is not probable that Mirza Taki, once fallen from his high estate, would have long survived, or rather would have been long suffered by his rivals or foes to survive, this crisis in his career. For intriguers and charlatans he was too real a character to be harmless, and means would have doubtless been devised to get rid of him altogether. As it happened, opportunity was taken of an ill-timed if well-meant interference on his behalf of the Russian legation, and the sháh’s ire was aroused more than ever against him.

“Once having got him out of the way,” writes Major Euan Smith from information gathered on the scene of the tragedy lie is recounting, “his enemies had full play, and, forty days after his banishment, prevailed upon the king to issue orders for his execution. . . . The executioners arrived at Fin, and, seeing the ex-minister, told him that they had been sent by the shah to ask after his health. Mirza Taki Khán at once saw that his fate was sealed; he merely asked that, instead of having his throat cut, he might be allowed to die in his own way. The request was granted; he went into the hammán, where the king’s barber opened the two principal arteries in each arm, and he quietly sat there and bled to death.”^[369. Eastern Persia, vol. i. p. 156. The palace of Fin, near Kashan, was the residence of the amir nizám.]

When England was engaged in the Crimean War of 1854-55 her alliance with a Muhammadan power in no way added to her popularity or strengthened her position in Persia. The Sunni Turk was almost a greater enemy to his neighbour the Shí'ah than the formidable Muscovite, who had curtailed him of so large a section of his territory west of the Caspian. Hence during the war Persia coquetted with Russia as to a possible secret alliance, rather than with France or England. Moreover, since Sir John Μ‘Neill’s arrival in Tehran in 1841, formally to repair the breach with Muhammad Sháh, there had been little differences, demands, and explanations, which were portentous of a storm in the future; and these symptoms had culminated in 1856, the year of the peace with Russia. As to Afghanistan, the wazír Yar Muhammad had in 1842, when the British troops were perishing in the passes, or otherwise in the midst of dangers, caused Kamran to be suffocated in his prison. Since that event he had himself reigned supreme in Herat, and, dying in 1851, was succeeded by his son Sa'ιd Muhammad. This chief soon entered upon a series of intrigues in the Persian interests, and, among other acts offensive to Great Britain, suffered one 'Abbás Kúlí, who had, under guise of friendship, betrayed the cause of the salár at Mashhad, to occupy the citadel of Herat, and again place a detachment of the sháh’s troops in Ghurian. Colonel Sheil remonstrated, and obtained a new engagement of non-interference with Herat from the Persian Government, as well as the recall of 'Abbás Kúlí. In September 1855 Muhammad Yúsuf Sáduzái seized upon Herat, putting Sa'id Muhammad to death with some of his followers who were supposed accomplices in the murder of his uncle Kamran.

About this time Kohan Dil Khán, one of the chiefs of Kandahar, died, and Dost Muhammad of Kabul annexed the city to his territory. Some relations of the deceased chief made their escape to Tehran, and the sháh, listening to their complaint, directed the prince-governor of Mashhad to march across to the eastern frontier and occupy Herat, declaring that an invasion of Persia was imminent. Such was the situation when the Hon. Mr Murray was fulfilling his second year of duty at the legation in Tehran. He had relieved Mr Taylour Thomson, Colonel Sheil’s locum tenens, at a time when relations were somewhat strained, and coolness and want of confidence were daily becoming more apparent between the British representative and the court to which he was accredited. The following passage is from a recently-published work treating of the place and period.^[370. James Outram: a Biography, vol. ii., London, 1880.]

“At the end of 1855, our relations with the court of Tehran were anything but satisfactory. Even the outward semblance of civility towards the English representative was disregarded, and, in like manner, the veneer of courtesy was wanting in the official communications bearing the sign-manual of the Shah or his responsible minister. So great was the tension of ill-feeling occasioned, that our envoy withdrew to Baghdad, declining to resume the functions of his office until ample apology had been made, by certain persons named, for certain offences charged, after a manner detailed by himself. A crisis such as this may, it is true, be brought about in Persia by ourselves, through defective diplomacy and ignorance of the native character, ways, prejudices, and, to some extent, language; but it may also arise from many other causes—among others, a wilful pre-determination on the part of the local government. Once instructed to give offence to strangers and provoke a rupture, the Persian is a wonderful adept in fulfilling his instructions; and will prove as capable in bandying insult and innuendo as in the more complex and refined game of compliment and cajolery. In the present instance, there was in the attitude of Persia evidence of wilfulness and an exhibition of more than ordinary temper; for not only were the Shah’s own words full of insult, but his expressions were supplemented by deeds. Finally, by sending a large military expedition under his royal uncle, Prince Murád Mirza, to take possession of Herat, he showed his contempt of treaties, and aimed a blow at England’s Eastern policy in the most sensitive part.

“This occurred in December, the same month in which the British envoy quitted Tehran. In the first week of 1856, negotiations were opened at Constantinople, when the Persian charge d’affaires in that city related his version of the quarrel to our well-known ambassador there. Discussion was prolonged for some months in 1856, during which an ‘ultimatum’ from Lord Clarendon had been put forward without avail; and in October, a plenipotentiary named Farrukh Khan arrived at the Porte with the Shah’s instructions to settle the whole matter in dispute. But although this personage went so far as to sign a declaration that Herat should immediately be evacuated by the troops of his sovereign, other engagements were required from him which he could not undertake, and the attempt at a settlement failed. Lord Stratford presented a new ‘ultimatum’ on November 22d; but it was then too late to avert an outbreak. The news that Herat had been captured on October 26th, and that three proclamations declaring war against Persia had been issued by the governor-general of India on November 1st, soon reached Constantinople, and Farrukh Khan’s occupation was, for the moment, gone.”

In less than three weeks after issue by the governor-general of India of the proclamation of war with Persia the Sind division of the field force left Karachi (Kurrachee). On 13th January following the Bombay Government orders notified the formation of a second division under Lieutenant-General Sir James Outram. Before the general arrived the island of Karak and part of Bushahr had both been occupied, and the fort of Rishir had been attacked and carried. After the general’s aιτival the march upon Barazjún and the engagement at Khushab—two places on the road to Shíráz— and the operations at Muhamrah and the Kárún river decided the campaign in favour of England. On 5th April, at Muhamrah, Sir James Outram received the news that the treaty of peace had been signed in Paris, where Lord Cowley and Farrukh Khán had conducted the negotiations. The stipulations regarding Herat were much as before; but there were to be apologies made to the mission for past insolence and rudeness, and the slave trade was to be suppressed in the Persian Gulf.

With the exception of a small force retained at Bushahr under General John Jacob for the three months assigned for execution of the ratifications and giving effect to certain stipulations of the treaty with regard to Afghanistan, the British troops returned to India, where their presence was greatly needed, owing to the outbreak of the mutiny. The envoy retraced his steps from Baghdad to Tehran, to receive the excuses of the sháh’s minister. Before Mr Murray’s arrival, however, an act of so-called retaliation, but savouring rather of sheer revenge, had been perpetrated, which could not have commended itself to the mind of an English diplomatist on the spot. One of the articles of the treaty of peace provided for the release of all prisoners taken by the Persians at Herat. Among these was the ex-ruler Muhammad Yúsuf, who, having resisted the besieging army, had been brought captive to Tehran. The provision of mercy was in his case tantamount to a sentence of savage death, for the relatives of Sa'íd Muhammad (whom he had slain in return for the murder of his uncle Sháh Kamran) awaited his release literally to hew him to pieces in front of the Kasri Kajár, a royal palace about 5 miles from the walls of the capital. When Colonel Taylor and the officers deputed with him to certify the evacuation of Herat by the Persian soldiers reached their destination, they were received by a newly-appointed governor, Sultan Ahmad Khán, better known as Sultan Ján, nephew and son-in-law of the amir Dost Muhammad. It is unnecessary to refer to other than the political reasons of the war. They soon ceased to interest the minds of even European residents in Persia; and the war became a thing of the past. Mr Murray was succeeded in 1859 by Sir Henry Rawlinson as British envoy. No more popular nomination could have been made than that of this justly-distinguished Oriental statesman; but he barely remained a year at the work. Retiring at his own request, he was succeeded by Mr Charles Alison, whose marvellous acquaintance with Turks and their language had rendered him an invaluable secretary at Constantinople.

It now only remains to mention those incidents which have engaged the attention of the British Government, or in which British officers have had to play a part. Such are the establishment of a telegraph, the settlement of the Perso-Balúch, and the arbitration on the Perso-Afghan frontier. The proceedings of Russia in the countries east of the Caspian and bordering on the Oxus have, moreover, a bearing more or less direct on the interests of Great Britain, with especial reference to her Indian empire.

The question of constructing a telegraph in Persia as a link in the overland line to connect England with India was broached in Tehran by Colonel Patrick Stewart and Captain Champain, officers of engineers, in 1862, and an agreement on the subject concluded by Mr Edward Eastwick, when charge d’affaires, at the close of that year. Three years later a more formal convention, including a second wire, was signed by Mr Alison and the Persian foreign minister; meantime the work had been actively carried on, and communication opened on the one side between Bushahr and Karachi and the Makran coast by cable, and on the other between Bushahr and Baghdád via Tehran. The untrustworthy character of the line through Asiatic Turkey caused a subsequent change of direction; and an alternative line—the Indo-European—from London to Tehran, through Russia and along the eastern shores of the Black Sea, was constructed, and has worked well since 1872, [9:18:653] in conjunction with the Persian land telegraph system and the Bushahr-Karachi line.^[371. The Indo-European Telegraph Company have now (1884), on rather more than 450 miles of wire, from Julfa on the Aιτas to Tehran, in what is called the “Maintenance Department,” six stations with fifteen employes; the “commercial” stations, with twenty employés, are at Tabriz and Tehran only. The Persian telegraph system, under British officers, has fourteen stations in all, the chief being at Tehran, Ispahan, Shíráz, and Bushahr. The official staff numbers between thirty-five and forty. The number of paid words passing through these lines has steadily increased from 305,485 in 1877 to 1,177,412 in 1883. The average time taken by a message from London to Calcutta via Tehran varies from one and a half to two and a half hours.]

The Sístan mission, under Major-General (afterwards Sir Frederic) Goldsmid, left England in August 1870, and reached Tehran on 3d October. Thence it proceeded to Ispahan, from which city it moved to Baluchistan, instead of seeking its original destination. Difficulties had arisen both in arranging the preliminaries to arbitration and owing to the disordered state of Afghanistan, and it was therefore deemed advisable to commence operations by settling a frontier dispute between Persia and the Kelat state. Unfortunately, the obstructions thrown in the way of this settlement by the Persian commissioner, the untoward appearance at Bampúr of an unexpected body of Kelátis, and the absence of definite instructions marred the fulfilment of the programme sketched out; but a line of boundary was proposed, which has since been accepted by the litigants, and which, except perhaps in the case of a small district on the north, has, it is believed, been generally respected. In the following year the same mission, accompanied by the same Persian commissioner, proceeded to Sístan, where it remained for more than five weeks, prosecuting its inquiries, until joined by another mission from India, under Major-General (afterwards Sir Richard) Pollock, accompanying the Afghan commissioner. Complications then ensued by the determined refusal of the two native officials to meet in conference; and the arbitrator had no course available but to take advantage of the notes already obtained on the spot, and return with them to Tehran, there to deliver his decision. This was done on 19th August 1872. The contending parties appealed to the British secretary of state for foreign affairs, as provided by previous understanding; but the decision held good, and was eventually accepted on both sides (see above, p. 619).

The Russo-Persian boundary question of 1881 might have been considered to belong to history, but has been treated elsewhere. 11 is, however, a strictly pacific arrangement, and has nothing in common with the treaties of Gulistan or Turkmánchái.

Mr Alison died at Tehran in April 1872. Mr Ranald Thomson, whose experience of Persia is of thirty-five years’ duration, then became charge d’affaires, and held the post until relieved by his brother, Mr (since Sir) Taylour Thomson from Chili. On the retirement of the latter in April 1879, Mr (sinceSir Ranald) Thomson succeeded as envoy. During the later years of the reign of Násru , d-Dín several Englishmen have distinguished themselves as explorers in the north-east. Among them the names of O’Donovan, Napier, Baker, Gill, Clayton, and Stewart will be readily remembered. Colonels Bateman - Cham pain, Murdoch Smith, Sir Oliver St John, Beresford Lovett, and the late Major Pierson, all engineer officers connected with the telegraph, have made their mark in the country. Násru ’d-Dín Sháh, unlike his predecessors, has paid two visits to Europe,—one in 1873 and one in 1879. On the first occasion only he extended his journey to England, and was then attended by his “sadr 'azim,” or prime minister, the late Mirza Husain Khán, an able and enlightened adviser, withal a Grand Cross of the Star of India. His second visit was to Russia, Germany, France, and Austria, but he did not cross the Channel. Among the sháh’s latest projects are the possession of a little fleet in the Persian Gulf, and of some vessels on the Kárún. In 1884 it was stated that a thousand-ton steamer (the “Persepolis ”) and a smaller one for river navigation were actually in course of construction. The route by the Kárún was to be opened, and a carriageable road constructed from Shústar to Tehran, via Dizful, Khuramabad, Búrújird, Sultanabad, and Kúm. Orders had been given for building two tugs to pull native craft up the Kárún. The arrangements for the road, transport, and administration from Muhamrah to Tehran were confided to General Houtum Schindler, the inspector-general of Persian telegraphs.^[372. In the transcription of proper names in Part II. an endeavour to render the pronunciation current in Persia has caused the modification of the more conventional, and perhaps the more strictly correct, mode elsewhere followed in this work. On this principle it is that the e is replaced by i and a, and the o by u, as in Makran for Mekran, Rigan for Regan, Khurásan for Khorásan, &c. In Arabic words, however, the w is not exchanged for v, nor is the y necessarily used for the (_£, except where the repetition of i would be confusing, as in sáiyid. As a general rule the system of spelling Indian words, accepted for official correspondence, has been applied to the transliteration of Persian, when a final a is not accented it represents ah, as kára for kárah, and so forth.]

The works which have been mainly followed and quoted in the above historical sketch are Sir John Malcolm’s History of Persia; the more modern histories by Robert Grant Watson and Clements Markham; the Travels of Venetians in Persia, edited by Lord Stanley of Alderley, printed for the Hakluyt Society (1873); and the History of the late Revolutions in Persia, taken from the memoirs of Father Krusinski, procurator of the Jesuits at Ispahan (1733).

PART III.—LANGUAGE AND LITERATURE.

Section I.— Persian (Iranian) Languages.

Under the name of Persian is included the whole of that great family of languages occupying a field nearly coincident with the modern Iran, of which true Persian is simply the western division. It is therefore common and more correct to speak of the Iranian family. The original native name of the race which spoke these tongues was Arian. King Darius is called on an inscriptioι “a Persian, son of a Persian, an Arian of Arian race”; and the followers of the Zoroastrian religion in their earliest records never give themselves any other title but Airyavó danghavó, that is to say, “Arian races.” The province of the Iranian language is bounded on the west by the Semitic, on the north and north-east by the Ural-altaic or Turanian, and on the south-east by the kindred language of India.

The Iranian family of languages is one of the seven great branches of the Indo-European stem, and was first recognized as such by Sir William Jones and Friedrich Schlegel. Whatever uncertainty still remains as to the exact relationship between all the several branches of the Indo-European family, it is at least certain that Indian and Persian belong together more closely than the rest, and that they continued to develop side by side for a long period after the other branches had been already severed from the parent stem.

The common characteristics of all Iranian languages, which distinguish them especially from Sanskrit, are as follows.
[table]
[table]

Our knowledge of the Iranian languages in older periods is too fragmentary to allow of our giving a complete account of this family and of its special historical development. It will be sufficient here to distinguish the main types of the older and the more recent periods. From antiquity we have sufficient knowledge of two dialects, the first belonging to eastern Iran, the second to western.

1. Zend, or Old Bactrian.— Neither of these two titles is well chosen. The name Old Bactrian suggests that the language was limited to the small district of Bactria, or at least that it was spoken there, —which is, at the most, only an hypothesis. Zend, again (originally ázaintish), is not the name of a language, as Anquetil Duperron supposed, but means “interpretation” or “explanation,” and is specially applied to the mediaeval Pahlavi translation of the Avesta. Our “Zend-Avesta” does not mean the Avesta in the Zend language, but is an incorrect transcription of the original expression “Avisták va zand,” i.e., “ the holy text (Avesta) together with the translation.” But, since we still lack sure data to fix the home of this language with any certainty, the convenient name of Zend has become generally established in Europe, and may be provisionally retained. But the home of the Zend language was certainly in eastern Iran; all attempts to seek it farther west— e.g., in Media^[374. Cp. I. Darmesteter, Études Iraniennes, i. 10 (Paris, 1883).] —must be regarded as failures.

Zend is the language of the so-called Avesta, ^[375. As was said above, this, and not Zend-Avesta, is the correct title for the original text of the Persian Bible. The origin of the word is doubtful, and we cannot point to it before the time of the Sasanians. Perhaps it means “announcement,” “revelation.”] the holy book of the Persians, containing the oldest documents of the religion of Zoroaster. Besides this important monument, which is about twice as large as the Iliad and Odyssey put together, we only possess very scanty relics of the Zend language in mediaeval glosses and scattered quotations in Pahlavi books. These remains, however, suffice to give a complete insight into the structure of the language. Not only amongst Iranian languages but amongst all the languages of the Indo-European group, Zend takes one of the very highest places in [9:18:654] importance for the comparative philologist. In age it almost rivals Sanskrit; in primitiveness it surpasses that language in many points; it is inferior only in respect of its less extensive literature, and because it has not been made the subject of systematic grammatical treatment. The age of Zend must be examined in connexion with the age of the Avesta. In its present form the Avesta is not the work of a single author or of any one age, but embraces collections produced during a long period. The view which became current through Anquetil Du perron, that the Avesta is throughout the work of Zoroaster (in Zend, Zarathnshtra), the founder of the religion, has long been abandoned as untenable. But the opposite view, which is now frequently accepted, that not a single word in the book can lay claim to the authorship of Zoroaster, also appears on closer study too sweeping. In the Avesta two stages of the language are plainly distinguishable, for which the supposition of local dialectic variation is not sufficient explanation, but which appear rather to be an older and a younger stage in the development of the same language. The older is represented in but a small part of the whole work, the so-called Gáthás or songs. These songs form the true kernel of the book Yasna^[376. The Avesta is divided into three parts: (1) Yasna, with an appendix, Vιsparad,a collection of prayers and forms for divine service; (2) Vendidad, containing directions for purification and the penal code of the ancient Persians; (3) Khordah-Avesta, or the Small Avesta, containing the Yasht, the contents of which are for the most part mythological, with shorter prayers for private devotion.]; they must have been in existence long before all the other parts öf the Avesta, throughout the whole of which allusions to them occur. These gáthás are what they claim to be, and what they are honoured in the whole Avesta as being,— the actual productions of the prophet himself or of his time. They bear in themselves irrefutable proofs of their authenticity, bringing us face to face not with the Zoroaster of the legends but with a real person, announcing a new doctrine and way of salvation, no supernatural Being assured of victory, as he is represented in later times, but a mere man, often himself despairing of his final success, and struggling not with spirits and demons but with human conflicts of every sort, in the midst of a society of fellow-believers which was yet feeble and in its earliest infancy. It is almost impossible that a much later period could have produced such unpretentious and almost depreciatory representations of the deeds and personality of the prophet; certainly nothing of the kind is found outside the gathas. If, then, the gáthás reach back to the time of Zoroaster, and he himself, according to the most probable estimate, lived as early as the 14th century b.c., the oldest component parts of the Avesta are hardly inferior in age to the oldest Vedic hymns. The gáthás are still extremely rough in style and expression; the language is richer in forms than the more recent Zend; and the vocabulary shows important differences. The predominance of the long vowels is a marked characteristic, the constant appearance of a long final vowel contrasting with the preference for a final short in the later speech.
[table]

The clearest evidence of the extreme age of the language of the gáthás is its striking resemblance to the oldest Sanskrit, the language of the Vedic poems. The gáthá language (much more than the later Zend) and the language of the Vedas have a close resemblance, exceeding that of any two Romanic languages; they seem hardly more than two dialects of one tongue. Whole strophes of the gáthás can be turned into good old Sanskrit by the application of certain phonetic laws; for example—

“mat váo padáish yá frasrútá ízhayáo pairijasái mazdá ustánazastó at váo ashá aredrahyácá nemanghá at váo vanghéush mananghó hunaretátá,” becomes in Sanskrit—

“mana vah padáih yá praçrutá íháyáh parigachái medha uttánahastah at va rtena radhrasyaca namasá át vó vasor manasah súnrtayá.”^[377. “with verses of my making, which now are heard, and with prayerful hands, I come before thee, Mazda, and with the sincere humility of the upright man and with the believer’s song of praise.”]

The language of the other parts of the Avesta is more modern, but not all of one date, so that we can follow the gradual decline of Zend in the Avesta itself. The later the date of a text, the simpler is the grammar, the more lax the use of the cases. We have no chronological points by which to fix the date when Zend ceased to be a living language; no part of the Avesta can well be put later than the 5th or 4th century b.c. Persian tradition at least regards the collection and arrangement of the holy texts as completed before Alexander’s time. At that period they are said to have been already written out on dressed cowhides and preserved in the state archives at Persepolis.

I he followers of Zoroaster soon ceased to understand Zend. For this reason all that time had spared of the Avesta was translated into Middle Persian or Pahlavi (q.v. ) under the Sasanians. This translation, though still regarded as canonical by the Parais, shows a very imperfect knowledge of the original language. Its value for modern philology has been the subject of much needless contro versy amongst European scholars. It is only a secondary means towards the comprehension of the ancient text, and must be used with discrimination. A logical system of comparative exegesis, aided by constant reference to Sanskrit, its nearest ally, and to the other Iranian dialects, is the best means of recovering the lost sense of the Zend texts.

The phonetic system of Zend consists of simple signs which express the different shades of sound in the language with great precision. In the vowel-system a notable feature is the presence of the short vowels e and o, which are not found in Sanskrit and Old Persian; thus the Sanskrit santi, Old Persian hantiy, becomes henti in Zend. The use of the vowels is complicated by a tendency to combinations of vowels and to epenthesis, i.e., the transposition of weak vowels into the next syllable; e.g., Sanskrit bharati, Zend baraiti (he carries); Old Persian margιι, Zend rnóurva (Merv); Sanskrit riìiakti, Zend irinakhti. Triphthongs are not uncommon; e.g., Sanskrit açvebhyas (dative plural of açva, a horse) is in Zend aspaéibyó ; Sanskrit krnoti (he does), Zend kerenaoiti. Zend has also a great tendency to insert irrational vowels, especially near liquids; owing to this the words seem rather inflated; e.g., savya (on the left) becomes in Zend hávaya; bhrájati (it glitters), Zend barázaiti; gná (γw77), Zend gená. In the consonantal system we are struck by the abundance of sibilants (s and sh, in three forms of modification, z and zh) and nasals (five in number), and by the complete absence of l. A characteristic phonetic change is that of rí into sh; e.g., Zend asha for Sanskrit rta, Old Persian arta (in Artaxerxes'); fravashi for Pahlavi fravardin, New Persian ferver (the spirits of the dead). The verb displays a like abundance of primary forms with Sanskrit, but the conjugation by periphrasis is only slightly developed. The noun has the same eight cases as in Sanskrit. In the gáthás there is a special ablative, limited, as in Sanskrit, to the “a” stems, whilst in later Zend the ablative is extended to all the stems indifferently.

We do not know in what character Zend was written before the time of Alexander. From the Sasanian period we find an alphabetic and very legible character in use, derived from Sasanian Pahlavi, and closely resembling the younger Pahlavi found in books. The oldest known manuscripts are of the 14th century a.d. ^[378. Grammar by Spiegel (Leipsic, 1867); Dictionary by Justi (Leipsic, 1864); edition of the Avesta by westergaard (Copenhagen, 1852), translation into German by Spiegel (Leipsic, 1852), and into English by Darmestcter (Oxford, 1880) in the Sacred Books of the East.]

Although the existence of the Zend language was known to the Oxford scholar Hyde, the Frenchman Anquetil Duperron, who went to the East Indies in 1755 to visit the Parsí priests, was the first to draw the attention of the learned world to the subject Scientific study of Zend texts began with E. Burnouf, and has since then made rapid strides, especially since the Vedas have opened to us a knowledge of the oldest Sanskrit.

2. Old Persian.— This is the language of the ancient Persians properly so called,^[379. And perhaps of the Medes. Although we have no record of the Median language, we cannot regard it as differing to any great extent from the Persian. The Medes and Persians were two closely-connected races. There is nothing to justify us in looking for the true Median language either in the cuneiform writings of the second class or in Zend.] in all probability the mother-tongue of Middle Persian of the Pahlavi texts, and of New Persian. We know Old Persian from the rock-inscriptions of the Achaemenians, now fully deciphered. Most of them, and these the longest, date from the time of Darius (Old Persian, Dárayavaush); but we have specimens as late as Artaxerxes Ochus. In the latest inscriptions the language is already much degraded; but on the whole it is almost as antique as Zend, with which it has many points in common. For instance, if we take a sentence from an inscription of Darius, as—

“Auramazdá hya imam bumim adá hya avam asmánam adá hya martiyam adá hya siyátim adá martiyahyå hya Dárayavaum khsháyathiyam akunaush aivaιu paruvnám khsháyathiyam,”

it would be in Zend—

“Ahuró mazdáo yó imam búmïm adát yó aom asmanem adát yó mashím adát yó sháitím adát mashyahé yó dárayatvóhúm khshaétem akerenaot óyúm pouru-nám khshaétem.”^[380. “Onnuzd, who created this earth and that heaven, who created man and man’s dwelling-place, who made Darius king, the one and only king of many.”]

The phonetic system in Old Persian is much simpler than in Zend; we reckon twenty-four letters in all. The short vowels e, 0 are wanting; in their place the old “a” sound still appears as in Sanskrit, e.g., Zend bagem, Old Persian bagam, Sanskrit bhagam∙, Old Persian hamarana, Zend hamerena, Sanskrit samarana. As regards consonants, it is noticeable that the older 2 (soft s) still preserved in Zend passes into d, — a rule that still holds in New Persian; compare—
[table]

Also Old Persian has no special l. Final consonants are almost entirely wanting. In this respect Old Persian goes much farther than the kindred idioms, e.g., Old Persian abara, Sanskrit abharat, Zend abarat, tφepe ; nominative baga, root-form baga-s, Sanskrit [9:18:655] bhagas. The differences in declension between Old Persian and Zend are unimportant.

Old Persian inscriptions are written in the cuneiform character of the simplest form, known as the “first class.” Most of the inscriptions have besides two translations into the more complicated kinds of cuneiform character of two other languages of the Persian empire. One of these is the Assyrian; the real nature of the second is still a mystery. The interpretation of the Persian cuneiform, the character and dialect of which were equally unknown, was begun by Grotefend, who was followed by Burnouf, Rawlinson, and Oppert. The ancient Persian inscriptions have been collected in a Latin translation with grammar and glossaries by Spiegel (Leipsic, 1862). The other ancient tongues and dialects of this family are known only by name; we read of peculiar idioms in Sogdiana, Zabulistan, Herat, &c. It is doubtful whether the languages of the Scythians, the Lycians, and the Lydians, of which hardly anything remains, were Iranian or not.

After the fall of the Achaemenians there is a period of five centuries, from which no document of the Persian language has come down to us.

Under the Arsacids Persian nationality rapidly declined; all that remains to us from that period—namely, the inscriptions on coins —is in the Greek tongue. Only towards the end of the Parthian dynasty and after the rise of the Sasanians, under whom the national traditions were again cultivated in Persia, do we recover the lost traces of the Persian language in the Pahlavi inscriptions and literature.

3. Middle Persian.— The singular phenomena presented by Pahlavi writing have been discussed in a separate article (see Pahlavi). The language which it disguises rather than expresses—Middle Persian, as we may call it—presents many changes as compared with the Old Persian of the Achaemenians. The abundant grammatical forms of the ancient language are much reduced in number; the case-ending is lost; the noun has only two inflexions, the singular and the plural; the cases are expressed by prepositions, —e.g., rúbán (the soul), nom. and acc. sing., plur. rúbánán; dat. val or avo rúbán, abl. min or az rúbán. Even distinctive forms for gender are entirely abandoned, e.g., the pronoun avo signifies “he,” “she,” “it.” In the verb compound forms predominate. In this respect Middle Persian is almost exactly similar to New Persian.

4. New Persian.— The last step in the development of the language is New Persian, represented in its oldest form by Firdausi. In grammatical forms it is still poorer than Middle Persian; except English, no Indo-European language has so few inflexions, but this is made up for by the subtle development of the syntax. The structure of New Persian has hardly altered at all since the Sháh-nárna ; but the· original purism of Firdausi, who made every effort to keep the language free from Semitic admixture, could not long be maintained. Arabic literature and speech exercised so powerful an influence on New Persian, especially on the written language, that it could not withstand the admission of an immense number of Semitic words. There is no Arabic word which would be refused acceptance in good Persian. But, nevertheless, New Persian has remained a language of genuine Iranian stock.

Among the changes of the sound system in New Persian, as contrasted with earlier periods, especially with Old Persian, the first that claims mention is the change of the tenues k, t, p, c, into g, d, b, z. Thus we have—
[table]

A series of consonants often disappear in the spirant; thus—
[table]

Old d and dh frequently become y —
[table]

Old y often appears as J: Zend yárna (glass), New Persian yam; yaνan (a youth), New Persian javán. Two consonants are not allowed to stand together at the beginning of a word; hence vowels are frequently inserted or prefixed, e.g., New Persian sitàdan or istádan (to stand), root stá; birádar (brother), Zend and Pahlavi brátar. ^[381. Grammars of New Persian, by Lumsden (Calcutta, 1820), Chodzko (Paris, 1852), Vullers (Giessen, 1870). For the New Persian dialects see Fr. Müller, in the Sitzungsber. der Wien. Akad., vols, lxxvii., Ixxviii.]

Amongst modern languages and dialects other than Persian which must be also assigned to the Iranian family may be mentioned—

1. Kurdish, a language nearly akin to New Persian, with which it has important characteristics in common. It is chiefly distinguished from it by a marked tendency to shorten words at all costs, e.g., Kurd, berá (brother)=New Persian birádar ; Kurd, dim (I give) = New Persian diham ; Kurd, sρi (white) = New Persian sipéd.

2. Balτιch, the language of Baluchistan, also very closely akin to New Persian, but especially distinguished from it in that all the old spirants are changed into explosives, e.g., Baluch váb (sleep) = Zend hvafna∙, Baluch kaρ (slime) = Zend kafa, New Persian kaf; Baluch hapt (seven) — New Persian haft.

3. Ossetic, true Iranian, in spite of its resemblance in sound to the Georgian.^[382. Compare Hübschmann, in Kuhn’s Zeitschrift, xxiv. 396.]

4. Afghan, which has certainly been increasingly influenced by the neighbouring Indian languages in inflexion, syntax, and vocabulary, but is still at bottom a pure Iranian language, nδt merely intermediate between Iranian and Indian.

The position of Armenian alone remains doubtful. Some scholars attribute it to the Iranian family; others prefer to regard it as a separate and independent member of the Indo-European group. Many words that at first sight seem to prove its Iranian origin are only adopted from the Persian.^[383. Compare P. de Lagarde, Armenische Studien (Göttingen, 1877); H. Hübschmann, Armenische Studien (Leipsic, 1883).] (K. G. )

Section II.— Modern Persian Literature.

Persian historians are greatly at variance about the origin of their national poetry. Most of them go back to the 5th Christian century and ascribe to one of the Sasanian kings, Bahrámgúr or Bahrám V. (420-439), the invention of metre and rhyme; others mention as author of the first Persian poem a certain Abulhafs of Soghd, near Samarkand. In point of fact, there is no doubt that the later Sasanian rulers fostered the literary spirit of their nation (see Pahlavi). Pahlavi books, however, fall outside of the present subject, which is the literature of the idiom which shaped itself out of the older Persian speech by slight modifications and a steadily increasing mixture of Arabic words and phrases in the 9th and 10th centuries of our era, and which in all essential respects has remained the same for the last thousand years. The national spirit of Iran, although smothered and stifled by the Arab conquest, could not be entirely annihilated. The system of centralization was at no time very strong in the extensive dominions of the Omayyad and 'Abbásid dynasties; and the more their power and influence decayed the more they lost their hold on Persia, especially since the native element began to aspire to governorships and to take the political management into its own hand. The death of Hárún al-Rashid in the beginning of the 9th century, which marks the commencement of the decline of the caliphate, was at the same time the starting-point of movements for national independence and a national literature in the Iranian dominion, and the common cradle of the two was in the province of Khorásán, between the Oxus and Jaxartes. In Merv, a Khorásánian town, a certain 'Abbás composed in 809 a.d. (193 a.h.), according to the oldest biographical writer of Persia, Mohammed 'Aufí, the first real poem in modern Persian, in honour of the 'Abbásid prince Ma’mún, Hárún al-Rashíd’s son, who had himself a strong predilection for Persia, his mother’s native country, and was, moreover, thoroughly imbued with the freethinking spirit of his age. Soon after this, in 820 (205 A.H.), Táhir, who aided Ma’mún to wrest the caliphate from his brother Amin, succeeded in establishing the first semi-independent Persian dynasty in Khorásán, which was overthrown in 872 (259 a.h.) by the family of the Saffárids, founded by Ya'kúb b. Laith, originally a brazier in Sístán or Zábulistán.

The development of Persian poetry under these first native dynasties was slow. Arabic language and literature had gained too firm a footing to be supplanted at once [9:18:656] by a new literary idiom still in its infancy; nevertheless the few poets who arose under the Táhirids and ⅛affiirids show already the germs of the characteristic tendency of all later Persian literature, which aims at amalgamating the enforced spirit of Islamism with their own Aryan feelings, and reconciling the strict deism of the Mohammedan religion with their inborn loftier and more ór less pantheistic ideas; and we can easily trace in the few fragmentary verses of men like Hanzalah, Hakim Fírúz, and Abú Salík those principal forms of poetry now used in common by all Mohammedan nations—the forms of the kasída (the encomiastic, elegiac, or satirical poem), the ghazal or ode (a love-ditty, wine-song, or religious hymn), the rubéií or quatrain (oui· epigram, for which the Persians invented a new metre in addition to those adopted from the Arabs), and the mathnawî or double-rhymed poem (the legitimate form for epic and didactic poetry). The first who wrote such a mathnawi was Abú Shukúr of Balkh, the oldest literary representative of the third dynasty of Khorásán, the Sámánids, who had been able in the course of time to dethrone the Saffárids, and to secure the government of Persia, nominally still under the supremacy of the caliphs in Baghdád, but in fact with full sovereignty. The undisputed reign of this family dates from the accession of Amir Nasr II. (913-942; 301-331 a. h.), who, more than any of his predecessors, patronized arts and sciences in his dominions. The most accomplished minstrels of his time were Mohammed Faráládí; Abú Ί-'Abbás of Bokhárá, a writer of very tender verses; Abú Ί-Muzaffar Nasr of Níshápúr; Abú 'Abdalláh Mohammed of Junaid, equally renowned for his Arabic and Persian poetry; Ma'nawí, full of original thoughts and spiritual subtleties; Khusrawání, from whom even Firdausi condescended to borrow quotations; Abú Ι-Hasan Shahid of Balkh, the first who made a díwán or alphabetical collection of his lyrics; and Master Rúdagí, the first classic genius of Persia, who impressed upon every form of lyric and didactic poetry its peculiar stamp and individual character (see Rúdagí). His graceful and captivating style was imitated by Hakim Khabbáz, a great baker, poet, and quack; Abú Shu'aib Sálih of Herát, who left a spirited little song in honour of a young Christian maiden; Raunakí of Bokhárá; Abú’l-Fath of Bust, who was also a good Arabic poet; the amir Abú ’ 1-Hasan 'Alí Alagátchí, who handled the pen as skilfully as the sword; 'Umárah of Merv, a famous astronomer; and Kisá'í, a native of the same town, a man of stern and ascetic manners, who sang in melodious rhythm the praise of c Ali and the twelve imáms. All these poets flourished under the patronage of the Sámánid princes, who also fostered the growing desire of their nation for historical and antiquarian researches, for exegetical and medical studies. Mansúr I., the grandson of Rúdagí’s patron, ordered (963; 352 a.h.) his wazír Bal'amí to translate the famous universal history of Tabari (224-310 a.h.) from Arabic into Persian; and this Ta ’ rikh-i-Tabari, the oldest prose work in modern Persian, is not merely remarkable from a philological point of view, it is also the classic model of an easy and simple style. The same prince employed the most learned among the ulemá of Transoxiana for a translation of Tabari’s second great work, the Tafsir, or commentary on the Koran, and accepted the dedication of the first Persian book on medicine, a pharmacopoeia by the physician Abú Mansúr Muwaffak b. 'Alí of Herát (edited by Seligmann, Vienna, 1859), which forms a kind of connecting link between Greek and Indian medicine. It was soon after further developed by the great Avicenna (died 1037; 428 a.h.), himself a Persian by birth, and author of pretty wine-songs, moral maxims, psychological tracts, and a manual of philosophic science, the Dánishnáma-i-Alá'i, in his native tongue.

A still greater impulse was given, both to the patriotic feelings and the national poetry of the Persians, by Mansúr’s son and successor, Prince Núh II., who ascended the throne in 976 (365 a.h.). Full of enthusiasm for the glorious past of the old Iranian kingdom, he charged his court poet Dakíkí, who openly professed in his ghazals the Zoroastrian creed, to turn the Pars! collection of the venerable legends and traditions of the heroic ages of Iran, the Khodâ'ináma, or “Book of Kings” (which had been translated from the Pahlavi under the Saffárid Ya'kúb b. Laith), into Persian verse. Shortly after commencing this work Daki⅛i was murdered in the prime of life; and the fall of the minstrel was soon followed by that of the Sámánid dynasty itself, which was supplanted by the younger and more vigorous house of Sabuktagín, the founder of the Ghaznawids, who had rapidly risen from the rank of a common Turkish soldier to that of an independent ruler of Ghazna (Ghazni, Ghuznee)and all the surrounding countries, including a considerable portion of India. But Dakíkí’s great enterprise was not abandoned; a stronger hand, a higher genius, was to continue and to complete it, and this genius was found in Firdausi (940-1020; 328-411 a.h.), with whom we enter the golden age of the national epopee in Persia (see Firdousí). In 1011, after thirty-five years of unremitting labour, he accomplished his gigantic task, and wrote the last distichs of the immortal Sháhnáma, that “glorious monument of Eastern genius and learning,” as Sir W. Jones calls it, “which, if ever it should be generally understood in its original language, will contest the merit of invention with Homer itself.” And, although it was not he, the unrivalled master of epic art, but his old friend and patron, the less-renowned 'Unsurí, who officiated as “king of poets” in the court of Mahmúd of Ghazna (998- 1030; 388-421 a.h.), who had continued his father Sabuktagín’s conquests, and founded an empire extending from the Caucasus to Bengal and from Bokhárá and Kashgar to the Indian Ocean, he was nevertheless the central sun round which all the minor stars revolved, those four hundred poets who formed the famous “Round Table” in the sultan’s magnificent palace. Firdausi’s fame eclipsed that of all his contemporaries (however well founded their claim upon literary renown),—men like 'Unsurí, Farrukhí, Asjadí, Ghadá’irí, Minútchehrí, and others, whose eloquent praises of Mahmúd have come down to us in very scarce copies, and even that of his own teacher Asadí, who survived his great pupil, and established a reputation of his own by introducing into Persian literature the novel form of the munázarah or strife-poem, the equivalent of the Provençal tenson and the English estrif or joust. The Sháhnáma, from the very moment of its appearance, exercised such an irresistible fascination upon all minds that there was soon a keen competition among the younger poets as to who should produce the most successful imitation of that classic model; and this competition has gone on under different forms through all the following centuries, even to the most recent times. First of all, the old popular traditions, so far as they had not yet been exhausted by Firdausi, were ransacked for new epic themes, and a regular cycle of national epopees gathered round the Book of Kings, drawn almost exclusively from the archives of the princes of Sístán, the family of Firdausi’s greatest hero, Rustam. The first and most ambitious of these competitors seems to have been Asadí’s own son, 'All b. Ahmad al-Asadí, the author of the oldest Persian glossary, who completed in 1066 (458 a.π.), in upwards of 9000 distichs, the Garsháspnáma, or marvellous story of the warlike feats and love-adventures of Garshásp, one of Rustam’s ancestors. The heroic deeds of Rustam’s grandfather were celebrated in the Sámnáma, which almost equals the Sháhnáma in length; those of Rustam’s two sons, in the Jahángirnáma and the Fará- [9:18:657] murznáma ; those of his daughter, an amazon, in the Brunhild style of the German Nibelunge, in the Bánú Gusháspnáma; those of his grandson, in the Barsúnáma; those of his great-grandson, in the Shahriyámama (ascribed to Mukhtárí and dedicated to Mas'úd Sháh, who is probably identical with Mas'úd b. Ibráhím, Sultan Mahmúd’s great-grandson, 1088-1114; 481-508 a.h.); and the wonderful exploits of a son of Isfandiyár, another hero of the Sháhnáma, in the Bahmannáma.

When at last these old Iranian sources were almost entirely exhausted, the difficulty was met in various but equally ingenious ways. Where some slight historical records of the heroic age—no matter how doubtful their authenticity—were still obtainable, poetical imagination seized upon them at once, and filled the wide gaps by its own powerful invention; where no traditions at all were forthcoming, fiction pure and simple asserted its indisputable right; and thus the national epopee gave way to the epic story, and—substituting prose for verse—to the novel and the fairy tale. Models of the former class are the various Iskandarnámas, or “Books of Alexander the Great,” the oldest and most original of which is that of Nizámí (completed about 1202; 599 a.h.); the latter begins with the Kitab-i-Samak 'Iyar, a novel in three volumes (about 1189; 585 a.h.), and reaches its climax in the Bústán-i-Khayal, or “Garden of Imagination,” a prose romance of fifteen large volumes, by Mohammed Taki Khayál, written between 1742 and 1756 (1155 and 1169 a.h.). Many aspirants to poetical fame, however, were not satisfied with either of these expedients: they boldly struck out a new path and explored hitherto unknown regions, and here again a twofold tendency manifested itself. Some writers, both in prose and verse, turned from the exhausted fields of the national glory of Persia to the comparatively original soil of Arabian traditions, and chose their subjects from the chivalrous times of their own Bedouin conquerors, or even from the J ewish legends of the Koran. Of this description are the Anbiyánáma, or history of the pre-Mohammedan prophets, by Hasaní Shabistarí 'Ayání (before the 8th century of the Hijra); Ibn Husám’s Kháwarnáma (1427; 830 a.h.), or the deeds of 'Alí; Bádhil’s Hamla-i-Haidari, which was completed by Najaf (1723; 1135 a.h.), or the life of Mohammed and the first four caliphs; Kázim’s Far-ahnáma-i-Fátima, the book of joy of Fátima, Mohammed’s daughter (1737; 1150 a.h.), —all four in the epic metre of the Sháhnáma; and the prose stories of Hátim Tá’í, the famous model of liberality and generosity in pre-Islamitic times; of Amir Hamzah, the uncle of Mohammed; and of the Mujizát-i-Músavvi, or the miraculous deeds of Moses, by Mu'ín-almiskín (died about 1501; 907 a.h.).

Quite a different turn was taken by the ambition of another class of imitators of Firdausi, especially during the last four centuries of the Hijra, who tried to create a new heroic epopee by celebrating in rhythm and rhyme stirring events of recent date. The gigantic figure of Tímúr inspired Hátifí (died 1521; 927 a.h.) with his Tímúrnáma ∙, the stormy epoch of the first Safawí rulers, who succeeded at last in reuniting for some time the various provinces of the old Persian realm into one great monarchy, furnished Kásimí (died after 1560; 967 a.h.) with the materials of his Sháhnáma, a poetical history of Sháh Isma'íl and Sháh Tahmásp. Another Sháhnáma, celebrating Sháh 'Abbás the Great, was written by Kamálí of Sabzawár; and even the cruelties of Nádir Sháh were duly chronicled in a pompous epic style in 'Ishratí’s Sháhnáma-i-Nádiri (1749; 1162 a.h.). But all these poems are surpassed in length by the 33,000 distichs of the Sháhinsháhnáma by the poet-laureate of the late Feth 'Alí Sháh of Persia, and the 40,000 distichs of the Georgenáma, a poetical history of India from its discovery by the Portuguese to the conquest of Poonah by the English in 1817. In India especially this kind of epic versification has flourished since the beginning of Humáyún’s reign (1530-1556); the courtpoets of the great Mogul emperors of Delhi, as well as of all the minor dynasties, vied with one another in glorifying the exploits of their respective sovereigns, as is sufficiently proved by the Zafarnáma-i-Sháhjaháni by Kudsí (died 1646; 1056 a.h.); the Sháhinsháhnáma by Tálib Kalím (died 1651; 1061 a.h.), another panegyrist of Sháh Jahán; Átashí’s 'Adilnáma, in honour of Sháh Mohammed 'Adil of Bíjápúr, who ascended the throne in 1629 (1039 a.h.); the T'awárikh-i-Kuli Ifutbsháh, a metrical history of the Kutb sháhs of Golkonda; and many more, down to the Fatly-náma-i-Tipú Sultán by Ghulám Hasan (1784; 1189 a.h.).

But the national epopee, with both its legitimate and its illegitimate offspring, was not the only bequest the great Firdausi left to his nation. This rich genius gave also the first impulse to the higher development of those other branches of poetical art which were to flourish in the following ages—particularly to romantic, didactic, and mystic poetry ; and even his own age produced powerful co-operators in these three most conspicuous departments of Persian literature. Romantic fiction, which achieved its highest triumph in Nizámí of Ganja’s (1141-1203; 535-599 a.h.) brilliant pictures of the struggles and passions in the human heart (see Nizámí, vol. xvii. pp. 521, 522), sent forth its first tender shoots in the numerous love-stories of the Sháhnáma, the most fascinating of which is that of Zál and Rúdabeh, and developed almost into full bloom in Firdausi’s second great mathnawí Yusuf u Zalîkhá, which the aged poet wrote after his flight from Ghazna, and dedicated to the reigning caliph of Baghdád, Alkádir-billáh. It represents the oldest poetical treatment of the Biblical story of Joseph, which has proved so attractive to the epic poets of Persia, among others to 'Am'ak of Bokhárá (died 1149), who was the first after Firdausi to write a Yusuf u Zalikhá (which can be read in two different metres), to Jámí (died 1492), Maují Kásim Khán, Humáyún’s amir (died 1571), Názim of Herát (died 1670), and Shaukat, the governor of Shíráz under Feth 'Alí Sháh. Perhaps prior in date to Firdausi’s Yusuf was his patron 'Unsurí’s romance JPαm∕c u Adhrá, a popular Iranian legend of great antiquity, which had been first written in verse under the Táhirid dynasty. This favourite story was treated again by Fasíhí Jurjání (in the course of the same 5th century of the Hijra), and by many modern poets,— as Damírí, who died under the Safawí Sháh Mohammed (1577-1586; 985-994 a.h.), Námí, the historiographer of the Zand dynasty, and Husain of Shíráz under Feth 'Alí Sháh, the last two flourishing towards the beginning of the present century. Another love-story of similar antiquity, which had originally been written in Pahlavi, formed the basis of Fakhr-uddín As'ad Jurjání’s JΓis u Ramin, which was composed in Isfahán (Ispahán) about 1048 (440 a.h.), —a poem remarkable not only for its high artistic value but also for its close resemblance to one of the epic masterpieces of mediaeval German literature, Gottfried von Strasburg’s Tristan und Isold.

The last-named Persian poet was apparently one of the earliest eulogists of the Seljuks, and it was under this Turkish dynasty, which soon became a formidable rival both of the Ghaznawids and of the Arabian caliphs of Baghdád, that lyrical romanticism—that is, panegyrical and satirical poetry—rose to the highest pitch. What Firdausi, in his exalted descriptions of royal power and dignity, and the court-poets of Sultan Mahmúd, in their unbounded praise of the great sovereign and protector of arts, had commenced, what other encomiasts under Mahmúd’s successors—for instance, Abú ’ 1-Faraj Rúní of Lahore and Mas'úd b. Sa'd b. Salmán (under Sultan [9:18:658] Ibrâhîm, 1059-1088)—had successfully continued, reached its perfection in the famous group of panegyrists who gathered in the first half of the 6th century of the Hijra round the throne of Sultan Sanjar, and partly also round that of his great antagonist, Atsiz, sháh of Khwárizm. This group included Adib Sábir, who was drowned by order of the prince in the Oxus about 1145 (540 a.h.), and his pupil Jauharí, the goldsmith of Bokhárá; Amir Mu'izzí, the king of poets at Sanjar’s court, killed by a stray arrow in 1147 (542 a.h.); Rashid Watwát (the Swallow), who died in 1172 (568 a.h.), and left, besides his kasídas, a valuable treatise on poetry (ffada , ik-essihf) and a metrical translation of the sentences of 'Alí; 'Abd-alwási' Jabalí, who sang at first, like his contemporary Hasan Ghaznawí (died 1169; 565 a.h.), the praise of the Ghaznawid sháh Bahrám, but afterwards bestowed his eulogies upon Sanjar, the conqueror of Ghazna; and Auhad-uddín Anwarí, the most celebrated kasída-writer of the whole Persian literature. Anwarí (died between 1191 and 1196; 587 and 592 a.h.), who in early life had pursued scientific studies in the madrasah of Tús and who ranked among the foremost astronomers of his time, owes his renown as much to the inexhaustible store of poetical similes and epitheta ornantia which he showered upon Sanjar and other royal and princely personages as to his cutting sarcasms, which he was careful enough to direct, not against special individuals, but against whole classes of society and the cruel wrongs worked by an inexorable fate,—thus disregarding the more manly example of Firdausi, whose bold attack upon Sultan Mahmúd for having cheated him out of the well-earned reward for his epopee is the oldest and, at the same time, most finished specimen of personal satire. This legitimate branch of high art, however, soon degenerated either into the lower forms of parody and travesty—for which, for instance, a whole group of Transoxanian writers, Súzaní of Samarkand (died 1174; 569 a.h.) and his contemporaries, Abú c Ali Shatranjí of the same town, Lámi' of Bokhárá, and others gained a certain literary reputation—or into mere comic pieces and jocular poems like the “Pleasantries” lflazliyyaT) and the humorous stories of the “Mouse and Cat” and the “Stone-cutter” (SangtarasK) by 'LTbaid Zákání (died 1370; 772 a.h.). Anwarí’s greatest rival was Khákání (died 1199; 595 a.h.), the son of a carpenter in Shírwán, and panegyrist of the sháhs of Shírwán, usually called the Pindar of the East on account of the difficult and enigmatic style of his verses. Oriental critics, of course, greatly admire the obscure allusions, far-fetched puns, and other eccentricities with which the otherwise energetic and harmonious language, both of his laudatory odes and of his satires, is loaded; to European taste only the shorter epigrams and the double-rhymed poem Tuhfat-ufirákain, in which Khákání describes his journey to Mecca and back, give full satisfaction. Among his numerous contemporaries and followers may be noticed Mujír-uddín Bailakání (died 1198; 594 a.h.), Zahir Fáryábí (died 1202; 598 a.h.), and Athír Akhsíkatí (died 1211; 608 a.h.),— all three panegyrists of the atábegs of Adharbaiján (Azerbijan), and especially of Sultan Kizil Arslan—Kamál-uddín Isfahání, tortured to death by the Moguls in 1237 (635 A.H.), who sang, like his father Jamál-uddín, the praise of the governors of Isfahán, and gained, on account of his fertile imagination, the honorary epithet of the “creator of fine thoughts” (Khallák-ulma'ání); and Saif-uddín Isfarangí (died 1267; 666 a.h.), a favourite of the sháhs of Khwárizm.

Fruitful as the 6th and 7th centuries of the Hijra were in panegyrics, their literary fame did not rest upon these alone; they attained an equally high standard in two other branches of poetry, the didactic and the mystic, which after a short period of separate existence entered into a close and henceforth indissoluble union. The origin of both can again be traced to Firdausi and his time. In the ethical reflexions, wise maxims, and moral exhortations scattered throughout the Sháhnáma the didactic element is plainly visible, and equally plain in it are the traces of that mystical tendency which was soon to pervade almost all the literary productions of Persian genius. Súfic pantheism, which tends to reconcile philosophy with revealed religion, and centres in the doctrine of the universality and absolute unity of God, who is diffused through every particle of the visible and invisible world, and to whom the human soul during her temporary exile in the prison-house of the body strives to get back through progressive stages till she is purified enough to be again absorbed in Him, is already hinted at in the numerous verses of the “Book of Kings” in which the poet cries out against the vanity of all earthly joys and pleasures, and expresses a passionate desire for a better home, for a reunion with the Godhead. But the most characteristic passage of the epopee is the mysterious disappearance of Sháh Kaikhosrau, who suddenly, when at the height of earthly fame and splendour, renounces the world in utter disgust, and, carried away by his fervent longing for an abode of everlasting tranquillity, vanishes for ever from the midst of his companions. The first Persian who devoted poetry exclusively to the illustration of Súfic doctrines was Firdausi’s contemporary, the renowned sheikh Abú Sa'íd b. Abú Ι-Khair of Mahna in Khorásán (968-1049; 357-440 a.h.), the founder of that specific form of the rubá'í which gives the most concise expression to religious and philosophic aphorisms,—a form which was further developed by the great freethinker Omar b. Khayyam (q.vf), and Afdal-uddín Káshí (died 1307; 707 A.H.). The year of Abú Sa'íd’s death is most likely the same which gave to the world the first great didactic mathnawí, the Púshaná’înania, qτ “Book of Enlightenment,” by Nasir b. Khosrau (q.vf), a poem full of sound moral and ethical maxims with slightly mystical tendencies. About twenty-five years later the first theoretical handbook of Súfism in Persian was composed by 'Alí b. 'Uthmán al-jullábí al-hujwírí in the Kashf-ulmαhjub, which treats of the various schools of Súfís, their teachings and observances. A great saint of the same period, Sheikh 'Abdalláh Ansárí of Herát (1006-1089; 396-481 a.h.), assisted in spreading the pantheistic movement by his Munáját or invocations to God, by several prose tracts, and by an important collection of biographies of eminent Súfís, based on an older Arabic compilation, and serving in its turn as groundwork for Jámí’s excellent Nafahát-aluns (completed in 1478; 883 A.H.). He thus paved the way for the publication of one of the earliest text-books of the whole sect, the Hadíkat-ulhakíkat, or “Garden of Truth” (1130; 525 a.h.), by Hakim Saná’í of Ghazna, to whom all the later Súfic poets refer as their unrivalled master in spiritual knowledge. In this extensive mathnawí in ten cantos, as well as in his smaller poetical productions, he skilfully blended the purely didactic element, which is enhanced by pleasant stories and anecdotes, with the chief tenets of higher theosophy,—an example which has been strictly adhered to by all the following Súfic poets, who only differ in so far as they give preponderance either to the ethical or to the mystical side of their writings. As the most uncompromising Súfís appear the greatest pantheistic writer of all ages, Jelál-uddín Rúmí (1207-1273; 604-672 a.h.; see Rúmí), and his scarcely less renowned predecessor Faríd-uddín 'Attár, who was slain by the Moguls at the age of 114 lunar years in 1230 (627 a.h.). This prolific writer, originally a druggist ('attár) in Níshápúr, after having renounced all worldly affairs and performed the pilgrimage to Mecca, devoted himself to a stern ascetic life, and to the composition of Súfic works, partly in prose, as in his valuable “Biography of eminent Mystic Divines,” but mostly in the form of mathnawís[9:18:659] (upwards of twenty in number), among which the Pandnama, or “Book of Counsels,” and the Mantik-uUajr, or the “Speeches of Birds,” occupy the first rank. In the latter, an allegorical poem, interspersed with moral tales and pious contemplations, the final absorption of the Súfí in the deity is most ingeniously illustrated, and the seven valleys through which the birds travel on their way to the fabulous phaenix or símurg (literally thirty birds), and in which all except thirty succumb, are the seven stations of the mystic road that leads from earthly troubles into the much-coveted Faná or Nirvána.

In strong contrast to these advanced $úfís stands the greatest moral teacher of Persia, Sheikh Sa'di of Shíráz (died about 110 lunar years old in 1292; 691 a.h. ; see Sa'di), whose two best known works, the Bústan, or “Fruitgarden,” and the Gulistán, or “Rose-garden,” owe their great popularity both in the East and the West to the purity of their spiritual thoughts, their sparkling wit, charming style, and the very moderate use of mystic theories. However, both have found comparatively few imitations,—the former in the Dastúrnama of Nizárí of Kohistán (died 1320; 720 a.h.), in the Dah Bab, or “Ten Letters,” of Kátibí (died 1434; 838 a.h.), and in the Gulzar of Hairatí (murdered 1554; 961 a.h.) ; the latter in Mu'ín-uddín Juwainí’s Nigáristan (1335; 735 a.h.) and Jámí’s Baháristán, or “Spring-garden” (1487; 892 a.h.); whereas an innumerable host of purely Súfic compositions followed in the wake of Saná’í’s, 'Attár’s, and Jelál-uddín Rúmí’s mathnawís. They consist partly of mere expositions of doctrines with or without illustrations by tales and anecdotes, partly of complete Súfic allegories, often disfigured by the wildest eccentricities. It will suffice to name a few of the most conspicuous in each class. To the former belong the Lamaát, or “Sparks,” of 'Irákí (died between 1287 and 1309; 686 and 709 a.h.), the Zád-almusáfirin, or “Store of the Wayfarers,” by Husainí (died 1318; 718 a.h.), the Gulshan-i-Raz, or “Rose-bed of Mystery,” by Mahmúd Shabistarí (died 1320; 720 a.h.), the Jdm-i-Jαm i or “Cup of Jamshid,” by Auhadí (died 1338; 738 a.h.), the Anis-ul l Amfin, or “Friend of the Mystics,” by Kásim-i-Anwár (died 1434; 837 a.h.), and others; to the latter 'Assár’s Mihr u Mushtarî, or “Sun and Jupiter” (1376; 778 a.h.), 'Árifí’s Gai u Chaugan, or “The Ball and the Bat” (1438; 842 a.h.), Husη u Dil, or “Beauty and Heart,” by Fattáhí of Níshápúr (died 1448; 852 a.h.), Sharn u Parwana, or “The Candle and the Moth,” by Ahlí of Shíráz (1489; 894 a.h.), Sháh u Gada, or “King and Dervish,” by Hilálí (put to death 1532; 939 a.h.), Bahá-uddín 'Amilí’s (died 1621; 1030 a.h.) Nan u Halwa, or “Bread and Sweets,” Shir u Shahar, or “Milk and Sugar,” and many more.

During all these periods of literary activity, lyric poetry, pure and simple— i.e., the ghazal, in its legitimate form-had by no means been neglected; almost all the renowned poets since the time of Rúdagí had sung in endless strains the pleasures of love and wine, the beauties of nature, and the almighty power of the Creator; but, however rich the ghazals of Sa'di in lofty thoughts and pious feelings, however sublime the hymns of Jelál-uddín Rúmí, it was left to the incomparable genius of Háfiz (died 1389; 791 A.H.; see HiÍfiz) to give to the world the most perfect models of lyric composition; and the lines he had laid down were more or less strictly followed by all the ghazal-writers of the 9th and 10th centuries of the Hijra,—by Salmán of Sáwa (died about 1377; 779 a.h. ), who excelled besides in kasída and mathnawí; Kamál Khujandí, Háfiz’s friend, and protégé of Sultan Husain (776-784 a.h.); Mohammed Shirin Maghribí (died at Tabriz in 1406; 809 a.h.), an intimate friend of Kamál; Ni'mat-ulláh Wali (died 1431; 834 a.h.), the founder of a special religious order; Kásim-i-

Anwár (see above); Amir Sháhí (died 1453; 857 a.h.), of the princely family of the Sarbadárs of Sabzawár; Banná’í (died 1512; 918 a.h.), who also wrote a romantic poem, Bahram u Bihrúz·, Bábá Fighání of Shíráz (died 1519; 925 a.h.), usually called the “Little Háfiz”; Nargisí (died 1531; 938 a. H.); Lisání (died 1534; 941 a.h.), who himself was imitated by Damírí of Isfahán, Muhtasham Káshí, and Wahshí Báfikí (all three died in the last decade of the 10th century of the Hijra); Ahlí of Shíráz (died 1535; 942 a.h.), author of the Sihr-i-Halal, or “Lawful Witchcraft,” which, like Kátibí’s(died 1434; 838 a.h.) Majma l -ulbahrain, or the “Confluence of the Two Seas,” can be read in two different metres; Nau'í (died 1610; 1019 a.h.), who wrote the charming romance of a Hindu princess who burned herself in Akbar’s reign with her deceased husband on the funeral pile, styled Súz u Gudáz, or “Burning and Melting,” <fcc. Among the immediate predecessors of Háfiz in the 8th century of the Hijra, in which also Ibn Yamín, the great kit'ah-writer,^[384. A kit'ah or mukatta'ah is a poem containing moral reflexions and differs from the kasída and ghazal only by the absence of a matla' or initial distich.] flourished, the highest fame was gained by the two poets of Delhi, Amir Hasan and Amir Khosrau. The latter, who died in 1325 (725 a.h.), two years before his friend Hasan, occupies the foremost place among all the Persian poets of India by the richness of his imagination, his graphic style, and the historical interest attached to his writings. Five extensive díwáns testify to his versatility in all branches of lyric poetry, and nine large mathnawís to his mastership in the epic line. Four of the latter are poetical accounts of contemporary events during the reigns of the emperors of Delhi, 'Alá-uddín Mohammad Sháh Khiljí (1296-1311), his predecessor Fírúz Sháh, and his successor Kutb-uddín Mubárek Sháh,— the Miftah-ulfutúh, or “Key of Mysteries,” the Kiran-ussa-dain, or “The Conjunction of the Two Lucky Planets,” the Nah Sψihr, or “Nine Spheres,” and the love-story of Khidrkhan u Duwalrani. His other five mathnawís formed the first attempt ever made to imitate Nizámí’s famous Khamsah, or five romantic epopees, and this attempt turned out so well that henceforth almost all epic poets wrote quintuples of a similar description. Khwájú Kirmání (died 1352; 753 a.h.) was the next aspirant to Nizámí’s fame, with five mathnawís, among which Hamai u Humayun is the most popular, but he had to yield the palm to 'Abd-urrahmán Jámí (1414-1492; 817-898 a.h.), the last classic poet of Persia, in whose genius were summed up, as it were, all the best qualities of his great predecessors, and who combined, in a manner, the moral tone of Sa'di with the lofty aspirations of Jelál-uddín Rúmí, and the graceful ease of Háfiz’s style with the deep pathos of Nizámí, to whose Khamsah he wrote the most successful counterpart (see his Yusuf u Zalíkha mentioned above). Equally renowned are his numerous prose works, mostly on Súfic topics, and his three díwáns. Many poets followed in Jámí’s footsteps, first of all his nephew Hátifí (see above), and either wrote whole khamsahs or imitated at least one or other of Nizámí’s epopees; thus we have a Laila u Majnún, for instance, by Maktabí (1490), Hilálí (see above), and Rúh-ulamín (died 1637). But their efforts could not stop the growing corruption of taste, and it was only at the court of the Mogul emperors, particularly of the great Akbar (1556-1605), who revived Sultan Mahmúd’s “round table,” that Persian literature still enjoyed some kind of “Indian summer” in poets like Ghazálí of Mashhad or Meshed (died 1572); 'Urfí of Shíráz (died 1591), who wrote spirited kasídas, and, like his contemporaries Wahshí and Kautharí, a mathnawí, Farhad u Shirin ; and Faiçlí (died 1595), the author of the romantic poem, Nal u Daman, who also imparted new life into the rubá'í. In Persia proper [9:18:660] only Zulálí, whose clever romance of “Sultan Mahmúd and his favourite Ayáz” (1592) is widely read in the East, §á’ib (died 1677), who is commonly called the creator of a new style in lyric poetry, and, among the most modern, Hátif of Isfahán, the singer of sweet and tasteful odes (died about 1785), deserve a passing notice.

But we cannot conclude our brief survey of the national literature of Persia without calling attention to the rise of quite a novel form of Iranian poetry, the drama, which has only sprung up in the beginning of the present century. Like the Greek drama and the Mysteries of the European Middle Ages, it is the offspring of a purely religious ceremony, which for centuries has been performed annually during the first ten days of the month Moharrem,—the recital of mournful lamentations in memory of the tragic fate of the house of the caliph 'Alí, the hero of the Shí'itic Persians. Most of these passion-plays deal with the slaughter of 'Alí’s son Hosain and his family in the battle of Kerbelá. But lately this narrow range of dramatic subjects has been considerably widened; Biblical stories and even Christian legends have been brought upon the Persian stage; and there is a fair prospect of a further development of this most interesting and important movement.

In the various departments of general Persian literature, not touched upon in the foregoing pages, the same wonderful activity has prevailed as in the realm of poetry and fiction, since the first books on history and medicine appeared under the Sámánids (see above). The most important section is that of historical works, which, although deficient in sound criticism and often spoiled by a highly artificial style, supply us with most valuable materials for our own research, especially when they relate contemporary events in which the authors took part either as political agents or as mere eye-witnesses. Quite unique in this respect are the numerous histories of India, from the first invasion of Sultan Mahmúd of Ghazna to the English conquest, and even to the first decades of the present century, most of which have been described and partly translated in the eight volumes of Elliot’s History of India (1867-78). Persian writers have given us, besides, an immense variety of universal histories of the world, with many curious and noteworthy data (see, among others, Mírkhond’s and Khwándamír’s works under Mírkhond, vol. xvi. p. 499); histories of Mohammed and the first caliphs, partly translated from Arabic originals, which have been lost; detailed accounts of all the Persian dynasties, from the Ghaznawids to the still reigning Kajars, of Jenghiz Khán and the Moguls (in Juwainí’s and Wassáf’s elaborate TTríkhs), and of Tímúr and his successors (see an account of the Zafarnama under Petis de la Croix) ; histories of sects and creeds, especially the famous Dahistan, or “School of Manners” (translated by Troyer, Paris, 1843); and many local chronicles of Iran and Túrán. Next in importance to history rank geography, cosmography, and travels (for instance, the Nuzhat-ulkulúb, by Hamdalláh Mustaufí, who died in 1349, and the translations of Istakhrí’s and Kazwíní’s Arabic works), and the various tαdhkirαs or biographies of Súfís and poets, with selections in prose and verse, from the oldest of 'Aufí (about 1220) to the last and largest of all, the Makhzamulgharfìib, or “Treasure of Marvellous Matters” (completed 1803), which contains biographies and specimens of more than 3000 poets. We pass over the λvell-stocked sections of philosophy, ethics, and politics, of theology, law, and Çúfism, of mathematics and astronomy, of medicine (the oldest thesaurus of which is the “Treasure of the sháh of Khwárizm,” 1110), of Arabic, Persian, and Turkish grammar and lexicography, and only cast a parting glance at the rich collections of old Indian folk-lore and fables preserved in the Persian versions of Kalílah u Dimnah (see Rúdagí), of the Sindbadnama, the Tútináma, or “Tales of a Parrot,” and others, and at the translations of standard works of Sanskrit literature, the epopees of the Rdmáyana and Malιdbhdrαta, the Bhagavad-Gitd, the Yoga-Vasishtha, and numerous Purdnas and Upanishads, for which we are mostly indebted to the emperor Akbar’s indefatigable zeal.

A complete history of Persian literature is still a desideratum. Hammer’s Schöne Redekünste Persiens, Vienna, 1818, is altogether unsatisfactory and obsolete. Concise sketches of Persian poetry are contained in Ouseley’s Biographical Notices ; in Flügel’s article in Erseh and Gruber’s Allgemeine Enzyklopädie (1842); in Bland’s papers in the Journal of the Roy. Asiatic Society, vol. vii. p. 345 sq. and vol. ix. p. 122 sq. ; and in Barbier de Meynard’s Poésie en Perse, Paris, 1877. Real mines of information are the catalogues of Sprenger, Calcutta, 1854; Morley, London, 1854; Flügel, 3 vols., Vienna, 1865; and Rieu, 3 vols., London, 1879-83. For the first five centuries of the Hijra compare Ethé’s editions and metrical translations of “Rúdagí’s Vorläufer und Zeitgenossen,” in Morgenländische Forschungen, Leipsic, 1875; of Kisá’í’s songs, Firdausi’s lyrics, and Abú Sa'íd b. Abú ’1-Khair’s rubá'ís, in Sitzungsberichte der bayr. Akademie (1872, p. 275 sq. ; 1873, p. 622 sq.; 1874, p. 133 sq. ; 1875, p. 145 sq. ; and 1878, p. 38 sq.}·, of Avicenna’s Persian poems, in Göttinger Nachrichten, 1875, p. 555 sq. ; and of Asadí and his munázarát, in “Persische Tenzonen,” Verhandlungen des 5ten Orûntalisten-Congresses, Berlin, 1882, part ii., first half, p. 48 sq. ; Zotenberg’s Chronique de Tabari, Paris, 1867-74; Jurjání’s JVis u Rámin, edited in the Bibl. Indica, 1864 (translated into German by Graf in Z. D. Μ. G., xxiii. 375 sq. ); and Kasimirski’s Spécimen du díiuán de Mcnoutchehri, Versailles, 1876. On Khákáni, see Khanykoff’s “Mémoire,” in Journal Asiatique, 6th series, vol. iv. p. 137 sq. and v. p. 296 sq., and Salemann’s edition of his rubá'ís, with Russian transl., Petersburg, 1875; on Faríd-uddín 'Attár, Sacy’s edition of the Pandnáma, Paris, 1819, and Garcin de Tassy’s Mantik-uttair, Paris, 1857; on the Gulshan-i-ráz, E. H. Whinfield’s edition, London, 1880; and on Amir Khosrau’s mathnawís, the abstracts given in Elliot’s History of India, vol. iii. p. 524 sq. German translations of Ibn Yamín were published by Schlechta-Wssehrd, Bruchstücke, Vienna, 1852; of Jámí’s minor poems, by Rosenzweig, Vienna, 1840; by Rückert, in Zeitschrift für die Kunde des Morgenlandes, vols. v. and vi., and Zeitschrift der D. Morgenl. Gcsellsch., vols, ii., iv., v., vi., xxiv., xxv., andxxix.; and by Wickerhauser, Leipsic, 1855, and Vienna, 1858; German translation of Yúsuf u Zalíkhá, by Rosenzweig, Vienna, 1824, English by Griffith, London, 1881; French translation of Lailä u Majnún, by Chézy, Paris, 1805, German by Hartmann, Leipsic, 1807; Hilálí’s “König und Derwisch,” by Ethé, in Morgenländ. Stud., Leipsic, 1870, p. 197 sq. On the Persian drama, compare Gobineau’s Religionset Philosophies de l' Asie centrale, Paris, 1866; Chodzko’s Théâtre persan, new ed., Paris, 1878; and Ethé, “Persische Passionspiele,” in Morgenländ. Stud., p. 174 sq. (H. E.)
