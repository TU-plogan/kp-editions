PHILIP III. (1245-1285), surnamed “the Rash,” king of France, was born in 1245 and succeeded his father Louis IX. on 25th August 1270, at Tunis, where, after continuing the siege for some time, he made a truce of ten years and embarked for France in the following November. He was twice married, first to Isabella of Aragon in 1258, and subsequently to Mary of Brabant. He died at Perpignan on 5th October 1285. See France, vol. ix. p. 544.
