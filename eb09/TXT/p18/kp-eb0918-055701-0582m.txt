PERRONE, Giovanni (1794-1876), Roman Catholic theologian, was born at Chieri (Piedmont) in 1794, studied theology at Turin, and in his twenty-first year went to Rome, where he joined the Society of Jesus, and, after his ordination to the priesthood, became a teacher in the Collegium Romanum. From Ferrara, where he was rector of the Jesuit college after 1830, he returned to his teaching work in Rome, being made head of his old college in 1850. He died on 26th August 1876. He was the author of numerous dogmatic works, which, as clearly and faithfully reflecting the prevailing tendencies of Roman theology, obtained wide currency and were extensively translated. They may still be regarded as representing most nearly the modern orthodoxy of his church. The Praelectiones Theologicae may be specially named (1st ed. 1835, 31st ed. 1866).
