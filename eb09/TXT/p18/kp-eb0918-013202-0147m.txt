PAeONY(Paeonia), a genus of Ranunculaceae remarkable for their gorgeous flowers, constructed almost exactly on the same lines as those of the common buttercup except as regards the pistil, which in the paeonies consists of two or more separate carpels each containing several seeds, and surrounded at the base by a fleshy cup or disk, which grows up around the carpels. The receptacle of the flower, moreover, instead of being flattish or somewhat convex, is in paeonies a little depressed in the centre, so that the stamens become somewhat perigynous as in water-lilies (Nymphaea) or roses (Rosa). The carpels when ripe form dry follicles, splitting along one edge so as to expose the numerous shining black seeds, provided with a small fleshy aril. There are but few species, natives of the northern hemisphere of the Old World, and divisible into two main groupsâ€”those with herbaceous stems dying down in winter, and those with shrubby stems (Moutan or Tree Paeonies). The herbaceous paeonies have tuberous roots like those of a dahlia, and bold, much-divided leaves. Their magnificent cup-like flowers are, in different varieties, of all shades of colour from white to clear yellow (P. Wittman-niana), rose-coloured, and richest crimson. A blue paeony has yet to be introduced. There is little reason to doubt that this desideratum will be fulfilled, for in larkspurs and aconites and columbines, closely related genera, we have a similar range in colour to that of the paeony, together with intense blue. The writer has also seen a Chinese drawing representing a blue paeony, and, although too much stress must not be laid on that circumstance, yet it must be remembered that the correctness of some representations of Chinese plants formerly considered fanciful has been proved by the subsequent introduction of the plant, e.g., Dielytra spectabilis. The Moutan or tree paeonies have an erect bushy stem, from which the bark peels off in flakes; the foliage is divided as in the commoner kinds, and more or less glaucous. The flowers are remarkable for the extreme delicacy of tint, and botanically by the large development of the disk above mentioned. Moutan paeonies are natives of China. In gardens a large variety of paeonies are cultivated, chiefly of hybrid origin; and one of the European species, P. corallina, has been found naturalized on an island in the mouth of the Severn, to which it is supposed to have been introduced.
