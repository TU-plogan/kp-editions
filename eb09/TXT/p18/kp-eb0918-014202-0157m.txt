PALADIN (Lat., palatinus} literally means a courtier, a member of a royal household, one connected with a palace. The palatium of the Roman emperors on the Palatine Hill supplied a name for all the royal and imperial residences in mediaeval Europe, and a corresponding adjective and noun for royal officials and dependants. From being applied to the famous twelve peers of Charlemagne, the word paladin became a general term in romance for knights of great prowess.
