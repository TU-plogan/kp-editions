PETER of Blois, otherwise known as Petrus Blesensis, a writer of the 12th century, was born at Blois in France about the year 1120. He studied theology at Paris, where one of his teachers was John of Salisbury, who exercised a considerable influence over him; he afterwards resided for some time as a student of law at Bologna. He was then appointed preceptor to William II. of Sicily, and in 1167 made keeper of the privy seal (sigillifer); political occurrences, however, compelled his return in the following year to France, whence he was invited into England by Henry II., who made him his private secretary. About 1176 he withdrew from court and entered the household of Richard, archbishop of Canterbury, whose chancellor he became.

This office he also held under Baldwin, Richardâ€™s successor, by whom he was sent to Rome in 1187 to support his cause in the controversy with the monks of Canterbury. Peter died about 1200.

His writings, which cover all the fields of intellectual activity then accessible, show him to have been one of the most widely and deeply learned men of his age. They include a number of allegorizing sermons and edifying tracts, a hortatory address, De Jeresolymitana peregrinatione acceleranda, a discourse Contra perfidiam Judaeorum, and, most interesting for its bearing on the political and ecclesiastical history of his time, a collection of 183 letters to Henry II., as well as to various popes, prelates, and scholars, including his old master John of Salisbury. The best edition of his works is that of Pierre de Goussaiuville, Paris, 1667, fol.
