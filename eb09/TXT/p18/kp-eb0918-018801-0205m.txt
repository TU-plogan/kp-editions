PALLADIUM, an archaic wooden image {ξoavov) of Pallas, preserved in the citadel of Troy as a pledge of the safety of the city. It represented the goddess, standing in the stiff archaic style, holding the spear in her right hand. According to one story, Zeus had thrown it down from heaven when Ilus was founding the city of Ilium. Odysseus and Diomedes carried it off from the temple of Pallas, and thus made the capture of Troy possible. Many different cities boasted that this ancient image had passed into their possession—Athens, Argos, Rome, Lavinium, Ac. It is probable that the Palladium is an image of the warlike goddess Pallas, who must in origin be distinguished from Athena. The theft of the Palladium is a frequent subject in Greek art, especially of the earlier time.
