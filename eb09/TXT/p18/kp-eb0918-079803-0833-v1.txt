PHOCAeA, in ancient geography, was one of the cities of Ionia, on the western coast of Asia Minor. It was the most northern of the Ionian cities, and was situated on the coast of the peninsula that separates the Gulf of Cyme, which was occupied by Aeolian settlers, from the Hermaean Gulf, on which stood Smyrna and Clazomenae.^[1. It was said to have been founded by a band of emigrants from Phocis, under the guidance of two Athenian leaders, named Philogenes and Damon, but it joined the Ionian confederacy by accepting the government of Athenian rulers of the house of Codrus.] Its advantageous position between two good harbours, called Naustathmus and Lampter, is pointed out by Livy (xxxvii. 31), and was probably the cause which led the inhabitants to devote themselves from an early period to maritime pursuits. We are expressly told by Herodotus that the Phocaeans were the first of all the Greeks who undertook distant voyages and made known to their countrymen the coasts of the Adriatic, as well as those of Tyrrhenia and Spain. In the latter country they established friendly relations with Arganthonius, king of Tartessus, who even invited them to emigrate in a body to settle in his dominions, and, on their declining this offer, [>resented them with a large sum of money. This they employed in constructing a strong wall of fortification around their city, a defence which stood them in good stead when the Ionian cities were attacked by Cyrus in 546. On that occasion they refused to submit when besieged by Harpagus, the general of Cyrus; but, mistrusting their power of ultimate resistance, they determined to abandon their city, and, embarking their wives and children and most valuable effects, to seek a new home in the western regions, where they had already founded several flourishing colonies, among others those of Alalia in Corsica and the important city of Massilia in the south of Gaul. A large part of the emigrants, however, relented, and, after having proceeded only as far as Chios, returned to Phocaea, where they submitted to the Persian yoke. The rest, however, having bound themselves by a solemn oath never to return, proceeded to Corsica, where they settled for a time; but, being afterwards expelled from the island, they founded the colony of Velia or Elea in southern Italy.

Phocaea continued to exist under the Persian government, but greatly reduced in population and commerce, so that, although it joined in the revolt of the Ionians against Persia in 500, it was only able to send three ships to the combined fleet that fought at Lade. Nor did it ever again assume a prominent part among the Ionian cities, and it is rarely mentioned in Greek history. But at a later period it was sufficiently powerful to oppose a vigorous resistance to the Roman praetor Aemilius during the war against Antiochus in 191. On that occasion the town was taken and plundered, but it continued to survive, and we learn from its coins that it was a place of some importance throughout the Roman empire. The ruins still visible on the site bear the name of Palea Foggia, but they are of little interest. A small town in the immediate neighbourhood, known as Nova Foggia, appears to date only from Byzantine times.
