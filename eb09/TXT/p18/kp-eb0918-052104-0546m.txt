PERCEVAL, Amand-Pierre Caussin de (1795-1871), Orientalist, was born at Paris, where his father was professor of Arabic in the Collège de France, on 13th January 1795. In 1814 he went to Constantinople as a student interpreter, and afterwards travelled in Asiatic Turkey, spending a year with the Maronites in the Lebanon, and finally becoming dragoman at Aleppo. Returning to Paris, he became professor of vulgar Arabic in the school of living Oriental languages in 1821, and also professor of Arabic in the Collège de France in 1833. In 1849 he was elected to the Academy of Inscriptions. He died at Paris during the siege, 15th January 1871, regretted not only for his ripe scholarship but for the gentleness and modesty of a character which represented the best features of the old school of French savants.

Caussin de Perceval published a useful Grammaire Arabe vulgaire, which passed through several editions (4th ed. 1858), and edited and enlarged Bocthor’s Dictionnaire Français-Arabe (3d ed. 1864); but his great reputation rests almost entirely on one book, the Essai sur l'histoire des Arabes (3 vols., Paris, 1847-48), in which the native traditions as to the early history of the Arabs, down to the death of Mohammed and the complete subjection of all the tribes to Islam, are brought together with wonderful industry and set forth with much learning and lucidity. One of the principal MS. sources used is the great Kitáb al-Aghány, which has since been published in Egypt; but no publication of texts can deprive the Essai, which is now unhappily very scarce, of its value as a trustworthy guide through a tangled mass of tradition.
