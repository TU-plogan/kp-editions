PENNI, Gianfrancesco (1488-1528), Italian painter, surnamed “Il Fattore,” from the relation in which he stood to Raphael, whose favourite disciple he was after Giulio Romano, was a native of Florence, but spent the latter years of his life in Naples. He painted in oil as well as in fresco, but is chiefly known for his work in the Loggie of the Vatican.
