PALUDAN-MÜLLER, Frederik (1809-1876), the leading poet of Denmark during the middle of the present century, was born at Kjerteminde on the 7th February 1809. His father was Jens Paludan-Miiller, a distinguished bishop of Aarhuus. He was educated at the cathedral school of Odense from 1820 to 1828; in the latter year he passed to the university of Copenhagen. In 1832 he opened his career as a poet with Four Romances, and a romantic comedy entitled Kjaerlighed ved Hoffet (“Love at Court ”). This enjoyed a great success, and was succeeded in 1833 by Dandserinden {“ The Dancer”), and in 1834 by the lyrical drama of Amor og Psyche. There was now no doubt about Paludan-Miiller’s genius. In 1835 he came under the influence of Byron, and published an Oriental tale, Zuleimas Flugt (“Zuleima’s Flight”), which was less successful than the preceding books. But he regained all that he had lost by his two volumes of Poems in 1836 and 1838. Paludan-Miiller now left his native country for the first time, and spent two years (1838-40) in Germany, Italy, and France. The next dates in his career are those of the publication of his principal masterpieces— his lyrical dramas, Venus, 1841; Dryadens Bryllup (“The Dryad’s Wedding ”), 1844; Tithon (f i Tithonus ”), 1844; and his famous didactico-humoristic epic Adam Homo, in three volumes, 1841-48. His later works include Abels Död (“The Death of Abel ”), 1854; Kalanus, an Indian tragedy; Paradiset (“Paradise”), a lyrical drama, 1861; Benedikt fra Nurcia, 1861; Tideme Skifte ( “The Times are Changing”), a comedy, 1874; and Adonis, an exquisite romance in verse, 1874. Besides these works, all of which are poetical, Paludan-Miiller published a story, Ungdomskilden (“ The Fountain of Youth”), in 1865, and an historical novel in three volumes, Ivar Lykke's Historie (“The Story of Ivar Lykke”), 1866-73. The poet lived a very retired life, first in Copenhagen, then for many years in a cottage on the outskirts of the royal park of Fredensborg. He died in his house in Ny Adelgade, Copenhagen, on the 27th December 1876.

Paludan-Miiller’s genius has been made the subject of one of the most brilliant of George Brandes’s monographs. His work was varied, but of remarkably high and level merit. His lyrical dramas form a group of pure poems, of an elevated class, which would distinguish him above most of the European poets of his time, even if he had not shown himself, in Adam Homo, to be a great satirist as well. His artistic form was singularly fine. He might have been a more finished thinker if his imagination had not been disturbed by Byron. The reader who desires to study Paludan-Miiller at his best must read the first book of Adam Homo, and the whole of Kalanus and of Adonis. His poetical works were collected in eight volumes in 1878-79.
