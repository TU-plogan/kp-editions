PHILEMON, Epistle to. This, which is the shortest of the extant epistles of St Paul, stands to the other books of the New Testament in a relation similar to that of the book of Ruth to the other books of the Old Testament. It is an idyl of domestic life. Onesimus, the slave of one of Paul’s converts in Asia Minor, had run away from his master, probably, as was often the case with runaways, after stealing some of his money. He had come to Paul, more probably at Rome than, as some have thought, at Caesarea, and Paul had converted him. Paul sends him back to his master, begging that he may be kindly treated as being now a brother Christian, and formally undertaking to repay what he owed. The epistle is addressed not only to Philemon but to Apphia, who was probably his wife, to Archippus (possibly the head of the community at Colossae or Laodicea, Col. iv. 17), and to the community which either, like some of the Roman collegia, consisted of Philemon’s household or held its meetings in his house. It has sometimes been regarded as an appendix to the epistle to the Colossians on the grounds (1) that Onesimus was sent with both letters (Col. iv. 9 Philem. 10-12), (2) that in both letters salutations are sent to Archippus (Col. iv. 17; Philem. 2), and (3) that the same persons are mentioned in both letters as being with Paul at the time of writing (Col. i. 1, iv. 7-14; Philem. 1, 23, 24). This apparent connexion with the epistle to the Colossians is the basis of the chief arguments which have been used against its genuineness. Baur (Paul, E. T., vol. ii. p. 84) thinks that this “attractive, graceful, and friendly letter” is merely a practical commentary, in the form of a fiction, on the general conception of the relations of masters to Christian slaves which is set forth in Col. iv. 1. But this view has few supporters. The genuineness of the epistle is almost universally admitted. The best modern works upon it are Bishop Lightfoot’s Colossians and. Philemon (3d ed., London, 1879) and Holtzmann’s essay, “Der Brief an Philemon,” in the Zeitschr. f. wissensclι. Theol., 1873, p. 428.
