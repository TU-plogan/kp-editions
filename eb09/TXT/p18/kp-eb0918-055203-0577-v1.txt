PÉRONNE, chief town of an arrondissement of the department of the Somme, France, and a fortified place on the right bank of that river at its confluence with the stream called the Doingt or Cologne, lies 94 miles northnorth-east of Paris on the railway from Paris to Cambrai. Wet moats surround the ramparts, which are built of brick. The church of St Jean (1509-1525) was greatly damaged during the bombardment of 1870-71, but has since been restored. The castle of Péronne, in one of the bastions of the enceinte, was partially destroyed by fire in 1877; it still retains four large conical-roofed towers dating from the Middle Ages, one of which is said to have been the prison of Louis XI., when he had his famous encounter with Charles the Bold (1468). The town-hall, which was built in the 16th century, has an elegant campanile of modern construction. The population of Péronne in 1881 was 4696.

The Frankish kings had a villa at Péronne, which Clovis II. gave to Erchinoaldus, mayor of the palace. The latter founded a monastery here, and raised in honour of St Furey a collegiate church, which was a wealthy establishment until the Revolution; it is the burial-place of Charles the Simple, who died of starvation in a dungeon in Péronne, into which he had been thrown by the count of Vermandois (929). After the death of Philip of Alsace Péronne, which he had inherited through his wife, escheated to the French crown (1199), and in 1209 received a charter with municipal privileges from Philip Augustus. By the treaty of Arras (1435) it was given to the Burgundians; bought back by Louis XI., it passed again into the hands of Charles the Bold in 1465. On the death of Charles, however, in 1477, Louis XI. resumed possession. In 1536 the emperor Charles V. besieged Péronne, but without success; in its defence a woman called Marie Fourré greatly distinguished herself, and the anniversary of the raising of the siege was celebrated at Péronne for many years. It was the first town after Paris at which the League was proclaimed in 1577. Peronne’s greatest misfortunes occurred during the late Franco-German war. It was invested on 27th December 1870, and bombarded from the 28th to the 9th of the following January, upon which date, on account of the sufferings of the civil population, among whom smallpox had broken out, it was compelled to capitulate. Out of 700 houses 600 were [9:18:553] more or less injured and eighty-two buildings set on fire; the tower of the church of St Jean was also burnt, its roofing and timber-work destroyed, and the bells melted by the flames. This damage has since been repaired.
