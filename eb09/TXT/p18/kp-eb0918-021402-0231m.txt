PANTAeNUS, head of the catechetical school at Alexandria at the close of the 2d Christian century, is known chiefly as having been the master of Clement, who succeeded him. Eιisebius and Jerome speak of him as having been, originally at least, a Stoic, and as having been sent, on account of his zeal and learning, as a missionary to “India”—Yemen perhaps being meant. He was the author of commentaries on various books of Scripture, all of which have been lost with the exception of a few insignificant fragments. His teaching work in Alexandria seems to have begun before 180 a.d., and it was brought to an end by the persecution of Septimius Severus in 202.
