PHILIP, “the evangelist,” is first mentioned in the Acts (vi. 5) as one of “the seven” who were chosen to attend to certain temporal affairs of the church in Jerusalem in consequence of the murmurings of the Hellenists against the Hebrews. After the martyrdom of Stephen he went to Samaria, where he preached with much success, Simon Magus being one of his converts. He afterwards instructed and baptized the Ethiopian eunuch on the road between Jerusalem and Gaza; next he was “caught away” by the Spirit and “found at Azotus” (Ashdod), whence “passing through he preached in all the cities till he came to Caesarea” (Acts viii.). Here some years afterwards, according to Acts xxi. 8, 9, he entertained Paul and his companion on their way to Jerusalem; at that time “he had four daughters which did prophesy.” At a very early period he came to be confounded with the subject of the preceding notice (q.v.} ; the confusion was all the more easy because, while he undoubtedly could in a certain well-understood sense of the word be called an “apostle,” writers naturally refrained from applying to him the more ambiguous designation of “evangelist.” “Philip the deacon” is commemorated on 6th June.
