PALMA, Jacopo, a painter of the Venetian school, was born at Serinalta near Bergamo, towards 1480, and is said to have died at the age of forty-eight, or towards 1528. He is currently named Palma Vecchio (Old Palma) to distinguish him from Palma Giovane, his grandnephew, a much inferior painter. About the facts of his life little is known. He is reputed to have been a companion and competitor of Lorenzo Lotto, and to some extent a pupil of Titian, after arriving in Venice early in the 16th century; he may also have been the master of Bonifazio. His earlier works are in the older manner, and betray the influence of the Bellini; but, modifying his style from the study of Giorgione and Titian, Palma took high rank among those painters of the distinctively Venetian type who remain a little below the leading masters. For richness[9:18:192] and suffusion of colour he is hardly to be surpassed; but neither in invention, strength of character, nor vigorous draughtsmanship does he attain any peculiar excellence. His finish is great, his draperies ample, his flesh golden-hued. He painted many fine portraits. A face frequently seen in his pictures is that of his daughter Violante, of whom Titian was more or less enamoured. Two works by Palma are more particularly celebrated. The first is a composition of six paintings in the Venetian church of S. Maria Formosa, with St Barbara in the centre, under the dead Christ, and to right and left Sts Dominic, Sebastian, John Baptist, and Anthony. The second work is in the Dresden Gallery, representing three sisters seated in the open air (presumably the painter’s daughters); it is frequently named The Three Graces. Other leading examples are—the Last Supper, in S. Maria Mater Domini; a Madonna, in the church of S. Stefano in Vicenza; the Epiphany, in the Brera of Milan; the Holy Family, with a young shepherd adoring, in the Louvre; St Stephen and other Saints, Christ and the Widow of Nain, and the Assumption of the Virgin, in the Accademia of Venice; and Christ at Emmaus, in the Pitti Gallery. Palma’s grand nephew, Palma Giovane, was also named Jacopo (1∙544 to about 1626). His works, which are extremely numerous in Venice, and many of them on a vast scale, belong to the decline of Venetian art.
