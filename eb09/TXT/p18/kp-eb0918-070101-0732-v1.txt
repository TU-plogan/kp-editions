PETERHEAD, a seaport, market town, burgh of barony, and parliamentary burgh of Aberdeenshire, Scotland, is situated on a rocky peninsula on the North Sea, about 30 miles north-north-east of Aberdeen and 2 north of Buchan Ness. It has railway communication by a section of the Great North of Scotland line, opened in 1862. The town is built of the red granite of the district. At the extremity of the peninsula is the insular suburb of Keith-Inch. Among the principal buildings are the town-hall (1788), with a granite spire 125 feet high, the music hall, and the court-house. The reading society (1808) possesses a library with upwards of 5000 volumes, and the mechanics’ institute one with about 1000 volumes. The Arbuthnot Museum contains natural history specimens, a collection of coins, and objects of antiquarian interest. In front of the town-hall is a statue to Field-Marshal Keith (1696- 1758), presented to the burgh by William I. of Prussia in 1868. A market cross was erected in 1832 when the town was created a parliamentary burgh. Peterhead at an early period had an extensive trade with the ports of the Baltic, the Levant, and America. Formerly it was a bonding subport to Aberdeen, but was made independent in 1832. The north and south harbours lie between the town and Keith-Inch, and the isthmus dividing them is pierced by a canal, which is crossed by an iron swing-bridge. In the north harbour are two graving-docks. A new harbour was completed in 1878, and the south harbour has been deepened and enlarged. The south bay is to be converted into a national harbour of refuge. The Arctic seal and whale fishing, which in 1802 was prosecuted by only one vessel, employed in 1857 as many as 32 vessels, but since that time it has declined somewhat. The herring fishing, in which the port has long held a leading position (631 boats in 1883), was begun in 1818 by a joint-stock company. The general trade is of considerable importance. The chief exports are herrings (£180,000 in 1883), granite, cattle, and agricultural produce. In 1883 the number of vessels that entered the port with cargoes and in ballast was 864 of 87,839 tons, the number that cleared 840 of 86,318 tons. The town possesses ship and boat building [9:18:702] yards, saw-mills, an iron-foundry, cooperages, agricultural implement works, woollen manufactories, breweries, and a distillery. In the neighbourhood there are extensive granite and polishing works. The limits of the police burgh and the parliamentary burgh are identical, with a population in 1871 of 8535 and in 1881 of 10,922.

The town and lands of Peterhead belonged anciently to the abbey of Deer, built by William Cumming, earl of Buchan, in the 13th century. When the abbey was erected into a temporal lordship in the family of Keith, the superiority of the town fell to the earl marischal, with whom it continued till the forfeiture of the earldom in 1715. The town and lands were purchased in 1720 by a fishing company in England, and on their failure by the Merchant Maiden Hospital of Edinburgh for £3000, who are still the superiors of the town. Peterhead was made a burgh of barony in 1593 by George Keith, fourth earl marischal of Scotland. It was the scene of the landing of the Pretender, 25th December 1715. Peterhead is included in the Elgin district of burghs.
