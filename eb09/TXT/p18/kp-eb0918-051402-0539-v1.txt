PENZA, a government of eastern Russia, bounded on the N. by Nijni Novgorod, on the E. by Simbirsk, and on the S. and W. by Saratoff and Tamboff, and having an area of 15,000 square miles. The surface is undulating, with deep valleys and ravines, but even in its highest parts it does not reach more than 600 to 900 feet above sealevel. It is chiefly made up of Cretaceous sandstones, sands, marls, and chalk, covered in the east by Eocene deposits. Chalk, potter’s clay, peat, and iron are the chief mineral products, in the north. The soil is a black earth, more or less mixed with clay and sand; the only marshes of any extent occur in the Krasnoslobodsk district; and considerable sand-areas appear in the broad valleys of the larger rivers. There are extensive forests in the north, but the south shows the characteristic features of a steppeland. The government is watered by the Moksha, the Sura (both navigable), and the Khoper, belonging respectively to the Oka, Volga, and Don systems. Timber is floated down several smaller streams, while the Moksha and Sura are important means of conveyance for grain, spirits, timber, metals, and oils. The climate is harsh and continental, the average temperature at Penza being only 39° - 8 (12° - 2 in January and 68° - 5 in July).

The population—1,356,600 in 1881, and in 1884 estimated at about 1,465,000—consists principally of Russians, mixed to some extent with Mordvinians; there are also about 150,000 Mordvinians who are to a large extent Russified; some 40,000 Mescheryaks, who have undergone the same process still more fully; and 60,000 Tatars, who still keep their own religion, language, and customs. The Russians profess the Greek faith, and very many, especially in the north, are Raskolniks. Somewhat less than 10 per cent, of the population (133,250 in 1881) live in towns; the chief occupation of the inhabitants is agriculture, 61 per cent, of the soil being arable. Wheat and millet are raised only to a limited extent, the chief crops being rye, oats, buckwheat, hemp, potatoes, and beetroot. The averages for 1870-77 were 3,900,000 quarters of corn and 1,779,200 bushels of potatoes. The chief centres of corn export are Penza, Narovtchat, and Golovinshtchina. Market-gardening is successfully [9:18:515] carried on in several districts, and improved varieties of fruit-trees are being introduced through the imperial botanical garden at Penza and a private school of gardening in the Gorodishtche district. Fourteen per cent, of the area is under meadows or grazing land; and in 1881 there were within the government 244,000 head of cattle, 383,000 horses, and 235,000 pigs. Sheep-breeding is especially developed in Tchembar and Insar (670,000 sheep, including 72,000 of finer breeds, in 1881). The Mordvinians are very partial to beekeeping. The forests (620,000 acres) are a considerable source of wealth, especially in Krasnoslobodsk and Gorodishtche, whence timber, a variety of wooden wares, and also pitch and tar are exported to the south. As many as 30 per cent, of the adult male population leave the government in search of employment, either on the Volga or in southern Russia.

The manufactures are few, employing only 13,300 hands. The yearly returns in 1879 did not exceed 13,325,000 roubles (£1,332,500). The distilleries come first (£973,200), followed by the woollen cloth industry (£237,000), the paper industry (£37,200), tanneries, soap-works, glass-works, machine-works, iron-works, and beetroot-sugar factories. Trade, which has been favoured by the completion of the railway from Tula to Samara, is still limited to the export of corn, spirits, timber, hemp-seed oil, tallow, hides, honey, wax, some woollen cloth, potash, and cattle, the chief centres for trade being Penza, Nijni Lomoff, Mokshan, Saransk, Krasnoslobodsk, and Golovinshtchina.

The government is divided into ten districts, the chief towns of which are :—Penza (41,650), Gorodishtche (3200), Insar (5230), Kerensk (12,450), Krasnoslobodsk (7000), Mokshan (13,050), Narovtchat (5150), Nijni Lomoff (10,500), Saransk (13,450), and Tchembar (5320). Troitsk (5700), Verkíinii Lomoff (7300), and Sheshkéeff (3500) also have municipal institutions.

The present government of Penza was formerly inhabited by Mordvinians, who had the Mescheryaks in the west, the Bulgars in the north, ajιd the Burtases in the south. In the 13th century these populations fell under the dominion of the Tatars, with whom they fought against Moscow. As early as the 14th century they possessed the town of Narovtchat. The Russians penetrated into the country in the 16th century, founding the town of Mokshan in 1535, and several others in the course of that and the following centuries. Penza was founded in the beginning of the 17th century, the permanent Russian settlement dating as far back as 1666. Its wooden fort, on the site of the present cathedral of the Saviour, protected the neighbourhood against risings of the Mordvinians and Mescheryaks. In 1776 it was taken by Pugatcheff. The town was almost totally destroyed by the great conflagrations of 1836, 1839, and 1858.
