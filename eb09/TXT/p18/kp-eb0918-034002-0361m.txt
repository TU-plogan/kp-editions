PASKEWITCH, Ivan Fedoro witch (1782-1856), prince of Warsaw, and general-in-chief of the Russian army, was descended from an old and wealthy family, and was born at Poltava 8th May 1782. He was educated at the imperial institution for pages, where his progress was so rapid that after his first examination he received the promise of a lieutenant’s commission in the guards, and was named aide-de-camp to the emperor. His first active service was in 1805, in the auxiliary army sent to the assistance of Austria against France, when he took part in the battle of Austerlitz. From 1807 to 1812 he was engaged in the campaigns against Turkey, and distinguished himself by many brilliant and daring exploits. During the French war of 1812-14 he was present, in command of the 26th division of infantry, at all the most important engagements; at the battle of Leipsic he took 4000 prisoners. On the outbreak of war with Persia in 1826 he was appointed second in command, and, succeeding in the following year to the chief command, gained rapid and brilliant successes which compelled the shah to sue for peace 19th February 1828. In reward of his services he was raised by the emperor to the rank of count of the empire, with the surname of Erivan, and received a million of roubles and ã diamond-mounted sword. From Persia he was sent to Turkey in Asia, and, having captured in rapid succession the fortresses of Kars, Erzeroum, and Akalkalaki, he was at the end of the campaign made a field marshal. In 1831 he was entrusted with the command of the army sent to suppress the revolt of Poland, and after the fall of Warsaw, which gave the death-blow to Polish independence, he was raised to the dignity of prince of Warsaw, and created viceroy of the kingdom of Poland. In this position he is said to have manifested the highest qualities as an administrator, and in his relations with the kings of Prussia and Austria he secured their confidence and esteem. On the outbreak of the insurrection of Hungary in 1848 he was appointed to the command of the Russian troops sent to the aid of Austria, and finally compelled the insurgents to lay down their arms at Vilagos. In April 1854 he again took the field in command of the army of the Danube, but on the 9th June, at Silistria, where he suffered defeat, he received a contusion which compelled him to retire from active service. He died 29th January 1856
