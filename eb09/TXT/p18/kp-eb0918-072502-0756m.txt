PFAFF, Christian Heinrich (1773-1852), chemist and physicist, younger brother of J. F. Pfaff noticed below, took his degree as doctor of medicine at Stuttgart in 1793. He travelled with a noble family as physician, and practised for a time at Heidenheim; but he afterwards became professor (extraordinary in 1797, ordinary in 1801) of medicine, physics, and chemistry at the university of Kiel. He was a most prolific author of memoirs on sanitary and medical, and especially on chemical and physical, subjects. His work in chemistry was chiefly analytical and mineralogical. In physics he was distinguished as one of the earlier experimenters with the voltaic current, and had a considerable share in the experimental investigation of its properties. He also made important researches on the carrying power of magnets, more particularly on the effect of the extent of the attracting surface. Comparatively few of his memoirs are now quoted, owing to the fact that none of his results contained any capital discovery; nevertheless he deserves to be remembered as one of the energetic workmen who aided in raising the stately pile of modern experimental science.
