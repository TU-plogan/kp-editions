PERVIGILIUM VENERIS, the Vigil of Venus, a short Latin poem, in praise of spring as the season of love and flowers. Written professedly in early spring on the eve of a three-nights’ festival (Vigil) in honour of Venus (probably April 1-3), it describes in warm and poetical language the annual aλvakening of the vegetable and animal world in spring through the all-pervading influence of the foam-born goddess, whose birth and connexion with Rome and the Caesars are also touched upon. The joyous tone which runs through the poem passes suddenly at the close into one of lyric sadness: “The nightingale is singing, but I am silent. When comes my spring ?” It consists of ninety-three verses in trochaic tetrameter catalectic and is divided into strophes of unequal length by the refrain, “Cras amet qui nunquam amavit; quique amavit cras amet.” The author, date, and place of composition are unknown. Formerly it was ascribed to Catullus, but from its late Latinity, approximating in some points to Italian,^[1. Thus de is very frequently used like Italian di; totae (v. 22) instead of omnes, Itai, tutti ; and mαηe (ib. ) in the sense of “to-morrow, Itai, domani. ] it can hardly have been earlier, and was probably later, than the latter half of the 2d century a.d. It is certainly earlier than Fulgentius (about 480-550 a.d.), who imitated it. The references to Hybla and Etna (or Enna), from which some have thought that the poem is Sicilian, need be no more than poetical allusions to Sicily as the flowery land. Virgil’s description of spring (Georg., ii. 323-342) is imitated somewhat closely; compare especially verse 62 with Virgil’s 327; again, v. 85 is a copy of Aeneid, xi. 458. This seems to disprove Bernhardy’s conjecture that the poem is a translation from the Greek. From its exuberant rhetoric Orelli ascribes it to an African poet of the 3d or 4th century a.d. Bücheler places it between Florus and Nemesianus, i.e., in the 2d or 3d century a.d. Wernsdorf suggested as its author Annius Florus in the time of Hadrian; Heidtmann conjectured Appuleius; Baehrens refers it to Tiberianus, a poet of the 4th century. But there are not data enough to determine the authorship.

The Pervigilium is preserved in the Paris MSS. 10318 (Codex Salmasiaηus') and 8071 (Codex Thuancus or Pithoeanus'); the former (the better of the two) belongs to the 7th or beginning of the 8th century, the latter to the 9th or beginning of the 10th. They differ too much to have been copied from the same original. The age of the MSS. refutes the theory, sometimes broached, that the poem is modern. The first edition was published by Lipsius at Antwerp in 1611; and there are modern editions by Wernsdorf (Poetae Latini Minores, vol. iií), Orelli (1832), Bücheler (1859), Baehrens (1877). There are translations into English verse by Thomas Stanley (1651) and Parnell, into prose by W. K. Kelly; a French translation by Sanadon; a German one by Kirchner.
