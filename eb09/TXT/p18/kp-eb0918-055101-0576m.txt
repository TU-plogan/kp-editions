PERM, capital of the above government, stands on the left bank of the Kama, on the great highway to Siberia, 930 miles north-east from Moscow. During summer it has regular steam communication with Kazan, 685 miles distant, and it is connected by rail with Ekaterinburg. The town is mostly built of wood, with broad streets and wide squares, and has a somewhat poor aspect, especially when compared with Ekaterinburg. It is the see of a bishop, and has an ecclesiastical seminary and a military school. The manufactures are few; the Government manufactory of steel guns and munitions of war, in the immediate neighbourhood of the town, turns out about 1600 tons of guns annually. The aggregate production of the private manufactories of all kinds did not exceed <£165,000 in 1879; they included tanneries (£78,600), distilleries (£61,000), rope-works (£9500), brick-works, breweries, soap and candle works, iron-wire and copper-ware works. Numerous flour-mills and several oil-works occur within the district. The town derives its commercial importance as being the chief place of storage for merchandise to and from Siberia (tea, metals and metal-wares, skins, leather, butter, wool, bristles, tallow, cedar nuts, linseed, <kc.), which is unshipped here from the steamers coming up the Kama, and despatched by rail or on cars and sledges to Siberia, or vice versa. The trade is chiefly in the hands of Nijni Novgorod, Kazan, Ekaterinburg, and Siberian merchants. The population of Perm in 1879 was 32,350.

The present site of Perm was occupied, as early as the year 1568, by a settlement named Brukhanovo, founded by one of the Strogonoffs; this settlement seems to have received the name of Perm in the 17th century. The Yagozhikhinsky copper-work was founded in the immediate neighbourhood in 1723, and in 1781 it received officially the name of Perm, and became an administrative centre both for the country and for - the mining region. The mining authorities left Perm for Ekaterinburg in 1830.
