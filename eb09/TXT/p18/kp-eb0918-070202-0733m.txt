PETERS, or Peter, Hugh (1598-1660), a man whose name has for three centuries been rarely mentioned except in terms of infamy, was the son of Thomas Dyckwoode alias Peters, by Martha, daughter of John Freffry of Fowey, Cornwall, and was baptized in Fowey parish church 29th June 1598. His parents were in good circumstances, and they sent him to Trinity College, Cambridge, where he took the degree of B.A. in 1616 and Μ. A. in 1622. About the latter date he was licensed by Dr George Montaigne, bishop of London, to the lectureship at St Sepulchre’s, London, but his first definite post in the church was at Rotterdam (1623-32), as colleague of William Ames, whom he much admired, and who died “in his bosom.” In October 1635 he emigrated to Boston in New England, and in the following year became the minister of the first church at Salem in Massachusetts. His abilities soon gave him a prominent place in all the civil and ecclesiastical affairs of the colony, and in 1641 his reputation was so great that he was sent to England as the best guardian of the colony’s interests at home. His shrewd judgment, his ready wit, and his zeal for the cause of the Parliament endeared him to the army and its leaders; he accompanied Fairfax and Cromwell on their campaigns, and described their achievements in numerous letters to the House of Commons. To the adherents of the vanquished cause Hugh Peters always lent his good offices. He was desirous that Laud should be banished, and not executed. It was through his influence that Juxon was permitted to attend Charles after his condemnation, and his acts of kindness to some of the Royalist clergy are mentioned in Walker’s Sufferings of the Clergy. Through the favour of the Protector he filled several important offices. He was one of the twenty-one persons appointed to consider the abuses of the national laws; he was a judge for granting probates of wills, and a trier for licensing candidates to the ministry. At the Restoration he was seized and imprisoned in the Tower of London, where he composed his affecting tract, “A Dying Father’s Last Legacy to an Only Child.” His trial as a regicide took place on 13th October 1660, and he was, of course, condemned to death. Four days later he was drawn on a sledge to Charing Cross and there hanged and quartered, his head being set on a pole on London Bridge. Hugh Peters suffered his cruel death without any sign of wavering. For many years after his death the grossest charges against his memory were circulated in catchpenny pamphlets by his enemies, and his name was held up to general execration; but it is clear that these accusations are but the creation of party malice. He was twice married; his first wife was Elizabeth, said to have been the daughter of Thomas Cooke of Pebmarsh, Essex, and the widow of Edmund Read, who died at Wickford in the same county November 1623. She died about 1640, and he subsequently married Deliverance Sheffield, the mother of his only child, Elizabeth Peters. The writings of Hugh Peters and the publications, in print and manuscript, relating to his life are described in the Bibliotheca Cornubiensis. He pleaded, in opposition to Prynne and others, for the admission of the Jews into England. The chief blot on his fame is his advocacy of the burning of the records.
