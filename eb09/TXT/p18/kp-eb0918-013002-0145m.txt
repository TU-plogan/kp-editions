PADERBORN, an ancient town of Prussia, the seat of a Roman Catholic bishop, is situated in the province of Westphalia and district of Minden, 60 miles to the southwest of Hanover. It derives its name (Latin, Paderae Fontes) from the springs of the Pader, a small affluent of the Lippe, which rise in or close to the town under the cathedral to the number of nearly two hundred, and with such force as to drive several mills within a few yards of their source. The most prominent building is the cathedral, the western part of which dates from the 11 th, the central part from the 12th, and the eastern part from the 13th century. The exterior is imposing, but heavy, and marred by a want of harmony arising from the successive stages of its construction. Among other treasures of art it contains the silver coffin of St Liborius, a substitute for one which was coined into dollars in 1622 by Duke Christian of Brunswick. The externally insignificant chapel of St Bartholomew ranks among the most interesting buildings in Westphalia, dating as it does from 1017, and possessing the characteristic features of the architecture of that early period. The old Jesuit church and the chapel of the convent of Abdinghof are also interesting. The town-hall is a picturesque edifice of the Renaissance. Paderborn formerly possessed a university, with the two faculties of theology and philosophy, but it was closed in 1819. The Roman Catholic gymnasium, however, enjoys a considerable reputation, and there are several other schools, hospitals, and religious endowments, as well as an historical and antiquarian society. The manufactures of Paderborn are unimportant, but the trade in grain, cattle, fruit, and wool has attained considerable dimensions since the opening of the Westphalian railway. The population in 1880 was 14,689 (12,602 Roman Catholics).

Paderborn is indebted for its development to Charlemagne, who discerned the favourable situation of the village of Patrisbrunnen, and made it the capital of a bishopric. He frequently visited it, receiving the conquered Saxons hefre at a diet in 777 and at a later period the Saracen ambassadors from Saragossa and the suppliant Pope Leo III. Several diets were also held here by the Saxon emperors. About the year 1000 the town was enlarged by Bishop Meinwerk and surrounded with walls. It afterwards joined the Hanseatic League, received many of the privileges of a free imperial town, and endeavoured to assert its independence of the bishops. The citizens gladly embraced the doctrines of the Reformation, but the older faith was re-established by Bishop Theodore, who took the town by force in 1604. The ecclesiastical principality of Paderborn, which had an area of close on 1000 square miles, was secularized in 1803 and handed over to Prussia. The bishop, however, was allowed to retain his spiritual jurisdiction. From 1807 to 1814 the territory was included in the kingdom of Westphalia.
