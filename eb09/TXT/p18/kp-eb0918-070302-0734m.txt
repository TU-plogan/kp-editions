PETIS DE LA CROIX, François (c. 1653-1713), the best representative of Oriental learning in France during the last decades of the 17 th century and the beginning of the 18th century, was born in Paris about 1653. He was son of the Arabic interpreter of the French court, and inherited this office at his father’s death in 1695, afterwards transmitting it to his own son, Alexandre Louis Marie. At an early age he was sent by Colbert to the East; during the ten years he spent in Syria, Persia, and Turkey he mastered Arabic, Persian, and Turkish, and also collected rich materials for future writings.^[1. Many of these—as the account of Jerusalem, Modern and Ancient, the Travels through Syria and Persia, the Antiquities and Monuments of Egypt, the translations of Pseudo-Wákidí’s Conquest of Syria and of Háji Khalfa’s Dictionary, and the History of the Ottoman Empire— still remain in manuscript. ] He found, besides, opportunity to equip himself for those diplomatic missions which the French Government entrusted to him soon after his return to Paris in 1680. Having served a short time as secretary to the French ambassador in Morocco, he accompanied as interpreter the French forces sent against Algiers, and greatly contributed to the satisfactory settlement of the treaty of peace between the two countries, which was drawn up by himself in Turkish and ratified in 1684. In a similar capacity he conducted the negotiations with Tunis and Tripoli in 1685 and those with Morocco in 1687; and the zeal, tact, and linguistic knowledge he manifested in these and other transactions with Eastern courts were at last rewarded in 1692 by his appointment to the Arabic chair in the Collège Royal de France, which he filled until his death in 1713.

He published Contes Tures, Paris, 1707, and Les Mille et un Jours, 5 vols., Paris, 1710-12, and proved his acquaintance with the Armenian and Ethiopie languages (a powerful impulse to the study of the latter having been given just at that time by the masterly works of Hiob Ludolf) in his Armenian Dictionary and his Account of Ethiopia. But the lasting monument of his literary fame, the one standard work that has outlived many generations and still keeps a distinct merit of its own, is his excellent French version of Sharaf-uddín 'AH Yazdí’s Zafarnárna, or History of Timúr (completed 828 a.h.; 1425 A.D.), which was given to the world nine years after his death, 1722 (4 vols., Paris; translated into English by J. Darby, London, 1723). This work, renowned throughout the East as a model of elegant style, and one of the rare specimens of a fairly critical history Persia can boast of, was compiled under the auspices of Mirzá Ibrahim Sultán, the son of Shah Rukh and grandson of the great Timúr himself. This prince collected all the official records of Tímúr’s reign, both in Turkish and Persian, collated and revised them, and had then an accurate text drawn up by his secretaries, which was turned by Sharaf-uddín into elegant and refined language and revised by Ibrahim Sultán himself (see Rieu’s Cat. Persian MSS. in the Brit. Mus., i. p. 173 sq.'). The only error committed by Petis de la Croix in his otherwise very correct translation is that he erroneously ascribed the important share which Ibrahim Sultán had in the Zafarndma to Timúr himself.
