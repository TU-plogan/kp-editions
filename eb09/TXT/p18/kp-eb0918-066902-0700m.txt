PERTINAX, Helvius, Roman emperor, was the son of a charcoal-burner, and was born in 126 a.d. in Liguria, or at Villa Martis among the Apennines. From being a teacher of grammar he rose through many important offices, both civil and military, to the consulate, which he held twice. Chosen on 31st December 192 to succeed the murdered Commodus, he was himself assassinated in a mutiny of the soldiers after a reign of eighty-six days.
