PELAGIUS. Of the origin of Pelagius almost nothing is known. The name is supposed to be a Graecized form of the Cymric Morgan (muir i sea; gin, begotten). His contemporaries understood that he was of British birth, and gave him the distinctive appellation Brito. He was a large ponderous person, heavy both in body and mind, if we are to believe Jerome (“stolidissimus et Scotorum pultibus praegravatus”). Born during the second half of the 4th century, he was influenced by the monastic enthusiasm which had been kindled in Gaul by Athanasius (336), and which, through the energy of Martin of Tours (361), rapidly communicated itself to the Britons and Scots. For, though Pelagius remained a layman throughout his life, and though he never appears in any strict connexion with a caenobitical fraternity, he yet adhered to monastic discipline (“veluti monachus ”), and distinguished himself by his purity of life and exceptional sanctity (“egregie Christianus ”). He seems to have been one of the earliest, if not the very earliest, of that remarkable series of men who issued from the monasteries of Scotland and Ireland and carried back to the Continent in a purified form the religion they had received from it. Coming to Rome in the beginning of the 5th century (his earliest known writing is of date 405), he found a scandalously low tone of morality prevalent. From his extant Commentaries on the Epistles of St Paul it may be gathered that men were encouraged to rely on a profession of the Christian creed, and on the magical efficacy of the sacraments, while they entirely neglected to cultivate a Christian character. This state of things Pelagius denounced. But his remonstrances were met by the plea of human weakness (“durum est, arduum est, non possumus, homines sumus, fragili carne circumdati ”). To remove this plea by exhibiting the actual powers of human nature became his first object. It seemed to him that the Augustinian doctrine of total depravity and of the consequent bondage of the will both cut the sinew of all human effort and threw upon God the blame which really belonged to man. Unless men had the power to do God’s will, it was vain for Him to declare it. And, if men believed they were incapable of virtue, they would make no effort to reach it. His favourite maxim was, “If I ought, I can.” Accordingly, he expressed unmeasured disapproval when he heard a bishop at Rome quoting with approbation the characteristic words of Augustine: “Give what Thou commandes!, and command what Thou wilt.”

The views of Pelagius did not originate in a conscious reaction against the influence of the Augustinian theology, although each of these systems was developed into its ultimate form by the opposition of the other. Neither must too much weight be allowed to the circumstance that Pelagius was a monk, for he was unquestionably alive to the delusive character of much that passed for monkish sanctity. Yet possibly his monastic training may have led him to look more at conduct than at character, and to believe that holiness could be arrived at by rigour of discipline. This view of things suited his natural temperament, which was essentially matter-of-fact and somewhat shallow. Judging from the general style of his writings, his religious development had been equable and peaceful, not marked by the prolonged mental conflict, the spiritual turmoil, the hand-to-hand wrestling with God, the abrupt transitions, which characterized the experience of his great opponent. With no great depth of mind, he saw very clearly the thing before him, and many of his practical counsels are marked by sagacity, and are expressed with the succinctness of a proverb (“corpus non frangendum, sed regendum est ”). His interests were primarily ethical; hence his insistence on the freedom of the will and his limitation of the action of divine grace.

The peculiar tenets of Pelagius, though indicated in the commentaries which he published at Rome previous to 409, might not so speedily have attracted attention had they not been adopted by Coelestius, a much younger and bolder man than his teacher. Coelestius had been trained as a lawyer, but abandoned his profession for an ascetic life. When Rome was sacked by the Goths (410) the two friends crossed to Africa. There Pelagius once or twice met with Augustine, but very shortly sailed for Palestine, where he justly expected his opinions would be more cordially received. Coelestius remained in Carthage with the view of receiving ordination. But Aurelius, bishop of Carthage, being warned against him, summoned a synod, at which Paulinus, a deacon of Milan, charged Coelestius with holding the following six errors:—(1) that Adam would have died even if he had not sinned; (2) that the sin of Adam injured himself alone, not the human race; (3) that new-born children are in the same condition in which Adam was before the fall; (4) that the whole human race does not die because of Adam’s death or sin, nçr will the race rise again because of the resurrection of Christ; (5) that the law gives entrance to heaven as well as the gospel; (6) that even before the coming of Christ there were men who were entirely without sin. To these propositions a 7th is sometimes added, “that infants, though unbaptized, have eternal life,” a corollary from the third. Coelestius did not deny that he held these opinions, but he maintained that they were open questions, on which the church had never pronounced. The synod, notwithstanding, condemned and excommunicated him. Coelestius, after a futile appeal to Rome, repaired to Ephesus, and there received ordination.

In Palestine Pelagius lived unmolested and revered, [9:18:472] until in 415 Orosius, a Spanish priest, came from Augustine to warn Jerome against him. The result was that in June of that year Pelagius was cited before John, bishop of Jerusalem, and charged with holding that man may be without sin, if only he desires it. This prosecution broke down, and in December of the same year Pelagius was summoned before a synod of fourteen bishops at Diospolis (Lydda). The prosecutors on this occasion were two Gallican bishops, Heros of Arles and Lazarus of Aix, but on account of the illness of one of them neither could appear. The proceedings, being conducted in various languages and by means of interpreters, lacked certainty, and justified Jerome’s application to the synod of the epithet “miserable.” But there is no doubt that Pelagius repudiated the assertion of Caelestius, that “the divine grace and help is not granted to individual acts, but consists in free will, and in the giving of the law and instruction.” At the same time he affirmed that a man is able, if he likes, to live without sin and keep the commandments of God, inasmuch as God gives him this ability. The synod was satisfied with these statements, and pronounced Pelagius to be in agreement with Catholic teaching. Pelagius naturally plumed himself on his acquittal, and provoked Augustine to give a detailed account of the synod, in which he shows that the language used by Pelagius was ambiguous, but that, being interpreted by his previous written statements, it involved a denial of what the church understood by grace and by man’s dependence on it. The North-African church as a whole resented the decisions of Diospolis, and sent up from their synods of Carthage and Mileve (416) an appeal to Innocent, bishop of Rome, who decided the question in favour of the African synods on “the broad, popular, and unanswerable ground that all Christian devotion implies the assistance of divine grace, that it is admitted in every response of the service, in every act of worship.” And, though his successor Zosimus wavered.for a time, influenced partly by his Greek training, which led him to consider the points in dispute as idle, and partly by the Confession of Faith which Pelagius had addressed to the see of Rome, he at length fell in with what he saw to be the general mind of both the ecclesiastical and the civil powers. For, simultaneously with the largely attended African synod which finally condemned Pelagianism in the West, an imperial edict was issued at Ravenna on 30th April 418, peremptorily determining the theological question and enacting that not only Pelagius and Caelestius but all who accept their opinions shall suffer confiscation of goods and irrevocable banishment. Thus prompted, Zosimus drew up a circular inviting all the bishops of Christendom to subscribe a condemnation of Pelagian opinions. To this document signature was refused by nineteen Italian bishops, among whom was Julian of Ec-lanum (Apulia), a man of good birth, approved sanctity, and great capacity, who now became the recognized leader of the movement. But not even his acuteness and zeal could redeem a cause which was rendered hopeless when the Eastern Church (Ephesus, 431) confirmed the decision of the West.

Pelagianism.

The system of Pelagius is a consistent whole, each part involving the existence of every other. Starting from the idea that “ability limits obligation,” and resolved that men should feel their responsibility, he insisted that man is able to do all that God commands, and that there is, and can be, no sin where the will is not absolutely free,—able to choose good or evil. The favourite Pelagian formula, “Si necessitatis est, peccatum non est; si voluntatis, vitari potest,” has an appearance of finality which imposed on superficial minds. The theory of the will involved in this fundamental axiom of Pelagianism is that which is commonly known as the “liberty of indifference,” or “power of contrary choice,”—a theory which affirms the freedom of the will, not in the sense that the individual is self-determined, but in the sense that in each volition and at each moment of life, no matter what the previous career of the individual has been, the will is in equipoise, able to choose good or evil. We are born characterless (non pleni), and with no bias towards good or evil (ut sine virtute, ita et sine vitio). It follows that we are uninjured by the sin of Adam, save in so far as the evil example of our predecessors misleads and influences us (non propagine sed exemplo). There is, in fact, no such thing as original sin, sin being a thing of will and not of nature; for if it could be of nature our sin would be chargeable on God the creator. This will, capable of good as of evil, being the natural endowment of man, is found in the heathen as well as in the Christian, and the heathen may therefore perfectly keep such law as they know. But, if all men have this natural ability to do and to be all that is required for perfect righteousness, what becomes of grace, of the aid of the Holy Spirit, and, in a word, of Christianity? Pelagius vacillates considerably in his use of the word “grace.” Sometimes he makes it equivalent to natural endowment. Indeed one of his most careful statements is to this effect: “We distinguish three things—the ability, the will, the act (posse, veile, esse). The ability is in nature, and must be referred to God, who has bestowed this on His creature; the other two, the will and the act, must be referred to man, because they flow from the fountain of free will” (Aug., De Gr. Christi, c. 4). But at other times he admits a much wider range to grace, so as to make Augustine doubt whether his meaning is not, after all, orthodox. But, when he speaks of grace “sanctifying,” “assisting,” and so forth, it is only that man may “more easily” accomplish what he could with more difficulty accomplish without grace. A decisive passage occurs in the letter he sent to the see of Rome along with his Confessio Fidei : “We maintain that free will exists generally in all mankind, in Christians, Jews, and Gentiles; they have all equally received it by nature, but in Christians only is it assisted by grace. In others this good of their original creation is naked and unarmed. They shall be judged and condemned because, though possessed of free will, by which they might come to the faith and merit the grace of God, they make an ill use of their freedom; while Christians shall be rewarded because, by using their free will aright, they merit the grace of the Lord and keep His commandments” ζib., c. 33, 34). Pelagius allowed to grace everything but the initial determining movement towards salvation. He ascribed to the unassisted human will power to accept and use the proffered salvation of Christ. It was at this point his departure from the Catholic creed could be made apparent: Pelagius maintains, expressly and by implication, that it is the human will which takes the initiative, and is the determining factor in the salvation of the individual; while the church maintains that it is the divine will that takes the initiative by renewing and enabling the human will to accept and use the aid or grace offered.

Semipelagianism.

It was easy for Augustine to show that this was an “impia opinio”; it was easy for him to expose the defective character of a theory of the will which implied that God was not holy because He is necessarily holy; it was easy for him to show that the positions of Pelagius were anti-Scriptural (see Augustine) ; but, though his arguments prevailed, they did not wholly convince, and the rise of Semipelagianism—an attempt to hold a middle course between the harshness of Augustinianism and the obvious errors of Pelagianism —is full of significance. This earnest and conciliatory movement discovered itself simultaneously in North Africa and in southern Gaul. In the former church, which naturally desired to adhere to the views of its own great theologian, the monks of Adrumetum found themselves either sunk to the verge of despair or provoked to licentiousness by his predestinarian teaching. When this was reported to Augustine he wrote two elaborate treatises to show that when God ordains the end He also ordains the means, and if any man is ordained to life eternal he is thereby ordained to holiness and zealous effort. But meanwhile some of the monks themselves had struck out a via media which ascribed to God sovereign grace and yet left intact man’s responsibility. A similar scheme was adopted by Cassian of Marseilles (hence Semipelagians are often spoken of as MassilianF), and was afterwards ably advocated by Vincent of Lerins and Faustus of Rhegium. These writers, in opposition to Pelagius, maintained that man was damaged by the fall, and seemed indeed disposed to purchase a certificate of orthodoxy by the abusive epithets they heaped upon Pelagians (ranae, muscae inoriturae, &c.). The differentia of Semipelagianism is the tenet that in regeneration, and all that results from it, the divine and the human will are co-operating (synergistic) coefficient factors. After finding considerable acceptance, this theory was ultimately condemned, because it retained the root-principle of Pelagianism,— that man has some ability to will good and that the beginning of salvation may be with man. The councils of Orange and Valence (529), however, which condemned Semipelagianism, did so with the significant restriction that predestination to evil was not to be taught,—a restriction so agreeable to the general feeling of the church that, three centuries after, Gottschalk was sentenced to be [9:18:473] degraded from the priesthood, scourged, and imprisoned for teaching reprobation. The questions raised by Pelagius continually recur, but, without tracing the strife as sustained by Thomists and Jansenists on the one side and the Jesuits and Arminians on the other, this article can only indicate the general bearing of the controversy on society and the church.

The anthropology of Pelagius was essentially naturalistic. It threatened to supersede grace by nature, to deny all immediate divine influence, and so to make Christianity practically useless. Pelagius himself did not carry his rationalism through to its issues; but the logical consequence of his system was, as Augustine perceived, the denial of the atonement and other central truths of revealed religion. And, while the Pelagians never existed as a sect separate from the church catholic, yet wherever rationalism has infected any part of the church there Pelagianism has sooner or later appeared; and the term “Pelagian” has been continued to denote views which minimize the effects of the fall and unduly magnify man’s natural ability. These views and tendencies have appeared in theologies which are not in other respects rationalistic, as, e.g., in Arminianism; and their presence in such theologies is explained by the desire to remove everything which might seem to discourage human effort.

It is not easy to determine how far the vices which ate so deeply into the life of the church of the Middle Ages were due to the sharpness with which some of the severer features of the Augustinian theology were defined during the Pelagian controversy. The pernicious belief in the magical efficacy of the sacraments and the consequent defective ethical power of religion, the superstitious eagerness to accept the church’s creed without examining or really believing it, the falsity and cruelty engendered and propagated by the idea that in the church’s cause all weapons were justifiable, these vices were undoubtedly due to the belief that the visible church was the sole divinely-appointed repository of grace. And the sharply-accentuated tone in which Augustinianism affirmed man’s inability quickened the craving for that grace or direct agency of God upon the soul which the church declared to be needful and administered through her divinely-appointed persons and sacraments, and thus brought a decided impulse to the development of the sacerdotal system.

Again, although it may fairly be doubted whether, as Baur supposes, Augustine was permanently tainted with the Manichaean notion of the inherent evil of matter, it can scarcely be questioned that his views on marriage as elicited by the Pelagian controversy gave a considerable impulse to the already prevalent idea of the superiority of virginity. When the Pelagians declared that Augustine’s theory of original sin discredited marriage by the implication that even the children of the regenerate were born in sin, he could only reply (De Nuptiis et Concupiscentia) that marriage now cannot partake of the spotless purity of the marriage of unfallen man, and that, though what is evil in concupiscence is made a good use of in marriage, it is still a thing to be ashamed of,—not only with the shame of natural modesty (which he does not take into account) but with the shame of guilt. So that, even although he is careful to point out the advantages of marriage, an indelible stigma is still left even on the lawful procreation of children.

The remark of Milman, that “all established religions subside into Pelagianism, or at least semi-Pelagianism,” is unexpected, but the converse remark, that “no Pelagian ever has or ever will work a religious revolution,” may be easily substantiated. It has indeed become a commonplace of historical science that in order to do or to endure great things men must believe in one form or other of predestination. They must feel confident that they are made use of by God to accomplish things that to Him seem worthy, and that until these be accomplished no earthly power can defeat or harm them. They must feel that their will is embraced in the divine and empowered by it. And it is the consciousness of their own impotence that leads men to yield themselves as instruments of the divine power. Pelagianism is the creed of quiet times and commonplace people; Augustinianism is the inevitable faith of periods that are dangerous and eventful, and in which men must exhibit some heroism.

Of the writings of Pelagius there have been preserved to us in the works of Jerome (5th vol. of Martianay’s ed., and 11th vol. of Vallarsi’s ed.) (1) Commentarii in Epistolas Pauli ; (2) Epistola ad Demetriadem (also published separately by Sender, Halle, 1775); (3) Libellus Fidei. But in Augustine’s various writings against Pelagianism (in the 10th vol., Bened. ed.) many passages are cited from the writings of Pelagius; and in the appendix of the same volume a valuable collection of documents connected with the controversy will be found. In the ordinary histories of the church other authorities are mentioned, and reference need here be made only to wiggers, Versuch. . . . des Augustinis∙m∕us undPelag. (Hamburg, 1833; translated by Emerson, Andover, 184Ò); Wörter, Der Pelagιanismus (2d ed., Freiburg, 1874); Guizot, Histoire de la Civilisation en r rance, 5 leçon); Mozley, Augustinian Doctrine of Predestination (London, 1855); and Cunningham, Historical Theology (Edin., 1863).

. PELAGIUS I., pope from 555 to 560, was a Roman by birth, and first appears in history at Constantinople in the rank of deacon, and as apocrisiarius of Pope Silverius, whose overthrow in favour of Vigilius his intrigues promoted. Vigilius continued him in his diplomatic appointment, and he was sent by the emperor Justinian in 542 to Antioch on ecclesiastical business; he afterwards took part in the synod at Gaza which deposed Paul of Alexandria. In his official position he had amassed some wealth, which on his return to Rome he so employed among the poor as to secure for himself great popularity; and, when Vigilius was summoned to Byzantium in 544, Pelagius, now archdeacon, was left behind as his vicar, and by his tact in dealing with Totila, the Gothic invader, succeeded in saving the citizens from murder and outrage. He appears subsequently to have followed his master to Constantinople, and there to have taken part in the Three Chapters controversy; in 553, at all events, he signed the “constitutum” of Vigilius in favour of these, and for refusing, along with him, to accept the decrees of the fifth general council (the 2d of Constantinople, 553) shared his sentence of exile. Like Vigilius, he afterwards, however, condemned the chapters, and accordingly, when the citizens of Rome, through the mediation of Narses, begged for the restoration of the pope and his clergy, both were recalled from banishment. The emperor now asked the Roman representatives whom they should prefer—Vigilius or Pelagius—and it may safely be presumed that their reply, to the effect that they would not choose the latter as long as the former was alive, was hardly such as Justinian had expected or wished. Both set out for Rome, but Vigilius died mysteriously on the way at Syracuse. Pelagius, as the nominee of Justinian, at once succeeded on his arrival in Rome, but most of the clergy, suspecting his orthodoxy, and believing him to have had some share in the unlooked-for removal of his predecessor, shunned his fellowship, and only two bishops and one presbyter could be got to take part in his ordination to the pontificate. He enjoyed, however, the support of Narses, and, after he had publicly purged himself of the charge of complicity in Vigilius’s death by solemn oath in the church of St Peter, he met with toleration, at least so far as his own immediate diocese was concerned, the populace remembering his former charities and his success in dealing with Totila. The rest of the Western bishops, however, still held aloof from the man who, by condemning the Three Chapters, had put a slight, as they thought, upon the council of Chalcedon; and the episcopate of Tuscany caused his name to be removed from the diptychs. This elicited from him a circular, in which he asserted his loyalty to the four general councils, and declared that in their action against the holy see the hostile bishops had been guilty of schism. The bishops of Liguria and Aemilia, headed by the archbishop of Milan, and those of Istria and Venice, headed by Paulinus of Aquileia, also withheld their fellowship from one who had taken part in the council of Constantinople; but Narses resisted the appeals of Pelagius, who would fain have invoked the secular arm. Childebert, king of the Franks, also, even after the pope had sent a confession of his faith, refused to interfere. Pelagius died on 3d March 560, and was succeeded by John III.
