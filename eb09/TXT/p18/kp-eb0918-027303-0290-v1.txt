PARIAN CHRONICLE. This famous Chronicle is contained in the Arundelian Marbles {q.v.') now at Oxford. It originally embraced an outline of Greek history from the reign of Cecrops, king of Athens (1582 B.c.), down to the archonship of Diognetus at Athens (264 B.c.), but the remaining portion extends no farther than 355 B.c. The Chronicle seems to have been set up by a private person, but, as the opening of the inscription has perished, we do not know the occasion or motives which prompted the step. The author of the Chronicle has given much attention to the festivals, and to poetry and music; thus he has recorded the dates of the establishment of festivals, of the introduction of various kinds of poetry, the births and deaths of the poets, and their victories in contests of poetical skill. On the other hand, important political and military events are often entirely omitted; thus the return of the Heraclidae, Lycurgus, the wars of Messene, Draco, Solon, Clisthenes, Pericles, the Peloponnesian War, and the Thirty Tyrants are not even mentioned. The years are reckoned backward from the archonship of Diognetus, and the dates are further specified by the kings and archons of Athens. The reckoning by Olympiads is not employed. Amongst the legendary dates recorded in the Chronicle the following may be mentioned :—

From the attention bestowed on poets and tyrants in the Chronicle, Boeckh infers that its author drew mainly on the works of Phanias of Eresus, a disciple of Aristotle, who wrote on poets, the tyrants of Sicily, tyrannicide, &c. Further, from some resemblances between Eusebius and the Chronicle, Boeckh is led to conjecture that the Christian historian may have made use of the same sources as the author of the Chronicle.

The Parian Chronicle is given by Boeckh in the Corpus Inscriptionum Graecarum, vol. ii., and by Müller in the Fragmenta Historicorum Graecorum, vol. i.; it is edited separately by Flach, Tübingen, 1883.
