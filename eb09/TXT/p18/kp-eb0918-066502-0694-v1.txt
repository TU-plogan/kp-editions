PERTH, an inland county of Scotland, is situated almost in the centre of the country between 56° 4' and 56° 57' N. lat., and between 3° 4' and 4° 50' W. long. The larger part of its border-line is formed of natural boundaries, the Grampians separating it on the west and north from Argyll, Inverness, and Aberdeen, while the Ochils and the Firth of Tay in the south-east divide it from Kinross, Clackmannan, and Fife. In the south the river Forth forms a large portion of the boundary with Stirling, but the boundary with Forfar in the north-east is almost at no point defined either by rivers or mountains. The county is of an irregular circular form, the diameter being about 70 miles. A small portion in the south-east is separated from the main portion at the junction of Clackmannan and Fife, and another small portion is surrounded by Stirlingshire. Perthshire is the fourth largest county in Scotland, the total area being 1,617,808 acres, or 2528 square miles. Situated on the Highland border, Perthshire embraces characteristics scarcely combined in any other county of Scotland, and it excels them all in the picturesqueness and multiform variety of its scenery. The finest passes into the Highlands are Killiecrankie, Leny, and the Trosachs. With hardly any exception the rivers and streams flow east and south and reach the ocean either by the Forth or the Tay. They generally issue from large elongated lochs formed by depressions at the foot of the mountains. The Ericht in the extreme north-west unites Loch Ericht and Loch Rannoch; and from the latter flows the Tummel, which, after passing through Loch Tummel and forming a series of rapids and falls, joins the Tay. The Tay, which rises on the borders of Argyllshire, passes through Loch Dochart and Loch Tay, and in its course [9:18:666] of rather over 100 miles receives nearly the whole drainage of the county, discharging a larger volume of water to the sea than any other river in Great Britain; its principal tributaries are the Tummel at Logierait, the Bran near Dunkeld, the Isla near Kinclaven (after its junction with the Ericht), the Almond near Perth, and the Earn from Loch Earn, at the borders of Fifeshire. The Forth from Loch Ard skirts the southern boundary of the county, and receives the Tei th from Lochs Katrine, Achray, Vennacher, Voil, and L∏bnaig, the Goodie Water from Loch Menteith, and the Allan, which rises in the Ochil Hills. Loch Ericht, partly in Inverness-shire, and Loch Tay are each more than 14 miles in length, Loch Rannoch is 9 miles long, Lochs Earn and Katrine are 7 each, and Lochs Vennacher, Lubnaig, and Voil each between 5 and 3. There are an immense number of small lochs varying in length from 1 to 3 miles, among which may be mentioned Garry, Tummel, Lows, Lyon, Dochart, Freuchie, Ard, and Menteith. The lochs and rivers abound in salmon and varieties of trout; and scarcely any of the streams have been perceptibly injured by the pollution of manufactures. About four-fifths of the surface of the county, chiefly in the west and north-west, is occupied by the Grampians, or encroached on by their ridges or by isolated summits, among the highest of the chain in Perthshire being Ben Lawers (3984 feet), north of Loch Tay; Ben More (3843) and Stobinnain (3821), south of Loch Dochart; Ben-y-Gloe (3690), and other peaks, near Glen Tilt; Schiehallion (3547), south of Loch Rannoch; and Ben Voirlich (3180), south of Loch Earn. The Ochils, occupying a considerable area in the south-east, attain in many cases a height of over 2000 feet, and the Sidlaws, practically a continuation of the Ochils running into Forfarshire, reach a height of about 1500 feet. The lowland districts consist chiefly of the straths and river-valleys, as Strathtay; Strathmore, extending into Forfarshire; St rath earn, stretching across the county from west to east, and bounded on the south by the Ochils; the district of Menteith between the Teith and the Forth; and the Carse of Gowrie between the Sidlaws and the Firth of Tay.

Geology and Minerals.— As regards its geology Perthshire consists of two distinct areas, that differ from each other entirely in the rocks of which they are composed and consequently in their scenery. The larger of these regions comprises the mountainous ground and occupies the northern and by much the larger part of the county. The rocks in this region belong to the series of crystalline schists, and include varieties of gneiss, mica-schist, clay-slate, hornblende-rock, &c., with important bands of quartzite, quartz-schist, and limestone. These rocks are arranged in approximately parallel folds, the axes of which range in a general sense from south-west to northeast, the same groups of strata being repeated again and again by successive plications. The quartzites from their durability and whiteness form specially marked zones across the county, as in the ranges of Schiehallion and Ben-y-Gloe. The limestones also from their persistence afford excellent horizons for interpreting the geological structure. A notable band of them runs along the valley of Loch Tay, plunging under Ben Lawers and rising up again in Glen Lyon, whence it continues across Strath Tummel into Glen Tilt. These various crystalline rocks are believed to be prolongations of the schistose series that overlies the Lower Silurian rocks of Sutherland; but they have not yet yielded fossils. They are here and there pierced by masses of granite, porphyry, or other eruptive rocks.

The southern (or more correctly south-eastern) limit of the mountain ground is defined by a line drawn from the foot of Loch Lomond by Aberfoyle, Pass of Leny, Comrie, a little belθλv Dunkeld, and Bridge of Cally, to Lintrathen. On the southern side of this line the ground presents distinctively lowland scenery. It is occupied by the Lower Old Sandstone with its included conglomerates, flagstones, and volcanic rocks. A remarkable dislocation, which nearly coincides with the line just traced, separates the younger series of formations from the older rocks of the mountains. But here and there on the north side of the fracture, in bay-like hollows of the hills, the massive conglomerates of the Old Red Sandstone can be seen resting upon the upturned edges of the schists. These conglomerates with their associated strata appear to have been laid down in a large lake or inland sea which lay across central Scotland and northern Ireland, and was tenanted by the peculiar Old Red Sandstone fishes (Cephalaspis, àc.). A long line of active volcanoes extended through this lake. Their sites are still traceable in the Ochil and Sidlaw Hills. See Geology, vol. x. p. 343 sq. Much of the lower ground is covered with the clays, gravels, and sands left by the icesheets and glaciers that once occupied the surface. Raised beaches marking recent upheaval of the land are seen in the Firth of Tay. The larger rivers present a succession of three or more alluvial terraces. Copper ore is found in the southern Ochils and coal at their base. Ironstone is wrought at Culross. Lead and other metals are found sparingly in the neighbourhood of Tyndrum, Ben Ledi, and Glen Lyon. Roofing slates are quarried at Birnam. In many valleys there are large deposits of peat.

Agriculture.— The climate and soil of Perthshire present greater varieties than in any other county of Scotland. In the higher western regions it is very moist; and long stretches of exposed uplands alternate with finely-sheltered valleys. The arable land is chiefly in the drier eastern districts. For the most part the soil is sharp and fertile. The county, agriculturally, may be classed in four divisions: deer-forests, chiefly the wilder mountain districts; grazing and pasture lands on the hills, embracing about four-fifths of the total area; light soils in the lower undulating districts, including the north portion of Menteith and the upper portion of the principal river-valleys, specially suited for oats, barley, turnips, and potatoes; clay and carse land, chiefly in the Carse of Gowrie, which extends to about 100,000 acres, in the Carse of Stirling north of the Forth and in the lower part of Strathearn below and above Bridge of Earn. The Carse of Gowrie has as its basis the boulder clay, above which rests the blue clay proper, or peat, or the carse clay,—a mixture of sand and clay, ranging from the finest clay soil to poor whitish “end clay.” The best heavy carse land is very rich and productive, but requires to be thoroughly wrought, limed, and manured. The district is well adapted for wheat, although the area sown is decreasing. A considerable area is occupied by orchards, the light quick soil on Tayside and in the upper districts of Menteith being admirably adapted for apples.

Between 1875 and 1880 the number of holdings decreased from 5296 to 5123, although their area increased from 331,890 to 344,728 acres. Of the holdings 179 in 1880 were above 300 acres in extent, 1033 between 100 and 300 acres, 786 between 50 and 100 acres, and 3125 did not exceed 50 acres each. There are a large number of small holdings in the Highland valleys and in the neighbourhood of the villages and small towns. According to the agricultural returns for 1883 there were 344,240 acres, or only a little less than a fifth of the total area, under cultivation, 103,050 acres being under corn crops, 50,799 acres green crops, 100,631 rotation grasses, 87,064 permanent pasture, and 2696 fallow. Of the corn crops, 70,424 acres were under oats, 22,770 acres barley and here, 6238 wheat, and 3087 beans; and of the green crops, 31,059 acres were under turnips and swedes and 18,611 under potatoes. The number of horses was 13,651, of which 10,524, chiefly Clydesdales, were used solely for agricultural purposes. Cattle numbered 73,097, of which 18,755 were cows and heifers in milk or in calf. Although dairy-farming is not in itself an important industry, a large number of cows are generally kept on the lowland fanns. The cows are principally Ayrshires, but the West [9:18:667] Highland or Kyloe breed of cattle is common in the straths and lower grounds adjoining the Highlands. Sheep in 1883 numbered 696,640. All the pasturage in the Grampians, not in deer-forests, is occupied by sheep, and there are also large sheep-runs on the Ochils. The blackfaced are principally kept in the Grampians, but there are also a large number of Cheviots, and in the lower grounds South Downs and Leicesters are common. In 1812 there were 203,880 acres under wood, of which 61,164 were planted and 142,716 natural. The area under woods in 1884 was 94,563 acres, in addition to which 424 acres were under orchards, 535 acres market-gardens, and 113 acres nurseries. In Breadalbane and Menteith there are still extensive remains of the old forest.

According to the latest return (187 2-73) the land was divided among 5737 proprietors, possessing 1,612,001 acres at an annual value of £959,365, or about Ils. 10d. an acre. Of the proprietors 4680, or nearly four-fifths, possessed less than one acre each. The following possessed upwards of 20,000 acres each, viz., duke of Athole, 194,640; earl of Breadalbane, 193,504; Baroness Willoughby d’Eresby, 76,837; trustees of marquis of Breadalbane, 40,662; earl of Moray, 40,553; Hon. Lady Menzies, 35,500; Sir A. D. Drummond Stewart, 33,274; trustees of R. Stewart Menzies, 33,000; Sir Robert Menzies, 32,784; duke of Montrose, 32,294; earl of Mansfield, 31,197; D. R. Williamson, 29,494; C. H. Drummond Moray, 24,980; Mrs Mary Stuart Robertson, 24,000; W. Μ. Macdonald, 22,600; David Carnegie, 22,205; and Lieutenant - Colonel Farquharson, 20,056.

Manufactures. — The manufacture of coarser linen fabrics is largely carried on in the towns and villages, and there are a considerable number of flour-mills. ' Cotton-works exist at Deanston and Stanley; hand - loom weaving is carried on at Auchterarder, Dunblane, Donne, Crieff, and elsewhere, and in several places the manufacture of shawls, blankets, and other fabrics. For the industries of the city of Perth see below.

Railways.— The lowland districts of the county are intersected by branches of the principal railway lines of Scotland, supplying convenient communication between all the principal towns; and by the Highland and Oban railways, supplemented by coaches and steamers on the larger lochs, the finest scenery in the county has been rendered easy of access.

Administration and Population.— Anciently the county was divided into the hereditary jurisdictions of Athole in the north, Balquhidder in the south-west, Breadalbane in the west, Gowrie in the east, Menteith in the south, Perth in the south-east, Bannoch in the north-west, and Stormont and Strathearn in the middle. These jurisdictions were abolished by the Act of 1748, and in 1795 an Act was passed dividing the county for administrative purposes into the ten districts of Auchterarder, Blairgowrie, Carse of Gowrie, Crieff, Culross, Coupar-Angus, Dunblane, Dunkeld, Perth, and Weem. The sheriffdom is divided into an eastern and a western district, the seat of the one being Perth and of the other Dunblane. The county is represented in parliament by one member, the city of Perth by one member, and Culross is included in the Stirling district of burghs. Perthshire embraces eighty-one parishes, and contains three ancient cities, Perth, formerly the capital of Scotland, and Dunkeld and Dunblane, formerly the seats of bishoprics, as was also Abernethy. The royal burghs are Perth (27,207) and Culross (380); and Auchterarder, Abernethy, and Dunblane formerly held this rank. The police burghs are Abernethy (906), Alyth (2377), Blairgowrie (4537), Callander (1522), Coupar-Angus (partly in Forfarshire), Crieff (4469), Dunblane (2186), Perth (26,951), and Rattray (2533). The population of the county in 1831 was 142,166, which by 1851 had diminished to 138,660, and by 1871 to 127,768; but in 1881 it had increased to 129,007, of whom 61,552 were males and 67,455 females. The increase has been wholly in the town population, from 44,250 (in 1871) to 49,642 (in 1881), there being a decrease in the village population from 23,321 to 22,349, and in the rural from 60,197 to 57,016. The number of persons speaking Gaelic was 14,505, or more than one-ninth of the total population.

History and Antiquities.— In the 2d century the district was divided, according to Ptolemy, among three tribes. The Damnonii inhabited Menteith, Strathearn, and Forthryfe (including the western part of Fife), and had three principal oppida—Alauna, at the junction of the Allan and Forth, guarding the entrance to the Highlands from the south; Lindum, at Ardoch; and Victoria, at Loch Orr in Fife. The Venicones inhabited part of Fife and the adjoining district of Perthshire, with the town of Orrea, probably Abernethy, at the junction of the Earn and Tay, the nearest Roman station to which was at Ardargie. The Vacomagi skirted the Highland region, and had the tθλvns of Tamea in Inchtuthil (an island in the Tay), where remains still exist, and Banatia, at Buchanty on the Almond, where there was a strong Roman station. In 83 A. r>. Agricola explored the country beyond the Forth, and in the following year probably carried his legions to the foot of the Grampians. At Mons Graupius or Granpius, whose site is not ascertained, but which is, according to the most probable conjecture (Mr Skene’s), in the district of Stormont in Perthshire, amongst the outliers of the Grampians near Meikleour, where the Cleavers Dyke and Buzzard Dykes perhaps mark the camps of Agricola and Galgacus, and the Hill of Blair the scene of battle, the Romans (according to their own accounts) defeated the tribes of Caledonia with great slaughter; but they deemed it imprudent to pursue the victory. Perthshire was accordingly left in the possession of its native tribes till its invasion by Severus in 207. The Roman road of Severus passed by Alanna to Lindum at Ardoch, where there are extensive remains of a Roman station, and thence by Strageath near Auchterarder, Dalgin Ross near Comrie, where there were prominent remains a century ago, and Buchanty, where one branch passed eastwards to the coast, and the other turned northwards over the Grampians.

As Severas renewed the wall of Antoninus, he does not appear to have retained possession of the county north of the Forth and the Clyde. Perthshire was included in the kingdom of the Southern Picts, who had their capital first at Abernethy and afterwards at Forteviot. On the burning of Forteviot by the Northmen in the 8th century the seat of the Government was changed to Scone, which continued to be the capital of Albany, the chief royal residence in Scotland, and the place where its kings were crowned, though circumstances led to James II., James III., and Mary being crowned elsewhere. But, as Perth increased in population, it became the seat of the parliament, and the favourite residence of the kings, until it was succeeded by Edinburgh in the reign of James II. In the early history of the county fall the defeat of the Danes at Luncarty in the 10th century and of Macbeth by Earl Siward at Dunsinane in 1054. To its later history, apart from incidents connected with the city of Perth, belong the removal of the coronation stone from Scone to Westminster by Edward I.; the battle of Dupplin, where Edward Baliol defeated the earl of Mar; the rout of the troops of General Mackay at Killiecrankie by the Highlanders under Dundee, 17th July 1689; and the indecisive battle at Sheriffmuir, 13th November 1715, between the adherents of the Pretender under the earl of Mar and the forces of the Government under Argyll. Apart from the camp at Ardoch Roman remains are not important. Of hill-forts the most remarkable is that on Dunsinane Hill. Among other relics of an early period are a ship-barrow of the vikings on the Hill of Rattray; weems in the parishes of Monzie, Alyth, and Bendochy; the witchstone near Cairn beddie, where Macbeth is said to have met the witches,—probably a sepulchral memorial of some old battlefield; another stone in Meigle parish called Macbeth’s Stone; a group of standing stones near Pitlochrie; and a number of sculptured stones at Meigle.

Abernethy, originally founded by the Pictish king Nertan in the 5th century, and refounded by St Columba in the 6th, succeeded Iona as the seat of the primacy of Scotland, afterwards transferred to St Andrews. The round tower in the churchyard, resembling those in Ireland, is supposed to have been built in the time of Kenneth Macalpine. The Culdees had monastic churches at Dunblane, Dunkeld, Abernethy, and Muthill. Dunblane (g , .v.) and Dunkeld {q.v.) were subsequently erected into bishoprics. The Canons Regular had an abbey at Scone, founded in 1124 and burned in 1559, its site being now occupied by a modern mansion; a priory at Loch Tay, 1114; a priory at Inchafray, 1200; a priory at Strathfillan, 1314; and a priory at Abernethy, 1273. The Dominicans had a convent at Perth, 1231, where there was also a Carthusian monastery, 1429, and a Greyfriars monastery, 1460. Culross abbey, of which the tower and the Gothic choir still remain, was founded by the Cistercians in 1217, and there was also an abbey of Cistercian nuns at St Leonards, Perth, founded in 1296. A Carmelite convent was founded at Tulliallan in 1267. There were collegiate churches at Meth ven and Tullibardine. Of the old castles of the chiefs mention may be made of Elcho Castle on the Tay, 4 miles south of Perth; Blair Castle, garrisoned by Montrose in 1644, stormed by Cromwell in 1653, occupied by Claverhouse in 1689, dismantled in 1690, and restored in 1870; Castle Huntly, built in 1452 by Lord Grey, master of the household to James II.; the ruins of Castle Dhu, near Moulin, once a stronghold of the Campbell family; the ruins of Finlarig Castle, Killin, the cradle of the Breadalbane family; Cluny Castle, on the island in the loch of the same name between Dunkeld and Blairgowrie; and Donne Castle, on the Teith, a picturesque ruin of very old date, rebuilt by Murdoch, duke of Albany. Among modern mansions the principal are Keir House, the seat of the late Sir W. Stirling-Maxwell; Blair Drummond House, the seat of the Drummonds; Blair Castle, duke of Athole; Taymouth Castle, earl of Breadalbane; Donne Lodge, earl of Moray; Dupplin Castle, earl of Kinnoul; Scone Palace, earl of Mansfield; Gleneagles, earl of Camperdown; Strathallan Castle, Viscount Strathallan; and Drummond Castle, Baroness Willoughby d’Eresby.
