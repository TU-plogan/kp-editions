PATTESON, John Coleridge (1827-1871), bishop of Melanesia, was the eldest son of Justice Patteson and Frances Duke Coleridge, a near relation of Samuel Taylor Coleridge, and was born in Gower Street, Bedford Square, 2d April 1827. He was educated at Ottery St Mary, and at Eton, where he greatly distinguished himself on the cricket-field. He entered Balliol College, Oxford, in 1845, and graduated B.A. in 1848. After spending some time on the Continent in the capacity of tutor, he in 1852 became a fellow of Merton College. In 1853 he became curate of Alfington, Devon, and in the following year he was ordained priest and joined the mission to the Melanesian islands in the South Pacific. There he laboured with great success, visiting the different islands of the group in the mission ship the “Southern Cross,” and by his good sense and unselfish devotion winning the esteem and affection of the natives. In 1861 he was consecrated bishop of Melanesia, and in this capacity did much to promote the Christianization of the islands until his premature death by the hand of a native, 20th September 1871.
