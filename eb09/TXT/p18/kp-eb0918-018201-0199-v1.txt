PÁLGHÁT, a town in Malabar district, Madras, India, situated in the gap or pass of the same name in the Western Ghâts, in 10° 45' 49" N. lat. and 76° 4Γ 48" E. long., 74 miles south-east of Beypur, with a population in 1881 of 36,339. Being the key to Travancore and Malabar from the east, it was formerly of considerable strategic importance. The fort fell for the first time into British hands in 1768, and subsequently formed the basis of many of the operations against Tippoo, which terminated in the storming of Seringapatam. It still stands, but is no longer garrisoned. Pághát is a busy entrepot for the exchange of produce between Malabar and the upland country, and is a station on the Madras railway. The easy ascent by the Pâlghât Pass, formerly covered with teak forests, supplies the great route from the south-west coast of India to the interior.
