PALWÁL, in Gurgâon district, Punjab, India, with a population in 1881 of 10,635, is a town of great antiquity, supposed to figure in the earliest Aryan traditions under the name of Apelava, part of the Pândava kingdom of Indraprâstha. Its importance is purely historical, and the place is now a mere agricultural centre.
