FABER, George Stanley (1773-1854), an English clergyman, son of Thomas Faber, vicar of Calverley, Yorkshire, was born October 25, 1773. He entered University College, Oxford, in 1789, graduated B.A. in 1792, and in 1794 was elected fellow and tutor of Lincoln College. He received his M.A. degree in 1796, and his B.D. degree in 1803. In 1801 he was appointed to the office of proctor, and the same year he delivered the Bampton lecture, which he afterwards published under the title of Horce Mosaicce. He was at this time one of the foremost preachers of the university, and his earnestness and eloquence secured for his discourses an interested and eager audience In his [9:8:835] preaching he gave considerable prominence to the doctrines usually known as evangelical, but he endeavoured to avoid as much as possible the technicalities of a system, and to give all that he spoke a directly practical bearing. Marrying in 1803, he lost his fellowship, and for two years he acted as curate to his father. In 1805 he became vicar of Stockton-on-Tees, and three years later of Redmarshall, both in the county of Durham. In 1811 he obtained the rectory of Long Newton, in 1831 was made a prebendary of Salisbury Cathedral, and the following year received the mastership of Sherborn Hospital, where he died in the masterâ€™s residence on 27th January 1854. Faber wrote over forty volumes treating more or less directly of theological subjects, and chiefly of those which are of a polemical nature. They manifest great and varied erudition, and considerable acuteness within a certain limited sphere; but his abilities are frequently misapplied in vain endeavours to establish baseless theories, and in minute discussions regarding subjects of no general or lasting importance.

Among his principal works are Mysteries of theCabiri, or the Great Gods of Phoenicia, 2 vols., 1803; Origin of Pagan Idolatry, 3 vols., 1816; Difficulties of Romanism, 1826; Apostolicity of Trinitarianism, 2 vols., 1832; Election, 1842; Papal Infallibility, 1851; and the Sacred Calendar of Prophecy, 3 vols., 1828. The last is his most popular work, and has passed through several editions.
