FABRE D’EGLANTINE, Philippe Francois Nazaire (1755-1794), a French dramatist and revolutionist, was born at Carcassonne, December 28, 1755. His real name was simple Fabre, the “d’Eglantine” being an addition which he adopted in commemoration of his receiving the golden eglantine of Clemence Isaure from the academy of the floral games at Toulouse. After travelling through the provinces as an actor, he came to Paris when about thirty years of age with the intention of continuing the same career, but being ignored by the critics he ventured to take his revenge by a comedy entitled Les gens des Lettres ou le Provincial d, Paris, and in spite of its failure continued to bring piece after piece on the boards. Shortly after the outbreak of the revolutionary movement he entered the political arena, was chosen by Danton as his private secretary, and obtained from the electors of Paris a place in the National Convention. He distinguished himself by the extravagance of his speeches and measures, voting for the king’s death, supporting the maximum and the law of the suspected, and giving distorted evidence against the Girondins. On the abolition of the Gregorian calendar he was one of the most active members of the committee entrusted with the formation of the republican substitute, and to him was due a large part of the new nomenclature, with its poetic Prairial and Floreal, its prosaic Primidi and Duodi, and its absurd substitution of the names of trees and beasts and implements for those of saints and heroes. The report which he made on the subject on 24th October is not without scientific’value. On January 12, 1794 he was arrested by order of the committee of public safety on a charge of malversation and forgery in connexion with the affairs of the Compagnie des Indes. During his trial he displayed the greatest apparent nonchalance, sitting in an arm chair, looking out dreamily at the rain, and singing his own well-known song of II pleut, il pleut, bergere, rentre tes blancs moutons. On his way to the scaffold he distributed his manuscript poems to the people.

Fabre d’Eglantine left behind him seventeen plays and a number of miscellaneous productions. One only of the plays, Le Philinthe de J/oZ/ere, still preserves its reputation as a good specimen of the second class. It professes to be a continuation of Moli&re’s Le Misanthrope, but the hero of the piece is of a different character from the nominal prototype—an impersonation, indeed, of pure and simple egotism. On its publication the play was introduced by a preface, in which the author mercilessly satirizes the Optimiste of his rival Collin d’Harleville, whose Chateaux en Espagne had gained the applause which D’Eglantine’s Presomptueux had failed to win. A posthumous play, Les Precepteurs, steeped with the doctrines of Rousseau’s Fmile, was performed on 17th September 1794, and met with an enthusiastic reception. The author’s (Euvres melees et posthumes were published at Paris 1802, 2 vols.
