FABRICIUS, George (1516-1571), poet, historian, and archaeologist, was born at Chemnitz in Upper Saxony, on the 24th April 1516. He completed his studies at Freiberg and Leipsic. Travelling into Italy with one of his pupils, he made an exhaustive study of the antiquities of Rome. The result was the second work named below, in which the correspondence between every discoverable relic of the old city and the references and descriptions which lay scattered throughout ancient literature was traced with the minutest detail. Even learned Germans suspected that the work was in reality an ancient performance. Having returned to Germany in 1553, he was appointed director of the college of Meissen, where he died on the 13th July 1571. In his sacred poems, which obtained for him considerable distinction, he affected to avoid every word with the slightest savour of paganism; and he blamed the poets for their allusions to pagan divinities.

The following list includes the principal works which he published, either as author or as editor :—(1) Terentii Afri Comoedioe sex cum castigatione duplid Joannis Rivii et G. Fabridi, Strasburg, 1548, 8vo; (2) Roma, sive Liber utilissimus de veteris Romce situ, regionibus, viis, templis, aliisque cedifidis, Basel, 1550, 8vo; (3) Virgilii Opera cum commentariis Servii et T. G. Donati, Basel, 1551, fol.; (4) Virgilii Opera a Fabrieio castigata, Leipsic, 1551, 1591, 8vo; (5) Poematum Sacrorum libri quindecim, Basel, 1560, 16mo; (6) Poematum veterum ccclesiasticorum opera Christiana et opcrurn reliquiae ac fragmenta, 1562, 4to; (7) De Re Poetica libri septem, 1566, 8vo; (8) Rerum Misnicarum libri septem, 1569, 4to; (9) Originum illustrissimoe stirpis Saxonicce libri septem, 1597, fol.; (10) Rerum Germanice magnoe et Saxonicce universce memorabilium volumina duo, Leipsic, 1609, fol. A life of George Fabricius was published in 1839, at Leipsic, by Professor C. G. Baumgarten Crusius. In 1845 the same biographer issued an edition of Fabricius’s Epistolce ad Wolf. Meuerum et alios ceqtiales, prefixed to which there is also a short sketch De Vita Ge. Fabricii et de gente Fabridorum.
