FABRICIUS, Hieronymus (1537-1619), a celebrated Italian anatomist and surgeon, was surnamed Acquapendente from the episcopal city of that name, where he was born in 1537. At Padua, after a course of philosophy, he studied medicine under Fallopius, whose successor as teacher of anatomy and surgery he became in 1562. From the senators of Venice he received numerous honours, and an anatomical theatre was built by them for his accommodation. He died May 21, 1619.

The collective works of Fabricius were printed by Bohn under the title of Opera omnia Anatomica et Physiologica, Leipsic, 1687. The Leyden edition, published by Albinus in 1738, folio, is preferred to that of Bohn, as containing a life of the author and the prefaces of his treatises. See Anatomy, vol. i., p. 809, and Surgery.
