CARPI, Ugo da (died 1536), a painter, was long held the inventor of the art of painting in chiaroscuro, afterwards brought to such perfection by Parmegiano and by [9:5:132] Baltasar Peruzzi of Siena. The researches of Huber and Breitkopf have proved, however, that this art was known aud practised in Germany by Jan Ulrich Pilguin and Mair, at least as early as 1499, while the date of the oldest of Da Carpi’s prints is 1518. Printing in chiaroscuro is performed by using several blocks. Da Carpi usually employed three,—one for the outline and darker shadows, another for the lighter shadows, and a third for the halftint. By means of them he printed engravings after several pictures and after some of the cartoons of Raphael. Of these a Sybil, a Descent from the Cross, and a History of Simon the Sorcerer are the most remarkable.
