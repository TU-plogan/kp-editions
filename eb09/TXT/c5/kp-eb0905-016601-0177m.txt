CARTWRIGHT, Edmund, D.D., F.R.S. (1743-1823), inventor of the power-loom, was born at Marnham, Nottinghamshire, April 24, 1743, and educated at Wakefield grammar school. He began his academical studies at Oxford in University College, but in 1762 he was elected a demy of Magdalen College, where, in 1764, he succeeded to a fellowship. In 1770 he published Armine and Elvira, a legendary tale in verse, which passed through seven editions in little more than a year. It was followed in 1779 by The Prince of Peace, the best of his poetical productions. In 1779 he was presented to the rectory of Goadby Marwood, Leicestershire, to which was added a prebend in the Cathedral of Lincoln. He would probably have passed an obscure life as a country clergyman had not his attention been accidentally turned in 1784 to the possibility of applying machinery to weaving. The result was that he invented the power-loom, for which he took out a patent in 1785. At this period he removed to Doncaster, where he established a weaving and spinning factory, which proved a failure; and in 1796 he settled in London. His first power-loom was a rude contrivance, but he afterwards greatly improved it, and made it an almost perfect machine. The first mill on his plan, that of Messrs Grimshaws of Manchester, was wilfully destroyed by fire in 1791. In spite, however, of the opposition of the hand-weavers, the use of power-looms had in 1807 greatly increased; but as his patent was about to expire, this extraordinary mechanical genius would have derived no benefit from his invention, had not Parliament voted him a grant of Â£10,000 in consideration of his having contributed so largely to the commercial prosperity of the nation. Besides the power-loom Cartwright invented machines for combing wool and making ropes, and he was also the author of many improvements in the arts, manufactures, and agriculture. He passed his latter years on a farm he had purchased near Sevenoaks, Kent, where he died October 30, 1823. He was the younger brother of Major John Cartwright, the subject of the following notice.
