CATLIN, George (1796-1872), a writer on the North American Indians, was born at Wilkesbarre, Luzerne Co., Pennsylvania, in 1796. He was brought up to the law, and practised that profession in Philadelphia for two years; but art was his favourite pursuit, and forsaking the law he established himself at New York as a portrait painter. In 1832, his attention having been called to the fact that the pure American race was disappearing before the march of civilization, he resolved to rescue from oblivion the types and customs of this singular people. With this object in view he spent many years among the Indians in North and South America. He lived with them, acquired their languages, and studied very thoroughly their habits, customs, and mode of life, making copious notes and many studies for paintings. In 1840 he came to Europe with his collection of paintings; and in the following year he published at London a work on the Manners, Customs, and Condition of ths Forth American Indians in two volumes, illustrated with 300 engravings. In 1844 he published The Forth American Portfolio, containing 25 plates of hunting scenes and amusements in the Rocky Mountains and the prairies of America. This was followed in 1848 by Eight Years' Travels and Residence in Europe, in which Catlin narrates the adventures of three different parties of American Indians, whom he had introduced to the courts of England, France, and Belgium. In 1861 he published a curious little volume, in “manugraph,” entitled Ths Breath of Life, on the advantage of keeping one’s mouth habitually closed, especially during sleep; and in 1868 appeared his Last Rambles amongst the Indians of the Rocky Mountains and the Andes. He died in Jersey City, New Jersey, December 22, 1872.
