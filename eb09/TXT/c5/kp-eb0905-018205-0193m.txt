CASSANO, a town and bishop’s seat of Italy, in the province of Calabria Citra, seven miles E.S.E. of Castrovillari. It stands in a concave recess of a steep mountain, round an isolated rock, on which are the ruins of a grand feudal castle. It has hot sulphureous baths, of great local reputation, and is surrounded by beautiful scenery. Macaroni, stamped leather, table-linens, and cotton and silk stuffs are manufactured; and corn, fruits, and oil are raised in the vicinity. Cassano is usually identified with the Castellum Carissanum of Pliny, and Cosα in Agro Thurino of Caesar; and one of the towers of its castle is still known as Torre di Milo or Milo’s Tower, in memory of the death of Cicero’s famous client. Population, 9035.
