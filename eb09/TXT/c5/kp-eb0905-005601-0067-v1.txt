CAPILLARY ACTION

A TUBE, the bore of which is so small that it will only admit a hair (capilld), is called a capillary tube. When such a tube of glass, open at both ends, is placed vertically with its lower end immersed in water, the water is observed to rise in the tube, and to stand within the tube at a higher level than the water outside. The action between the capillary tube and the water has been called Capillary Action, and the name has been extended to many other phenomena which have been found to depend on properties of liquids and solids similar to those which cause water to rise in capillary tubes.

The forces which are concerned in these phenomena are those which act between neighbouring parts of the same substance, and which are called forces of cohesion, and those which act between portions of matter of different kinds, which are called forces of adhesion. These forces are quite insensible between two portions of matter separated by any distance which we can directly measure. It is only when the distance becomes exceedingly small that these forces become perceptible. Quincke^[1. Pogg. Ann., cxxxvii. p. 402.] has made experiments to determine the greatest distance at which the effect of these forces is sensible, and he finds for various substances distances about the twenty-thousandth part of a millimetre.

Poggendorff^[2. Pogg. Ann., ci. p. 551.] tells us that Leonardo da Vinci^[3. Died 1519.] must be considered as the discoverer of capillary phenomena.

The first accurate observations of the capillary action of tubes and glass plates were made by Hauksbee.^[4. Physico- Mechanical Experiments, London, 1709, pp. 139-169 ∙ and Phil. Trans., 1711 and 1712.] He ascribes the action to an attraction between the glass and the liquid. He observed that the effect was the same in thick tubes as in thin, and concluded that only those particles of the glass which are very near the surface have any influence on the phenomenon.

Dr Jurin^[5. Phil. Trans., 1718, No. 355, p. 739, and 1719. No. 363, p. 1083.] showed that the height at which the liquid is suspended depends on the section of the tube at the surface of the liquid, and is independent of the form of the lower part of the tube. He considered that the suspension of the liquid is due to “the attraction of the periphery or section of the surface of the tube to which the upper surface of the water is contiguous and coheres.” From this he shows that the rise of the liquid in tubes of the same substance is inversely proportional to their radii.

Newton devotes the 31st query in the last edition of his Opticks to molecular forces, and instances several examples of the cohesion of liquids, such as the suspension of mercury in a barometer tube at more than double the height at which it usually stands. This arises from its adhesion to the tube, and the upper part of the mercury sustains a considerable tension, or negative pressure, without the separation of its parts. He considers the capillary phenomena to be of the same kind, but his explanation is not sufficiently explicit with respect to the nature and the limits of the action of the attractive force.

It is to be observed that, while these early speculators ascribe the phenomena to attraction, they do not distinctly assert that this attraction is sensible only at insensible distances, and that for all distances which we can d>.ectly measure the force is altogether insensible. The idea of such forces, however, had been distinctly formed by Newton, who gave the first example of the calculation of the effect of such forces in his theorem on the alteration of the path of a light-corpuscule when it enters or leaves a dense body.

Clairaut^[6. Clairaut, Théorie de la Figure de la Terre, Paris, 1808. pp. 105, 128.] appears to have been the first to show the necessity of taking account of the attraction between the parts of the fluid itself in order to explain the phenomena. He does not, however, recognize the fact that the distance at which the attraction is sensible is not only small but altogether insensible.

Segner^[7. ' Segner, Comment. Soc. Reg. Götting., i. (1751), p. 301.] introduced the very important idea of the surface-tension of liquids, which he ascribed to attractive forces, the sphere of whose action is so small “ut nullo adhuc sensu percipi potuerit.” In attempting to calculate the effect of this surface-tension in determining the form of a drop of the liquid, Segner took account of the curvature of a meridian section of the drop, but neglected the effect of the curvature in a plane at right angles to this section.

But the idea of surface-tension introduced by Segner had a most important effect on the subsequent development of the theory. We may regard it as a physical fact established by experiment in the same way as the laws of the elasticity of solid bodies. We may investigate the forces which act between finite portions of a liquid in the same way as we investigate the forces which act between finite portions of a solid. The experiments on solids lead to certain laws of elasticity expressed in terms of coefficients, the values of which can be determined only by experiments on each particular substance. Various attempts have also been made to deduce these laws from particular hypotheses as to the action between the molecules of the elastic substance. We may therefore regard the theory of elasticity as consisting of two parts. The first part establishes the laws of the elasticity of a finite portion of the solid subjected to a homogeneous strain, and deduces from these laws the equations of the equilibrium and motion of a body subjected to any forces and displacements. The second part endeavours to deduce the facts of the elasticity of a finite portion of the substance from hypotheses as to the motion of its constituent molecules and the forces acting between them.

In like manner we may by experiment ascertain the general fact that the surface of a liquid is in a state of tension similar to that of a membrane stretched equally in all directions, and prove that this tension depends only on the nature and temperature of the liquid and not on its form, and from this as a secondary physical principle ve may deduce all the phenomena of capillary action. This is one step of the investigation. The next step is to deduce this surface-tension from an hypothesis as to the molecular constitution of the liquid and of the bodies that surround it. The scientific importance of this step is to be measured by the degree of insight which it affords or promises into the molecular constitution of real bodies by the suggestion of experiments by which we may discriminate between rival molecular theories.

In 1756 Leidenfrost^[8. De aqµoe communis nonnullis qualitatibus tractotus, Duisburg.] showed that a soap-bubble tends to contract, so that if the tube with which it was blown is left open the bubble will diminish in size and will expel through the tube the air which it contains. He attributed this force, however, not to any general property of the surfaces of liquids, but to the fatty part of the soap which he supposed to separate itself from the other constituents [9:5:57] of the solution, and to form a thin skin on the outer face of the bubble.

In 1787 Monge^[9. Mémoires de Γ Acad. des Sciences, 1787, p. 506.] asserted that “by supposing the adherence of the particles of a fluid to have a sensible effect only at the surface itself and in the direction of the surface it would be easy to determine the curvature of the surfaces of fluids in the neighbourhood of the solid boundaries which contain them; that these surfaces would be lintearice of which the tension, constant in all directions, would be everywhere equal to the adherence of two particles, and the phenomena of capillary tubes would then present nothing which could not be determined by analysis.” He applied this principle of surface-tension to the explanation of the apparent attractions and repulsions between bodies floating on a liquid.

In 1802 Leslie^[10. * Philosophical Magazine, 1802, vol. xiv. p. 193.] gave the first correct explanation of the rise of a liquid in a tube by considering the effect of the attraction of the solid on the very thin stratum of the liquid in contact with it. He does not, like the earlier speculators, suppose this attraction to act in an upward direction so as to support the fluid directly. He shows that the attraction is everywhere normal to the surface of the solid. The direct effect of the attraction is to increase the pressure of the stratum of the fluid in contact with the solid, so as to make it greater than the pressure in the interior of the fluid. The result of this pressure if unopposed is to cause this stratum to spread itself over the surface of the solid as a drop of water is observed to do when placed on a clean horizontal glass plate, and this even when gravity opposes the action, as when the drop is placed on the under surface of the plate. Hence a glass tube plunged into water would become wet all over were it not that the ascending liquid film carries up a quantity of other liquid which coheres to it, so that when it has ascended to a certain height the weight of the column balances the force by which the film spreads itself over the glass. This explanation of the action of the solid is equivalent to that by which Gauss afterwards supplied the defect of the theory of Laplace, except that, not being expressed in terms of mathematical symbols, it does not indicate the mathematical relation between the attraction of individual particles and the final result. Leslie’s theory was afterwards treated according to Laplace’s mathematical methods by James Ivory in the article on capillary action, under the heading “Fluids, Elevation of,” in the supplement to the fourth edition of the Eιιsyclop<jedia Britannica, published in 1819.

In 1804 Thomas Young^[11. Essay on the “Cohesion of Fluids,” Philosophical Transactions, 1805, p. 65.] founded the theory of capillary phenomena on the principle of surface-tension. He also observed the constancy of the angle of contact of a liquid surface with a solid, and showed how from these two principles to deduce the phenomena of capillary action. His essay contains the solution of a great number of cases, including most of those afterwards solved by Laplace, but his methods of demonstration, though always correct, and often extremely elegant, are sometimes rendered obscure by his scrupulous avoidance of mathematical symbols. Having applied the secondary principle of surface-tension to the various particular cases of capillary action, Young proceeds to deduce this surface-tension from ulterior principles. He supposes the particles to act on one another with two different kinds of forces, one of which, the attractive force of cohesion, extends to particles at a greater distance than those to which the repulsive force is confined. He further supposes that the attractive force is constant throughout the minute distance to which it extends, but that the repulsive force increases rapidly as the distance diminishes. He thus shows that at a curved part of the surface, a superficial particle would be urged towards the centre of curvature of the surface, and he gives reasons for concluding that this force is proportional to the sum of the curvatures of the surface in two normal planes at right angles to each other.

The subject was next taken up by Laplace.^[12. Mécanique Celeste, supplement to the tenth book, published in 1806.] His results are in many respects identical with those of Young, but his methods of arriving at them are very different, being conducted entirely by mathematical calculations. The form into which he has thrown his investigation seems to have deterred many able physicists from the inquiry into the ulterior cause of capillary phenomena, and induced them to rest content with deriving them from the fact of surfacetension. But for those who wish to study the molecular constitution of bodies it is necessary to study the effect of forces which are sensible only at ius≡nsible distances; and Laplace has furnished us with an example of the method of this study which has never been surpassed. Laplace investigates the force acting on the fluid contained in an infinitely slender canal normal to the surface of the fluid arising from the attraction of the parts of the fluid outside the canal. He thus finds for the pressure at a point in the interior of the fluid an expression of the form F = K + ∣h(⅛ + ⅛), where K is a constant pressure, probably very large, which, however, does not influence capillary phenomena, and therefore cannot be determined from observation of such phenomena; H is another constant on which all capillary phenomena depend; and R and R' are the radii of curvature of any two normal sections of the surface at right angles to each other.

In the first part of our own investigation we shall adhere to the symbols used by Laplace, as we shall find that an accurate knowledge of the physical interpretation of these symbols is necessary for the further investigation of the subject. In the Supplement to the Theory of Capillary Action, Laplace deduces the equation of the surface of the fluid from the condition that the resultant force on a particle at the surface must be normal to the surface. His explanation, however, of the rise of a liquid in a tube is based on the assumption of the constancy of the angle of contact for the same solid and fluid, and of this he has nowhere given a satisfactory proof. In this supplement Laplace gives many important applications of the theory, and compares the results with the experiments of Gay-Lussac.

The next great step in the treatment of the subject was made by Gauss.^[13. Principia generalia Theorúe Figurer Fluidorum in statu Aequilibru (Göttingen, 1830), or Werke, v. 29 (Göttingen, J 867).] The principle which he adopts is that of virtual velocities, a principle which under his hands was gradually transforming itself into what is now known as the principle of the conservation of energy. Instead of calculating the direction and magnitude of the resultant force on each particle arising from the action of neighbouring particles, he forms a single expression which is the aggregate of all the potentials arising from the mutual action between pairs of particles. This expression has been called the force function. Withits sign reversed it is now called the potential energy of the system. It consists of three parts, the first depending on the action of gravity, the second on the mutual action between the particles of the fluid, and the third on the action between the particles of the fluid and the particles of a solid or fluid in contact with it.
[9:5:58]

The condition of equilibrium is that this expression (which we may for the sake of distinctness call the potential energy) shall be a minimum. This condition when worked out gives not only the equation of the free surface in the form already established by Laplace, but the conditions of the angle of contact of this surface with the surface of a solid.

Gauss thus supplied the principal defect in the great work of Laplace. He also pointed out more distinctly the nature of the assumptions which we must make with respect to the law of action of the particles in order to be consistent with observed phenomena. He did not, however, enter into the explanation of particular phenomena, as this had been done already by Laplace. He points out, however, to physicists the advantages of the method of Segner and Gay-Lussac, afterwards carried out by Quincke, of measuring the dimensions of large drops of mercury on a horizontal or slightly concave surface, and those of large bubbles of air in transparent liquids resting against the under side of a horizontal plate of a substance wetted by the liquid.

In 1831 Poisson published his Nouvelle Theorie de ΓAction Capillaire. He maintains that there is a rapid variation of density near the surface of a liquid, and he gives very strong reasons, which have been only strengthened by subsequent discoveries, for believing that this is the case. He then proceeds to an investigation of the equilibrium of a fluid on the hypothesis of uniform density, and he arrives at the conclusion that on this hypothesis none of the observed capillary phenomena would take place, and that, therefore, Laplace’s theory, in which the density is supposed uniform, is not only insufficient but erroneous. In particular he maintains that the constant pressure K, which occurs in Laplace’s theory, and which on that theory is very large, must be in point of fact very small, but the equation of equilibrium from which he concludes this is itself defective. Laplace assumes that the liquid has uniform density, and that the attraction of its molecules extends to a finite though insensible distance. On these assumptions his results are certainly right, and are confirmed by the independent method of Gauss, so that the objections raised against them by Poisson fall to the ground. But whether the assumption of uniform density be physically correct is a very different question, and Poisson has done good service to science in showing how to carry on the investigation on the hypothesis that the density very near the surface is different from that in the interior of the fluid.

The result, however, of Poisson’s investigation is practically equivalent to that already obtained by Laplace. In both theories the equation of the liquid surface is the same, involving a constant H, which can be determined only by experiment. The only difference is in the manner in which this quantity H depends on the law of the molecular forces and the law of density near the surface of the fluid, and as these laws are unknown to us we cannot obtain any test to discriminate between the two theories.

We have now described the principal forms of the theory of capillary action during its earlier development. In more recent times the method of Gauss has been modified so as to take account of the variation of density near the surface, and its language has been translated in terms of the modern doctrine of the conservation of energy.^[14. See Prof. Betti, Teoriα della Capillaritâ: Nuovo Cimento, 1867; a memoir by Μ. Stahl, “Ueber einige Punckte in der Theorie der Capillarerscheinungen,” Pogg. Ann., cxxxix. p. 239 (1870); and Μ. Van der Waal’s Over de Continviteit van den Gas- en Vloeistoftoe-sirmd. The student will find a good account of the subject from a mathematical point of view in Professor Challis’s “Report on the Theory of Capillary Attraction, Brit. Ass. Report, iv. p. 253 (1834.)]

Μ. Plateau,^[15. Μ, Plateau, Statique experimentale et théorique des liquides.] who has himself made the most elaborate study of the phenomena of surface-tension, has adopted the following method of getting rid of the effects of gravity: He forms a mixture of alcohol and water of the same density as olive oil. He then introduces a quantity of oil into the mixture. It assumes the form of a sphere under the action of surface-tension alone. He then, by means of rings of iron-wire, disks, and other contrivances, alters the form of certain parts of the surface of the oil. The free portions of the surface then assume new forms depending on the equilibrium of surface-tension. In this way he has produced a great many of the forms of equilibrium of a liquid under the action of surface-tension alone, and compared them with the results of mathematical investigation. He has also greatly facilitated the study of liquid films by showing how to form a liquid, the films of which will last for twelve or even for twenty-four hours. The debt which science owes to Μ. Plateau is not diminished by the fact that, while investigating these beautiful phenomena, he has never himself seen them. He lost his sight long ago in tho pursuit of science, and has ever since been obliged to depend on the eyes and the hands of others.

Μ. Van der Mensbrugghe^[16. Mêm. de T Acad. Roy. de Belgique, xxxvii. (1873).] has also devised a great number of beautiful illustrations of the phenomena of surfacetension, and has shown their connection with the experiments of Mr Tomlinson on the figures formed by oils dropped on the clean surface of water.

Μ. Dupré in his 5th, 6th, and 7th Memoirs on the Mechanical Theory of Heat (Ann. de Chimie et de Physique, 1866 to 1868) has done much towards applying the principles of thermodynamics to capillary phenomena, and the experiments of his son are exceedingly ingenious and well devised, tracing the influence of surface-tension in a great number of very different circumstances, and deducing from independent methods the numerical value of the surface-tension. The experimental evidence which Μ Duprè has obtained bearing on the molecular structure of liquids must be very valuable, even if many of our present opinions on this subject should turn out to be erroneous.

Μ. Quincke^[17. Pogg. Ann., cxxxix. (1870), p. 1.] has made a most elaborate series of experiments on the tension of the surfaces separating one liquid from another and from air.

Μ. Liidtge^[18. Pogg. Ann., cxxxix. (1870), p. 620.] has experimented on liquid films, and has shown how a film of a liquid of high surface-tension is replaced by a film of lower surface-tension. He has also experimented on the effects of the thickness of the film, and has come to the conclusion that the thinner a film is, the greater is its tension. This result, however, has been tested by Μ. Van der Mensbrugghe, who finds that the tension is the same for the same liquid whatever be the thickness, as long as the film does not burst. The phenomena of very thin liquid filins deserve the most careful study, for it is in this way that we are most likely to obtain evidence by which we may test the theories of the molecular structure of liquids.

Sir W. Thomson^[19. Proceedings R. S., Edinburgh, February 7, 1870,] has investigated the effect of the curvature of the surface of a liquid on the thermal equilibrium between the liquid and the vapour in contact with it. He has also calculated the effect of surface-tension on the propagation of waves on the surface of a liquid, and has determined the minimum velocity of a wave, and the velocity of the wind when it is just sufficient to disturb the surface of still water.^[20. Philosophical Magazine, November, 1871.] Theory of Capillary Action.

When two different fluids are placed in contact, they may either diffuse into each other or remain separate. In [9:5:59] some cases diffusion takes place to a limited extent, after which the resulting mixtures do not mix with each other. The same substance may be able to exist in two different states at the same temperature and pressure, as when water and its saturated vapour are contained in the same vessel. The conditions under which the thermal and mechanical equilibrium of two fluids, two mixtures, or the same sub stance in two physical states in contact with each other, is possible belong to thermodynamics. All that we have to observe at present is that, in the cases in which the fluids do not mix of themselves, the potential energy of the system must be greater when the fluids are mixed than when they are separate

It is found by experiment that it is only very close to the bounding surface of a liquid that the forces arising from the mutual action of its parts have any resultant effect on one of its particles. The experiments of Quincke and others seem to show that the extreme range of the forces which produce capillary action lies between a thousandth and a twenty thousandth part of a millimetre

We shall use the symbol e to denote this extreme range, beyond which the action of these forces may be regarded as insensible. If χ denotes the potential energy of unit of mass of the substance, we may treat χ as sensibly constant except within a distance e of the bounding surface of the fluid. In the interior of the fluid it has the uniform value χ 0 . In like manner the density, p, is sensibly equal to the constant quantity o 0 , which is its value in the interior of the liquid, except within a distance e of the bounding surface. Hence if V is the volume of a mass Μ of liquid bounded by a surface whose area is S, the integral

Μ = pdxdυdz (1), where the integration is to be extended throughout the volume V, may be divided into two parts by considering separately the thin shell or skin extending from the outer surface to a depth ¢, within which the density and other properties of the liquid vary with the depth, and the interior portion of the liquid within which its properties are constant.

Since « is a line of insensible magnitude compared with the dimensions of the mass of liquid and the principal radii of curvature of its surface, the volume of the shell whose surface is S and thickness ¢ will be Sc, and that of the interior space will be V - St.

If we suppose a normal v less than t to be drawn from the surface S into the liquid, we may divide the shell into elementary shells whose thickness is dv, in each of which the density and other properties of the liquid will be constant.

The volume of one of these shells will he S<fr. Its mass will be Spdv. The mass of the whole shell will therefore be S f*ρdv, and that of the interior part of the liquid (V - Sf)p 0 ∙ "We thus find for the whole mass of the liquid

Μ = Vp., - S∕^*(p 0 - p)<*> <2)∙

Substituting χp for p in the process we have just gone through, we find

Multiplying equation (2) by χ 0 , and subtracting it from (4), E-Mχ 0 = χ 0 Sy%'-χ 0 W j '∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ (5 ')∙

In this expression Μ and χ 0 are both constant, so that the variations of the right hand side of the equation is the same as that of the energy E, and expresses that part of the energy which depends on the area of the bounding surface of the liquid. We may call this the surface energy.

The symbol χ expresses the energy of unit of mass of the liquid at a depth v within the bounding surface. When the liquid is in contact with a rare medium, such as its own vapour or any other gas, χ is greater than χ 0 , and the surface energy is positive. By the principle of the conservation of energy, any displacement of the liquid by which its energy is diminished will tend to take place of itself. Hence if the energy is the greater, the greater the area of the exposed surface, the liquid will tend to move in such a way as to diminish the area of the exposed surface, or in other words, the exposed surface will tend to diminish if it can do so consistently with the other conditions. This tendency of the surface to contract itself is called the surface-tension of liquids.

Μ. Dupre has described an arrangement by which the surfacetension of a liquid film may be illustrated.

A piece of sheet metal is cut out in the form AA (fig. 1). A veιy fine slip of metal is laid on it in the position BB, and the whole is dipped into a solution of soap, or Μ. Plateau’s glycerine mixture. When it is taken out the rectangle AACC is filled up by a liquid film. This film, however, tends to contract on itself, and the loose strip of metal BB will, if it is let go, be drawn up towards AA, provided it is sufficiently light and smooth.

Let T be the surface energy per unit of aιea; then the energy of a surface of area S will be ST. If, in the rectangle AACC, A A -a, and CC-ft, its area is S=ab, and its energy TαZ>. Hence if F is the force by which the slip BB is pulled towards AA' 1 , F = <É Trtà = Ta < 6 )> or the force arising from the surface-tension acting on a length α of the strip is Ta, so that T represents the surface-tension acting transversely on every unit of length of the periphery of the liquid surface. Hence if we write

T= j Γ(χ--χ 0 Wr (7), we may define T either as the surface-energy per unit of area, or as the surface-tension per unit of contour, for the numerical values of these two quantities are equal.

If the liquid is bounded by a dense substance, whether liquid or solid, the value of χ may be different from its value when the liquid has a free surface. If the liquid is in contact with another liquid, let us distinguish quantities belonging to the two liquids by suffixes. We shall then have e i- m iXoi = S∕^ 1 (Xi-Xoi)pAi ∙ ∙ ∙ (θ), e j- m »Xoí=S/^ 1 (Xi-Xoí)p« <í ’'«· ∙ ∙ (θ)∙

Adding these expressions, and dividing the second member by S, we obtain for the tension of the surface of contact of the two liquids T j ,,= /*’ (χι - χ nι )o 1 Λι +f ti (χ i - χ m )p ll d∙' a ∙ ∙ (lθ,>∙ * z β 0

If this quantity is positive, the surface of contact will tend to contract, and the liquids will remain distinct. If, however, it were negative, the displacement of the liquids which tends to enlarge the surface of contact would be aided by the molecular forces, so that the liquids, if not kept separate by gravity, would at length become thoroughly mixed. No instance, however, of a phenomenon of this kind has been discovered, for those liquids which mix of themselves do so by the process of diffusion, which is a molecular motion, and not by the spontaneous puckering and replication of the bounding surface as would be the case if T were negative.

It is probable, however, that there are many cases in which the integral belonging to the less dense fluid is negative. If the denser body be solid we can often demonstrate this; for the liquid tends to spread itself over the surface of the solid, so as to increase the area of the surface of contact, even although in so doing it is obliged to increase the free surface in opposition to the surface-tension. Thus water spreads itself out on a clean surface of glass. This shows that (χ - χ 0 y )pdv must be negative for water in contact with glass.

On the Tension of Liquid Films.

The method already given for the investigation of the surface-tension of a liquid, all whose dimensions are sensible, fails in the case of a liquid film such as a soap-bubble. In such a film it is possible that no part of the liquid may be so far from the surface as to have the potential and density corresponding to what we have called the interior of a liquid mass, and measurements of the [9:5:60] tension of tne film when drawn out to different degrees of thinness may possibly lead to an estimate of the range of the molecular forces, or at least of the depth within a liquid mass, at which its properties become sensibly uniform. We shall therefore indicate a method of investigating the tension of such films.

Let S be the area of the film, Μ its mass, and E its energy; σ the mass, and e the energy of unit of area; then

M = Sσ (11),

E —Se (12).

Let us now suppose that by some change in the form of the boundary of the film its area is changed from S to S + dS. If its tension is T the work required to effect this increase of surface will be T<ZS, and the energy of the film will be increased by this amount, lienee

TrfS = <fE

= Sde + edS (13).

But since Μ is constant, dM=SΛr + σdS=O (14).

Eliminating <ZS from equations (13) and (14), and dividing by S, we find T=e-σ~ (15)·

dvr

In this expression σ denotes the mass of unit of area of the film, and e the energy of unit of area.

If we take the axis of z normal to either surface of the film, the radius of curvature of which we suppose to be very great compared with its thickness c, and if p is the density, and χ the energy of unit of mass at depth z, then v =f c p dz (16), j o and

<=∕≠ (17)∙

j o

Both p and χ are functions of z, the value of which remains the same when z-c is substituted for z. If the thickness of the film is greater than 2«, there will be a stratum of thickness c - 2¢ in the middle of the film, within which the values of pand χ will be ∕> 0 and χ 0 ∙ In the two strata on either side of this the law, according to which p and χ depend on the depth, will be the same as in a liquid mass of large dimensions. Hence in this case a = (c - 2t)p 0 + c λj' t pdv (18), e = (c-2e)χ 0 p 0 + 2∕' f χpdv (19),

∙ ’ υ

da~ p9 ’ dc -λopβ ’ ∙''da~ x '>'

T * χpdv - 2χ^plv, = t∕ ∖ χ-χ 0 W∙' (20).

Hence the tension of a thick film is equal to the sum of the tensions of its two surfaces as already calculated (equation 7). On the hypothesis of uniform density we shall find that this is true for films whose thickness exceeds ¢.

The symbol χ is defined as the energy of unit of mass of the substance. A knowledge of the absolute value of this energy is not required, since in every expression in which it occurs it is under the form χ - χ 0 , that is to say, the difference between the energy in two different states. The only cases, however, in which we have experimental values of this quantity are when the substance is either liquid and surrounded by similar liquid, or gaseous and surrounded by similar gas. It is impossible to make direct measurements of the properties of particles of the substance within the insensible distance « of the bounding surface.

When a liquid is in thermal and dynamical equilibrium with its vapour, then if ρ' and χ' are the values of p and χ for the vapour, and p 0 and χ 0 those for the liquid,

χ'-χ. = Λ-y(i-L) .... (21), where J is the dynamical equivalent of heat, L is the latent heat of unit of mass of the vapour, and p is the pressure. At points in the liquid very near its surface it is probable that χ is greater than χ 0 , and at points in the gas very near the surface of the liquid it is probable that χ is less than χ', but this has not as yet been ascertained experimentally. We shall therefore endeavour to apply to this subject the methods used in Thermodynamics, and where these fail us we shall have recourse to the hypotheses of molecular physics.

We have next to determine the value of χ in teιms of the action between one particle and another. Let us suppose that the force between two particles m and m' at the distance∕ is F≈mm' (ff<F) .... (22), being reckoned positive when the force is attractive. The actual force between the particles arises in part from their mutual gravitation, which is inversely as the square of the distance. This force is 0

expressed by mm ’ It is easy to show that a force subject to this law would not account for capillary action. We shall, therefore, in what follows, consider only that part of the force which depends on φ(∕), where φ(∕) is a function of f which is insensible for all sensible values of ∕, but which becomes sensible and even enormously great when/is exceedingly small.

If we next introduce a new function of /and write Ç ≠(∕M∕-Π(√) (23), then m m' ∏(∕) will represent—1. The work done by the attractive force on the particle m, while it is brought from an infinite distance from m' to the distance/from m' ; or 2. The attraction of a particle m on a narrow straight rod resolved in the direction of the length of the rod, one extremity of the rod being at a distance /from m, and the other at an infinite distance, the mass of unit of length of the rod being m'. The function ∏(∕) is also insensible for sensible values of/, but for insensible values of/it may become sensible and even very great.

If we next write 4*∕∏(∕)d∕=ψ(i) (24), then 2πJZJσψ(i) will represent—1. The work done by the attractive force while a particle m is brought from an infinite distance to a distance z from an infinitely thin stratum of the substance whose mass per unit of area is σ ; 2. The attraction of a particle m placed at a distance z from the plane surface of an infinite solid whose density is σ.

Let us examine the case in which the particle m is placed at a distance z from a curved stratum of the substance, whose principal radii of curvature are R 1 and R s . Let P (fig. 2) be the particle and PB a normal to the surface. Let the plane of the paper be a normal section of the surface of the stratum at the point B, making an angle ω with the section whose radius of curvature is R r Then if 0 is the centre of curvature in the plane of the paper, and BO = u,

Let POQ = 0 , PO=r , PQ=∕ , BP=z, ∕ 2 =u 2 + r 2 - 2ur cos. 6 (26).

The element of the stratum at Q may be expressed by σu ’ sin. θ dθdω, or expressing dθ in terms of df by (26), σ ^,fdfd u >.

Multiplying this by m and by ∏∕, we obtain for the work done by the attraction of this element when m is brought from an infinite distance to P 1 , u mσ ~f∏(f)dfdω .

Integrating with respect to /from ∕=z to f—a, where α is a line very great compared with the extreme range of the molecular force, but very small compared with either of the radii of curvature, we obtain for the work

∕mσ"(ψ(≈)-ψ{α))<Z ω , and since ψ(α) is an insensible quantity we may omit it. We may also write u z

- = 1 + - + Ac., τ u ’ since z is very small compared with u, and expressing u in terms or ω by (25), we find r a,r ., M , /cos. 2 « sin. 2 «\ ) , f 7nσψ(z)∣l+ s (- ir +- τ -)j<Z w = 2 < w M'(≡) j 1 + ∣ 2 (⅛ + ⅛) j ∙

This then expresses the work done by the attractive forces when a particle m is brought from an infinite distance to the point P at a [9:5:61] distance z from a stratum whose surface-density is <r, and whose principal radii of curvature are R 1 and R a .

To find the work done when m is brought to the point P in the neighbourhood of a solid body, the density of which is a function of the depth v below the surface, we have only to write instead of σ ρdz, and to integrate 2τmf ιι pt(z)dz+πm (jζ + jξ) j ζ pzψ(fdz, where, in general, we must suppose p a function of z. This expression, when integrated, gives (1) the work done on a particle m while it is brought from an infinite distance to the point P, or (2) the attraction on a long slender column normal to the surface and terminating at P, the mass of unit of length of the column being m. In the form of the theory given by Laplace, the density of the liquid was supposed to be uniform. Hence if we write

K = 2√θ ψ(z)de , ∏ = 2√θ zψ(z)dz, the pressure of a column of the fluid itself terminating at the surface will be p« j K + ∣ H + ⅛) ĭ ’

and the work done by the attractive forces when a particle m is brought to the surface of the fluid from an infinite distance will be mp I κ + 1 h (J∙ i + 1 θ j-.

If we write f t ^{z)dz=θ(z), then 2πmpθ(z) will express the work done by the attractive forces, while a particle m is brought from an infinite distance to a distance z from the plane surface of a mass of the substance of density p and infinitely thick. The function θ(z) is insensible for all sensible values of z. For insensible values it may become sensible, but it must remain finite even when z=0, in which case β(0) = K.

If χ ’ is the potential energy of unit of mass of the substance in vapour, then at a distance z from the plane surface of the liquid x = x , -2ιrp0(≡).

At the surface χ = x '-2ιrρ0(O).

At a distance z within the surface

X = √ - 4πp0(O) + 2ιrpθ(z) .

If the liquid forms a stratum of thickness e, then χ = χ ’ - 4τp0(O) + 2τrp0(z) + 2πpθ(z - c).

The surface-density of this stratum is <r=ep. The energy per unit of area is σ=f e χp<⅛ 'S 0

= cp(χ ’ — 4πpθ(0) ) + 2πp s j ζ θ(z)dz + 2ιrρ*J" o θ(c — z)dz.

Since the two sides of the stratum are similar the last two terms are equal, and

«= c p(x' - 4ιrpθ(0) ) + 4πp i f' θ(z)dz.

Differentiating with respect to c, we find dσ dc=P'

^=p(x'- ¼> θ (0 )) + 4rp ’ 0(c).

Hence the surface-tension de τ ~ e ~ σ Tσ =Aτp i (J'' θ(z)dz - c0(c)) .

Integrating the first term within brackets by parts, it becomes cθ(c)-0θ(0)-∕ o e z^-dz.

Remembering that 0(0) is a finite quantity, and that ψ(2 )> we find

T=4πp s j ζ%ψ(z)<fe.

When c is greater than c this is equivalent to 2H in the equation of Laplace. Hence the tension is the same for all films thicker than r, the range of the molecular forces. For thinner films

= 4ιro i cψ(c).

Hence if ψ(c) is positive, the tension and the thickness will increase together. Now 2πmpψ(c) represents the attraction between a particle m and the plane surface of an infinite mass of the liquid, when the distance of the particle outside the surface is c. Now, the force between the particle and the liquid is certainly, on the whole, attractive; but if between any two small values of c it should be repulsive, then for films whose thickness lies between these values the tension will increase as the thickness diminishes, but for all other cases the tension will diminish as the thickness diminishes.

We have given several examples in which the density is assumed to be uniform, because Poisson has asserted that capillary phenomena would not take place unless the density varied rapidly near the surface. In this assertion we think he was mathematically wrong, though in his own hypothesis that the density does actually vary, he was probably right. I n fact, the quantity 4ιrp 2 K, which we may call with Van der Waals the molecular pressure, is so great for most liquids (5000 atmospheres for water), that in the parts near the surface, where the molecular pressure varies rapidly, we may expect considerable variation )f density, even when we take into account the smallness of the compressibility of liquids.

The pressure at any point of the liquid arises from two causes, the external pressure P to which the liquid is subjected, and the pressure arising from the mutual attraction of its molecules. If we suppose that the number of molecules within the range of the attraction of a given molecule is very large, the part of the pressure arising from attraction will be proportional to the square of the number of molecules in unit of volume, that is, to the square of the density. Hence we may write P=P + A p 1 (1), where A is a constant. But by the equations of equilibrium of the liquid

⅜=-pdχ (2).

Hence

-pdχ=2Apdp (3), and x '- x =2Ap-2B ..... (4). where B is another constant.

Near the plane surface of a liquid we may assume p a function of z. We have then for the value of χ at the point where z—c, χ ’ -χ-2τrf^*p(z)^(z-c)dz . . . (5), where ¢ is the range beyond which the attraction of a mass of liquid bounded by a plane surface becomes insensible. The value of x depends, therefore, on those values only of p which correspond to strata for which z is nearly equal to c. We may, therefore, expand p in terms of zc, or writing x for zc, p=p c +x (⅛) w + ⅜(S)(o + * c ∙ ∙ ∙ (6) ’ where the suffix (c) denotes that in the quantity to which it is applied after differentiation, z is to be made equal to c. We may now write X " X = 2,rp ω ∕+∕ ∏x)dx + 2τ (⅛ xψ(x)dx + 2τ (S)(c) l/^ (x)dx+&C · * σ) · The function ψ(x) has equal values for + x and - x. Hence y'* + e *jc∙ψ(x)i7z vanishes if n is odd.

But if we write

K = ιr * ψ(μ)dx , L - I »* x t ψ(x)dx, Μ = τ^^o^TΞ ,r ∕ + ∕ x i ψ(x}dx, &c. x '- x =2Kp + 2L J+2M^+fc c ,

This is the expression for x on the hypothesis that the value of p can be expanded in a series of powers of z - c within the limits ze and z+e. It is only when the point P is within the distance e of the surface of the liquid that this ceases to be possible.

If we now substitute for x its value from equation 4, we obtain 2Ap - 2B = 2Kp + 2L ∣⅛ + 2M +&c., a linear differential equation in p, the solution of which is p-~ς —w + C 1 e + C s β + C 3 β + C 4 e , where n 1 , n a , ra 3 , n 4 are the roots of the equation lln 4 + Ln s + KA=0.

The coefficient Μ is less than **L, where c is the range of the [9:5:62] attractive force. Hence we may consider Μ very small compared with L. If we neglect Μ altogether,

∕∑V^K ∕ITK

n, = √ -y— , ⅝=-V - L - ∙

If we assume a quantity a such that α i K = 2L, we may call a the average range of the molecular forces. If we also take b, so that bn = 1, we may call b the modulus of the variation of the density near the surface. .

Our calculation hitherto has been made on the hypothesis that a is small when compared with b, and in that case we have found that a 2 : b a :: A - K: K .

But it appears from experiments on liquids that A - K is in general large when compared with K, and sometimes very large. Hence we conclude, first, that the hypothesis of our calculation is incorrect, and, secondly, that the phenomena of capillary action do not in any very great degree depend on the variation of density near the surface, but that the principal part of the force depends on the finite range of the molecular action.

In the following table, Åp is half the cubical elasticity of the liquid, and Kp the molecular pressure, both expressed in atmospheres (the absolute value of an atmosphere being one million in centimetre-gramme-second measure, see below, p. 70). p is the density, T the surface-tension, and a the average range of the molecular action, as calculated by Von der Waals from the values of T and K.

The unit in which a is expressed is 1 cm × 10“ 9 ; a is therefore the twenty-millionth part of a centimetre for mercury, the thirtymillionth for water, and the forty-millionth part for alcohol. Quincke, however, found by direct experiment that certain molecular actions were sensible at a distance of a two-hundred-thousandth part of a centimetre, so that we cannot regard any of these numbers as accurate.

On Surface-tension.

Definition.— The tension of a liquid surface across any line drawn on the surface is normal to the line, and is the same for all directions of the line, and is measured by the force across an element of the line divided by the length of that element. Experimental Laws of Surface-tension.

1. For any given liquid surface, as the surface which separates water from air. or oil from water, the surfacetension is the same at every point of the surface and in every direction. It is also practically independent of the curvature of the surface, although it appears from the mathematical theory that there is a slight increase of tension where the mean curvature of the surface is concave, and a slight diminution where it is convex. The amount of this increase and diminution is too small to be directly measured, though it has a certain theoretical importance in the explanation of the equilibrium of the superficial layer of the liquid where it is inclined to the horizon.

2. The surface-tension diminishes as the temperature rises, and when the temperature reaches that of the critical point at which the distinction between the liquid and its vapour ceases, it has been observed by Andrews that the capillary action also vanishes. The early writers on capillary action supposed that the diminution of capillary action was due simply to the change of density corresponding to the rise of temperature, and, therefore, assuming the surfacetension to vary as the square of the density, they deduced its variations from the observed dilatation of the liquid by heat. This assumption, however, does not appear to be verified by the experiments of Brunner and Wolff on the πse of water in tubes at different temperatures.

3. The tension of the surface separating two liquids which do not mix cannot be deduced by any known method from the tensions of the surfaces of the liquids when separately in contact with air.

When the surface is curved, the effect of the surfacetension is to make the pressure on the concave side exceed the pressure on the convex side by T + -^, where T is the intensity of the surface-tension and R 1 , R. 2 are the radii of curvature of any two sections normal to the surface and to each other.

If three fluids which do not mix are in contact with each other, the three surfaces of separation meet in a line, straight or curved. Let 0 (fig.

3) be a point in this line, and let the plane of the paper be supposed to be normal to the line at the point 0. The three angles between the tangent planes to the three surfaces of separation at the point 0 are completely determined by the tensions of the three surfaces. For if in the triangle abc the side ab is taken so as to represent on a given scale the tension of the surface of contact of the fluids a and b, and if the other sides be and ca are taken so as to represent on the same scale the tensions of the surfaces between b and c and between c and a respectively, then the condition of equilibrium at 0 for the corresponding tensions R, P, and Q is that the angle ROP shall be the supplement of abc, POQ of bca, and, therefore, QOR of cab. Thus the angles at which the surfaces of separation meet are the same at all parts of the line of concourse of the three fluids. When three films of the same liquid meet, their tensions are equal, and, therefore, they make angles of 120° with each other. The froth of soap-suds or beat-up eggs consists of a multitude of small films which meet each other at angles of 120°.

If four fluids, a, b, c, d, meet in a point 0, and if a tetrahedron ABCD is formed so that its edge AB represents the tension of the surface of contact of the liquids a and b, BC that of b and c, and so on; then if we place this tetrahedron so that the face ABC is normal to the tangent at 0 to the line of concourse of the fluids abc, and turn it so that the edge AB is normal to the tangent plane at 0 to the surface of contact of the fluids a and b, then the other three faces of the tetrahedron will be normal to the tangents at 0 to the other three lines of concourse of the liquids, and the other five edges of the tetrahedron will be normal to the tangent planes at 0 to the other five surfaces of contact.

If six films of the same liquid meet in a point the corresponding tetrahedron is a regular tetrahedron, and each film, where it meets the others, has an angle v.hose cosine is - ½. Hence if we take two nets of wire with hexagonal meshes, and place one on the other so that the point of concourse of three hexagons of one net coincides with the middle of a hexagon of the other, and if we then, after dipping them in Plateau’s liquid, place them horizontally, and gently raise the upper one, we shall develop a system of plane laminae arranged as the walls and floors of the cells are arranged in a honeycomb. We must not, however, raise the upper net too much, or the system of films will become unstable.

When a drop of one liquid, B, is placed on the surface of another, A, the phenomena which take place depend on the relative magnitude of the three surface-tensions corresponding to the surface between A and air, between B [9:5:63] and air, and between A and B. If no one of these tensions is greater than the sum of the other two, the drop will assume the form of a lens, the angles which the upper and lower surfaces of the lens make with the free surface of A and with each other being equal to the external angles of the triangle of forces. Such lenses are often seen formed by drops of fat floating on the surface of hot water, soup, or gravy. But when the surface-tension of A exceeds the sum of the tensions of the surfaces of contact of B with air and with A, it is impossible to construct the triangle of forces, so that equilibrium becomes impossible. The edge of the drop is drawn out by the surface-tension of A with a force greater than the sum of the tensions of the two surfaces of the drop. The drop, therefore, spreads itself out, with great velocity, over the surface of A till it covers an enormous area, and is reduced to such extreme tenuity that it is not probable that it retains the same properties of surface-tension which it has in a large mass. Thus a drop of train oil will spread itself over the surface of the sea till it shows the colours of thin plates. These rapidly descend in Newton’s scale and at last disappear, showing that the thickness of the film is less than the tenth part of the length of a wave of light. But even when thus attenuated, the film may be proved to be present, since the surface-tension of the liquid is considerably less than that of pure water. This may be shown by placing another drop of oil on the surface. This drop will not spread out like the first drop, but will take the form of a flat lens with a distinct circular edge, showing that the surface-tension of what is still apparently pure water is now less than the sum of the tensions of the surfaces separating oil from air and water.

The spreading of drops on the surface of a liquid has formed the subject of a very extensive series of experiments by Mr Tomlinson. Μ. Van der Mensbrugghe has also written a very complete memoir on this subject. 1

When a solid body is in contact with two fluids, the surface of the solid cannot alter its form, but the angle at which the surface of contact of the two fluids meets the surface of the solid depends on the values of the three surfacetensions. If a and δ are the two fluids and c the solid then the equilibrium of the tensions at the point 0 depends only on that of thin components parallel to the surface, because the surface-tensions normal to the surface are balanced by the resistance of the solid.

Hence if the angle ROQ (fig. 4) at which the surface of contact OP meets the solid is denoted by a,

T δc -T cα -T αδ cos. α=0, whence

Tðc - T fa cos. a= —m .

1 aδ

As an experiment on the angle of contact only gives us the difference of the surface-tensions at the solid surface, we cannot determine their actual value. It is theoretically probable that they are often negative, and may be called surface-pressures.

The constancy of the angle of contact between the surface of a fluid and a solid was first pointed out by Dr Young, who states that the angle of contact between mercury and glass is about 140°. Quincke makes it 128° 52 , .

If the tension of the surface between the solid and one of the fluids exceeds the sum of the other two tensions, the point of contact will not be in equilibrium, but will be dragged towards the side on which the tension is greatest. If the quantity of the first fluid is small it will stand in a drop on the surface of the solid without wetting it. If the quantity of the second fluid is small it will spread itself over the surface and wet the solid. The angle of contact of the first fluid is 180° and that of the second is zero.

If a drop of alcohol be made to touch one side of a drop of oil on a glass plate, the alcohol will appear to chase the oil over the plate, and if a drop of water and a drop of bisulphide of carbon be placed in contact in a horizontal capillary tube, the bisulphide of carbon will chase the water along the tube. In both cases the liquids move in the direction in which the surface-pressure at the solid is least.

On the rise of a Liquid in a Tube.

Let a tube (fig. 5) whose internal radius is r, made of a solid substance c, be dipped into a liquid a. Let us suppose that the angle of contact for this liquid with the solid c is an acute angle. This implies that the tension of the free surface of the solid c is greater than that of the surface of contact of the solid with the liquid a. Now consider the tension of the free surface of the liquid a. All round its edge there is a tension T acting at an angle α with the vertical. The circumference of the edge is 2τrr, so that the resultant of this tension is a force 2τrrT cos. a acting vertically upwards on the liquid. Hence the liquid will rise in the tube till the weight of the vertical column between the free surface and the level of the liquid in the vessel balances the resultant of the surfacetension. The upper surface of this column is not level, so that the height of the column cannot be directly measured, but let us assume that lι is the mean height of the column, that is to say, the height of a column of equal weight, but with a flat top. Then if τ is the radius of the tube at the top of the column, the volume of the suspended column is ιrr 2 h, and its weight is ττpgr i lι, when p is its density and g the intensity of gravity. Equating this force with the resu!tant of the tension τrpgr 3 h — 2tγ7 , T cos. α, or

2T cos. a P9 r

Hence the mean height to which the fluid rises is inversely as the radius of the tube. For water in a clean glass tube the angle of contact is zero, and

, 2T - ogr '

For mercury in a glass tube the angle of contact is 128° 52', the cosine of which is negative. Hence when a glass tube is dipped into a vessel of mercury, the mercury within the tube stands at a lower level than outside it.

Rise of a Liquid between Two Plates.

When two parallel plates are placed vertically in a liquid the liquid rises between them. If we now suppose fig. 5 to represent a vertical section perpendicular to the plates, we may calculate the rise of the liquid. Let l be the breadth of the plates measured perpendicularly to the 1 Swr la Tension Superficielle des Liquides, Bruxelles, 1873.
[9:5:64]

plane of the paper, then the length of the line which bounds the wet and the dry parts of the plates inside is I for each surface, and on this the tension T acts at an angle a to the vertical. Hence the resultant of the surface-tension is 2lT cos. a. If the distance between the inner surfaces of the plates is a, and if the mean height of the film of fluid which rises between them is ä, the weight of fluid raised is pghla. Equating the forces— pghlα = 2∏ cos. a, whence

2T cos. « - P'J a This expression is the same as that for the rise of a liquid in a tube, except that instead of r, the radius of the tube, we have a the distance of the plates.

Form of the Capillary Surface,

The form of the surface of a liquid acted on by gravity is easily determined if we assume that near the part considered the line of contact of the surface of the liquid with that of the solid bounding it is straight and horizontal, as it is when the solids which constrain the liquid are bounded by surfaces formed by horizontal and parallel generating lines. This will be the case, for instance, near a flat plate dipped into the liquid. If we suppose these generating lines to be normal to the plane of the paper then all sections of the solids parallel to this plane will be equal and similar to each other, and the section of the surface of the liquid will be of the same form for all such sections

Let us consider the portion of the liquid between two parallel sections distant one unit of length. Let P 1 , P. 2 (fig. 6) be two points of the surface; 0 1 , θ 2 , the inclination of the surface to the horizon at P 1 and P 2 ; y v y 2 the heights of P 1 and P 2 above the level of the liquid at a distance from all solid bodies. The pressure at any point of the liquid which is above this level is negative unless another fluid as, for instance, the air, presses on the upper surface, but it is only the difference of pressures with which we have to do, because two equal pressures on opposite sides of the surface produce no effect.

We may, therefore, write for the pressure at a height y P=-pffy, where p is the density of the liquid, or if there are two fluids the excess of the density of the lower fluid over that of the upper one.

The forces acting on the portion of liquid P 1 P 2 A 2 A 1 are— first, the horizontal pressures, - ⅛pgy 2 and ½pyy∣; second, the surface-tension T acting at P 1 and P 2 in directions inclined θ 1 and θ 2 to the horizon. Resolving horizontally we find—

T (cos. θ i - cos. 0 1 ) +1 g p (y* - y 1 *) = o, whence cos. θ i = cos. 0 1 -1 g p y* +^y i i , or if we suppose Γ 1 fixed and P 2 variable, we may write

1 qpy* cos. e=ğ -ψ- + constant.

This equation gives a relation between the inclination of the curve to the horizon and the height above the level of the liquid.

Resolving vertically we find that the weight of the liquid raised above the level must be equal to T (siιi, θ 2 - sin. θ 1 ), and this is therefore equal to the area P 1 P 2 A 2 Aj multi plied by gp. The form of the capillary surface is identical with that of the “elastic curve,” or the curve formed by a uniform spring originally straight, when its ends are acted on by equal and opposite forces applied either to the ends themselves or to solid pieces attached to them. Drawings of the different forms of the curve may be found in Thomson and Tait’s Natural Philosophy, vol. i. p. 455.

We shall next consider the rise of a liquid between two plates of different materials for which the angles of contact are α 1 and α 2 , the distance between the plates being a, a small quantity. Since the plates are very near one another we may use the following equation of the surface as an approximation :—

y = h l + Ax + B.r s k2 ≡⅛ι + Aa + B<ι 2 , whence cot. α 1 = - A

cot. <⅛= A + 2B«

T (cos. a l + cos. σ 2 ) - p ga ( h 1 +j Aa + BA*) , whence we obtain

T λ ^ 1 ~pga ( cos, βl + cos ' + 6 (2 cot ∙ a ι - cot ∙ a s)

T cι

A ii = pğã (cos, βl + cos, t ⅛) + 6 (2 cot ∙ e ⅛ ~ cot ∙ β ι) ∙

Let X be the force which must be applied in a horizontal direction to either plate to keep it from approaching the other, then the forces acting on the first plate are T + X in the negative direction, and T sin. a l + ⅛gph l 2 in the positive direction. Hence

X = ∣0>V-T(l-sin. α 1 ).

For the second plate

X = 2 gpki - T(l - sin. α i ).

Hence

X = ξ gp{h x i + A s 9 ) - T (1 -1 (sin. β 1 + sin. α a )) , or, substituting the values of h 1 and h 2 ,

X = χ (cos. α 1 + cos. c⅛) 2

the remaining terms being negligible when a is small. The force, therefore, with which the two plates are drawn together consists first of a positive part, or in other words an attraction, varying inversely as the square of the distance, and second, of a negative part or repulsion independent of the distance. Hence in all cases except that in which the angles α 1 and α 2 are supplementary to each other, the force is attractive when α is small enough, but when cos. α 1 and cos. α 2 are of different signs, as when the liquid is raised by one plate, and depressed by the other, the first term may be so small that the repulsion indicated by the second term comes into play. The fact that a pair of plates which repel one another at a certain distance may attract one another at a smaller distance was deduced by Laplace from theory, and verified by the observations of the Abbé Haüy.

A Drop between Two Plates.

If a small quantity of a liquid which wets glass be introduced between two glass plates slightly inclined to each [9:5:65] other, it will run towards that part where the glass plates are nearest together. When the liquid is in equilibrium it forms a thin film, the outer edge of which is all of the same thickness. If d is the distance between the plates at the edge of the film and ∏ the atmospheric pressure, the

2T cos. α

pressure of the liquid in the film is ∏ -jA— ι and if

A is the area of the film between the plates and B its circumference, the plates will be pressed together with a force

2AT cos. α .

h BT sin. a, and this, whether the atmosphere exerts any pressure or not. The force thus produced by the introduction of a drop of water between two plates is enormous, and is often sufficient to press certain parts of the plates together so powerfully as to bruise them or break them. When two blocks of ice are placed loosely together so that the superfluous water which melts from them may drain away, the remaining water draws the blocks together with a force sufficient to cause the blocks to adhere by the process called Regelation.

In many experiments bodies are floated on the surface of water in order that they may be free to move under the action of slight horizontal forces. Thus Newton placed a magnet in a floating vessel and a piece of iron in another in order to observe their mutual action, and Ampère floated a voltaic battery with a coil of wire in its circuit in order to observe the effects of the earth’s magnetism on the electric circuit. When such floating bodies come near the edge of the vessel they are drawn up to it, and are apt to stick fast to it. There are two ways of avoiding this inconvenience. One is to grease the float round its water line so that the water is depressed round it. This, however, often produces a worse disturbing effect, because a thin film of grease spreads over the water and increases its surface-viscosity. The other method is to fill the vessel with water till the level of the water stands a little higher than the rim of the vessel. The float will then be repelled from the edge of the vessel. Such floats, however, should always be made so that the section taken at the level of the water is as small as possible.

Phenomena arising from the Variation of the Surface-tension.

Pure water has a higher surface-tension than that of any other substance liquid at ordinary temperatures except mercury. Hence any other liquid if mixed with water diminishes its surface-tension. For example, if a drop of alcohol be placed on the surface of water, the surfacetension will be diminished from 80, the value for pure water, to 25, the value for pure alcohol. The surface of the liquid will therefore no longer be in equilibrium, and a current will be formed at and near the surface from the alcohol to the surrounding water, and this current will go on as long as there is more alcohol at one part of the surface than at another. If the vessel is deep, these currents will be balanced by counter currents below them, but if the depth of the water is only two or three millimetres, the surface-current will sweep away the whole of the water, leaving a dry spot where the alcohol was dropped in. This phenomenon was first described and explained by Professor James Thomson, who also explained a phenomenon, the converse of this, called the “tears of strong wine.”

If a wine glass be half-filled with port wine the liquid rises a little up the side of the glass as other liquids do. The wine, however, contains alcohol and water, both of which evaporate, but the alcohol faster than the water, so that the superficial layer becomes more watery. In the middle of the vessel the superficial layer recovers its strength by diffusion from below, but the film adhering to the side of the glass becomes more watery, and therefore has a higher surface-tension than the surface of the stronger wine. It therefore creeps up the side of the glass dragging the strong wine after it, and this goes on till the quantity of fluid dragged up collects into a drop and runs down the side of the glass.

The motion of small pieces of camphor floating on water arises from the gradual solution of the camphor. If this takes place more rapidly on one side of the piece of camphor than on the other side, the surface-tension becomes weaker where there is most camphor in solution, and the lump, being pulled unequally by the surface-tensions, moves off in the direction of the strongest tension, namely, towards the side on which least camphor is dissolved.

If a drop of ether is held near the surface of water the vapour of ether condenses on the surface of the water, and surface-currents are formed flowing in every direction away from under the drop of ether.

If we place a small floating body in a shallow vessel of water and wet one side of it with alcohol or ether, it will move off with great velocity and skim about on the surface of the water, the part wet with alcohol being always the stern.

The surface-tension of mercury is greatly altered by slight changes in the state of the surface. The surface-tension of pure mercury is so great that it is very difficult to keep it clean, for every kind of oil or grease spreads over it at once.

But the most remarkable effects of change of surfacetension are those produced by what is called the electric polarization of the surface. The tension of the surface of contact of mercury and dilute sulphuric acid depends on the electromotive force acting between the mercury and the acid. If the electromotive force is from the acid to the mercury the surface-tension increases; if it is from the mercury to the acid, it diminishes. Faraday observed that a large drop of mercury, resting on the flat bottom of a vessel containing dilute acid, changes its form in a remarkable way when connected with one of the electrodes of a battery, the other electrode being placed in the acid. When the mercury is made positive it becomes dull and spreads itself out; when it is made negative it gathers itself together and becomes bright again. Μ. Lippmann, who has made a careful investigation of the subject, finds that exceedingly small variations of the electromotive force produce sensible changes in the surfacetension. The effect of one of a Daniell’s cell is to increase the tension from 30 ’ 4 to 40 ’ 6. He has constructed a capillary electrometer by which differences of electric potential less than 0 01 of that of a Daniell’s cell can be detected by the difference of the pressure required to force the mercury to a given point of a fine capillary tube. He has also constructed an apparatus in which this variation in the surface-tension is made to do work and drive a machine. He has also found that this action is reversible, for when the area of the surface of contact of the acid and mercury is made to increase, an electric current passes from the mercury to the acid, the amount of electricity which passes while the surface increases by one square centimetre being sufficient to decompose ’ 000013 grammes of water.

On the forms of Liquid Films which are Figures of Revolution. A spherical Soap-bubble.

A soap-bubble is simply a small quantity of soap-suds spread out so as to expose a large surface to the air. The bubble, in fact, has two surfaces, an outer and an inner surface, both exposed to air. It has, therefore, a certain amount of surface-energy depending on the area of these [9:5:66] two surfaces. Since in the case of thin films the outer and inner surfaces are approximately equal, we shall consider the area of the film as representing either of them, and shall use the symbol T to denote the energy of unit of area of the film, both surfaces being taken together. If T' is the energy of a single surface of the liquid, T the energy of the film is 2T'. When by means of a tube we blow air into the inside of the bubble we increase its volume and therefore its surface, and at the same time we do work in forcing air into it, and thus increase the energy of the bubble.

That the bubble has energy may be shown by leaving the end of the tube open. The bubble will contract, forcing the air out, and the current of air blown through the tube may be made to deflect the flame of a candle. If the bubble is in the form of a sphere of radius r this material surface will have an area

S=4τrr s (1).

If T be the energy corresponding to unit of area of the film the surface-energy of the whole bubble will be

ST = 4πr 2 T (2).

The increment of this energy corresponding to an increase of the radius from r to r + dr is therefore

TdS = 8πrTdr (3).

Now this increase of energy was obtained by forcing in air at a pressure greater than the atmospheric pressure, and thus increasing the volume of the bubble.

Let ∏ be the atmospheric pressure and ∏ + p the pressure of the air within the bubble. The volume of the sphere is

V=+" j (4), and the increment of volume is dV — 4ττr~dr (5).

Now if we suppose a quantity of air already at the pressure ∏ + p, the work done in forcing it into the bubble is pdN. Hence the equation of work and energy is ρdiV= r Γds (6), or 4πpr i dr — 8πrdrT (7), or

P=2TJ (8).

This, therefore, is the excess of the pressure of the air within the bubble over that of the external air, and it is due to the action of the inner and outer surfaces of the bubble. We may conceive this pressure to arise from the tendency which the bubble has to contract, or in other words from the surface-tension of the bubble.

If to increase the area of the surface requires the expenditure of work, the surface must resist extension, and if the bubble in contracting can do work, the surface must tend to contract. The surface must therefore act like a sheet of india-rubber when extended both in length and breadth, that is, it must exert surface-tension. The tension of the sheet of india-rubber, however, depends on the extent to which it is stretched, and may be different in different directions, whereas the tension of the surface of a liquid remains the same however much the film is extended, and the tension at any point is the same in all directions.

The intensity of this surface-tension is measured by the stress which it exerts across a line of unit length. Let us measure it in the case of the spherical soap-bubble by considering the stress exerted by one hemisphere of the bubble on the other, across the circumference of a great circle. This stress is balanced by the pressure p acting over the area of the same great circle: it is therefore equal to πr 2 p. To determine the intensity of the surface-tension we have to divide this quantity by the length of the line across which it acts, which is in this case the circumference of a great circle 2πr. Dividing τrr 2 p by this length we obtain ½pr as the value of the intensity of the surfacetension, and it is plain from equation 8 that this is equal to T. Hence the numerical value of the intensity of the surface-tension is equal to the numerical value of the surface-energy per unit of surface. We must remember that since the film has two surfaces the surface-tension of the film is double the tension of the surface of the liquid of whjch it is formed.

To determine the relation between the surface-tension and the pressure which balances it when the form of the surface is not spherical, let us consider the following case :—

Let fig. 8. represent a section through the axis Cc of a soap-bubble in the form of a figure of revolution bounded by two circular disks AB and ab, and having the meridian section APα. Let PQ be an imaginary section normal to the axis. Let the radius of this section PR be y, and let PT, the tangent at P, make an angle α with the axis.

Let us consider the stresses which are exerted across this imaginary section by the lower part on the upper part. If the internal pressure exceeds the external pressure by p, there is in the first place a force τryp acting upwards arising from the pressure p over the area of the section. In the next place, there is the surface-tension acting downwards, but at an angle α with the vertical, across the circular section of the bubble itself, whose circumference is 2τry, and the downward force is therefore 2ττyT cos. α.

Now these forces are balanced by the external force which acts on the disk ACB, which we may call F. Hence equating the forces which act on the portion included between ACB and PRQ

πy z p - 2ιιyΥ cos. <x= - F (9).

If we make CR = z, and suppose z to vary, the shape of the bubble of course remaining the same, the values of y and of α will change, but the other quantities will be constant. In studying these variations we may if we please take as our independent variable the length s of the meridian section AP reckoned from A. Differentiating equation 9 with respect to s we obtain, after dividing by 2τr as a common factor ryd ^ds - τc °s∙a⅛ + τ ysin. α⅛=°. . ∙ (10).

Now

⅛= sin ∙ α < 11 >∙

The radius of curvature of the meridian section is

≈1=-S < 12 >∙

The radius of curvature of a normal section of the surface at right angles to the meridian section is equal to the part of the normal cut off by the axis, which is

R 2 = PN = -^- (13).

z cos. α ' '

Hence dividing equation 10 by y sin. α, we find

< ’ = τ (⅛÷⅛)∙ ···<«)·

This equation, which gives the pressure in terms of the [9:5:67] principal radii of curvature, though here proved only in the case of a surface of revolution, must be true of all surfaces. For the curvature of any surface at a given point may be completely defined in terms of the positions of its principal normal sections and their radii of curvature.

Before going further we may deduce from equation 9 the nature of all the figures of revolution which a liquid film can assume. Let us first determine the nature of a curve, such that if it is rolled on the axis its origin will trace out the meridian section of the bubble. Since at any instant the rolling curve is rotating about the point of contact with the axis, the line drawn from this point of contact to the tracing point must be normal to the direction of motion of the tracing point. Hence if N is the point of contact, NP must be normal to the traced curve. Also, since the axis is a tangent to the rolling curve, the ordinate PR is the perpendicular from the tracing point P on the tangent. Hence the relation between the radius vector and the perpendicular on the tangent of the rolling curve must be identical with the relation between the normal PN and the ordinate PR of the traced curve. If we write r ior PN, then y = r cos. α, and equation 9 becomes s ,∙(' 2 i. 1 )=x. ∖ pr ∕ np

This relation between y and r is identical with the relation between the perpendicular from the focus of a conic section on the tangent at a given point and the focal distance of that point, provided the transverse and conjugate axes of the conic are 2α and 2δ respectively, where

α=-, and ⅛ 2 =-.

P *P

Hence the meridian section of the film may be traced by the focus of such a conic, if the conic is made to roll on the axis.

On the different Forms of the Meridian Line.

(1.) When the conic is an ellipse the meridian line is in the form of a series of waves, and the film itself has a series of alternate swellings and contractions as represented in figs. 8 and 9. This form of the film is called the unduloid.

(Ia.) When the ellipse becomes a circle, the meridian line becomes a straight line parallel to the axis, and the film passes into the form of a cylinder of revolution.

(1δ.) As the ellipse degenerates into the straight line joining its foci, the contracted parts of the unduloid become narrower, till at last the figure becomes a series of spheres in contact.

In all these cases the internal pressure exceeds the 2T

external by — where a is the semitransverse axis of the (I conic. The resultant of the internal pressure and the surface-tension is equivalent to a tension along the axis, and the numerical value of this tension is equal to the force due to the action of this pressure on a circle whose diameter is equal to the conjugate axis of the ellipse.

(2.) When the conic is a parabola the meridian line is a catenary (fig. 10), the internal pressure is equal to the external pressure, and the tension along the axis is equal to 2τrTm where m is the distance of the vertex from the focus.

(3.) When the conic is a hyperbola the meridian line is in the form of a looped curve (fig. 11). The corresponding figure of the film is called the nodoid. The resultant of the internal pressure and the surface-tension is equivalent to a pressure along the axis equal to that due to a pressure p acting on a circle whose diameter is the conjugate axis of the hyperbola.

When the conjugate axis of the hyperbola is made smaller and smaller, the nodoid approximates more and more to the series of spheres touching each other along the axis. When the conjugate axis of the hyperbola increases without limit, the loops of the nodoid are crowded on one another, and each becomes more nearly a ring of circular section, without, however, ever reaching this form. The only closed surface belonging to the series is the sphere.

These figures of revolution have been studied mathematically by Poisson,^[21. Nouvelle théorie de l'action capillaire (1831).] Goldschmidt,^[22. Determinatio superficiei minimae rotatione curvae data duo puncta jungentis circa datum axem ortae (Göttingen, 1831).] Lindelöf and Moigno,^[23. Leçons de calcul des variations (Paris, 1861).] Delaunay,^[24. “Sur la surface de revolution dont la courbure moyenne est constante,” Liouville’s Journal, vi.] Lamarle,^[25. “Théorie géométrique des rayons et centres de courbure,” Bullet, de F Acad. de Belgique, 1857.] Beer,^[26. Tractatus de Theoria Mathematica Phaenomenorum in Liquidis actioni gravitatis detractis observatorum (Bonn, 1857).] and Mannheim,^[27. Journal F Institut, No. 1260.] and have been produced experimentally by Plateau^[28. Statique experimentale et théorique des liquides.] in the two different ways already described.

The limiting conditions of the stability of these figures have been studied both mathematically and experimentally. We shall notice only two of them, the cylinder and the catenoid.

Stability of the Cylinder.

The cylinder is the limiting form of the unduloid when the rolling ellipse becomes a circle. When the ellipse differs infinitely little from a circle, the equation of the meridian line becomes approximately y = α + c sin. ∣ where c is small. This is a simple harmonic wave-line, whose mean distance from the axis is a, whose wave-length is 2∏α, and whose amplitude is c. The internal pressure

T

corresponding to this unduloid is as before p= —. Now ÍZ

consider a portion of a cylindric film of length x terminated by two equal disks of radius r and containing a certain volume of air. Let one of these disks be made to approach the other by a small quantity dx. The film will swell out into the convex part of an unduloid, having its largest section midway between the disks, and we have to determine whether the internal pressure will be greater or less than before. If A and C (fig. 12) are the disks, and if χ the distance between the disks is equal to πr half the wave-length of the harmonic curve, the disks will be at the points where the curve is at its mean distance from the

T

axis, and the pressure will therefore be — as before. If A 1 ,

C 1 are the disks, so that the distance between them is less than ∏r, the curve must be produced beyond the disks before it is at its mean distance from the axis. Hence in this case the mean distance is less than r, and

T

the pressure will be greater than —. If, on the other hand, the disks are at A 2 and C 2 , so that the distance between them is greater than τrr, the curve will reach its mean distance[9:5:68] from the axis before it reaches the disks. The mean distance will therefore be greater than r, and the τ

pressure will be less than —. Hence if one of the disks be made to approach the other, the internal pressure will be increased if the distance between the disks is less than half the circumference of either, and the pressure will be diminished if the distance is greater than this quantity. In the same way we may show that if the distance between the disks is increased, the pressure will be diminished or increased according as the distance is less or more than half the circumference of either.

Now let us consider a cylindric film contained between two equal fixed disks A and B, and let a third disk, C, be placed midway between. Let C be slightly displaced towards A. If AC and CB are each less than half the circumference of a disk the pressure on C will increase on the side of A and diminish on the side of B. The resultant force on C will therefore tend to oppose the displacement and to bring C back to its original position. The equilibrium of C is therefore stable. It is easy to show that if C had been placed in any other position than the middle, its equilibrium would have been stable. Hence the film is stable as regards longitudinal displacements. It is also stable as regards displacements transverse to the axis, for the film is in a state of tension, and any lateral displacement of its middle parts would produce a resultant force tending to restore the film to its original position. Hence if the length of the cylindric film is less than its circumference, it is in stable equilibrium. But if the length of the cylindric film is greater than its circumference, and if we suppose the disk C to be placed midway between A and B, and to be moved towards A, the pressure on the side next A will diminish, and that on the side next B will increase, so that the resultant force will tend to increase the displacement, and the equilibrium of the disk C is therefore unstable. Hence the equilibrium of a cylindri c film whose length is greater than its circumference is unstable. Such a film, if ever so little disturbed, will begin to contract at one section and to expand at another, till its form ceases to resemble a cylinder, if it does not break up into two parts which become ultimately portions of spheres.

Instability of a Jet of Liquid.

When a liquid flows out of a vessel through a circular opening in the bottom of the vessel, the form of the stream is at first nearly cylindrical though its diameter gradually diminishes from the orifice downwards on account of the increasing velocity of the Equid. But the liquid after it leaves the vessel is subject to no forces except gravity, the pressure of the air, and its own surface-tension. Of these gravity has no effect on the form of the stream except in drawing asunder its parts in a vertical direction, because the lower parts are moving faster than the upper parts. The resistance of the air produces little disturbance until the velocity becomes very great. But the surfacetension, acting on a cylindric column of liquid whose length exceeds the limit of stability, begins to produce enlargements and contractions in the stream as soon as the liquid has left the orifice, and these inequalities in the figure of the column go on increasing till it is broken up into elongated fragments. These fragments as they are falling through the air continue to be acted on by surfacetension. They therefore shorten themselves, and after a series of oscillations in which they become alternately elongated and flattened, settle down into the form of spherical drops.

This process, which we have followed as it takes place on an individual portion of the falling liquid, goes through its several phases at different distances from the orifice, so that if we examine different portions of the stream as it descends, we shall find next the orifice the unbroken column, then a series of contractions and enlargements, then elongated drops, then flattened drops, and so on till the drops become spherical.

Stability of the Catenoid.

When the internal pressure is equal to the external, the film forms a surface of which the mean curvature at every point is zero. The only surface of revolution having this property is the catenoid formed by the revolution of a catenary about its directrix. This catenoid, however, is in stable equilibrium only when the portion considered is such that the tangents to the catenary at its extremities intersect before they reach the directrix.

To prove this, let us consider the catenary as the form of equilibrium of a chain suspended between two fixed points A and B. Suppose the chain hanging between A and B to be of very great length, then the tension at A or B will be very great. Let the chain be hauled in over a peg at A. At first the tension will diminish, but if the process be continued the tension will reach a minimum value and will afterwards increase to infinity as the chain between A and B approaches to the form of a straight line. Hence for every tension greater than the minimum tension there are two catenaries passing through A and B. Since the tension is measured by the height above the directrix these two catenaries have the same directrix. Every catenary lying between them has its directrix higher, and every catenary lying beyond them has its directrix lower than that of the two catenaries.

Now let us consider the surfaces of revolution formed by this system of catenaries revolving about the directrix of the two catenaries of equal tension. We know that the radius of curvature of a surface of revolution in the plane normal to the meridan plane is the portion of the normal intercepted by the axis of revolution.

The radius of curvature of a catenary is equal and opposite to the portion of the normal intercepted by the directrix of the catenary. Hence a catenoid whose directrix coincides with the axis of revolution has at every point its principal radii of curvature equal and opposite, so that the mean curvature of the surface is zero.

The catenaries which lie between the two whose direction coincides with the axis of revolution generate surfaces whose radius of curvature convex towards the axis in the meridian plane is less than the radius of concave curvature. The mean curvature of these surfaces is therefore convex towards the axis. The catenaries which lie beyond the two generate surfaces whose radius of curvature convex towards the axis in the meridian plane is greater than the radius of concave curvature. The mean curvature of these surfaces is, therefore, concave towards the axis.

Now if the pressure is equal on both sides of a liquid film, if its mean curvature is zero, it will be in equilibrium. This is the case with the two catenoids. If the mean curvature is convex towards the axis the film will move from the axis. Hence if a film in the form of the catenoid which is nearest the axis is ever so slightly displaced from the axis it will move further from the axis till it reaches the other catenoid.

If the mean curvature is concave towards the axis the film will tend to approach the axis. Hence if a film in the form of the catenoid which is nearest the axis be displaced towards the axis, it will tend to move further towards the axis and will collapse. Hence the film in the form of the catenoid which is nearest the axis is in unstable equilibrium under the condition that it is exposed to equal pressures within and without. If, however, the circular ends of the [9:5:69] catenoid are closed with solid disks, so that the volume cí air contained between these disks and the film is determinate, the film will be in stable equilibrium however large a portion of the catenary it may consist of.

The criterion as’ to whether any given catenoid is stable or not may be obtained as follows.

Let PABQ and A7>5B (fig. 13) be two catenaries having the same directrix and intersecting in A and B. Draw ^Pp and Qq touching both catenaries, Pp and Q ι q will intersect at T, a point in the directrix; for since any catenary with its directrix is a similar figure to any other catenary with its directrix, if the directrix of the one coincides with that of the other the centre of similitude must lie on the common directrix. Also, since the curves at P and p are equally inclined to the directrix, P and p are corresponding points and the line P p must pass through the centre of similitude. Similarly Q? must pass through the centre of similitude. Hence T,the point of intersection of Pp and Qç, must be the centre of similitude and must be on the common directrix. Hence the tangents at A and B to the upper catenary must intersect above the directrix, and the tan- . gents at A and B

to the lower catenary must intersect below the directrix. The condition of stability of a catenoid is therefore that the tangents at the extremities of its generating catenary must intersect before they reach the directrix.

Stability of a Plane Surface.

We shall next consider the limiting conditions of stability of the horizontal surface which separates a heavier fluid above from a lighter fluid below. Thus, in an experiment of Μ. Duprez,^[29. “Sur un cas particulier de l’équilibre des liquides,” par F. Duprez, Nouveaux Afém. de V Acad. de Belgique. 1851 et 1854.] a vessel containing olive oil is placed with its mouth downwards in a vessel containing a mixture of alcohol and water, the mixture being denser than the oil. The surface of separation is in this case horizontal and stable, so that the equilibrium is established of itself. Alcohol is then added very gradually to the mixture till it becomes lighter than the oil. The equilibrium of the fluids would now be unstable if it were not for the tension of the surface which separates them, and which, when the orifice of the vessel is not too large, continues to preserve the stability of the equilibrium.

When the equilibrium at last becomes unstable, the ’ destruction of equilibrium takes place by the lighter fluid ascending in one part of the orifice and the heavier descending in the other. Heuce the displacement of the surface to which we must direct our attention is one which does not alter the volume of the liquid in the vessel, and which therefore is upward in one part of the surface and downward in another. The simplest case is that of a rectangular orifice in a horizontal plane, the sides being a and b.

Let the surface of separation be originally in the plane of the orifice, and let tlιe co-ordinates x and y be measured from one corner -parallel to the sides α and b respectively, and let z be measured upwards. Then if ρ be the density of the upper liquid, and <r that of the lower liquid, and P the original pressure at the surface of separation, then when the surface receives an upward displacement z, the pressure above it will be P- pgz, and that below it will be P - σgz, so that the surface will be acted on by an upward pressure (p - σ)gz.

Now if the displacement z be everywhere very small, the curvature d 2 z d⅛

in the planes parallel to xz and yz will be - r - i and ∙ j -≡ respectively; (Fx ay and if T is the surface-tension the whole upward force will be _ r d i z cPz ∖ . τ W s+ ⅜ 2 ) + ^ -σ ^ z ∙

If this quantity is of the same sign as z, the displacement will be increased, and the equilibrium will be unstable. If it is of the opposite sign from z, the equilibrium will be stable. The limiting condition may be found by putting it equal to zero. One form of the solution of the equation, and that which is applicable to the case of a rectangular orifice, is z=C sin. px sin. qy.

Substituting in the equation we find the condition

Ĭ+ «« stable.

0 neutral.

- ve unstable.

That the surface may coincide with the edge of the orifice, which is a rectangle, whose sides are a and b, we must have pa — mir , qb = rnt, when m and n are integral numbers. Also, if m and n are both unity, the displacement will be entirely positive, and the volume of the liquid will not be constant. That the volume may be constant, either n or m must be an even number. We have, therefore, to consider the conditions under which cannot be made negative. Under these conditions the equilibrium is stable for all small displacements of the surface. The smallest admissible value of ^2 + ⅛s is + ⅛Σ> where a is the longer side of the rectangle. Hence the condition of stability is that ιr2 (⅛ + ⅛) τ -<f" σ ^

Effect of Surface-tension on the Velocity of Waves. ^[30. See Sir W. Thomson. “Hydrokinetic Solutions and Observations, Phü. Mag., Nov. 1871.]

When a series of waves are propagated on the surface of a liquid, the surface-tension has the effect of increasing the pressure at the crests of the waves and diminishing it in the troughs. If the wave-length is λ, the equation of the surface is X y = δ sin. 2πξ .

The pressure due to the surface-tension T is d?y 4ιr 2

*='⅛- λ 2 Ty ’

This pressure must be added to the pressure due to gravity gpy. Hence the waves will be propagated as if the intensity of gravity had been

4x 2 Ι f~ 9+ λ 5 ^ p instead of g. Now it is shown in hydrodynamics that the [9:5:70] velocity of propagation of waves in deep water is that acquired by a heavy body falling through half the radius of the circle whose circumference is the wave-length, or

This velocity is a minimum when

√T — , ÿo and the minimum value is

7^τ^

V= √4-∙ v o

For waves whose length from crest to crest is greater than λ, the principal force concerned in the motion is that of gravitation. For waves τ ^hose length is less than λ the principal force concerned is khat of surface-tension. Sir William Thomson proposes to distinguish the latter kind of waves by the name of ripples.

When a small body is partly immersed in a liquid originally at rest, and moves horizontally with constant velocity V, waves are propagated through the liquid with various velocities according to their respective wave-lengths. In front of the body the relative velocity of the fluid and the body varies from V where the fluid is at rest, to zero at the cutwater on the front surface of the body. The waves produced by the body will travel forwards faster than the body till they reach a distance from it at which the relative velocity of the body and the fluid is equal to the velocity of propagation corresponding to the wavelength. The waves then travel along with the body at a constant distance in front of it. Hence at a certain distance in front of the body there is a series of waves which are stationary with respect to the body. Of these, the waves of minimum velocity form a stationary wave nearest to the front of the body. Between the body and this first wave the surface is comparatively smooth. Then comes the stationary wave of minimum velocity, which is the most marked of the series. In front of this is a double series of stationary waves, the gravitation waves forming a series increasing in wave length with their distance in front of the body, and the surface-tension waves or ripples diminishing in wave-length with their distance from the body, and both sets of waves rapidly diminishing in amplitude with their distance from the body.

If the current-function of the water referred to the body considered as origin is ψ, then the equation of the form of the crest of a wave of velocity w, the crest of which travels along with the body, is dψ = wds where ds is an element of the length of the crest. To integrate this equation for a solid of given form is probably difficult, but it is easy to see that at some distance on either side of the body, where the liquid is sensibly at rest, the crest of the wave will approximate to an asymptote inclined to the path of the body at an angle whose sine is , where w is the velocity of the wave and V is that of the body.

The crests of the different kinds of waves will therefore appear to diverge as they get further from the body, and the waves themselves will be less and less perceptible. But those whose wave-length is near to that of the wave of mininum velocity will diverge less than any of the others, so that the most marked feature at a distance from the body will be the two long lines of ripples of minimum velocity. If the angle between these is 2θ, the velocity of the body is w sec. θ, where w for water is about 23 centimetres per second.

Tables of Surface Tension.

In the following tables the units of length, mass, and time are the centimetre, the gramme, and the second, and the unit of force is that which if it acted on one gramme for one second would communicate to it a velocity of one centimetre per second :—

Quincke has determined the surface-tension of a great many substances near their point of fusion or solidification. His method was that of observing the form of a large drop standing on a plane surface. If K is the height of the flat surface of the drop, and k that of the point where its tangent plane is vertical, then

T=∣(K-⅛)¼ p .

[table]

Quincke finds that for several series of substances the surface-tension is nearly proportional to the density, so that if we 2T

call (K - k) 2 = — the specific cohesion, we may state the 9p general results of his experiments as follows :—

The bromides and iodides have a specific cohesion about half that of mercury. The nitrates, chlorides, sugars, and fats, as also the metals, lead, bismuth, and antimony, have [9:5:71] a specific cohesion nearly equal to that of mercury. Water, the carbonates and sulphates, and probably phosphates, and the metals, platinum, gold, silver, cadmium, tin, and copper have a specific cohesion double that of mercury. Zinc, iron, and palladium, three times that of mercury, and sodium, six times that of mercury.

Relation of Surface-tension to Temperature.

It appears from the experiments of Brunner and of Wolff on the ascent of water in tubes that at the tempera-true i o centigrade

T=75∙20 (1-0’001870 (Brunner);

= 76’08 (1-0∙002i-t-0 00000415i 2 ), for a tube ’02346 cm. diameter (Wolff);

= 77’34 (1 - 0’001810, for a tube O3098 cm. diameter (Wolff).

Sir W. Thomson has applied the principles of Thermodynamics to determine the thermal effects of increasing or diminishing the area of the free surface of a liquid, and has shown that in order to keep the temperature constant while the area of the surface increases by unity, an amount of heat must be supplied to the liquid which is dynamically equivalent to the product of the absolute temperature into the decrement of the surface-tension per degree of temperature. We may call this the latent heat of surface-extension.

It appears from the experiments of Brunner and Wolff that at ordinary temperatures the latent heat of extension of the surface of water is dynamically equivalent to about half the mechanical work done in producing the surfaceextension. (j. c. Μ.)
