CHAMPAGNE, Philippe de (1602-1674), a celebrated painter, was born at Brussels of a poor family. He was a pupil of Fouquier; and, going to Paris in 1621, was employed by Du Chesne to paint along with Nicholas Poussin in the palace of the Luxembourg. His best works are to be found at Vincennes, and in the church of the Carmelites at Paris, where is his celebrated Crucifix, a signal perspective success, on one of the vaultings. After the death of Du Chesne, Philippe became first painter to the queen of France, and ultimately rector of the Academy of Paris. As his age advanced and his health failed, he retired to Port Royal, where he had a daughter cloistered as a nun, of whom he painted a celebrated picture, highly remarkable for its solid unaffected truth. This, indeed, is the general character of his work,â€”grave reality, without special elevation or depth of character, or charm of warm or stately colour. He painted an immense number of paintings, dispersed over various parts of France, and now over the galleries of Europe. Philippe was a good man, indefatigable, earnest, and scrupulously religious. He died on the 12th August 1674.
