CHRESTIEN, Florent (1541-1596), a satirist and Latin poet, was the son of Guillaume Chrestien, an eminent French physician and writer on physiology, and was born at Orleans. A pupil of Henri Estienne, the famous Hellenist, and a zealous Calvinist, at an early age he was appointed tutor to Henry of Navarre, afterwards Henry IV., who made him his librarian. De Thou says of Chrestien that he was an excellent man, a man of such an enlightened and neble soul that he was incapable of writing aught from a base and servile complaisance, but that it was not safe to irritate his Calvinism, as if that were done he hit hard and straight, trusting to reconciliation afterwards. Florent Chrestien was the author of many good translations from the Greek into Latin verse,—amongst others, of versions of the Hero and Leander attributed to Musaeus, of several plays, and of many epigrams from the Anthology, all of which were enriched with excellent notes and commentaries. In his translations into French, among which are remarked those of Buchanan’s Jephtkxs and of Oppian De Venatione, he is not so happy, being rather to be praised for fidelity to his original than for excellence of style. He wrote in verse against Ronsard, and in prose against Pibrac, the apologist of the Saint-Bartholomew; but his principal claim to a place among memorable satirists is as one of the authors of the Satyre Menippee, the famous pasquinade in the interest of his old pupil, Henry ΓV., his share in which, however, cannot now be exactly determined.
