CIRILLO, Domenico (1734-1799), physician and patriot, was born at Grugno in the kingdom of Naples. Elected while yet a young man to the botanical chair left vacant by the death of Pedillo, Cirillo went some years, afterwards to England, where he was made member of the Royal Society, and to France, where he became the friend of Buffon, Diderot, D’Alembert, and others of like mark. On his return to Naples he was appointed successively to the chairs of practical and theoretical medicine. He wrote voluminously and well on scientific subjects; and he secured, an extensive medical practice. The entry into Naples of the French under Championnet, and the proclamation of the Parthenopeian Republic (1799), brought to a conclusion his life of laborious and thoughtful benevolence. Cirillo was chosen a representative of the people; he then became a member of the Legislative Commission, and was elected its president. On the abandonment by the French of the young republic (June 1799), cardinal-general Ruffoand tha army of Ferdinand of Bourbon returned to Naples, and the republicans withdrew, ill-armed and inadequately provisioned, to the forts. After a short siege, in which an English squadron under Captain Foote bore a prominent part, they surrendered, on honourable terms. Life and-liberty[9:5:793] were guaranteed them by the signatures of Buffo, of Foote, and of Micherouxa, the Russian minister. But the arrival of Nelson changed the complexion of affairs; he refused to ratify the capitulation. Secure under the British flag, too, Ferdinand and Caroline of Austria showed themselves eager for revenge. The patriots were arrested; and Cirillo, who had tended the queen more than once, and whose skill had been employed on behalf of the English admiral himself, was thrown into prison with the others. A court was formed to try the captives, and Cirillo was brought before them. Neither his age, nor his fair life and fame, nor his heroic speech and bearing, availed with them, and he was condemned to death. Nelson attempted to save him, and Ferdinand consented to forego his vengeance if the republican would ask for mercy. He refused, and was hanged. Cirillo, whose favourite study was botany, and who was recognized as an entomologist by Linnaeus, left many books, in Latin, and Italian, all of them treating of medical and scientific subjects, and all of little value now save as indications of the writer’s fine qualities as a man of science and humanitarian. Exception must, however, be made in favour of the Virtù Morali dell' Asino, a pleasant philosophical opuscule remarkable for its double charm of sense and style.
