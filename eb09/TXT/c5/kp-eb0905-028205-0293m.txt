+====================================================================+


CECIL, Robert, Earl of Salisbury (1550-1612), was the son of Lord Burghley, whose character and ability he inherited, and by whom he was carefully educated for political life. After residing at Cambridge and representing Westminster in parliament, he received a post in the French embassy, and was next made Secretary of State under Walsingham. He was also appointed Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, and Lord Privy Seal, and he succeeded his father as Master of the Court of Wards and Walsingham as chief Secretary of State. It is noteworthy that, though his health was delicate and his person deformed, he served as a volunteer against the Armada. His career was simply a continuation of his father’s. He toiled as laboriously and as carefully, and carried out the same system of espionage with equal success. The interest which he took in the domestic affairs of the country and in the state of [9:5:283] Ireland was as great; and the object of his foreign diplomacy was the same,—to prevent Spain from gaining a mastery which would be fatal to England. But he followed the wisdom of his father too well; his policy was wanting in originality and depth of insight; and he has left no mark upon history.

During the reign of the queen he had entered into correspondence with James, upon whose accession he was reappointed to the post of Secretary of State and was raised, in successive years, to the dignities of baron of Essenden, Viscount Cranborne, and earl of Salisbury. In 1608, on the death of the earl of Dorset, he added the office of Lord High Treasurer to that of Secretary. Thus he was now at once chief adviser of the king as to home and foreign affairs, mediator between him and the parliament, and also the responsible manager of the finances of the kingdom. In the last capacity his work was by no means easy. It was vain to hope to moderate the royal extravagance; his attempt to obtain from the Commons an increase of £200,000 to the royal income was unsuccessful; and the chief financial measure which he carried out was an addition to the duties on imports. As Secretary, Cecil followed his father’s example with regard to the Catholics, and wrote a Treatise against the Papists. His opposition to the growth of Spanish power was consistent, though he accepted a pension from the Spanish king, and refused to unite with France and the United Provinces to effect its utter overthrow.

Cecil has been much blamed for his conduct towards three of the greatest of his contemporaries. Of his cousin, Francis Bacon, he appears to have been jealous; in the noble qualities of the earl of Essex he saw nothing but a dangerous hotheadedness; and probably his opinion was similar about Raleigh, who, though more of a politician, was usually as little inclined to be cautious or conciliatory. But all this argues no extraordinary baseness; he was merely wanting, by nature and through education, in breadth of sympathy. The assertion that he was the sole cause of all Raleigh’s troubles is unfounded, and is, indeed, contradicted by two facts :—first, that on his trial Cecil more than once insisted that he should meet with all consideration, and should be allowed to urge all he could in his own defence; and, secondly, that it was after Cecil’s death that the bitterest feeling against him was displayed, and that he was offered as a sacrifice to Spain. Besides his Treatise against the Papists, Cecil published an interesting work on The State and Dignity of a Secretary of State. His correspondence with James I. was published by Lord Hailes in 1766.
