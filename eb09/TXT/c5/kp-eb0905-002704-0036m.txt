CANTAGALLO, a town of Brazil, in the province of Rio de Janeiro, about 80 miles N.E. of the city of that name, on a small tributary of the Parahyba, with a station on the railway from Rio de Janeiro to Campos. It was formerly the seat of important gold mines; but, since these were worked out, it has depended almost wholly on agriculture. Population about 4200.
