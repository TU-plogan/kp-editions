CIVITA CASTELLANA, a town of Italy, in the province of Rome, 17 miles E.S.E. of Viterbo, situated on a volcanic plateau surrounded on all sides but one by deep ravines which send down their streamlets to the Tiber. The road from Borghetto crosses the gorge by a magnificent bridge erected in 1712 by Cardinal Imperiali. The town is a bishop’s see, and has a cathedral dating from 1210, with beautiful mosaics and an interesting crypt adorned by an altar-piece of the 14th century. The citadel, which was founded by Alexander VI. and completed by Leo X., is used for the incarceration of state prisoners. In the neighbourhood are the remains of the ancient city of Falerium Vetus, well known in connection with the story of Camillus and the schoolmaster; portions of the ancient walls, gateways, and sepulchres are still to be seen at the edge of the ravine. About four miles to the west are the much more extensive ruins of Falerii Nom, now known as Sta Maria di Falleri. They present some of the most remarkable specimens of ancient military architecture now in existence, consisting of walls nearly perfect, a large number of square towers in good preservation, and several finely-arched gateways. In the internal area the most important buildings are a Roman theatre erected on Etruscan foundations, and a Lombard church of the 12th century (the Abbadia di Sta Maria). The population of Civita Castellana is about 4000.
