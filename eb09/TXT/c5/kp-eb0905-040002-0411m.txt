CHARENTE, an inland department in the south-west of France, comprehending the ancient division of Angoumois, and inconsiderable portions of Saintonge, Poitou, and Limousin. It is bounded N. by the departments of Deux-Sèvres and Haute-Vienne, E. by those of Vienne and Dordogne, and S. and W. by Dordogne and Charente-Inférieure. The greater part of its area of 2295 square miles consists of the valley of the River Charente, which rises in Haute-Vienne, and after a circuitous course passes into the department of Charente-Inférieure, where it falls into the sea opposite Isle-Madame, having received in its progress the waters of the Tardoire, Touvres, Né, Antoine, and Boutonne. The Charente, though rapid, has been artificially rendered navigable, and steamers ply between Angoulême and Saintes, although the tide ascends no higher than the latter town. The surface of the department is comparatively level, and subject to frequent inundations; and in the arrondissement of Conf olens alone there are upwards of sixty small lakes. The hills, which belong to the Limousin range, are generally uniform in height, and abound in marine deposits; some of them are covered with chestnut forests, which supply the district with a large amount of fruit. The climate is temperate, and the prevailing winds are the west and south-west. The principal productions are wine, corn, hemp, flax, and potatoes, the wine being largely distilled into brandy, for which the town of Cognac is famous. Pigs, sheep, and poultry are extensively reared for the consumption of the capital; and the value of the truffles annually brought to market is estimated at several million francs. The mineral productions consist chiefly of iron, lead, antimony, and gypsum, of which iron and gypsum only are worked to any extent. Among the manufactures paper occupies the foremost place; but canvas, linen cloth, hats, cordage, hoops, and pottery are also made. Charente is divided into five arrondissements, which derive their names from the five principal towns of Angoulême, Cognac, Ruffec, Barbézieux, and Confolens. Angoulême is the chief town. The population in 1872 amounted to 367,520.
