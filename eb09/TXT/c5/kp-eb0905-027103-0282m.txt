CAVEDONE, Jacopo (1577-1660), an Italian painter, born at Sassuolo in the Modenese, was educated in the school of the Caracci, and under them painted in the churches of Bologna. His principal works are the Adoration of the Magi, the Four Doctors, and the Last Supper; and more especially the Virgin and Child in Glory, with San Petronio and other saints, painted in 1614, and now in the Bolognese Academy. Cavedone became an assistant to Guido in Rome; his art was generally of a subdued undemonstrative character, with rich Titianesque colouring. In his declining years his energies broke down after the death of a cherished son; and he died in extreme poverty, in a stable in Bologna.
