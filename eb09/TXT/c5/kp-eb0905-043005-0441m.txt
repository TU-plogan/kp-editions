CHARONDAS, a celebrated lawgiver, who legislated not only for his native Catana, but likewise for various cities of Magna Graecia. By some he is said to have been a disciple of Pythagoras, who flourished 540-510 b.c. ; and according to the common account (as given by Diodorus, xπ.), he also drew up a code for the use of the Thurians; but this statement is scarcely admissible, since Thurii was not founded till the year 443, and it is known that the laws of Charondas were in use among the Rhegians till they were abolished by Anaxilaus, who reigned from 494-476 b.c. It is traditionally related that Charondas fell a sacrifice to one of his own laws, by which it was made a capital offence to appear armed in a public assembly. Hastening to quell a tumult on his return from a military expedition, his sword still hanging by his side, he was reminded by a citizen of his violation of the law, upon which Charondas exclaimed—“Then will I seal it with my blood !” and immediately plunged the weapon into his breast. Fragments of his laws are given in Heyne’s Opuscula, vol. ii.
