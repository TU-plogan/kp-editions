CATHERINE, Saint. The Roman hagiology contains the record of no less than six saints of this name, viz. :— 1. St Catherine, virgin and martyr, whose day of commemoration recurs on the 25th of November; 2. St Catherine of Sweden, who died abbess of Watzen, on the 24th March 1381, and is commemorated on the 21st of that month; 3. St Catherine of Siena, born in 1347, whose festal day is observed on the 30th of April; 4. St Catherine of Bologna, whose family name was Vigri, and who died abbess of the Convent of St Clairs in that city on the 9th March 1463; 5. St Catherine of Genoa, who belonged to the noble family of Fieschi, was born about 1448, spent her life and her means in succouring and attending on the sick, especially in the time of the plague which ravaged Genoa in 1497 and 1501, died in that city in 1510, was canonized by Clement XII. in 1737, and had her name placed in the calendar on the 22d of July by Benedict XIV.; and 6. St Catherine de’ Ricci, of Florence, born of that noble family in 1522, who became a nun in the convent of the Dominicans at Prato, died in 1589, and was canonized by Benedict XIV. in 1746, who fixed her festal day on the 13th February.

AU these women are recorded by the chroniclers of the Roman Church to have worked miracles. Indeed without this essential qualification they could not have been canonized. The lives of all, save that of Catherine of Genoa, whose career was a more active one, having been spent mainly in the hospitals of her native city, were passed in the practice of the ordinary monastic virtues. St Catherine de’ Ricci was subject to long trances and visions. And of St Catherine of Genoa it is recorded, that that miracle of levitation (or being raised from the ground), which is asserted with such curious frequency to have happened to various saints, frequently happened to her, when she was in the act of receiving the Holy Communion.

Of aU these saints, however, it wül only be necessary here to say a few words of the earliest of the name, who is the person intended when the Roman Church speaks of St Catherine without any additional designation, and then to give a somewhat more detailed account of the far most celebrated and historicaUy important of them aU, St Catherine of Siena.

History has exceedingly little to tell of this saint; history, more properly so called, indeed, has nothing at aU. She is said to have been of royal parentage, and her life is referred to the early part of the 4th century. She was martyred at Alexandria. She was especially celebrated for her learning and philosophical culture, and has always been considered the especial patron of philosophical schools. But in proportion to the scantiness of authenticated fact, legendary fable has been abundant in furnishing forth lives of the saint. And it is to one of these legends that the well-known presentiment of the saint, which alone is likely to cause modern readers to feel any interest in her name, is due. It is said that in revenge for the discomfiture of a company of heathen philosophers, with whom she had been compelled to dispute, the holy and learned lady was bound to a wheel armed with spikes, in such sort that every turn of the machine would cause the spikes to pierce her body. But the cords were miraculously broken, and the malice of her enemies foiled. Hence St Catherine, virgin and martyr, is always represented with a wheel, and the extreme popularity of this saint, and consequent commonness of the pictures of her, is indicated by the fact that a wheel of a certain construction and appearance is to the present day called a Catherine wheel. The lover of mediaeval painting may be warned against mistaking the pictures, which he so constantly meets with, of St Catherine with her wheel, for representations of St Catherine of Siena, or of any of the other saints Catherine, who all of them lived a thousand years or more later than the first and original saint of the name.

St Catherine of Siena, born in that city in tne year 1347, was a daughter of Giacomo Benincasa, said by the hagiographers to have been a descendant of the noble family of Borghese, also of Sienese origin,—a connection, however, which has been repudiated by the nobles of that subsequently Papal family. It seems certain, however, that the two families were sprung from the same stock. The researches of Signor Grottanelli, the present librarian of the municipal library at Siena, have enabled him to construct a pedigree of the saint, which may be considered as perfectly authentic, from which it appears that she was one of thirteen children; and that her father Giacomo, who died when she was one-and-twenty, in 1368, had been one of ten. Her mother Lapa, who was the grand-daughter of a “poeta volgare,”—that is to say, a poet who wrote in the then nascent Italian tongue,—lived to be eighty-nine.
[9:5:230]

To her and to one of her brothers, and to two of her nieces, sundry of the saint’s letters are addressed

As is usual in the Roman hagiography, the first and contemporary biographer of St Catherine, her confessor, the Dominican friar Raimondo (he was great-grandson of the celebrated Pietro delie Vigne, the chancellor of the Emperor Frederick II., and became the 24th general of the Dominican order), insists largely on the tendency towards sanctity which marked Catherine in her earliest years. The austerities and self-inflictions by which she prepared herself for her career, and gave proof of her vocation to those around her, began at an incredibly early age, and went on increasing in intensity till they pass from the probable to the highly improbable, and thence to the manifestly miraculous. At five years old it was her practice in going up stairs to kneel at each step to the Virgin. She habitually flogged herself and induced other children to do the same, at six years of age. At seven she deprived herself of a great portion of her food, secretly giving it to her brother, or throwing it to the cats. At the same age she would watch from the window to see when a Dominican monk passed, and as soon as he had moved on, would run down and kiss the spot of the pavement on which he had placed his feet. At twelve years old her mother begged her to comb her hair and wash her face offener. But this she steadily refused to do, till her mother requested a married sister to use her influence with Catherine, to which for a time she yielded to a certain degree. This yielding, however, she often in after-life, as her confessor testified, bewailed with bitter tears of penitence, always mentioning it, when she made, as she was in the habit of doing frequently, a general confession of her sins.

About the same period of Catherine’s life, her twelfth year, she wholly abandoned the use of animal food. At fifteen she left off wine. At twenty she gave up bread, living only on uncooked vegetables. She used to sleep but one quarter of an hour in the four and twenty. She always flogged herself till the blood streamed from her three times a day. She lived three years without speaking. She wore a chain of iron round her body, which gradually ate its way into her flesh. And, finally, she remained wholly without food for many years. Catherine began, we ate told, to have visions at six years old. Returning home one day, about that time, through the streets of Siena, she saw in the sky, immediately over the Dominican Church, a throne with Christ sitting on it, dressed in Papal robes, accompanied by St PauI, St Peter, and St John.

But these practices of her infancy, and these early visions were but preparatory to the wonders of a later period. Christ appeared to her daily as soon as she retired to her cell, as she informed Father Raimondo, for the purpose of teaching her the doctrines of religion, which, as she said to her confessor, “no man or woman ever taught me, but only Our Lord Jesus Christ himself, sometimes by means of inspiration, and sometimes by means of a clear bodily appearance, manifest to the bodily senses, and talking with me, as I now talk with you.” A detailed account of these manifestations will be found in the pages of Father Raimondo.

It is necessary to give some account of one miraculous occurrence, which was deemed the great and culminating glory of the saint, and has occupied the most prominent position in her estimation by the church, and in the imaginations of her admirers. This is the supernatural impression on her hands and feet of the scars of wounds corresponding with those made in the hands and feet of the Saviour by the nails which fixed Him to the cross. This is stated to have occurred at Pisa, and is asserted by Father Raimondo to have happened in his presence. Catherine had received the sacrament, and fell, as usual with her at such times, into a trance. Her confessor and some others were awaiting her recovery from it, when they saw her suddenly rise with a start to a kneeling posture, with her arms stretched out horizontally, and in a minute or two more fall prostrate. Soon afterwards she came out of her trance, and immediately calling aside her confessor said, “Be it known to you, my father, that I now bear on my body the marks of the crucifixion of our Lord Jesus Christ.” “And I,” continues Father Raimondo, “having told her that I had observed as much from the movements of her body, while she was in her trance, asked her in what manner the Lord had performed that miracle ì And she said, ‘ I saw the crucified Lord descending towards me with a great light, which caused me, from the impetus of my soul to meet its Creator, to raise up my body. Then I saw five bloody rays descending from the scars of his most holy wounds, and directing themselves to the hands and feet and heart of my body. Upon which, knowing what the mystery was, I exclaimed, 0, Lord, my God, let not, I pray you, the scars appear externally on my body, it is enough for me to have them internally. Then, while I was yet speaking, the rays, before they reached me, turned from blood-colour to a pure and splendid light, and touched the five parts of my body—that is my hands, my feet, and my heart.’ I asked her further, Do you now feel in those spots any sensible painî To which, with a deep sigh, she replied, ‘ So great is the pain I feel in all those five places, but especially in my heart, that it appears impossible to me to live many days, unless the Lord perform some further miracle.’”

In order to appreciate the importance and bearing of this celebrated miracle, the fierce and bitter rivalry which existed between the Dominicans and Franciscans must be borne in mind. St Francis had, some half century previously, received these five wounds in the same way. The marks are familiarly known among hagiographers and their readers as the Stigmata ; and the having received them was considered the crowning glory of St Francis, and was the exclusive boast of his Franciscans. But now the Dominicans were even with them. The Sienese Pope, who canonized his townswoman Catharine, Pius IL, gave his approbation to a service, in which this reception of the stigmata was prominently asserted. And so severely was the blow felt by the indignant Franciscans that they obtained from the next Pope but one, Sixtus IV., himself a Franciscan, a decree to the effect that St Francis had an exclusive right to and monopoly of that especial miracle, and that it was accordingly forbidden to represent St Catherine receiving the stigmata under pain of ecclesiastical censures. The tendency observable in many of the austerities and miracles said to have been suffered and done by St Catherine, to outdo the austerities and miracles of other saints, especially St Francis, is particularly remarkable in this of the stigmata. The degree in which it served the purpose of the Dominicans is the measure of the suspicion attaching to it. But there is nothing incredible in the supposition that Catherine may have imagined in her trance all that she had related; and still less is it unlikely that such diseased dreamings may have been the natural product of a waking fancy, filled with, and dwelling on, this much envied manifestation. Perhaps the condition, so providently introduced, as it would seem, that the scars were not to be visible, may be suggestive of a fraudulent intention. But on the other hand, it may be observed that if such a fraud had been planned, it would have been easy for one, who habitually subjected her body to so much suffering, to submit to the required wounds beforehand. It will, however, probably be felt by most readers of the above quoted narrative of Father Raimondo that it bears on the face of it many of the marks of untruth [9:5:231] fulness. The monk’s statement that he had. known what was taking place from the movements of her body would seem to be very suggestive of a foregone purpose and plan. On the other hand it may be argued that this is so obvious, that the monk would never have committed himself to such a statement had not it been the simple truth.

The celebrated and learned Tomasseo, whose literary reputation probably stands higher with his countrymen than that of any other living writer, and who is the latest writer on St Catherine, accepting her works and character in the spirit of an enthusiastic devotee, writes in the essay on St Catherine, which he has prefixed to the latest edition of her works (4* vols., Florence, 1860), as follows: “If by the mere play of the imagination a person, who has had a limb cut off, feels, nevertheless, pain in the part which has been removed; if the force of thought often creates bodily ills and cures them, it would be in contradiction to all philosophy and all the laws of criticism to deny that a woman rendered by love profoundly apprehensive of the sufferings of another, may feel pain in her own person, in that same spot of the body where the loved person feels or felt it. It would be to deny to Catherine that privilege of sympathizing piety and tender humanity, which we grant to the French mother, who exclaims, Pai mal à la poitrine de ma fille 1 And for Catherine Jesus was alive, was present in her heart, in her eyes. All her being, as all the world, was full of him.” The recognized phenomenon, however, to which the eloquent philologist refers is a purely physiological one; and it is for physiologists to determine what amount of analogy may be discoverable between that known fact and the sensation of bodily pain from which Catherine declared herself to be suffering, when she had recovered from her trance ;— or rather that respecting which Catherine is said to have made such a declaration by the Dominican her confessor and biographer. For in weighing the extremely curious question of the amount of conscious imposture which may probably be supposed to have been mingled with other elements in the extraordinary narrative, it is very necessary to remember that we have the testimony and statements of Catherine only through the medium of the general of the order, to the fame and glory of which Catherine’s saintly fame and glory was so all-important.

It is important to observe in this connection that various statements of her confessor will leave little doubt On the minds of t 1 mse who have made that form of malady called catalepsy their study, or even of those who have witnessed the phenomena attending it, that Catherine was subject to constantly-recurring attacks of catalepsy. And physicians will probably deem the hint above thrown out, to the effect that the saint was in the habit of throwing herself into this state “as much as she could,” not unimportant. It is unnecessary in this place to do more than call attention by a passing word to the very remarkable similarity between some of the phenomena described by Father Raimondo and those attending many very well-known cases of animal magnetism.

But if doubts and difficulties crowd thickly about the whole of that portion of Saint Catherine’s story which has obtained for her the pre-eminence of saintship, it may be said that the public events of her life, which make part of the undoubted history of her time, are hardly less extraordinary and surprising. In the year 1376, the 29th of Catherine’s life, Gregory XI. was living and holding the Papal court at Avignon. He was the last of seven French Popes in succession who had done so, and had perpetuated for seventy-three years what ecclesiastical writers are fond of terming “the Babylonian captivity of the church.” To put an end to this absenteeism, and to bring back the Papacy to Italy was the cherished and anxious wish of all good Italians, and especially of all Italian churchmen. Petrarch had urgently pressed Urban V., Gregory’s immediate predecessor, to accomplish the desired change; and Dante had at an earlier date laboured to bring about the same object. But both had failed in front of the great difficulties which attended the step. The French cardinals, who surrounded the Pope, were anxious, of course, to detain him in France. The king of France threw all his influence into the same scale. The French Pope’s own prejudices and wishes were, of course, enlisted on the same side. Rome itself and the dominions of the church, which the violences and usurpations of the Roman barons kept in a chronic state of rebellion, made the Eternal City anything but an inviting residence. There was also considerable truth in the representations insisted on by several of the French Popes, that the rising importance of the northern churches bad in a great degree changed the central point of the ecclesiastical world, and that the church could more advantageously be governed from a French than from an Italian city. Thus all the influences which Italy had for many years past striven to bring to bear upon the popes, to induce them to return to their own city had failed. And it was under these circumstances that Catherine, the illiterate daughter of an obscure Sienese dyer, determined to try her powers of persuasion and argument for the accomplishment of that which the princes of the church and the greatest men of Italy bad in vain attempted. For this purpose Catherine proceeded to Avignon in the summer of 1376. And in the September of that year the Pope set out on his return to Rome. It is true that he did this, intending after a sojourn in the Eternal City to return to France, and he would almost certainly have done so, had he not been prevented by death. But the dyer’s daughter did, as things fell out, succeed in her enterprise, and moved the centre of Europe back again once more to its old place in Rome! Of course it may be said that to attribute the Pope’s return to Rome to Catherine’s intervention is a notable instance of a post hoc ergo propter hoc inference. But many proofs might be given from various writers to show that it was unquestionably believed in her own day that Catherine had been the real moving cause of the restoration of the Papacy to Rome. (See especially Ammirato, Istorie Florentine, vol. v. p. 130, ed. Flor., 1824.) After many other journeyings she arrived in Rome on the 28th of November 1378, in obedience to the commands of the Pope; and there she died on the 29th of April 1380, at the age of thirty-three. Father Raimondo was then at Genoa, and declares that in that city, at the hour of her death, he heard a voice communicating to him a last message from Catherine, which he afterwards found she had uttered on her deathbed word for word as he heard it, “and of this,” he adds solemnly, “let that Eternal Truth, which can neither deceive nor be deceived, be witness.”

Catherine’s works consist of a treatise occupying a closely-printed quarto volume, which Father Raimondo describes as “a dialogue between a soul, which asked four questions of the Lord, and the same Lord, who made answer and gave instruction in many most useful truths,”—of her letters, 373 in number, and of 26 prayers. The dialogue is entitled, The Book of Divine Doctrine, given in person by God the Father, speaking to the mind of the most glorious and holy virgin Catherine of Siena, and written down as she dictated it in the vulgar tongue, she being the while entranced, and actually hearing what God spoke in her. The work is declared to have been dictated by the saint in her father’s house in Siena, a little before she went to Rome, and to have been completed on the 13th of October 1378. This dialogue has been divided into five parts, though no such division existed in it as it fell from her lips. The first four parts exist in manuscript, as taken down from the lips of the entranced saint; but the fifth treatise is not extant in the original, but only in the Latin version of Father Raimondo, from which the published Italian version has been re-translated. The French oratorian, Father Casimir Oudin, in his supplement of [9:5:232] ecclesiastical writers, omitted by Bellarιnine, says very quietly, “She wrote, or Raimondo de Vincis wrote in her name, a work inscribed,” &c., &c. And it is very possible that the suspicion indicated may be a just one; but there is nothing in the matter of the work itself to belie the origin attributed to it. It may be remarked, however, that the context, as it stands, does not even pretend to give the unbroken utterances of the saint. It is intermingled, without any advertisement to the reader, typographical or other, that he is about to enter on matter of a different authorship, with long passages descriptive of the saint’s mode of receiving the revelation, written in the person of the secretary. But the saint’s own utterances are exactly such as might have been expected from such a patient. They resemble the worst and emptiest style of the pulpit eloquence of her time and country, and consist entirely of mere verbose and repetitive inanities and platitudes. It is impossible to read them without being strongly reminded of the productions, which have been given forth in these latter days as spiritual communications made to persons in trance or otherwise constituting themselves “mediums,”—a similarity which suggests sundry curious considerations. The most probable supposition seems to be that these “dialogues” were composed by Father Raimondo, from notes taken down from Catherine’s trance ramblings. The 26 prayers might have been expected to throw more light on the character and mental calibre of the saint, whose communings with the Infinite they represent. But nothing of the kind is to be gathered from them. The impression they are calculated to produce is either that the saint λvas a self-conscious actor and pretender, or that they are not her compositions,—the latter perhaps being the more probable hypothesis. Though addressed in form to the Deity, there is little in these effusions that can with accuracy be called prayer. The speaker, or rather writer, seems continually to forget his avowed object, and runs off into long statements of the nature and attributes of the Deity, and ecclesiastical positions based thereon, evidently prompted rather by didactic views as to mortal hearers, than by effort to hold communion with the Almighty. It is all dry, cold, repetitive, verbose theology, instead of the warm utterances of either a contrite or a thankful heart. It remains to say a few words of the saint’s letters, by far the most interesting and valuable of her reputed works. They are 373 in number, and form two stout quarto volumes of the Lucca edition. In the four octavo volumes of the recent cheap Milan reprint, only the first 198 are given, though no word appears to indicate that the collection is imperfect. On the contrary, the fourth volume is entitled “4th and last.” Still more recently the letters have been reprinted by Barbèra at Florence, 1860, in 4 vols, small octavo, with a preliminary notice of the saint prefixed by the celebrated Niccolò Tommaseo, consisting of 210 pages. The 373 letters of the entire collection have among them many addressed to kings, popes, cardinals, bishops, conventual bodies, and political corporations, as well as a great number written to private individuals. And it seems very strange that among so many correspondents of classes whose papers are likely to be preserved, and. many of whom, especially the monastic communities, would assuredly have attached a high value to such documents, no one original of any of these documents should have been preserved. Girolamo Gigli, the editor of the quarto edition of the saint’s works, printed at Lucca and Siena, 1707-13, an enthusiastic investigator and collector of every description of information regarding her, gives, in his preface to the letters, a careful account of the manuscript collections from which they have at different times been printed, but has not a word to say of any scrap of original document. The epistles were first printed by Aldus in 1500, just 120 years after Catherine’s death. The difficulties connected with the subject of the true authorship of these letters are much complicated by questions respecting Catherine’s capability of writing, and her own statements of the miraculous manner in which she acquired that accomplishment. The discussion of these difficulties would require a larger space than can here be allotted to the subject. And the reader curious on the subject may be referred to a life of the saint by Mr Trollope, from which much of the present notice has been taken. It is admitted on all hands, however, that a large portion of the letters were written by the hands of secretaries. The very high reputation, and that not wholly of a pietistic or ecclesiastical nature, which this large mass of writings has enjoyed for several centuries will probably appear to most English readers an extremely singular fact. A great deal of the praise bestowed on St Catherine’s writings by Italian critics has reference to their style and diction. Written at a time when the language, fresh from the hands of Dante, of Petrarch, and of Boccaccio, was still in its infancy, and in a city at all times celebrated for the purity of its vernacular, they have by the common consent of Italian scholars taken rank as one of the acknowledged classics of the language,—as a testa di lingua, as the Tuscan purists say. The Della Cruscans have placed them on the jealously-watched list of their authorities, and an enthusiastic Sienese compatriot, the before-mentioned Girolamo Gigli, has completed a vocabulario Caterini-ano, after the fashion of those consecrated to the study of the works of Homer and Cicero. Of course no one from the “barbarous” side of the Alps can permit himself any word of observation on this point, especially when the judgment is in the main confirmed by the authority of the greatest of living Italian critics, Niccolò Tommaseo. Had no such decisive opinion been extant to guide his ignorance, it might perhaps have seemed to a foreigner that the saint’s style was loose in its syntax, intricate in its construction, and terribly overloaded with the merest verbosity. But the philological excellencies of her writings are, after all, the least part of the praise that has been lavished on Catherine as an author. Her admirers enlarge on the moving eloquence, the exalted piety, the noble sentiments, the sound argumentation of her compositions, especially the letters.

So large a number of devout writers have occupied their pens on “legends” and biographies of Saint Catherine that it would be far too lengthy a task to attempt to give even a list of them. The public library of Siena contains no less than 79 works of which the popular saint of the city is the subject. Almost all of them, however, seem to be based more or less directly and avowedly on the work of Father Raimondo. And enough has been said to give the reader a sufficient idea of the nature of that book. Of Girolamo Gigli’s V^ocabulario Caieriniano mention has also been made. Of course it will readily be understood that this work regards the saint’s writings in a purely philological point of view. But the curious fate which attended this work may be noticed. It wαβ burned by the hangman at Florence, not because it was supposed to contain any heterodoxy in matter of religion, but merely because the Della Crusca, which is occasionally somewhat slily satirized in it, was enraged at the position taken up by the author, to the effect that the Sienese is a purer dialect of I talian than the Florentine I The notice of Saint Catherine by Niccolò T<>mmaseo, prefixed to the most recent edition of St Catherine’s works, has also been mentioned. It cannot be called “a life” in any sense. For the author makes no attempt to relate the story of her career, or to examine the evidence for any of the anecdotes which he does relate. It is written in a strain of enthusiastic pietistic admiration, which is certainly curious in the case of a highly-cultured 19th century layman; and its principal value consists in the judgment on the purely literary merits of the writer, by one who must be admitted to be the greatest living critic of Italy.
