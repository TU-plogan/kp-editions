CHATSWORTH, the seat of the duke of Devonshire, one of the most splendid private residences in England, is situated in Derbyshire, on the River Derwent, 3½ miles north-east of the village of Bakewell, and 8 miles west of the town of Chesterfield. It stands on the left bank of the river, opposite the hamlet of Edensor, and as seen from the west presents a magnificent façade in fine relief against the wooded ridge of Bunker’s Hill. The building is in the Ionic style, and the principal part is composed of four nearly equal sides, surrounding an open quadrangular court with a fountain in the centre. A wing and other somewhat extensive additions have been made since 1820. Chatsworth contains some beautiful wood carvings by Gibbons and Watson, several pieces of sculpture by Canova, Thorwaldsen, Chantrey, and Wyatt, and a unique collection of original drawings by Titian, Rubens, Salvator Rosa, Raphael, Claude Lorraine, and others of the older masters. The park is upwards of 11 miles in circuit; the gardens are among the most celebrated in the kingdom, and cover an area of twelve acres. The grand conservatory, an acre in extent, erected by Sir Joseph Paxton, is unequalled by any in Europe; and the waterworks, which include one fountain with a jet 260 feet high, are only surpassed by those of Versailles. The domain of Chatsworth is mentioned in Domesday Book as Chetesvorde. In the 16th century it was purchased by Sir William Cavendish. The mansion which he erected afterwards served as a place of confinement for Mary Queen of Scots from 1570 to 1581. It has entirely disappeared; and the present building was commenced in 1688 by the first duke of Devonshire and was completed in 1840 by the seventh.
