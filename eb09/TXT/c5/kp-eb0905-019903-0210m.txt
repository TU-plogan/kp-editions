CASTLETOWN (in Manx, Bully Cashtel), the capital of the Isle of Man, and seat of the Manx Government, stands on the western side of Castletown Bay, 11 miles south-west of Douglas, on both banks of the Silverburn. It is neat and regularly built, and has a large square containing some handsome houses. In the centre of the town stands Castle Rushin, which owes its foundation to the Danish chief, Guthred, in 960, and after serving for generations as the residence of the kings of Man, is now partly used as a prison and barracks. In its vicinity is the House of Keys, where the members of the Manx Parliament hold their sessions. The chief educational establishment is King Williamâ€™s College, situated about a mile and a half to the north of the town. It was originally erected about 1830-3; but a complete restoration was rendered necessary by fire in 1844, and it has since been enlarged, in 1862. Castletown also possesses a new townhouse, a market-house dating from 1830, and several other public buildings; there are breweries, limekilns, and corn mills in the town and neighbourhood; and a small shipping-trade is maintained. Population in 1871, 2320.
