It is situated in a beautiful narrow valley between steep granite mountains, and consists chiefly of lodging-houses and hotels for the accommodation of visitors, but has also some good shops and private houses, a theatre, hospitals, as well as schools, reading-rooms, &c. It is the seat of the district judge, custom-house, and excise. Carlsbad is the most aristocratic watering-place in Europe. It is most frequented from the middle of June to the middle of August, and the number of visitors averaging from 12,000 to 20,000. The permanent population is nearly 9000 (1873). The warm springs differ but little from each other in their component parts, the principal ingredients being sulphate of soda, carbonate of soda, and common salt. Of the ten springs the Sprudel, Hygiea, Bernhardt, Neubrunnen, and Schloss-brunnen are the principal, having temperatures ranging from 165째 to 122째 Fahr. They are said to have been discovered in 1370, during a hunting excursion, by the Emperor Charles IV., to whom a statue has been erected in the market-place. The resident inhabitants make many curious articles in iron, steel, tin, aud wood, .for which they find a ready market during the season.
