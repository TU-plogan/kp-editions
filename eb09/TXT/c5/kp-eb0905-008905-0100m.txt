CARCASSONNE, the chief town of the department of Aude, in France, is situated on both sides of the River Aude, and in the immediate neighbourhood of the Canal du Sud, about 55 miles S.E. of Toulouse, on the railway between that city and Narbonne, in 43’ 12' 54" N. lat. and 2° 20' 55 E. long. On an abrupt elevation on the right bank of the river stands the old city, enclosed by a double line of ramparts and towers, and retaining the aspect of a mediaeval fortress. A portion of the inner line is attributed to the Visigoths; the rest, including the castle, seems to belong to the 11th or 12th century, while the outer circuit has been referred mainly to the end of the 13th. The old cathedral of St Nazaire, which partly dates from the 11th century, and contains magnificent stained-glass windows of the Renaissance period, has been restored under the superintendence of Μ. Viollet-le-Duc. On the left bank of the river, but connected with the city by a bridge of twelve arches, lies the new town, clean, well-built, and flourishing, with streets intersecting each other at right angles. It is surrounded by boulevards occupying the site of its ramparts, and has a large esplanade [9:5:90] for military manoeuvres, as well as numerous fountains and planted walks. As chief town of a department, and the seat of a bishop, Carcassonne contains court-houses and various public offices, an episcopal palace, and a theological seminary; and among its other public buildings and insti tutions may be mentioned the new cathedral of St Michael, the town-hall, the library with upwards of 15,000 volumes, the exchange, the theatre, the barracks, the hospitals, the college, the school of design, the museum, the chamber of commerce, and the agricultural society. Of the various industrial establishments the most important are the woollen factories,—not less than 2000 people being engaged in the manufacture of cloth, which is chiefly exported to the Levant, Barbary, and South America. Wadding, paper, leather, pottery, and iron wares are also produced; and there is a trade in wine, brandy, and fruit. A large fair is held in November and another on Whit-Tuesday. Population in 1872, 20,808 in the town, and 23,644 in the commune.

Carcassonne occupies the site of Carcaso, an ancient city of Gallia Narbonensis, which belonged to the Volcae Tectosages. It was a place of some importance at the time of Caesar’s invasion, but makes almost no appearance in Roman history. On the disintegration of the empire, it fell into the hands of the Visigoths, who, in spite of the attacks of the Franks, especially in 585, retained possession till 724, λvhen they were expelled by the Saracens, destined in turn to yield before long to Charles Martel. From the 9th to the beginning of the 13th century Carcassonne formed a separate countship, which was brought to ruin by the attachment of Count Raymond Roger to the cause of the Albigenses. The city, in spite of a noble defence, was taken by the Crusaders of Simon de Montfort in 1209, and the unfortunate count perished in captivity. In 1224, his son, Raymond Trencavel Il., recovered his estates, but in 1247 he was forced to yield all his rights to Philip Augustus. A revolt of the city against the royal authority was severely punished in 1262, by the expulsion of its principal inhabitants, who were, however, peπnitted to take up their quarters on the other side of the river. This was the origin of the new town, which was fortified in 1347. During the religious wars Carcassonne several times changed lιands, and it did not recognise Henry IV. till 1596.
