CASTELLON DE LA PLANA, a town of Valencia, in Spain, the capital of a modern province, is situated about 4 miles from the sea, and 40 miles N.N.E. of Valencia, in 39° 57' N. lat. and 0° 4' W. long. It derives its name from the extensive plain in which it is situated, and which is watered artificially by an aqueduct brought for the most part through solid rock from the Mijares, a stream about [9:5:194] five miles distant. It is walled, and contains two nunneries, three monasteries, and two hospitals, as well as several churches, in which there are paintings by Ribalta, a native artist. There is a brisk local trade maintained in the weaving of sail-cloth and linen. In the time of the Moors the city was situated on a height to the north of the present position, to which it was removed by Jayme I. in 1233. Population, 20,123.
