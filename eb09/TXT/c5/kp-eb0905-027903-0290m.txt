CAXTON, William (1422-c. 1491), the introducer of printing into England, was born, as he tells us himself, in “Kent in the Weide.” The date of his birth is uncertain; Oldys places it in 1412, while his most recent biographer, Mr Blades, shows that it could not have been much later than 1423. The latter, however, fixes upon 1422-3 as the approximate date; and this appears to be as near correctness as we are likely to attain. 1412 seems too early; for, by the records of the Mercers’ Company we find that in 1438 William Caxton was apprenticed to Robert Large; and it is far more likely that he was apprenticed at sixteen than at twenty-six. Robert Large was a man of great wealth and of high position; in 1430 he was sheriff, and in 1439 he celebrated his election to the office of Lord Mayor with extraordinary splendour; and the fact that Caxton was apprenticed to a merchant of such distinction makes it nearly certain that he belonged to a family of considerable influence. In 1449 his master died; and it became the duty of his executors to place Caxton where he could fulfil the term of his apprenticeship. They sent him to Bruges; at least, we know that he was there soon after. In this town he entered into business on his own account, and prospered so well that before 1450 he was considered substantial security for £110, which would be equivalent to £1000 at the present time; and eight years later he had become governor of the Company of Merchant Adventurers. Caxton appears to have been a man of considerable polish, and to have had a high reputation for sagacity; for in 1465, the treaty with the duke of Burgundy concerning the wool trade being about to expire, he was appointed by the king, along with Sir Richard Whitehill, to negotiate its renewal; and this attempt having failed, he was again sent on a similar mission three years later by the Mercers’ Company, after the marriage of the duke to the sister of King Edward IV. In the next year, which is worthy of note as that in which he commenced his Recuyell des Histoires de Troye, he was considered worthy to share in the gift of the “vin d’honneur,” which was presented by the authorities of Bruges only to the most important men in the city. In the autumn of 1470 Caxton obtained, and availed himself of, an excellent opportunity for acquiring favour and influence in the English court; for Edward IV. had, with his supporters, been driven into exile, and had taken refuge in Bruges, at the court of his brother-in-law, the duke of Burgundy.

In 1471 Caxton, perhaps because he was beginning to find the duties of the office which he held too severe for his declining strength, or it may be because the interruption in the wool trade to which we have referred had diminished his fortune, entered the service of the duchess of Burgundy, from whom he received a yearly pension. At her command he continued the Recuyell, which was finished in September of that year.

About this time Caxton learned the art of printing. Wynkyn de Worde, his disciple, says that he was taught at Cologne by Ulric Zell; but Worde is often inaccurate, and he seems rather to have had Colard Mansion as his master. That printer was at Bruges; what need then for Caxton to go to Cologne î Besides Caxton’s types are more like Mansion’s than Zell’s; and, indeed, it was long before he adopted the improvements which the latter introduced.

At what date Caxton brought his press to England and set it up at Westminster is quite uncertain. It was probably between 1471 and 1477. 1474 is the date of the Game and Playe of Chesse ; but the tradition that this work was printed in England may not be correct. He received valuable patronage, being employed by Edward ΓV., Richard III., and Henry VII., by the duchess of Somerset, the earl of Arundel, Sir John Fastolf, and other nobles; and he appears to have been busy writing and printing up to his death, which occurred about 1492.

Of Caxton’s private life and character we know very [9:5:280] little. Hia temper seema to have been strongly conservative; he delighted in the glories of chivalry, and declared that he would rejoice in a new crusade which should prevent its decay. This disposition was also displayed in his great slowness to adopt reforms in typography. He appears to have been a shrewd and courtly man of business, and a scholar of considerable attainments, for he was acquainted with French, Latin, and Dutch, and was master of an English style which is both pleasant and vigorous.

For an account of his typography, see Printing. His life has been written by Oldys in the Biographia Britannica, by Lewis (1738), by Charles Knight, and by Mr Blades.
