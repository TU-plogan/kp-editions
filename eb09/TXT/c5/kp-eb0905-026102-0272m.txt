CAVALLO, Tiberius (1749-1809), an electrician and natural philosopher, son of a physician established at Naples, was born in that city, March 30, 1749. His father died when he was only eleven years old, but he received a liberal education through the kindness of his friends, and completed his studies at the university of Naples. He was originally destined for commerce, and came to England in 1771, in order to obtain more complete information respecting the various objects of mercantile pursuit. But he soon abandoned his intention of adopting that mode of life, and determined to devote his time to science. His mind, however, was rather imitative than original; and he is said to have found it easier to learn Euclid by heart than in the ordinary way, which indeed he found impossible. He became a member of the Royal Academy of Sciences of Naples, and a fellow of the Royal Society of London. He died at London in 1809. The splendid improvements which had been lately made in electricity directed his attention to that department of natural philosophy; and his chief works areâ€” A Complete Treatise of Electricity (1777), Essay on Medical Electricity (1780), and The Elements of Natural and Experimental Philosophy (1803).
