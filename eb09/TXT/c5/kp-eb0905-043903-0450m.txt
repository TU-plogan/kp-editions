CHATHAM, a town of England, in the county of Kent, on the south side of the Medway about 15 miles from its junction with the estuary of the Thames, and 27 miles east of London. Though still nominally distinct, it is practically united with Rochester on the west, and is in close proximity to Brompton and Gillingham on the east. In Chatham proper the streets are for the most part narrow, and with the exception of the docks and fortifications, there are but few objects of interest. St Mary’s church is a brick building erected about 1788, but occupying the site of an earlier structure of the 14 th century; it contains a monumental brass to the memory of Stephen Borough, the discoverer of the northern passage to Russia. There are a few remains of the hospital for lepers founded by Bishop Gundulf in 1078; but the funds for its maintenance were appropriated by decision of the court of chancery to the new hospital of St Bartholomew erected in 1863 within the boundaries of Rochester. The almshouse, established in 1592 by Sir John Hawkins for poor decayed seamen and shipwrights, is still in existence, the building having been re-erected in the present century; but the fund called the Chatham Chest, originated by Hawkins and Drake in 1588, was incorporated with Greenwich Hospital in 1802. The town possesses numerous churches and chapels of various denominations, a ragged school, a nautical school, a mechanics’ institute, and a lecture hall The Medway union workhouse is situated a short distance to the south-east. The water supply is obtained from springs at the village of Lupton, about half a mile further off in the same direction; and extensive reservoirs were constructed in 1862 at Star Hill in the neighbourhood of the village. Numerous brickyards, lime-kilns, and flour-mills are in the surrounding district, and the town carries on a large retail trade, partly from the presence of the garrison.

The fortifications are among the most elaborate in the kingdom. The so-called Chatham Lines ought rather to bear the name of the village of Brompton which they enclose. They were commenced in 1758 and completed in 1807; but various alterations and additions have since been effected. They are strengthened by several detached forts and redoubts, and consist of a very intricate system of trenches, batteries, and subterranean passages. Fort Pitt, which rises above the town to the west, was built in 1779, and is now used as a general military hospital; it was regarded as the principal establishment of the kind in the country till the foundation of Netley in Hampshire.

The lines include the Chatham, the Royal Marine, the Brompton, the Hut, and St Mary’s barracks; the garrison hospital and Melville hospital; the arsenal with its large park of artillery; the gymnasium, established in 1864: for gymnastic exercise; the military school for the practical instruction of sappers and engineers, opened in 1812; a military institute for the men in garrison; the convict prison; and, finally, the extensive system of dockyards which has made the town so famous.

Numerous Roman remains, both architectural and domestic, have been discovered at Chatham and Brompton; but they appear to have belonged to the Roman city of Rochester. Till the reign of Elizabeth the place was a mere insignificant village; but before 1588 the queen established the first dockyard on the site of what is now called the Ordnance Wharf, and erected Castle Upnor on the opposite bank of the river for its defence. The situation was changed in the following reign, and under the Charleses extensive additions were made. The history of the town since the attack of the Dutch in 1667 has been mainly the history of the naval and military establishments. The parliamentary borough, which returns one member, includes the towns of Chatham and Brompton, and the villages of Gillingham, Chatham Hill, and NewBrompton, and covers an area of 2707 acres. The population of the borough in 1871 numbered 45,792 persons, of whom 24,873 were males and 20,919 females.
