CARBONDALE, a city of the United States, in the county of Luzerne in Pennsylvania, near the source of the Lackawanna River, on the Delaware and Hudson Railway, about 110 miles N.N.W. of Philadelphia. Its incorporation only dates from 18Î´l, and (as its name implies) its principal importance consists in the fact that it is the centre of an extensive coal-field. About 900,000 tons are obtained annually from the neighbouring mines. Population in 1850, 4945; in 1870, 6393.
