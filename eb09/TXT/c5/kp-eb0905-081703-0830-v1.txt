CLAVIJO, Ruy Gonzalez de, a Spanish traveller cf the 15 th century, whose narrative is the first important one of its kind contributed to Spanish literature. He was a native of Madrid, and belonged to a family of some antiquity and position. On the return of the ambassadors Solomayor and Palazuelos from the East, Henry HI. determined to send another embassy to the court of Timur, who had just risen to power, and for this purpose he selected Clavijo, Gomez de Salazar, and a master of theology named Fray Alonzo Paez de Santa Maria. They sailed from Seville in May 1403, touched at the Balearic Isles, Gaeta, and Rhodes, spent some time at Constantinople, sailed along the southern coast of the Black Sea to Trebizond, andproceededinland, probably by Etchimazin, Tabreez, Tehran, and Meshud, to Samarcand, where they were well received by the conqueror. Their return was safely accomplished, and they landed in Spain in 1406. Clavijo proceeded at once to the court, at that time in Alcala de Henares, and served as chamberlain till the king’s death in the following year; he then returned to Madrid, and lived there in opulence till his own death in April 1412. He was buried in the chapel of the monastery of San Francisco, which he had rebuilt at great expense. His itinerary was first published in 1582 at Seville, by Argote de Molina, with the title of Historia del gran Tamorlan e itinerario y enarracion del viage y relacion de la embaxada que Ruy Gonzalez de Clavijo le hizo,— the editor appending “a short discourse,” for the better intelligence of his author. Another edition was brought out at Madrid in 1782, by Antonio de Sancha; and from this an English translation was prepared by Clements Markham, and published by the Hakluyt Society in 1860. The identification of a great number of the places mentioned by Clavijo is a matter of considerable difficulty, and has given rise to some discussion (see Khanikof’s list in Geographical Magazine, 1874). A short account of his life is given by Alvarez y Baena in the Hijos de Madrid, vol. ix.
