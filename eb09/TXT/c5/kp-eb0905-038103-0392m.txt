CHAMBORD, a magnificent Gothic chateau of France, in the department of Loire-et-Cher, 10 miles east of Blois, on the left bank of the Cosson. It was commenced by Francis I. in 1532, carried on by Henry II., and at length finished by Louis XIV. It is built of black stone, with a profusion of towers, turrets, and minarets, and the interior is fitted up with great magnificence. The park is enclosed by walls seven leagues in circumference. The castle is famous as the residence of Diana of Poitiers, and of Stanislaus, king of Poland, whose son-in-law, Louis XV., bestowed it upon Marshal Saxe. It was given by Napoleon to Marshal Berthier, from whose widow it was purchased by subscription in 1821, and presented to the duke of Bordeaux, the representative of the older branch of the Bourbons, who has assumed from it the title of Count de Chambord.
