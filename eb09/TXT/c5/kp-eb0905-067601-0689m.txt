CHIUSA, or La Chiusa, a town of Italy on the Pesio, in the province of Cuneo, and about ten miles south-east of the city of that name. It has a population of upwards of 6000, chiefly engaged in the manufacture of silk and glass. It is not to be confounded with a hamlet in the province of Turin, which was named Chiusa (enclosure) from its position near the fortified line erected by Desiderius of Lombardy, in 774, to check the advance of Charlemagne.
