CLAUDIUS, Matthias (1743-1815), a German poet, otherwise known by the nom de plume of Asmus, was born in 1743 at Rheinfeld, near Lubeck, and studied at Jena. With the exception of a short time in 1776 and 1777, when he held the office of superior commissioner or Ober-landcommissar at Darmstadt, he spent his life in the little town of Wandsbeck, near Hamburg, for which he had conceived so strong an attachment that he would not accept any appointment which required him to settle elsewhere. Here he earned his first literary reputation by the publication, from 1770 to 1775, of a weekly periodical called the Wandsbecker Bote or Wandsbeck Messenger, in which he gave to the world a large number of prose essays and poems of various kinds. They were written in very pure and simple German, and appealed to the popular taste; in many there was a vein of extravagant humour or even burlesque, while others were full of quiet meditation and solemn sentiment. In his later days, perhaps through the influence of Klopstock, with whom he had formed an intimate acquaint· ance, Claudius became strongly pietistic, and the graver side of his nature was alone permitted to display itself. Instead of firing the German heart with a Bheinweinlied, or shaking the German sides with a Wenn Jemand eine Reise thut, he translated the works of Saint Martin and Fénelon. At the same time, he thought it no harm to publish a complete collection of his writings, under the whimsical title of Asmus omnia sua secum portans, oder Sämmtlaehe Werke des Wandsbecker Bothen, 8 vols. 1774-1812. His biography has been written by Herbst (Gotha, 1857); and Kahle has given us Claudius und Hebel (Berlin, 1864).
