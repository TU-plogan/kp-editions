CASSIUS LONGINUS, Caius, is best known in history as one of the leaders in the assassination of Julius Caesar. Little is known of his early life. In 53 b.c. he served in the Parthian campaign under Crassus, and displayed great courage and skill. He succeeded in bringing oftâ€™ a division of the army after the defeat of Carrhae, and in the following year, 52 b.c., the government of the province having fallen into his hands, he was able, by cautious and skilful dispositions, to drive back the Parthians. In 61 b.c. he was compelled to retreat before a large force of the Parthians under Osaces and Pacorus, but managed to throw himself into Antioch, a strongly-fortified town, which the invaders found impregnable. They were compelled to retreat, and Cassius, pursuing them rapidly, gained a complete victory. He returned to Rome soon after, with a large fortune, and in 49 b.c. became tribune of the plebs. He at first united his fortunes with those of Pompey, but after Pharsalia he surrendered to Caesar, and was treated by him with great generosity. He was made one of the legates, and in 44 b.c. became praetor peregrinus with the promise of the Syrian province for the ensuing year. Hs does not seem, however, to have been at all conciliated by these favours. He was one of the busiest of the conspirators against his benefactor, and took an active part in the assassination on the Ides of March. Brutus and Cassius soon afterwards left Italy, and gathered together their forces in Macedonia and Syria. They succeeded in overcoming the slight opposition that was offered them in the provinces, and after taking Rhodes, united at Sardis to make a stand against the second triumvirate. They took up their position at Philippi, where they were attacked by Antony and Octavianus. The division under Cassius was defeated, and Cassius himself, thinking all was lost, commanded his freedman to slay him. He was buried at Thasos.
