CENTRAL INDIA POLITICAL AGENCY, the official name for a group of feudatory states in the middle of India. Roughly speaking, they are bounded on the N. by Rájputáná, the North-Western Provinces, and Oudh; on the E. by the Chhotá Nágpur division of Bengal, on the S. by the Central Provinces, and on the W. by Bombay. The total area of these states is not accurately known, [9:5:342] but is probably not less than 90,000 square miles, and the population is computed at over 8,000,000 souls. The individual states which make the group have nothing in common with one another, apart from the diplomatic link which connects them all with the British power through the person of the agent to the Governor-General. The principal of the feudatories are Gwaliar (Scindiah), Indor (Holkar), Rewah, and Bhopál. Each of these states will be found noticed in its respective place in alphabetical order. The total number of states, great and small, comprising the Central India Political Agency is 71.
