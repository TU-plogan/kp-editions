CAREY, Henry (died 1743), a humorous poet and musical composer, was an illegitimate son of George Savile, Marquis of Halifax, and was born towards the end of the 17th century. He studied music under Lennert, Roseingrave, and Geminiani, but never attained to excellence in the higher departments of composition. His ballads and songs, however, were exceedingly popular at the time. He wrote several dramatic pieces for Covent Garden theatre, among which may be mentioned a burlesque tragedy called Chrononhotonthologos (1734); an operetta called the Honest Yorkshireman ; two interludes, called Nancy and Thomas and Sally ; and two burlesque operas, called The Dragon of Wantley (1737) and Margery, or the Dragoness. His songs were collected and published by himself in a work called The Musical Century (1740); and one of them, Sally in our Alley, the most graceful and natural of English lyrics, is yet popular. His dramatic works were published in 1743. Carey died at an advanced age the same year. It has often been said that he put an end to his own life, but the story had no good foundation.
