CANVAS, a name applied to several kinds of stout cloth, made of hemp orÂ·linen fibres, and used for the sails of vessels, the ground of oil paintings, and various other purposes. Originally canvas was made solely from hemp, whence the name, which is corrupted from Cannabis, the classical and scientific name for the hemp plant. Being most extensively employed as sail-cloth, the term came to designate the sails of a ship generally, for which, however, although hempen canvas is still used, linen or mixed fibres are now more generally preferred.
