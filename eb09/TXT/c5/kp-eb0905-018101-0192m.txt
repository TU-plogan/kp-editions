CASS, Lewis (1782-1866), an American general and statesman, was born at Exeter, New Hampshire, in the United States, on the 9th October 1782. He began life as a law-student, and was called to the bar at the age of twenty. Four years later he became a member of the Ohio Legislature. During the war with England (1812- 1814) he served in the army, and rose to the rank of general. In 1813 he was appointed governor of Michigan,â€”a position which gave him the chief control of Indian affairs, for the territory was then occupied almost entirely by natives, there being only 6000 white settlers. This post he held for eighteen years, during which he obtained large tracts of territory from the Indians, instituted surveys, constructed roads, and explored the lakes and sources of the Mississippi. (For an account of these explorations see North American Review, 1., Iv.) About this time also he amassed the greater part of his large fortune by judicious purchase of land. In 1831 he became secretary of war under General Jackson, and he fulfilled the duties of this office during the first two years of the Florida war. Five years later he was appointed minister plenipotentiary to France, where he became acquainted with Louis Philippe, to whom he gives the highest praise in his France: its King, Court, and Government (1840). The cause of his resigning this appointment was that he disapproved of the concessions granted to England in the treaty concluded with Lord Ashburton by Daniel Webster, the American secretary of state, for the purpose of settling the dispute between England and the United States with regard to the north-eastern frontiers of the latter country. General Cass twice stood as candidate for the presidency, viz., in 1848 and 1852, but both times unsuccessfully. The last public office which he held was that of secretary of war under Buchanan; and, in the end of 1860, he retired into private life, upon the refusal of the president to send reinforcements to Fort Sumter. He died on the 17th June 1866. The chief points of the policy of General Cass were his defence of slavery, and his consequent attack upon the quintuple treaty which aimed at its suppression; his advocacy of a high protective tariff, and of extension of territory in the case of Texas; and his support of the cause of national unity, notwithstanding his expressed opinion that the Union had no right to coerce the separate States. As an author, General Cass is known by the writings already mentioned, and by his history of the Indians of the United States, which appeared in 1823. Accounts of his life have been published by H. R. Schoolcraft (1848), W. T. Young (1852), and W. L. G. Smith (1856).
