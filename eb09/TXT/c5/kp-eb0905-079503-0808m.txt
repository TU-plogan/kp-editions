CITTÀ DI CASTELLO, a town of Italy, pleasantly situated on the left bank of the Tiber, in the province of Perugia, 25 miles N. by W. from the town of that name. It has a cathedral, dedicated to St Floridus and dating from I50 i 3, a large number of interesting churches with valuable paintings, a communal palace of the 13th century, an episcopal palace remodelled since 1789, and no fewer than four mansions belonging to the Vitelli family, who governed the town in the 15th century, and were among the first to [9:5:796] patronize the youthful Raphael. The city for a long time numbered several works of this artist among its most precious possessions; but they have all been removed except two of minor importance. Città di Castello occupies the site of the ancient Tifernum, Tiberinum, which was chiefly famous for its connection with the younger Pliny, who had a villa in the neighbourhood. The older city was destroyed by Totila, but numerous inscriptions have been discovered which prove its identity. Population, 6090.
