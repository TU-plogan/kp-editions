CASSEL, or Kassel, the capital of the former electorate of Hesse Cassel, in Western Germany, and, since its annexation by Prussia in 1866, the capital of the province of Hesse Nassau, is pleasantly situated on both sides of the River Fulda, over which a stone bridge leads to the lower [9:5:183] new town. The river is navigable, and railways connect the town with all parts of Germany. The streets of the old town are narrow and crooked, but those of the upper and lower new town, and the three suburbs, are not surpassed by any in Germany. The principal streets are the Königsstrasse (5100 feet long and 60 broad), the Bellevue-Strasse, and the Friedrich Wilhelm Strasse (180 feet broad with four rows of linden trees). The Friedrich’s Platz is the largest square in Germany, being 1000 by 450 feet. It contains a marble statue of Landgrave Frederick IL, and commands a fine view from the open side. The former residence of the electors fronts this square, as well as the Museum, considered the finest building in the town. This museum contains various valuable collections of curiosities, interesting mosaics, a library of 100,000 volumes and valuable manuscripts. In the cabinet of curiosities there is a complete collection of clocks and watches (including the so-called Egg of Nuremberg), from the earliest to the present time. Among other public places and buildings worthy of notice are the Roman Catholic church, with a splendid interior; the Military School; the Königs Platz, with a remarkable echo; the Karl’s Platz, with the statue of Landgrave Charles; the Martin’s Platz, with a large church containing the burial-vaults of the Hessian princes.

The Gallery of Paintings in the Bellevue Castle has attracted of late many visitors to Cassel, as it contains numerous chefs d' oeuvre, the most of which, before 1866, were not accessible to the public. Among these are fine specimens of Holbein, Cranach, Dürer, Rembrandt, Vandyck, Rubens, Mabuse, Teniers, Metzu, Wouvermann, P. Potter, Ruysdael, Titian, Guido Reni, C. Dolce, the Caraccis, Veronese, Murillo, and many other eminent painters. The town contains numerous educational institutions, including a polytechnic school, an academy of the fine arts, a lyceum, and a military academy. The descendants of the French refugees who founded the upper new town have a church of their own and a hospital, and the Jews, a very handsome synagogue. Music is much cultivated and there is a good opera with a first-rate orchestra, of which Louis Spohr was at one time conductor. The opera house or theatre was built by Jerome Napoleon. Trade has very much increased of late, and among the manufactures are steam engines and locomotives, articles in silver and gold, philosophical instruments, tobacco, sugar, cotton and linen cloths, hats, leather, carriages, porcelain, soap, and chemicals. There are also several breweries; and two fairs are held annually. The celebrated chemists Bunsen and Kolbe are natives of Cassel. In the vicinity of the town are the Orangerie Chateau, and the Auegarten, a favourite promenade, with a marble bath.

On a slope of the Habichtswald Mountains, three miles from Cassel, and approached by an avenue, is the famous summer palace (with park and forest) of Wilhelmsböhe, sometimes called the Versailles of Germany. Napoleon III. resided here after the battle of Sedan. The surrounding gardens are beautifully adorned with fountains, cascades, lakes, and grottoes, the principal fountain sending up a jet of water 180 feet high and 12 feet in diameter. Here also is an interesting building called the Loewenburg, erected a century ago in the style of a fortified castle, and containing among other things portraits of the Tudors and Stuarts. The principal curiosity is the Karlsburg cascade, which is placed in a sort of broad ravine, thickly wooded on both sides. A staircase of 900 steps leads to the top. On one of the landings is a huge rudely-carved stone figure of the giant Enceladus, and at the top is an octagon building called the Riesenschloss, surmounted by a colossal copper figure of the Farnese Hercules, 31 feet high, whose club alone is sufficiently capacious to accommodate from eight to ten persons. In different parts of the park, and especially from the Octagon, charming views are obtained. The park was first formed by Landgrave Frederick II. (whose consort was Mary, daughter of George II. of England), and was finished by his successor, after whom it was named, and who is said to have employed 2000 workmen for fourteen years in its construction

Perhaps the earliest mention of Cassel occurs in a document of the year 913, when the name appears in the form of Chassala. The town was fortified by the Landgrave Philip the Magnanimous in the 16th century; and in 1687 it was augmented by the formation of the Upper New Town by the Landgrave Charles. In 1762 it was captured by Frederick of Brunswick, after an obstinate siege, during which it had been defended by the French under Diesbach; and not long after its fortifications were dismantled. In 1807 it became the capital of the kingdom of Westphalia; in 1813 it was bombarded and captured by the Russian general Chemicheff; in 1830, 1831, and 1848 it was the scene of violent commotions; from 1850 to 1851 it was occupied by the Prussians, the Bavarians, and the Austrians; and in 1866 it passed definitively into the possession of Prussia. Of late it has become a very thriving town, and is now a very favourite residence for strangers. Population (1875), 50,000.
