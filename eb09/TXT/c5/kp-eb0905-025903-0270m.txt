CAVA, or La Cava, a town of Italy in the province of Principato Citreriore, 28 miles by rail south-east of Naples, with a communal population of 19,500. It is the seat of a bishopric, has a cathedral and a diocesan seminary, and carries on the manufacture of silk, cotton, and woollen stuffs. In the vicinity is the famous Benedictine abbey of La Trinita della Cava, which was founded in the 11th century, and almost rivals Monte Casino in the number and value of its literary treasures. Its archives contain about 40,000 separate documents of parchment, and more than 60,000 manuscripts on paper,—of which a complete inventory is being published by Don Michele Morcaldi under the title of Codex Diplomaticus Cavensis. The library, in spite of losses sustained within the last two centuries, still preserves a number of rich and valuable manuscripts, and a collection of early specimens of typography. Among these may be mentioned the Codex Legum Longobardorum, which dates from the beginning of the 11th century; a MS. copy of the Vulgate of the 8th, an Isidorus of the 9th, and a prayerbook illustrated with miniatures ascribed to Fra Angelico da Fiesole. (See Dantier ’ s Monast. Benedict, dl Italia, and two articles in Academy, vol. viii. pp. 262 and 364, 1875.)
