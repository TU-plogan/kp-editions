CARIBS (in German Karaiben), a people of Red Indian race, which, at the time of the discovery of America by Columbus, was the most important along the northern coast of the southern continent, and in a number of the islands of what is still known as the Caribbean Sea. They were a strongly built, warlike, and aggressive people, and offered a pertinacious resistance to the advances of the Europeans, before whose arrival they had rendered themselves an object of terror to the other inhabitants of the region. They appear to have been addicted to cannibalism, and the very word cannibal is not improbably derived from a corruption of their name. From the islands they have for the most part disappeared, and their principal settlement is now in the republic of Honduras, where they form a very industrious and prosperous part of the population, while still retaining their original language and many of their peculiar customs. They are to be found principally in the district between the Pai took river and the Belize. Their immigration into Honduras dates only from about 1796, when the English, weary of the continual disturbances which they occasioned, transported them in a body from Dominica and St Vincent to the island of Ruotan. In these islands they divided into two great tribes, known as the Red and the Black Caribs, of whom the former were the pure descendants of the ancient stock, while the latter were largely intermingled with Negro blood. To the same race probably belong the Galibi in French Guiana, the Yaoi in Venezuela, the Cumanagotto, the Pariagotto, and various other tribes of the continent.
