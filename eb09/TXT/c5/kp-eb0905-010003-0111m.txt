CARDWELL, Edward (1787-1861), a learned divine and ecclesiastical historian, was born at Blackburn in Lancashire in 1787. He was educated at Brasenose College, Oxford, where, in 1809. he took his degree of B.A. as first class in classics and second class in mathematics, and became a fellow of his college. He took his master’s degree in 1812. After being for several years engaged as tutor and lecturer he was appointed, in 1814, one of the examiners to the university. In 1826 he was chosen Camden Professor of Ancient History; and during his five years’ professorship he published an edition of the Ethics of Aristotle with selected notes for the use of students, and a course of his lectures on The Coinage of the Greeks and Romans. In 1831 he took his degree of D.D., and was called to the post of principal of St Alban’s Hall, which he held till his death. He published in 1837 a student’s edition of the Greek Testament, with the text divided into paragraphs, and furnished with various readings and notes, and accompanied page for page by the English authorized version. In the same year appeared his edition of the Greek and Latin texts of the History of the Jewish War, by Josephus, with illustrative notes. But his most important labours were in the field of English Church History. He projected an extensive work, which was to embrace the entire synodical history of the church in England, and was to be founded on Wilkins’s Concilia. Of this work he executed some portions only. ' The first published of these was Documentary Annals of the Reformed Church of England from 1546 to 1716, which appeared in 1839 and soon reached a second edition. It was followed by a History of Conferences, <kc., connected with the Revision of the Book of Common Prayer from 1550 to 1690 (1840), which reached a third edition within ten years. In 1848 appeared Synodalia, a Collection of Articles [9:5:101] of Religion, Canons, and Proceedings of Convocation from 1547 to 1717, completing the series for that period. Closely connected with these works in the Reformatio Legum Ecclesiasticarum (1850), which treats of the changes proposed and attempted in the direction of reform during the reigns of Henry VIII., Edward VL, and Elizabeth. As a supplement to the foregoing, Dr Cardwell published iu 1854 a new edition of Bishop Gibson’s Synodus Anglicana. Dr Cardwell, as one of the best men of business in the university, held various important posts, among which were those of delegate of the press, curator of the university galleries, manager of the Bible department of the press, and private secretary to successive chancellors of the university. He died at Oxford, 23d May, 1861.
