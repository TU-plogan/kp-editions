CIVIDALE, or more precisely Cividale del Friuli, a town of Italy, in the province of Udine, and about ten miles east of the city of that name, on the right bank of the Natisone, over which there is a bridge 250 feet in length. It has an interesting collegiate church founded in 750, an antiquarian museum, and a military training college. The archives of the “duomo” contain various manuscripts of value, among which may be mentioned a 5th century copy of the translation of the Gospels by St Jerome, and the prayer-book of St Gertrude which dates from the 11th century. Cividale is generally supposed to occupy the site of the ancient Forum Julii, a town of the Carni, which rose to the rank of a Roman colony, became the capital of Venetia after the destruction of Aquileia in 452, was made the seat of a duchy under the Lombards, and thus gave its name to the province of Friuli. Many ancient remains have been brought to light from time to time, including vases, bas-reliefs, inscriptions, a temple, and another large building with mosaic floors. In 1874 the tomb of the Lombard duke Gisulfo was discovered. Paulus Diaconus was born at Forum Julii in the 8th century; and the actress Ristori is a native of Cividale. Population, 8200.
