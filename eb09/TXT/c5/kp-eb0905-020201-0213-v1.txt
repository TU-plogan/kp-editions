CASTRO, Guillen de (1569-1631), a Spanish dramatist of note, was a Valencian by birth, and early enjoyed a reputation as a man of letters. In 1591, with Aguilar and Artieda, he was a member of the Nocturnos, a brilliant Spanish imitation of the Italian Accademia. At one time a captain of horse, at another the protégé of the munificent Benevente, viceroy of Naples, of whom he received the governorship of a Neapolitan fortress, patronized and splendidly pensioned by the duke of Osuña and the countduke Olivarez, Guillen de Castro would seem to have made friends with his pen as quickly and as easily as he unmade them by his sour humour and discontented obstinacy. Little is known of the literary part of his life. He lived at Madrid, and wrote for the stage. It is certain, too, that he long enjoyed the friendship of Lope de Vega, who dedicated a play to him in flattering terms, and whom he assisted at the famous festival of the Canonization of San Isidro, where he won a prize in the literary tournament contested by Jauregui, Calderon, Juan de Montalvan, and others. He is said, moreover, to have died in such poverty as to have owed his funeral to charity. Guillen de Castro wrote some forty plays, in all of which he showed himself a follower of Lope de Vega, and a thorough Spaniard in instinct and idea, and in some of which great passions and stirring scenes are treated worthily and well. The best of them are perhaps—(1) Engañarse Engαnαndο, (2) Pagar en propria Mοneda, and (3) La Justicia en la Piedad. But the drama that has made Guillen de Castro’s reputation European is Las Mοcedades del Cid, to the first part of which Corneille was so largely indebted for the materials of his own renowned tragedy. The two parts of this play, like all those of Castro, have the genuine ring of the old songs of the Romanceros about them; and, from their intense nationality, no less than for their rough poetry and sweet versification, were, doubtless, among the most popular pieces of their day.
