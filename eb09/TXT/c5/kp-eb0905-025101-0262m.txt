CAUCASIA, a governor-generalship of the Russian empire, which extends from about 38° 40' to 46° 40' N. lat., and includes the whole range of the Caucasus, the vast steppes that lie to the north of the mountains between the Sea of Azoff and the Caspian, and all the Russian territory to the south. On the south side it is bounded by the Turkish empire and Persia, while on the north it is conterminous with Astrakhan and the province of the Don army. The principal division is into Cis-Caucasia or the European portion, and Trans-Caucasia or the Asiatic,—the watershed of the Caucasus having recently been adopted as the line of partition. Cis-Caucasia thus includes the government of Stavropol, the Kuban district, the Terek district, and Daghestan; while Trans-Caucasia comprises the governments of Tiflis, Baku, Elisabethpoζ Erivan, and Kutai, and the circles of Sukhum, Zakatal, and the Black Sea or Chernomorsk. The total area is 172,837 square miles, and the population is estimated at 4,893,332.
