CHANG-CHOW, a town of China, in the province of Fuh-keen, on a branch of the River Lung Keang, 35 miles west of Amoy. It is well built, and surrounded with a wall 4Â½ miles in circumference, which, however, includes a good deal of open ground. The streets are paved with granite, but are very dirty. The river is crossed by a curious bridge, 800 feet long, constructed of wooden planks supported on 25 piles of stones about 30 feet apart. The city is a centre of the silk-trade, and carries on an extensive commerce in different directions. Brick-works and sugar-factories are among its chief industrial establishments. Its population is estimated at about 1,000,000.
