CHRISTOPHER, Saint, according to the legend, was a Christian martyr of the 3d century, and a native of Palestine or of Syria. Glorying in his gigantic strength and stature, he resolved to serve none who owned a superior. His first master was more powerful than any man, but it soon appeared that he was exceedingly afraid of the devil. The devil therefore became the master of the future saint. But even he was found not to ba superior to fear; for he trembled before the image of Christ. His servant consequently deserted him, and, meeting a hermit who told him of the Saviour, was baptized, and undertook as penance to carry Christian pilgrims over a bridgeless stream. At length a little child requested his aid, but the burden proved more than the giant could support. The child was Christ; and thus is explained the name Christopher (Christ-bearer). As a sign, Christopher’s staff, being planted, grew into a palm-tree covered with fruit and foliage,—a miracle which effected the conversion of thousands. In consequence, the prefect Dagnus seized him, and after cruelly torturing him commanded him to be shot with poisoned arrows. These, however, instead of harming him, rebounded and wounded his persecutors. One entered the eye of the prefect; and in pity Christopher sacrificed himself to save his enemy. He was decapitated, and his blood healed the wound. The festival of St Christopher is celebrated by the Roman Catholic church on the 25th July, by the Greek church on the 9th May. St Christopher was invoked as a defence against pestilence, and in order to frighten away the spirits who watch over hidden treasure.
