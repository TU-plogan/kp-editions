CLAUDIUS, AppiusCrassus, was, according to Livy, a patrician notorious for his pride and cruelty and his bitter hatred of the plebeians. Twice they refused to fight under him, and, fleeing before their enemies, brought upon him defeat and disgrace. He retaliated by decimating the army. At length they effected his banishment, but he quickly returned, and again became consul. In the same year (451 b. c.) he was made one of the decemviri who had been appointed to draw up a code of written laws, and so carefully did he act during his first year of office that he was the only one of the ten who was re-elected. With Claudius at their head, the new decemviri appear to have resolved on retaining permanent authority, but an outburst of popular feeling suddenly crushed their power. Enamoured of the beautiful daughter of the plebeian centurion Virginius, Claudius attempted to seize her by an abuse of justice. One of his clients, Marcus Claudius, swore that she was the child of a slave belonging to him, and that she had been stolen by the childless wife of the centurion. Virginius was summoned from the army, but a private message was sent at the same time instructing the general to detain him. The first messenger was more speedy than the second, and on the day of trial Virginius was present to expose the conspiracy. Still judgment was given according to the evidence of Marcus, and Claudius commanded Virginia to be given up to him. There was but one way of escape, and in despair, her father seized a knife from a neighbouring stall and plunged it in her side. The popular passion was deeply stirred. Virginius, with Icilius, the betrothed lover of his daughter, and NÎ±mitorius, her uncle, hurried to arouse the army; Horatius and Valerius put themselves at the head of the people. The decemviri were overthrown; and Appius Claudius died in prison, either by his own hand or by that of the executioner. Mommsen rejects the view given as above by Livy, and is inclined to hold that Claudius, as decemvir, was the pretended champion of the plebs, and that the revolution which ruined him was a return of the people to the rule of the patricians, who are represented by Horatius and Valerius. See appendix to vol. i. of his History of Rome.
