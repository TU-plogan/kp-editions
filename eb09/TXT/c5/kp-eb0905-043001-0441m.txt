CHARLOTTESVILLE, a town of the United States, the capital of Albemarle county, Virginia, situated about 65 miles north-west of Richmond on Moore’s Creek, a tributary of Rivanna river. It is a railway junction of some importance; but its celebrity is due to the university of Virginia and the residence of Thomas Jefferson, which are both in the neighbourhood. The university was founded by Jefferson in 1819, and over $200,000 was spent on the buildings; it is endowed and controlled by the state, and was attended in 1875 by 330 students. Monticello, the founder’s residence, is stiŬ standing, though in a somewhat dilapidated state, and his tomb is to be seen in the family burying-ground. The population of the town in 1870 was 2838, of whom 1473 were coloured.
