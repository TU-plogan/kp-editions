CARTWRIGHT, William (1611-1643), an English poet, born at North way near Tewkesbury, in September 1611, was the son of a gentleman, who, having wasted his fortune, was reduced to the necessity of keeping an inn. William Cartwright finished his education at Oxford, entered the church, and became a popular preacher in that university. In 1642 he obtained the place of succentor in the church of Salisbury; and he was afterwards chosen junior proctor and metaphysical reader in his university. He died of camp fever at the age of thirty-two, in 1643. He was distinguished by a graceful person and attractive manner, and by extraordinary industry; and, indeed, his fame rests on his personal popularity and the praise which he received from his fellow-poets, and especially from Ben Jonson, rather than on the merit of his verses, which are, in fact, very ordinary productions. His poems and plays were published in 1651.
