CASTELLI, Ignaz Friedrich (1781-1862), an Austrian dramatist, was born on 6th March 1781, at Vienna. He completed his education at the university in his native town, and entered the profession of law. The leisure left him by his employment in a subordinate Government office he devoted to literary work, in particular to the composition and adaptation of dramatic pieces. Some of his war-songs became exceedingly popular, and so excited the ill-feeling of the French that Castelli had to flee from Vienna and take refuge in Hungary. In 1811 he was made director of the court theatre by Prince Lobkowitz, but he resigned this post in 1814 in order to accompany Count Cavriani to France as secretary. He returned to Vienna with Count MÃ¼nch-Bellinghausen, and for many years occupied himself entirely with literary work. He died in 1862 at Lilienfeld. From 1840 he had enjoyed a pension from Government. His autobiography appeared in three volumes, 1861-2. His numerous dramas and minor pieces are distinguished only by their light gaiety and humour.
