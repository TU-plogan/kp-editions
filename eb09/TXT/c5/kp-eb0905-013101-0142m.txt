CARPI, a town of Italy in the province of Modena, 10 miles north of that city, on a canal supplied by the Secchia. It is the seat of a bishop, and has a cathedral, a theological seminary, a modem palace, an old castle, and considerable remains of its ancient fortifications. Silkgrowing, and silk-weaving, the manufacture of straw hats, and the cultivation of grain, hemp, and flax are the principal occupations of the inhabitants, who number about 17,500. In the 14th and 15th and part of the 16th century, it belonged to the Pico family; but it was taken possession of by Charles V. and bestowed on Alfonso dâ€™Este.
