CLEOBULUS, one of the Seven Sages, was son of Evagoras, and a native of Lindus, which town he ruled, though whether as monarch or as head of a republic is uncertain. He was distinguished for his strength and his handsome person, for the wisdom of his sayings, the acuteness of his riddles, and the beauty of his lyric poetry. Diogenes Laertius quotes a letter in which Cleobulus invites Solon to take refuge with him against Pisistratus; and this would imply that he was alive in 560 b.c. He is said to have held advanced views as to female education, and he was the father of the wise Cleobuline, whose riddles were not less famous than his own.
