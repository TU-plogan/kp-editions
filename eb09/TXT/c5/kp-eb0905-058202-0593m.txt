CHEPHREN, an Egyptian monarch, called in the hieroglyphs Khafra, by Herodotus Chephren, by Diodorus Cephren or Chabrias, by Manetho Souphis 11., and by Eratosthenes Saophis II. He was, according to the legends, the son or brother of Cheops, and acted in the same tyrannical manner. Chephren built the second of the great pyramids at Gizeh close to the Sphinx and the Great Pyramid, and was said to be hated like his brother, his mummy not buried in the sepulchre but torn to pieces, and the sarcophagi emptied of their contents. The present length of the base of this pyramid is 690 feet 9 inches, and its perpendicular height 447 feet 6 inches, its angle 52° 20', but it is not built with the same care. The wife of Chephren, named Merisankh, was priestess of the god Thoth, and Kheman another prince of the family, priest of Thoth at Hermopolis. There is no reason for believing in the impiety of the monarch, or any oppression more than in the case of his predecessors and successor, all whose tombs were pyramids. Chephren also built the small temple behind the great Sphinx, but does not appear [9:5:583] amongst the monarchs recorded at the Wady Magarah. The lists of Abydos interpose a king called Ra-tatef or Tatefra, between Cheops and Chephren, but his reign was probably short and insignificant, and he may have been the brother of Cheops. According to Herodotus, Chephren reigned 50, according to Manetho 66, and according to Eratosthenes 27 years, the longest time being probably correct. From fragment 30 of the hieratic canon of Turin it is probable that he lived 95 years, and his reign, according to Lepsius, was from 3032-2966 b.c. A splendid diorite statue of Chephren is in the museum of Boulaq, and others, broken and thrown long ago into the well of the temple near the Sphinx, supposed to have been destroyed by popular hatred with the remains of the tombs of his family in the Gizeh cemeteries, are the principal monuments of his reign. It is just possible a bull Apis was buried in his pyramid.
