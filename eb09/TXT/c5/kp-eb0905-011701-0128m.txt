CARMICHAEL, Gershom (1672-1729), a metaphysician of whom Sir William Hamilton has said that ho “may be regarded, on good grounds, as the real founder of the Scottish school of philosophy.” He was born about the year 1672, probably in London, where his father, a Presbyterian minister who had been banished by the Scotch Privy Council for his religious opinions, was then living. Gershom was educated at Edinburgh University. He graduated there in 1691, and soon after became a Regent at St Andrews. In 1694 he was elected, a Master in the University of Glasgow,—an office that was converted into the profesorship of Moral Philosophy in 1727, when the system of Masters was abolished at Glasgow. He was an eminently successful teacher, attracting students from England as well as Scotland, but his warm temper led him into various disputes with the principal and other college authorities, in consequence of which he was more than once suspended from his functions. His works are Breviυscula Introductio ad Logicam, a treatise on logic and the psychology of the intellectual powers, in which among other things he affirms ' that all knowledge may be resolved into immediate judgments known in their own light; Synopsis Theologiae Naturalis ; and au edition of Puffendorff De Officio Hominis et Civis, with notes and supplements of high value. Carmichael died in 1729.
