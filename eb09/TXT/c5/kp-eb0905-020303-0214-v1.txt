CASTRUCCI9 CASTRACANI (1283-1328) was by birth a Lucchese, and by descent and training a Ghibelline.

He belonged to the family of Antelminelli; and being exiled at an early age with his parents and others of their faction by the Guelfs, then in the ascendant, and orphaned at nineteen, he served as a soldier in England, France, and Lombardy, till he returned to Italy in 1313, and was chosen chief by the Ghibellines, who had again obtained the mastery. To avenge himself on the vanquished faction he called in Uguccione da Faggiuola, lord of Pisa, who treated him ill and perfidiously, putting him in irons and sacking the city of Lucca, in spite of strenuous support received from Castruccio in many arduous enterprises, particularly in that of Montecatini. An insurrection of the Lucchese leading to the explusion of Uguccione and his party, Castruccio regained his freedom and his position, and the Ghibelline triumph was presently assured. Elected governor of Lucca in 1316, he warred incessantly against the Florentines,—becoming the faithful adviser and staunch supporter of the Emperor Louis V., whom he accompanied to Rome, and who made him duke of Lucca, count of the Lateran Palace, and senator of the empire. Castruccio was excommunicated with his master by the Papal Legate, in the interest of the Guelfs, and died soon afterwards, leaving several young children, whose fortunes were wrecked in the Guelfic triumph consequent on their father’s death.

Machiavelli’s Life of Castruccio is a mere biographical romance; it was translated into French, with notes, by Dreux de Radier in 1753; See Nicolas Negrini, Vita di Castruccio, Modena, 1496; Sismondi's and Leo’s Histories of the Italian Republics; and Wieland, Dissertatio ds Castruccio, Leipsic, 1779.
