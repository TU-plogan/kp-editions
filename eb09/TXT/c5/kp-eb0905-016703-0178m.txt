CARUS, Karl Gustav (1789-1869), a German physiologist and psychologist, was born at Leipsic, on the 3d January 1789. He was educated at the Thomas School and the university of his native city, 'and devoted his attention first to chemistry, intending to enter upon the business of his father, who had a large dyeing establishment. But a course of lectures on anatomy which he attended caused him to alter his views, and he began the systematic study of medicine. In 1811 he graduated, and began to teach as a privat-docent. The subject which he selected (comparative anatomy) had not previously been lectured on at Leipsic, and Carus soon established a reputation as a medical teacher. In 1813 he became director of the military hospital at Pfaffendorf, near Leipsic, and in the following year he was summoned as professor to the new medical college at Dresden. In this town he spent the remainder of his life, rising to the highest dignities of his profession. He was made royal physician in 1827, and became a privy councillor in 1862. The last years of his life were spent in drawing up an autobiography,—which was published under the title Lebeηseriηηeτwngeη und Denkwürdigkeiten, four volumes, 1865-6. He died on the 28th July 1869. In philosophy Carus belongs to the school of Schelling, and his works are thoroughly impregnated with the spirit of that system. He was also distinguished as a landscape painter and as an art critic.

Carus’s L terary activity was very great, and the list of his works is lengthy. The most important are— Grundzüge, der vergleichende Anatomie und Physiologie, 1828; System der Physiologie, 2d ed., 1847-9; Psyche: zur Entwidcelungsgeschichte der Seele, 1846; Physis: zur Geschichte des leiblichen Lebens; Natur und Idee, 1861; Symbolik des menschlichen Gestalts, 1852; Atlas der Kranioskopis, 2d ed., 1864; Vergleichende Psychologie, 1866.
