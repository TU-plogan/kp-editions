CIDER, an alcoholic beverage obtained by the fermentation of the juice of apples. The manufacture is chiefly carried on by the cultivators of the fruit, and it has been conducted from very remote times in Hereford, Worcester, Gloucester, Somerset, and Devonshire in England, and in Normandy in France. Cider is also largely prepared and consumed in Upper Austria, Wurtemberg, in the districts of the Maine and the Moselle, and in Holland; and it is besides a common beverage in the New England and Western States of America. In the south-west of England the most esteemed varieties of apple cultivated for cidermaking are the Royal Wilding, the Foxwhelp, White Normandy Beech, Yellow Sty re, Handsome Mandy, and Skyrme’s Kernel. For a superior quality of cider the large well matured apples of several varieties are selected, and are ground up to a fine pulp either in an old-fashioned cider mill, or in one of several newer machines which have been introduced for pulping the fruit. The old form of mill consists of a circular trough around which a huge heavy stone wheel or runner, weighing about a ton, is drawn by a horse. Into the trough a charge of apples, to the amount of from 8 to 10 bushels, is thrown, and the mill is kept in motion till the whole mass is reduced to a fine uniform pulp, which is technically called “the cheese.” The old-fashioned mills are now generally superseded by modem inventions, of which Coleman’s cider press may be taken as the type. It consists of two pairs of rollers mounted in a strong wooden frame. The first and upper pair are of hard wood, studded with iron teeth or knives, set immediately under a hopper into which the fruit is fed. In passing between the first pair the fruit is sliced into small pieces which fall between the second pair of rollers, placed immediately below. These consist of heavy cylinders of stone set quite close so that the opposing surfaces press against each other, and the sliced apples in passing between them are bruised to a fine pulp which is received into a trough placed directly under. The pulp or cheese is, or ought to be, laid aside for at least a night to allow fermentation to set in before the juice is expressed. By this means the aromatic oil contained in the seeds is extracted, communicating its aroma to the mass, and a richer, fuller-flavoured beverage is the result. The cheese is placed in hair-cloths in a strong framed box for expressing the juice, an operation which must be gently and carefully performed, so that the liquid may be obtained as pure and clear as possible. The juice ought to have a specific gravity of from 1O7 to 1 - 08, and should contain 10 or 11 per cent, of sugar and 0 - 6 to 0 ’ 7 per cent, of malic acid. The liquor is strained and placed for fermenting either in large vats or in separate casks. In the fermentation which ensues an abundant sediment is thrown to the bottom and a scum rises to the surface. In a week or ten days this action should leave the liquid clear and bright if the fermentation has continued steady and moderate. The liquidis then racked off into casks, as free as possible from scum and sediment, and excluded from atmospheric influence to stop the further action of the ferment. If in the early part of the following spring it is found to be still clear, nothing further is required except to cask it up for the market; but should it have become thick and ropy it must be “fined” either by means of isinglass or with stewed and mashed apples. It is frequently found necessary, in order effectually to stop fermentation, to expose the liquor to the influence of sulphurous acid gas, which is done by burning a sulphur tipped stick inside a cask half filled with cider, and shaking the cask so as to make the liquor absorb the acid gas. Such “matched” cider is readily detected by connoisseurs. The artificial colouring of cider, when practised, is done either with burnt sugar, the juice of red beet, logwood, or cochineal; and in Germany a flavour is sometimes communicated to the beverage with elder flowers, cinnamon, cloves, or other aromatics. The following analysis of a pint of common cider such as is supplied to agricultural labourers in Somersetshire is by Dr Voelcker :—

Cider is very prone to undergo acetous fermentation, and develop a rough, sharp, vinegary taste; and in that condition its consumption readily causes diarrhoea and colic. Roughness may be much reduced by treatment with various compounds prepared for the purpose which contain lime, or by the addition of a quantity of hops boiled with treacle or honey to the acetified cider. When sound it is a wholesome, agreeable, and refreshing stimulant beverage. In Germany a spirit, apple brandy, is distilled from cider.
