CHEOPS, the name of an Egyptian king Khufu, called Cheops by Herodotus, Chembes by Diodorus, Souphis by Manetho, and Saophis by Eratosthenes. He was the second king of the fourth dynasty of Manetho, and the builder of the Great Pyramid at Gizeh, 120 stadia distant from Memphis and about 45 from the Nile. According to Diodorus, each side was 7 plethra long, and the height 6 plethra; or according to Herodotus, each side of the base was 8 plethra in extent, and the height the same. The former sides are supposed to have been each 764 feet long, their present dimensions being about 746 feet, while the actual present height is 450 feet, and the angle of the casing stones 51° 5 0', according to the measurements of Perring. This wonder of the ancient world, the sepulchre of the monarch, was constructed at great expense and suffering, 100,000 men, changed every three months, being employed by forced labour ten years in constructing the causeway by which the blocks of stone were transported from the Tourah quarries, in the Arabian chain, to a quay on the banks of the Nile, where they were transported by boat from the other bank. Immense expense was entailed in the execution of this Cuatly sepulchre, and according to a popular but improbable tradition, Cheops was compelled through want of money to sacrifice the honour of his daughter to complete the task. Other popular tales, according to the gloss or extract of Manetho, depicted him as impious towards the gods, closing the temples and stopping the worship, but subsequently repenting, and writing a sacred book much esteemed by the Egyptians. His name was supposed to mean wealthy, or having much hair. The monumental information about Cheops does not confirm the Greek historians; on the contrary, it records the construction of temples in honour of the gods, the repair of the shrine and the gift of various figures of the temple of Isis and Athor close to his own pyramid, and his construction or repairs of the temple of the same goddess Athor, the Egyptian Venus, at Denderah or Tentyris. The sacred book may have been part of the Egyptian rituals, portions of which were attributed to the early kings of Egypt, and a medical papyrus records the discovery in his reign of a treatise on medicine in a temple of a goddess at the town of Debmut. Cheops carried on war at the Wady Magarah in the Peninsula of Sinai in Arabia, and a rock tablet represents him having conquered the hostile tribes in the presence of the god Thoth, who had revealed the mines of the locality. His oppression had so afflicted Egypt that the charges of impiety had attached to his name; but the tombs of his children reveal no change in the established religion, and his pyramid only differs from those of his predecessors and immediate successor by its rather larger size and greater beauty. His name Khufu, sometimes with the addition of that of the god Khnum as Khnum-Khufu, has been found on several monuments, and was found scrawled on the stones from the quarries of Tourah or the Mons Troicus employed in the so-called chambers of construction of the Great Pyramid. There is no known monument with the date of a regnal year of this monarch, so that it is uncertain if he reigned the sixty-three years attributed to him by Manetho, or the twenty-nine assigned by Eratosthenes. It is just possible, from fragment 30 of the Papyrus of Turin, that he may have lived ninety-five years and reigned the higher number, as generally recognized by Egyptologists. The date of Cheops according to Lepsius is 3095-3032 B,c., but great difference of opinion, amounting to nearly 2000 years, exists as to the time of Menes, from whom the lists separate him by the interval of 898 years. Priests of the Apis and Mnevis bulls are mentioned in the tombs of his period.
