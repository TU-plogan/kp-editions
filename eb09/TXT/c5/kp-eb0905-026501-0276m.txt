CAVANILLES, Antonio Jose (1745-1804), a Spanish ecclesiastic who devoted himself to botany, was born at Valencia in 1745. He was educated by the Jesuits at the university of that town, and became tutor of the sons of the Duke of Infantado, whom he accompanied to Paris. There he resided twelve years, enjoying the friendship of the famous Jussieu, whose views he adopted. He afterwards became director of the royal garden at Madrid. In 1789 and the following years, he published Dissertations upon Monadelphous Plants, and in 1790 he commenced to issue his work on the plants of Spain, and those discovered by Spanish navigators in Mexico, Peru, Chili, New Holland, and the Philippine Islands.
