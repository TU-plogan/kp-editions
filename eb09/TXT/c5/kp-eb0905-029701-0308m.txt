CELTIBERIA, the country of the Celtiberi, was an extensive inland division of Spain, lying between the basin of the Iberus or Ebro and the sources of the Tagus, Douro, and Guadiana, and comprehending the greater portion of the modern provinces of Cuenca and Soria, the south-west half of Aragon, and part of Burgos. By the Romans the name was employed almost as synonymous with Hispania Citerior. It was a hilly and barren region, intersected with valleys of great fertility. Of the chief cities the most famous were Segobriga, the capital; Bilbilis, the birthplace of the poet Martial; and Numantia, besieged ten years by the Romans, and taken and destroyed by Scipio Africanus, 133 b.c. The Celtiberians, as their name imports, were considered to have arisen from the intermarriage of Iberians with the Celts that, having crossed the Pyrenees from Gaul, subdued 'and settled amongst them. The new race thus formed were a brave and powerful people, whose warlike qualities, improved by conflicts with their neighbours and the Carthaginians, rendered them formidable opponents of the Romans, whom they not unfrequently defeated After their overthrow by Scipio, and their consequent alliance with their conquerors, they frequently revolted; but, on the assassination of their leader Sertorius in 72 b.c., they were subdued by Pompey, and from that time Celtiberia submitted quietly to Roman influence.
