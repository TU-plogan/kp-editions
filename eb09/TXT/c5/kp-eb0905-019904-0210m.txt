CASTOR AND POLLUX, in Greek and Roman mythology, were twin gods, also known under the name of Dioscuri (Διόσκουροι, from Zεvς, ∆ιbς, Jupiter, and κούροι, children) for, according to one myth, they were children of Jupiter and Leda, whose love the god had won under the form of a swan. In some versions Leda is represented as having brought forth two eggs, from one of which were born the mortal babes Castor and Clytaemnestra, from the other the immortal Pollux or Polydeuces and Helen.. According to others only the latter two were children of Zeus, and in Homer all are said to be children of Leda and Tyndareus, king of Sparta. We find also that the Dioscuri were specially reverenced among people of Dorian race, and that they were said to have reigned at Sparta. Müller therefore suggests that the myth arose from the apotheosis of certain human Tyn-daridae, round whom gradually collected fables which originally referred to some ancient Peloponnesian deities.

The Dioscuri presided over public games, Castor being the god of equestrian exercise, Pollux the god of boxing; but both are usually represented on fiery steeds with spears and egg-shaped hel&ets crowned with stars. They were, besides, the patrons of hospitality; their willing and kindly aid was especially sought by travellers; they were θεol σωττj-ρε<s, ever ready to befriend all who paid them due honour. Their most important exploits are their invasion of Attica, to rescue their sister Helen from Theseus; their share in the hunting of the Calydonian boar, and in the Argonautic expedition, during which they married the daughters of Leucippus; and, lastly, their battle with the· sons of Aphareus, in which Castor, the mortal, fell by the hand of Idas. Pollux, finding him dead after the battle, implored Jupiter to be allowed to die with him; but the father of the gods (says Homer) gave his brother life, on condition that both should, on alternate days, descend to Hades. According to another fable, the god marked his approval of their love by placing them together among the stars.

Though their worship was perhaps most carefully observed among people of Dorian origin, they were held in no small veneration at Rome. It was the popular belief in that city from an early period that the battle of Lake Regillus had been decided by their interposition. They had fought, it was said, armed and mounted, at the head of the legions of the commonwealth, and had afterwards carried the news of the victory with incredible speed to the city. The well in the Forum at which they alighted was pointed out, and near it rose their ancient temple. A great festival was kept in their honour on the Ides of Quintilis, believed to be the anniversary of the battle, and sumptuous sacrifices were offered to them at the public charge, It was further ordained that a grand muster and inspection of the equestrian body should be part of the ceremonial. All the knights, clad in purple and crowned with olive, were to meet at a temple of Mars in the suburbs. Thence they were to ride in state to the forum, where stood the temple of the twins. This pageant was during several [9:5:200] centuries one of the most splendid sights of Rome. In the time of Dionysius the cavalcade consisted of 5000 horsemen, all persons of fair repute and independent fortune.
