+====================================================================+


CATHERINE of Valois (1401-1437), consort of Henry V. of England, was born at Paris in 1401. She was most unfortunate in her early years; for her father, Charles VI., king of France, was subject to prolonged fits of insanity, and her mother, one of the most abandoned women of her time, neglected her children to such an extent that they were often without suitable food and clothes. At last, in one of his lucid intervals, Charles had her children separated from their mother, and Catherine, the youngest of them, was sent to a convent to be educated. On his accession to the English throne in 1413, Henry V. asked Catherine in marriage; but as the proposal was coupled with the demand of a large dowry in money, and especially the restitution to England of the provinces once held in France, it was unceremoniously rejected. In the invasion of France which ensued, Henry proved himself so able to assert his claims, and the country had been thrown into such a state of distress and disorder, that the court of Charles, then under the control of Philip of Burgundy, was fain to comply with all the demands of the English king. Accordingly Henry, who had already seen and loved Catherine, received her in marriage at Troyes in 1420, and, along with her, the immediate possession of the provinces claimed, the regency of France during the life of his father-in-law, and the reversion of the sovereignty of France. Early next year Catherine was solemnly crowned at London. In December 1421, Henry VI. was born at Windsor. Catherine was again in France, when her royal husband died (1422). She returned to London with the funeral cortege; but, after taking some part in the arrangements connected with the regency during her son’s minority, she almost disappears from the history of the country. The only remarkable circumstance of her subsequent life is her secret marriage. Her second husband, Owen Tudor, was sprung from a princely house of Wales, had followed Henry to his French wars, and had been made a squire of his body for bravery displayed at Agincourt. Subsequently, he became an officer in the queen’s household, and in this capacity gained her affections. He seems to have been a man of high character; but as his position in England was of the lowest, the marriage was for many years kept a profound secret. The vexations the queen had to endure in consequence of its ultimate disclosure probably hastened her death, which took place in 1437. As is well known, her eldest son to Owen Tudor was created earl of Richmond, and, marrying Margaret Beaufort, the heiress of the house of Somerset and representative of the junior branch of John of Gaunt, became the father of Henry VII., and the ancestor of the Tudor line of kings.
