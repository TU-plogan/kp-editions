CHAeRONEIA, a Boeotian town situated on the Thermodon, a tributary of the Cephissus, on a plain which was on the borders of Phocis, and was on the natural route for an army invading Boeotia on that side. It is celebrated in history as the scene of three great battles. In the first (447 b.c.) the Athenians were defeated by the Boeotians; in the second (388 b.c. ) Philip defeated the confederate forces of the Athenians and Boeotians; and in the third (86 B c.) Sulla defeated the generals of Mithridates. A colossal lion lately excavated near the site of the modern KÃ¡purna marks the grave of the Boeotians who fell in the second of these engagements, and in the village itself are some remains of the ancient citadel, the Petrachus, and a theatre excavated out of the rock on which the citadel was built. Chaeroneia was the birthplace of Plutarch.
