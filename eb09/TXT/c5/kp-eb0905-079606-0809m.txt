CIUDAD RODRIGO, a town of Spain, on the Agueda, in the province of Salamanca, near the frontier of Portugal. It is fortified, and has some good public buildings, including a cathedral (built in 1190), several churches and convents, an arena for bull-fights, and an episcopal seminary. In the principal square are three Roman columns brought from the ancient Malabriga; and remains of a Roman aqueduct are also extant. A bridge connects the city with the suburbs, which are surrounded by a fertile and well-cultivated district. There are manufactures of woollen stuffs, leather, and linen; and the soap is celebrated in Spain as Jabon de Piedra. During the Peninsular war the town was taken by Marshal Mass√©na in 1810, and in 1812 by the duke of Wellington, who received from the Cortes the title of duke of Ciudad Rodrigo. Population, 5700.
