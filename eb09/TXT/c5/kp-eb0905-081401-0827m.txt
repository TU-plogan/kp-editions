CLAUBERG, John (1622-1665), one of the most noted of the immediate followers of Descartes, was born at Solingen, in Prussia, in the year 1622. After travelling in France and England, he came to Leyden, where he studied philosophy under . the Cartesian John Ray. He became professor of philosophy at Herborn, and afterwards at Duisburg, and was one of the earliest teachers of the new doctrines in Germany. Clauberg is justly celebrated as an exact and methodical commentator on his master’s writings; but he was no mere commentator, and his speculations anticipate in a marked degree the subsequent course of thought in the Cartesian school. His theory of the connection between the soul and the body is hardly to be distinguished from that afterwards advanced by Malebranche; while his view of the relation which God holds to his creatures is a distinct foreshadowing of the pantheism of Spinoza. All creatures exist only through the continuous creative energy of the Divine Being, and are no more independent of his will than are our thoughts independent of us,—or rather less, for there are thoughts which force themselves upon us whether we will or not. Clauberg died at Duisburg in 1665. His chief works are— De conjunctione animae et corporis humani scriptum ; Exercitationes centum de cognitione Dei et nostri ; Logica vetus et nova ; Initiatio philosophi, seu Dubitatio Cartesiana. He also wrote a commentary on Descartes’s Meditations. A complete edition of his works in two vols, was published at Amsterdam in 1691.
