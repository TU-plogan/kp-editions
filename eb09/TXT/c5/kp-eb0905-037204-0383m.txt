CHALLONER, Richard (1691-1781), an eminent Roman Catholic prelate, born at Lewes, Sussex, 29th September 1691. After the death of his father, who was a rigid Dissenter, his mother sought refuge with some Roman Catholic families, the consequence being that the son was brought up in their religion, chiefly at the seat of Mr Holman at Warkworth, Northamptonshire, where the Rev. John Gother, a celebrated controversialist, officiated as chaplain. In 1704 he was sent to the English College at Douay, where he was ordained a priest, took his degrees in divinity, and was appointed professor in that faculty. In 1730 he was sent on the English mission and stationed in London. The controversial treatises that he now published in rapid succession attracted much attention, particularly his Catholic Christian Instructed, which was prefaced by a witty reply to Dr Conyers Middleton’s Letter from Rome, showing an exact conformity between Popery and Paganism. Middleton is said to have been so irritated that he endeavoured to put the penal laws in force against his antagonist, who prudently withdrew from London until the commotion subsided. On 29th January 1741, Challoner was raised to the episcopal dignity at Hammersmith, by the title of bishop of Debra, in partibus infidelium, and nominated coadjutor, cum jure successionis, to Bishop Petre, Vicar-Apostolic of the London district. Accordingly, on the decease of that prelate in 1758, Challυner succeeded to the Vicariate-Apostolic. He resided principally in London, but was obliged to retire into the country during the “No Popery” riots of 1780. Soon afterwards he died, on January 12, 1781, and was buried at Milton, Berkshire. Bishop Chailoner was the author of numerous controversial and devotional works, which have been frequently reprinted and translated into various languages. He compiled the Garden of the Soul, which continues to this day to be the most popular manual of devotion among English-speaking Roman Catholics; and he revised an edition of the Douay version of the Scriptures [9:5:373] (1749-50), correcting the language and orthography, which in many places had become obsolete. Of his historical works the most valuable is one which was intended to be a Roman Catholic antidote to Foxe’s well-known martyrology. īt is entitled Memoirs of Missionary Priests and other Catholidcs of both Sexes who suffered Death or Imprisonment in England on account of their Religion, from the year 1577 till the end of the reign of Charles 11., 2 vols. 1741; reprinted in 1803. Bishop Challoner also published anonymously, in 1745, the lives of English, Scotch, and Irish saints, under the title of Britannia Sancta.
