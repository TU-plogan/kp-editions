CARPZOV (in Latin Carpzovius), the name of a family, many of whose members attained distinction in Saxony in the 17th and 18th centuries as jurists, theologians, and statesmen. They traced their origin to Simon Carpzov, who was burgomaster of Brandenburg in the middle of the 16th century, and who left two sons, Joachim and Benedict.

Benedict Carpzov (1565-1624), first of this name, second son of Simon, was an eminent jurist. He was born in Brandenburg in 1565, and was educated at the universities of Frankfort and Wittenberg and other German schools. He returned home in 1590, and was soon after nominated assessor in law. In 1595 he was appointed professor of law at Wittenberg, whence he removed in 1602 to the court of Sophia, electress of Saxony, at Colditz, who named him her chancellor. After some years he returned to Wittenberg, and died there, November 26, 1624, leaving five sons. He published a collection of writings entitled Disputationes juridicoe. Benedict Carpzov (1595-1666), second of the name, was the second son of the preceding, and like him was a great lawyer. He was born at Wittenberg in 1595, was at first a professor at Leipsic, obtained an honourable post at Dresden in 1639, became Ordinary of the Faculty of Jurists at Leipsic in 1645, and was named privy councillor at Dresden in 1653. Among his works, which had a very extensive influence on the administration of justice, even beyond the limits of Saxony, are,— Definitiones forenses (1638), P radica nova rerum criminalium (1635), Opus decisionum illustrium Saxonioe (1646), Processus juris Saxonici (1657), &c. His last years were spent at Leipsic, and his time was entirely devoted to sacred studies. He read the Bible through fifty-three times, studying also the comments of Osiander and Cramer, and making voluminous notes. These have been allowed to remain in manuscript. He died at Leipsic, August 30, 1666.

August Carpzov (1612-1683), fourth son of the first Benedict, distinguished himself as a diplomatist. Born at Colditz in 1612, engaged first as advocate of the court at Wittenberg, he was appointed in 1657 chancellor and president of the Consistory at Coburg, and from 1675 till his death was privy councillor at Gotha. He took part in negotiating the treaties of Osnaburg and Nuremberg. Like his brother he was a man of earnest piety, and published several devotional works. He died at Coburg, November 19, 1683.

Johann Benedict Carpzov (1607-1657), fifth son of the first Benedict, was born at Rochlitz in 1607, became professor of theology at Leipsic, made himself known by a Systema Theologicum, in two volumes, and died at Leipsic, October 22, 1657, leaving five sons, all of whom attained 7 7 0 e some literary eminence.

Johann Gottlob Carpzov (1679—1767), grandson of the preceding, was born at Dresden in 1679. He was educated at Wittenberg, Leipsic, and Altdorf, became a learned theologian, and in 1719 was called to the chair of Oriental languages at Leipsic. In 1730 he was appointed superintendent and first pastor at Lübeck. His most important works were the Introductio in libros canonicos bibliorum Veteris Testamenti, and Critica sacra F. T. He died at Lübeck, April 7, 1767.

Johann Benedict Carpzov (1720-1803), grandson of the first Johann Benedict, was a distinguished classical scholar. He was born at Leipsic in 1720, became professor of philosophy there in 1747, and in the following year removed to Helmstadt as professor of poetry and Greek. In 1749 he was named also professor of theology. He was author of various philological works, wrote a dissertation on Mencius, and published an edition of Musaeus. He died April 28, 1803.
