CARAVAGGIO, Michelangelo Amerighi (or Merigi) da (1569-1609), a celebrated painter, born in the village of Caravaggio, in Lombardy, from which he received his name. He was originally a masonâ€™s labourer, but bis powerful genius directed him to painting, at which he worked with immitigable energy and amazing force. He despised every sort of idealism whether noble or emasculate, became the head of the Naturalist! (unmodified imitators of ordinary nature) in painting, and adopted a style of potent contrasts of light and shadow, laid on with a sort of fury, emblematic of that fierce temper which led the artist to commit a [9:5:83] homicide in a gambling quarrel at Rome. To avoid the consequences of his crime he fled to Naples and to Malta, where he was imprisoned for another attempt to avenge a quarrel. Escaping to Sicily, he was attacked by a party sent in pursuit of him, and severely wounded. Being pardoned, he set out for Rome; but having been arrested by mistake before his arrival, and afterwards released, and left to shift for himself in excessive heat, and still suffering from wounds and hardships, he expired of fever on the beach at Pontercole in 1609. His best pictures are the Entombment cf Christ, now in the Vatican; St Sebastian, in the Roman Capitol; a magnificent whole length portrait of a grand-master of the Knights of Malta, Alof de Vignacourt, and his page, in the Louvre; and the Supper at Emmaus, in the Borghese Palace.
