CHESTERFIELD, a municipal borough and markettown of England, in East Derbyshire, 12 miles south of Sheffield by the Midland Railway. It is situated on the Rother and Hipper, and is the terminus of a canal extending a distance of 46 miles to the Trent at Stockwith. It is irregularly built, with narrow streets, but has a spacious market-place. The church of All-Saints is a large and elegant edifice of the 13th century, with a remarkable twisted spire 230 feet high, which has given rise to considerable discussion as to whether it was so constructed or owes its deformity to the warping of the woodwork. There are eight or nine dissenting churches, a free grammar school, founded by Queen Elizabeth, and rebuilt in 1710 and 1845, a girls’ industrial school established in 1819, and various other educational institutions, a municipal hall erected in 1849, a market-hall (which dates from 1855-7 and contains a corn-exchange), a town-library, a mechanics’ institute, a prison, assembly rooms, a hospital, a theatre, and an institute of mining, civil, and mechanical engineers. The manufactures include cotton, silk, earthenware, machinery, and tobacco; and there are coal, iron, and lead mines in the vicinity. Races are held on Whittington Common, about a mile from the town, in the neighbourhood of the famous Revolution House. The population of the municipal borough in 1861 was 9836, and in 1871 it was 11,427. Chesterfield was a Roman station on the road from Derby to York, and its name is partly of Roman origin. At the time of the Conquest it was of but little importance, but in the reign of King John it received a charter of incorporation. In the year 1266 the rebellious barons were defeated in the neighbourhood by Henry, the nephew of Henry III. In 1642 the town was occupied by the forces of Sir John Gell, and in 1643 by Sir Thomas Fairfax.
