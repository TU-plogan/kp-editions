CAVORE, or Cavour, a town of Italy in the province of Turin, 25 miles south-west of the city of that name. It carries on silk-spinning and linen-weaving, as well as a trade in grain. In 1433 it was bestowed by Amadeus VIII. of Savoy on the lords of Raconis, and in the 16th and 17th centuries it appears from time to time in the various wars and revolutions. In more recent days it has given its name to the great statesman of Italy whose family were raised to the marquisate of Cavour in the middle of the last century. An earthquake did considerable damage to the town in 1808. Population, 7380.
