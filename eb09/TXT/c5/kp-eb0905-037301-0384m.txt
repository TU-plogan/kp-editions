CHALMERS, Alexander (1759-1834), was born in Aberdeen. He was educated as a doctor, but gave up this profession for literature. His first productions were contributions to London periodicals, and he was for some time editor of the Morning Herald. Besides editions of the works of Shakespeare, Beattie, Fielding, Johnson, Warton, Pope, Gibbon, Bolingbroke, and others, he published A General Biographical Dictionary in 32 vols. (1812-1817); a Glossary to Shakspeare ; an edition of Shakspeare; and the British Essayists, commencing with the Tatler and ending with the Observer, with biographical and historical prefaces and a general index.
