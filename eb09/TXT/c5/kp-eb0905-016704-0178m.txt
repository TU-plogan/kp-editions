CARVAHAL, TomasJosé Gonsalez (1753-1834), a Spanish poet and statesman, was born at Seville in 1753. He studied at the University of Seville, and took the degree of LL.D. at Madrid. He obtained an office in the financial department of the Government; and, in 1795 was made intendant of the colonies which had just been founded in Sierra Morena and Andalusia. During 1809- 1811, he held an intendancy in the patriot army. He became, in 1812, director of the University of San Isidro; but, having offended the Government by establishing a chair of international law he was imprisoned for five years (1815-1820). The revolution of 1820 reinstated him, but the counter-revolution of three years later forced him ∙ into exile. After four years he was allowed to return, and he died, in 1834, a member of the Supreme Council of War. Carvahal enjoyed European fame as author of metrical translations of the poetical books of the Bible. To fit himself for this work he commenced the study of Hebrew at the age of fifty-four. He also wrote other works in verse and prose, avowedly taking Luis de Leon as his model.
