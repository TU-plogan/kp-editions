CLAPAREDE, Jean Louis René Antoine Édouard, (1832-1870), an eminent naturalist, was born at Geneva, April 24, 1832, and belonged to an ancient family of that city. His father was pastor of the parish of Chancy, and Edouard’s early years were spent in that village. After a distinguished course at the classical college, the gymnasium, and the academy of his native city, he repaired in 1852 to the university of Berlin, and there devoted himself with self-sacrificing ardour to the study of medicine and the natural sciences and the acquisition of the Germanic languages of Northern Europe. The direction of his investigations was greatly affected by J. Müller and Ehrenberg, the former of whom was at that period engaged in his important researches about the Echinoderms. In 1855 he accompanied Müller to Norway, and there spent two months on a desolate reef that he might obtain satisfactory observations. The latter part of his stay at Berlin he devoted, along with Lachmann, to the study of the Infusoria and Rhizopods; and their united labours resulted in an important publication which at once gave them rank among the chief zoologists of the day. In 1857 he obtained the degree of doctor, and soon after he was chosen professor of comparative anatomy in the academy of Geneva. Here he continued to teach with ever growing acceptance; and he even became a favourite of the general public through his popular lectures. In 1859 he visited England, and, in company with Dr Carpenter, took a voyage to the Hebrides; and in 1863 he spent some months in the Bay of Biscay. On the appearance of Darwin’s work on the Origin of Species, he adopted his theories and published a valuable series of articles on the subject in the Revue Germanique, 1861. His enormous activity might seem to indicate vigorous health; but he was a martyr from the year 1854 to a painful affection of the heart, which caused excessive palpitations, frequently accompanied by spitting of blood. During 1865 and 1866 he was quite incapable of work, and he determined to pass the winter of 1866-7 in Naples. The change of climate produced some amelioration, and the patient’s indomitable energy was attested by two elaborate volumes on the Annelidae of the Gulf. He again visited Naples with advantage in 1868; but in 1870, instead of recovering as before, he grew worse, dropsy set in, and on the 31st of May he died at Siena on his way home. Modest and retiring, he was at the same time generous, hospitable, and helpful; and in spite of his physical weakness, he displayed remarkable spirit in the political disturbances of Geneva. A certain bluntness of expression sometimes made him fail of courtesy in debate, and he could be pitilessly severe in his criticism where he thought severity was deserved; but he was at the same time strikingly free from uncharitableness, jealousy, or resentment. His library was bequeathed to his native city. See the notice of his life by Henri de Saussure in the 42d vol. of the Archives des Sciences physiques et naturelles (Bibliothèque Univ, et Revue Suisse), Geneve, 1871.

Besides the works already mentioned his chief contributions to science are :—“Ueber Actinophrys Eichhornii,” in Müller’s Arch, für Anatomie, 1855; “Sur la théorie de la formation de l’Oeuf,” in Arch, des Sei., 1855; “Anatomie undEntwickelungs geschichteder Neritina fluviatilis,” in Müllers Arch., 1857; various papers in regard to binocular vision in the Arch, des Sei. , 1858 and 1859; “Zur Morphologie der Zusammengesetzten Augen bei den Arthropoden” in Zeitsch. für ĬVissensch. Zooil., 1860; Recherches anai. sur les Oligochètes, Gen., 1862; Rech, sur l’évolution des Araignées, 1862, which obtained the gold medal of the Utrecht Society of Arts and Sciences; Beobacht, über Anat. und Entιdckelungsgesch. Wirbelloser Thiere an der Küste der Normandie, 1863; “De la myopie,” in Arch, des Sci., 1868; “Studien an Akariden,” in Zcitsch. für Wiss. Zool., 1868; and “Histologische Untersuch, über den Regenwurm (Lumbricus terrestris)” in do., 1868. He left in MSS. Recherches sur la structure des Annelides sédentaires.
