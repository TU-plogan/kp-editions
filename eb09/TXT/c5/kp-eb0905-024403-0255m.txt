CATTI, or Chatti, a powerful and warlike German nation, who, though defeated by Drusus, Germanicus, and other Roman generals, were never wholly subjugated, till in the 4th century they disappeared among the Franks. They inhabited a district extending from the Weser on the E. to the Rhine on the W., and bounded on the S. by the Agri Decumates. They thus occupied about the same position as the modern Hesse—though their territory was more extensive, and included also part of North-Western Bavaria, —and the name Hesse is probably the same as Chatti. They lived in a communistic society, but possessed several towns, of which the chief was Mattium, now Maden.
