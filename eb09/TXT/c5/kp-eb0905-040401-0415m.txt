CHARLEMAGNE, Jean Armand (1759-1838), a French dramatic author, was born at Bourget in 1759. He was intended for the church, but only remained a few months at the theological seminary. He first became a solicitor’s clerk, and then entered the army, and served in the American war of independence. At the age of twenty-four he returned to France, and commenced publishing tracts on social subjects, but it was ten years later before he began to write for the stage. He is the author of a large number of comedies and poems and romances, and of an essay, published in 1794, and entitled Observations de. quelques patriotes sur la nécessité de conserver les monuments de la littérature et des arts.
