CARRIER, Jean Baptiste (1756-1794:), French Revolutionist, one of the actors most infamous for cruelty in the “Reign of Terror,” was born at Yolai, a village near Aurillac in Upper Auvergne, in 1756. At the beginning of the Revolution (1789), he was merely an obscure attorney; and in 1792, with many others of the same class, he was chosen deputy to the National Convention. He was already known as one of the influential members of the Cordeliers Club, which with the Jacobins supported Robespierre. After the subjugation of Flanders he was one of the commissioners nominated in the close of 1792 by the Convention, and sent into that country to carry out a general spoliation of the inhabitants, which was called “organizing the progress of liberty.” In the following year he took part in establishing the revolutionary tribunal, and said openly that for the prosperity of the republic at least half of its population must be “suppressed.” He voted for the death of Louis XVI., was one of the first to call for the arrest of the duke of Orleans, and took a prominent part in the revolution of May 31 (overthrow of the Girondists). After a mission into Normandy, Carrier was sent, early in October 1793, to Nantes, under orders from the Convention to suppress the revolt which was raging there, by the most severe measures. Nothing loath, he established a revolutionary tribunal, and formed a body of desperate men, called the Legion of Marat, for the purpose of destroying in the swiftest way the masses of prisoners heaped together in the jails. The form of trial was soon discontinued, and the victims were sent to the guillotine or shot or cut down in the prisons en masse. He also had large numbers of prisoners put on board a vessel with a trap door in its bottom, and sunk in the Loire by night. This process, first of the noyades of Nantes, called by its inventor “republican baptism,” was twenty-five times repeated, so that the river became polluted with corpses, and a decree was issued, prohibiting the drinking of its water; and even in this wholesale slaughter of men, women, and little children, there were special aggravations. Such was the terror inspired by these deeds that for some time no one dared to denounce the perpetrator, who, in his reports to the Committee of Public Safety, deliberately lied. At length the horrible truth became known, and Carrier was recalled. He was now the object of general execration; and although, in consequence of the fall of Robespierre (9th Thermidor), he had a short respite, he was in November 1794 tried before the revolutionary tribunal. The proceedings lasted nearly a month, and on the 16th December, having vainly pleaded the orders of the Convention in his defence, he was condemned to death and executed.
