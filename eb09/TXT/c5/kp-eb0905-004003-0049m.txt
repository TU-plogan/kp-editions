CAPE BRETON, an island of British America, to the north-east of Nova Scotia, from which it is separated by a strait about fifteen miles long and a mile wide, known as the Gut of Canceau or Canso. It lies between 45° 27' and 47 β 3' N. lat., and between 59° 47' and 61° 32' W. long.; its length from north to south is about 110 miles, its width about 87 miles, and its area 2,650,000 acres. Except on the north-west, the coast is much broken; and the island is nearly divided into two by the large irregular lakes of Bras d’Òr, which communicate with the sea by two channels on the north-east. The most important bays are Aspee, St Anne’s, Sydney, Mira, Louisbourg, Gabarus, St Peter’s, and Mabou; and the principal rivers are the Denys, the Margarie, the Baddeck, the Wagamatcook, the Mabou, and the Grand. There are several fresh-water lakes, of which Lake Ainslie in the west is the most extensive. The surface of the island is broken in several places by ranges of hills of moderate elevation, and the northern promontory consists of a plateau, which in some parts has a height above the sea of 1200 feet. The prevailing rocks belong to the carboniferous formations, interrupted here and there by igneous or metamorphic upheavals. About the half of the surface is said to be capable of cultivation; but in 1861 there were only 198,550 acres cleared and under tillage. In winter the thermometer sometimes falls to 32° and generally to 20° below zero; while in summer it rises to 96° in the shade, and the mean temperature is about 60°. The commercial resources of the island consist chiefly in its timber, its agricultural productions, jts minerals, and its fisheries. Nearly covered with forest at the time of its discovery, it still exports pine, oak, beech, maple, birch, and ash. Oats, wheat, turnips, and potatoes are extensively cultivated; horses, cattle and sheep are reared in considerable numbers; and cheese and butter form important items in its produce. Coal, limestone, and gypsum are worked, and excellent iron ore and slate are also to be found. Saltsprings of some value exist in different parts. The coal mines, which are chiefly situated towards the south-east, have been worked from an early period. The Bras d’Or Lakes and the neighbouring seas supply an abundance of salmon, cod, mackerel, herring, shad, and white-fish, and the fisheries employ about 3000 men. The number of schools in 1861 was 212; and in the same year there were 104 churches. The principal sects are the Roman Catholic Church, which had then 33,386 adherents, and the Presbyterians of the Lower Provinces with 19,982. The inhabitants are now mainly of Scottish descent, with a certain proportion of Acadians and Irish. A few hundred Micmac Indians, who are principally employed in making fishbarrels and butter-firkins, are still to be found. By the census of 1871 the total population amounted to 75,483, of whom 5264 were inhabitants of Sydney. In 1861 and 1851 the numbers were respectively 63,083 and 27,580.

Cape Breton was probably discovered by Sebastian Cabot, and its name is understood to have been bestowed in remembrance of Cap Bréton, near Bayonne, by the Basque sailors who early began to frequent the coast. In 1629 James Stewart, fourth Lord Ochiltree, settled a small colony at Baleine, on the east side of the island; but he was soon after taken prisoner with all his party by Captain Daniell of the French Company, who caused a fort to be erected at Great Cibou (now St Anne’s Harbour). By the peace of St Germain in 1632, Cape Breton was formally assigned to France; and in 1654 it formed part of the territory granted by patent to Μ. Denys, who made several small settlements on the island, which, however, had only a very temporary success. When by the treaty of Utrecht (1713) the French were deprived of Nova Scotia and Newfoundland, they were still left in possession of Cape Breton, and their right to erect fortifications for its defence was formally acknowledged. They accordingly transferred the inhabitants of Plaisance in Newfoundland to the settlement of Havr⅞ à l , Anglois, which soon after, under the name of Louisbourg, became not only the capital of Cape Breton (or Ile Royale, as it was then called), but also the most important military post in that district of French America. When war broke out in 1744 between France and England, the New England colonists determined to attack the island; and in the following year they succeeded in capturing Louisbourg. By the treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, the town was restored to France; but in the [9:5:41] war that was declared in 1756, it again yielded to the a^ault of a British force, this time commanded by Admiral Boscawen. On the conclusion of hostilities the island was ceded to England by the treaty of Paris; and on October 7, 1763, it was united by royal proclamation to the government of Nova Scotia. All the troops were withdrawn from Louisbourg in 1768; and when the island was separated from Nova Scotia in 1784, a new capital was founded at the mouth of the Spanish Biver by Governor Desbarres, and received its name Sydney in honour of Lord Sydney (Sir Thomas Townshend), then secretary of state for the colonies. There was immediately a considerable influx of settlers to the island, which received another important accession by the immigration of Scotch Highlanders from 1800 to 1828. In 1820, in spite of strong opposition, it was again annexed to Nova Scotia. It now sends five members to the Canadian House of Commons.
