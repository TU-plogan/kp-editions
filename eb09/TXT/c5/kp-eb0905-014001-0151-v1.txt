CARTAGENA, or Carthagena, a fortified seaport of Spain on the Mediterranean Sea, in the province of Murcia, and 29 miles S. by E. of the town of that name, in 37° 36' N. lat. and l o W. long. The town stands on a hill separated by a little plain from the harbour; towards the N. and E. it communicates with a fertile valley; on the 8. and W. it is hemmed in by high mountains. The harbour, the finest on the eastern coast of Spain, is fringed by four hills; and the island called La Escombrera, the ancient Scombraria, 2£ miles from the narrow entrance, shelters it from the violence of wind and waves. The harbour is heart-shaped and deep, except near its centre, where there is a ledge of rocks only 5 feet under water. On the eastern side is a breakwater 842 yards in length. A tramway leads from the port to the centre of the mining district, a distance of about two leagues. The streets of the town are spacious, but not imposing; and the friability of the stone gives the houses a dilapidated look. The barracks, arsenal, wet and dry docks, marine school, parade, rope-walks, and the fortifications, are all in a neglected condition. The mines near the town are very productive, and thousands of men and beasts are employed in transporting ores of lead, iron, copper, zinc, and sulphur to the coast. In 1871 there were 150 blast-furnaces and 76 smelting furnaces at work. The profits vary according to the prices of English coal and coke. Among other mineral products of Cartagena may be mentioned gypsum, saltpetre, amethysts, and rubies. Barley and wheat are grown in fair quantity, and there are some extensive vineyards and olive yards. Esparto grass (Stipa tenacissima), a species of rush, now much used in paper manufacture, is largely grown in the neighbourhood. It is the spartum, or Spanish broom, of the ancient Romans,—whence their name for Cartagena, Carthago Spartaria. It is still used locally for making shoes, ship’s cables, mats, and a kind of spun cloth. Barilla, earthenware, glass, and silk are also among the manufactures of Cartagena. The former prevalence of fever, the abandonment of the arsenal, and the prosperity of the neighbouring port of Alicante have much affected the trade of the town during this century; the rail-road communication which now exists with Murcia promises, however, to bring about a revival of its commerce. The imports are chiefly coal and coke from Wales and the north of England. The principal exports are esparto grass and metallic ores; 195,000 tons of the latter were shipped in 1872, almost wholly to Great Britain. The British vessels cleared in 1872 were 244, tonnage 113,015. Of foreign vessels 413 were cleared, tonnage 184,933. The sanitary condition of the town is now greatly improved, as the Almajar Marsh, which formerly caused much intermittent fever, has been drained. The drinking-water of Cartagena is not good; house-rent and food, with the exception of*bread-stuffs, are dear; and there are many paupers and mendicants, to whom no public relief is afforded. The population in 1872 was estimated at 26,000, exclusive of the miners and the labourers in the works of the port.

Cartagena was founded about the year 243 b.c. by Hasdrubal,and was called Carthage Nova or New Carthage, to distinguish it from the African city of Carthage. It was conveniently situated opposite to the Carthaginian territory in Africa, and was early noted for its harbour, the best on the neighbouring coast of Spain. I ts silver and gold mines were the source of great wealth both to the Carthaginians and to the Romans. In 210 b.c. this important place, the headquarters and treasure city of the Punic army, was stormed and taken with great slaughter by P. Scipio. The city continued to flourish under the Romans, who made it a colony, with the name Colonia Victrix Julia Nova Carthago. In 425 a.d. it was pillaged and nearly destroyed by the Goths. The modern Cartagena was a bishopric till the year 1219, when the see was removed to Murcia. It was rebuilt by Philip II. of Spain, for the sake of its harbour. In 1706, in the war of the Spanish Succession, it was occupied by Sir John Leake; and in the next year it was retaken by the duke of Berwick. On the 5th November 1823 the town capitulated to the French. In consequence of the insurrection in Spain, Cartagena was in 1844 again the scene of warfare. On the 23d August 1873 it was bombarded by the Spanish fleet under Admiral Lobos; on the 11th October a battle took place off the town, between the ships of the Government and the Intransigentes, and on the 12th January 1874 Cartagena was occupied by the Government troops.
