CAZEMBE is properly the hereditary name of an African chief, whose territory is situated to the south of Lake Moero and the north of Bangweolo, between ll 0 and 9° S. lat. In the end of the last century the authority of the Cazembe was recognized over a very extensive district, but the prestige of the dynasty has greatly diminished, and the present representative does not even rank first among the tributaries of the Muatiyanvo of the Rua or Moluwa kingdom. The country, which has no more distinctive title than the land of the Cazembe, is estimated to have an area of 120,000 square miles and a population of 500,000. It forms a kind of hollow plain, and is richly watered by numerous rivers. Of these the most important is the Luapula, which flows from Bangweolo to Moero, and forms, according to the conjecture of Cameron, one of the head waters of the Congo. The population, consists mainly of two races, the Messiras and the Campolólas,—of whom the former are native and subjugated, and the latter intrusive and dominant. The Campolólas alone are eligible to public offices, and their language is that spoken at court. Considerable attention is paid, throughout the country to agriculture; and millet, maize, manioc, sugarcane, yams, gourds, and bananas are grown. The ass and horse are both totally unknown; sheep are very scarce, but cattle are fairly abundant. Salt is obtained in various places, and forms an important source of wealth. Coarse cotton cloth, earthenware, and iron goods are the chief manufactures; and slaves, ivory, and copper-ore are almost the only exports. The Cazembe has despotic power, and uses it in a most barbarous fashion. He has 600 wives, and his nobles imitate his example according to their means. On his accession every new Cazembe chooses a new site for his residence, and thus the country cannot be said to have a permanent capital. The residence at the time of Dr Livingstone’s journey in 1868 was situated about a mile to the north of the small lake of Mofwe; and the town occupied, with its cassava grounds and cotton fields, about an English square mile, and had a population of about 1000. It is sometimes called Usemba or Lunda, and Magyar heard it mentioned as Tambalameba; but none of these seems to be its native name. In 1796 the Cazembe was visited by Manoel Gaetano Pereira, a Portuguese merchant; and in 1798 a more important journey was undertaken by Dr Francesco Jose Maria de Lacerda, a native of São Paulo in Brazil. He died at Tschungu on the 18th of October, but left behind him a valuable journal. In 1802 Honorato da Costa, superintendent of the Cassange factory, sent two native traders or pombeiros, Pedro João Baptista and Anastacio José, on a visit to the Cazembe; and in 1831 a more extensive mission was despatched by the Portuguese governor of Rios de Sena. It consisted of Major José Monteiro and Antonio Gamitto, with an escort of 20 soldiers and 120 negro slaves as porters; but its reception by the Cazembe was not altogether satisfactory. Another expedition is said to have been undertaken in 1853 by a Mr Freitas; and a few notes of a Moorish traveller are given in the Geographical Journal for 1854. Living⅛tone ’ s visit in 1868 has already been mentioned.
