CHARTISM was a movement for radical reform in English politics, which originated in 1838, reached its culminating point in 1848, and collapsed the same year; it took its name from the “People’s Charter” or “National Charter,” the document in which the scheme of reform was embodied. The Reform Bill of 1832 left a large class of the population, especially the working-men, dissatisfied. Accordingly, in 1838, after an unsuccessful attempt to initiate a scheme of more radical reform in the House of Commons, six of the most advanced members of the House had a consultation [9:5:434] with the deputies of the “Working-men’s Association,” the result being the appearance of the People’s Charter, which embodied in the six following points the programme of their party:—(1) annual parliaments; (2) universal suffrage; (3) vote by ballot; (4) abolition of the property qualification for membership of the House of Commons; (5) payment of members; (6) equal electoral districts. The most influential of the six members of the House who took part in the drawing up of the charter was O’Connell, and the methods adopted for the propagation of their views were those practised by the great agitator with such success. Monster meetings were held, at which seditious language was occasionally spoken, and slight collisions with the military took place. Petitions of enormous size, signed in great part with fictitious names, were presented to Parliament; and a great many newspapers were started, of which the Northern Star, conducted by Feargus O’Connor, the active leader of the movement, had a circulation of 50,000. In 1840 the Chartist movement was still further organized by the inauguration at Manchester of the National Charter Association, which rapidly became powerful, being the head of about 400 sister societies, which are said to have numbered 40,000 members. Some time after, efforts were made towards a coalition with the more moderate radicals, but these failed; and a land scheme was started by O’Connor, which prospered for a few years. In 1844 the fanatical spirit of some of the leaders was only too well illustrated by their attitude towards the Anti-Corn-Law League. O’Connor, especially, entered into a public controversy with Cobden and Bright, in which he was worsted; and he even endeavoured to defeat the purpose of the League. But it was not till 1848, during a season of great suffering among the working classes, and under the influence of the revolution at Paris, that the real strength of the Chartist movement was discovered, and the prevalent discontent became known. Early in March disturbances occurred in Glasgow which required the intervention of the military, while in the manufacturing districts all over the West of Scotland the operatives were ready to rise, in the event of the main movement succeeding. Some agitation, too, took place in Edinburgh and in Manchester, but of a milder nature; in fact, while there was a real and wide-spread discontent, men were indisposed to resort to decided measures. The principal scene of intended Chartist demonstration was London. An enormous gathering of half a million was announced for the 10th April on Kennington Common, from which they were to march on the Houses of Parliament to present a petition signed by nearly six million names, in order by this imposing display of numbers to secure the enactment of the six points. Probably some of the more violent members of the party thought to imitate the Parisian mob by taking power entirely into their own hands. The announcement of the procession excited great alarm, and the most decided measures were taken by the authorities to prevent a rising. The procession was forbidden. The military was called out under the command of the Duke of Wellington, and by him concealed near the bridges and other points where the procession might attempt to force its way. Even the Bank and other public buildings were put in a state of defence, and special constables, to the number, it is said, of 170,000, were enrolled, one of whom was destined shortly after to be the emperor of the French. After all these gigantic preparations on both sides the Chartist demonstration proved to be a very insignificant affair. Instead of half a million, only about 50,000 assembled on Kennington Common, and their leaders, Feargus O’Connor and Ernest Jones, shrank from the responsibility of braving the authorities by conducting the procession to the Houses of Parliament. The monster petition was duly presented, and scrutinized, with the result that the number of signatures was found to have been grossly exaggerated, and that the most unheard of falsification of names had been resorted to. Thereafter the movement specially called Chartism soon died out. The return of national prosperity relieved the working classes of their most pressing grievances; and subseqent legislative changes have in great measure removed the causes that existed for discontent among the classes which mainly supported the charter.
