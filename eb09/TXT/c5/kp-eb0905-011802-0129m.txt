CARNAC, a village of France, in the department oí Morbihan and arrondissement of LOrient, about 9 miles south-west of Auray, which is the nearest railway station. It owes its celebrity to the rude stone monuments in its vicinity, which are among the most extensive and interesting of their kind. The most remarkable consist of long avenues of maenhirs or standing stones; but there is also a great profusion of other erections, such as dolmens and barrows, throughout the whole district. About half a mile to the north of the village is the Menec system, which consists of eleven lines, numbers 942 maenhirs, and extends a distance of 3376 feet. The terminal circle, whose longest diameter is 300 feet, is somewhat difficult to make out, as it is broken by the houses and gardens of a little hamlet. Further to the north-east there is another system at Kermario (Place of the Dead), which consists of 994 stones, many of them of great size—some, for example, 18 feet in height—arranged in ten lines and extending about 4000 feet in length. Still further in the same direction is a third system at Kerlescant (Place of Burning), composed of 266 stones, which are distributed into thirteen lines, terminated by an irregular circle, and altogether extend over a distance of 1000 feet or more. A fourth system at Menec Vihan, due east of the village of Carnac, has 125 stones. The alignment of Kermario points to the dolmen of Kercado (Place of St Cado), where there is also a barrow, explored in 1863; and to the east of Menec stands the great tumulus of Mont St Michel, which measures 317 feet in length and 192 feet in width at the base, and has at present a height of 33 feet. The tumulus, which is crowned with a chapel, was excavated by René Galles in 1862; and the contents of the sepulchral chamber, which include several jade and fibrolite axes, are preserved in the museum at Vannes. About a mile east of the village is a small piece of moorland called the Boceno, from the bocenieu or mounds with which it is covered; and here, in 1874, the explorations of Cleuziou and Miln brought to light what they suppose to be the remains of a Gallo-Roman town. The tradition of Carnac is that there was once a convent of the Templars or Red Knights on the spot; but this it seems is not supported by history. Similar traces were also discovered at Mané Bras, a height about three miles to the east. The rocks of which these various monuments are composed is the ordinary granite of the district, and most of them present a strange appearance from their coating of white lichens. For further details the reader may consult the Prehistoric Times of Sir John Lubbock, who visited Carnac in 1867 along with Dr Hooker; the Guide to the Principal Chambered Barrows and other Prehistoric Monuments in the Islands of the Morbihan, &c. (1875), by W. C. Lukis, who spent considerable portions of seven years in the district; the various publications of René Galles, such as his Fouilles du, Mont Saini Michel en Camae, 1864, and Tumτdus et dolmens de Kercado, 1864; Fouquet ’ s Des monuments celtiques et des ruines romaines dans le Morbihan, 1873; Journal of Anthrop. Soc. of London, 1869, p cxxiii.; Jephson’s Walking Tour in Brittany, 1866; and the Proceedings of the Soc. of Scot. Antiq., 1875.
