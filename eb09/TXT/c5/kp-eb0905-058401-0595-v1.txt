CHER, a central department of France, embracing the eastern part of the ancient province of Berry and part of Bourbonnais, bounded N. by the department of Loire, W. by Loir-et-Cher and Indre, S. by Allier and Creuse, and E. by Nièvre and Loire. It is situated between 46° 18' and 47° 41' N. lat. and between l ’ 50' and 3° 6' E. long., and has an area of 2780 square miles. The surface of the department in general is extremely level, the only elevated districts being on the northern and north-western frontiers, which are skirted by a range of low hills. The principal rivers, besides the Cher and its tributaries, are the Grande Sauldre and Petite Sauldre on the N., but the Loire and Allier, though not falling within the department, drain the eastern districts, and are available for navigation. The Cher itself becomes navigable when it receives the Arnon and Yèvre, and the communications of the province are greatly facilitated by the Canal du Berry, which traverses it in all its length, the lateral canal of the Loire which stretches from Digoin to Briare, and the canal of the Sauldre. Except in the Sologne, a sandy and sterile tract in the north-west, the soil is generally fertile, but varies considerably in different localities. The most productive region is that on the east, which belongs to the valley of the Loire; the central districts are tolerably fertile but marshy, being often flooded by the Cher; while in the south and south-west there is a considerable extent of dry and fertile land. The department contains a comparatively large extent of pasturage, which has given rise to a considerable trade in horses, cattle, sheep, and wool for the northern markets. Among the agricultural productions hemp bolds the first place; but wine, fruits, chestnuts, and truffles are also important articles of traffic. Mines of iron and coal are wrought; and marble, millstones, lithographic stones, manganese, gypsum, porcelain clay, and peat are procured in different parts. The smelting of iron-ore and the manufacture of steel and cutlery are carried on to a considerable extent. The other manufactures are of coarse cloth and canvas, cotton and woollen gauze, porcelain and toys. The department is divided into three arrondissements, cognominal with the chief towns of Bourges, Saint-Amand, and Sancerre, of which the first isthe principal scat of administration. The total population in 1851 was 261,892, and in 1872, 335,392.
