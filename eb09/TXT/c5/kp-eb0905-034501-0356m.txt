CERBERUS (K∈p∕3cpoς), in Greek mythology, the dog which guarded the entrance to Hades, not against incomers, but against whoever might seek to escape. In Hesiod (Theog. 310), he is a many-headed monster with a fearful bark, but usually he was represented with three heads and the body of a dog such as haunted battlefields,— sometimes also with the tail of a snake. The same number of heads occurs in other beings connected with the lower world, as in Hecate “triformis” and Hermes “trikephalos.” The most difficult of the labours imposed on Hercules was to bring Cerberus to the upper world, and in this he was forbidden by Pluto to use any weapons. Of the various suggested derivations of the name perhaps the most satisfactory is that which connects it with eρt∕3oς, the darkness of Hades.
