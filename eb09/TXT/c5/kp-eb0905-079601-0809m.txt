CITTÀ VECCHIA, or CittàNotabile, a fortified city of Malta, situated about six miles west of Valetta, on high ground which affords a view of a large part of the island. It is the seat of a bishop, and contains an episcopal seminary and a handsome modern cathedral, which is said by tradition to occupy the site of the house of the governor Publius, who welcomed the apostle Paul. In the rock beneath the city there are some remarkable catacombs; and a grotto, reputed to have given shelter to the apostle, is pointed out below the church of S. Paolo. About two miles from the town is the residence of the English governor, known as the palace of St Antonio; and at a like distance in another direction is the ancient palace of the grand-masters of the order of St John, with an extensive public garden called Il Bosch etto. Città Vecchia was called Medina, or the City, by the Arabs, and it probably represents the town of Melita, which is mentioned by all the ancient geographers. It continued to be the capital of the island till the rise of Valetta in the 16th century. Population about 7000.
