CLAUDIUS, or Tiberius ClaudiusDrusus Nero Germanicus (10 b.c. —54 a,d.), the first Roman emperor of the name, born at Lugdunum (Lyons), in 10 b.c., was the son of Drusus and Antonia, and grandson of Livia, the wife of Augustus. Paralyzed and lame, and unable to speak with distinctness, he was an object of scorn even to his mother; and the natural diffidence and timidity of his character were increased by neglect and insult, till he was regarded as little better than an imbecile. His time was spent chiefly in the society of servants, and devoted to the industrious pursuit of literature; and until his accession he took no real part in public affairs, though Caligula honoured [9:5:817] him with the dignity of consul. His first wife was Plautia Urgulanilla, whom he divorced because he suspected her of designs against his life; his second, Aelia Petina, was also divorced; and his third was the infamous Valeria Messalina. In 41 a,d., on the murder of Caligula, Claudius was seized by the praetorians, and declared emperor. As soon as he gained resolution to assume the authority of his office, he proclaimed an amnesty for all except Chaerea, the assassin of his predecessor, and one or two others. The account, however, of his painstaking government, his laborious personal administration of justice, his conquest of Britain, his extension of Ûiq jus honorum to the Gauls, his construction of the Claudian aqueduct and the harbour of Ostia, are matters of history (see Roman History). The cruelties of his reign appear to have been due to the facility of character which placed him completely under the influence of his favourite freedmen, of whom the most conspicuous were Narcissus, Pallas, and Polybius, and of his wife, the vicious and shameless Messalina, whom he fondly loved and honoured. At length, according to the account of Tacitus, Messalina went through the ceremony of marriage with one of her lovers, and urged by her former confederate Narcissus, the emperor allowed her to be seized, aud Narcissus put her to death. Suetonius throws a somewhat different light on the story, making it rather more probable, for he tells us that there was a rumour that the emperor desired and assisted in the marriage, because he had been warned by a soothsayer that the husband of Messalina was about to fall into misfortune. The next and fourth wife of Claudius was his niece Agrippina, a woman as criminal as any of her predecessors. She prevailed upon him to set aside his own son Britannicus in favour of Nero, her son by a former marriage; and in 54 a.d., that she might place the act beyond recall, she put the emperor to death by means of poison.

Encouraged by Livy, as Suetonius asserts, and assisted by the freedmen who attended him, Claudius produced a history of Rome, commencing with the battle of Actium (31 b.c.), in 41 books, a defence of Cicero against Asinius Pollio, memoirs of his own life, and, in Greek, a history of Carthage and a history of Etruria; but none of his writings have come down to us. He introduced three new letters into the Latin alphabet—the digamma, the ψ, and another not now known; but they appear to have been dropped at his death.

The principal authority for the life and times of Claudius is the Annals of Tacitus, in whose high-coloured pictures there is much that gives rise to a suspicion of exaggeration. Suetonius and Dion Cassius are even less trustworthy.
