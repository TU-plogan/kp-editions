CIS-SUTLEJ STATES. This term has for many years been obsolete, as inapplicable to modern territorial arrangements. It came into use in 1809, when the Sikh chiefs south of the Sutlej (Satlaj) passed under British protection, and was generally applied to the country south of the Sutlej and north of the Delhi territory, bounded on the E. by the Himálayas, and on the W. by Soisá District. Prior to 1846, the greater part of this territory was independent, the chiefs being subject merely to control from a political officer stationed at Ambálá, and styled the agent of the governor-general for the Cis-Sutlej States. After the first Sikh war the full administration of the territory became vested in the officer already mentioned. In 1849 occurred the annexation of the Punjab, when the Cis-Sutlej States Commissionership, comprising the districts of Ambálá, Ferozpur, Ludhiáná, Thanéswár, and Simla, was incorporated with the new province. The name continued to be applied to this division until 1862, when, owing to Ferozpur having been transferred to the Lahore, and a part of Thanéswár to the Delhi Division, it ceased to be appropriate. Since then, the tract remaining has been known as the Ambálá or Umballa Division. Those of old Cis-Sutlej States which still retain their independence are Gatiálá, Jhino, Nábhá, Maier Kotlá, and Farídkot.
