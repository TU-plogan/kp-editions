CHÂTILLON-SUR-SEINE, a town of France, formerly the capital of the Pays de la Montagne or Country of the Mountain, in Burgundy, and now at the head of an arrondissement in the department of Côte d’Or, is situated about 40 miles south-west of Troyes on the Upper Seine. It is built on both sides of the river, and formerly consisted [9:5:445] of two distinct portions known as Chaumont and Bourg, each with its own fortifications. It is the seat of a court of primary instance, and possesses the ruins of a magnificent castle, a hospital, a town-house, a communal college, a public library, and some fine promenades. The church of St Vorle dates from the 12th century, and contains a number of frescoes included among the historic monuments of France. Marshal Marmont, duke of Ragusa, who was born in the town in 1774, has left a memento in the shape of a handsome chateau. A considerable trade is maintained by Châtillon in timber, wool, leather, and lithographic stones; and it has cloth-factories, paper-mills, foundries, flour-mills, and various other industrial establishments. The origin of the town probably dates from the 5th century. For several centuries it was a favourite residence of the dukes of Burgundy. In modern times it is mainly remarkable for the conference held, in February 1814, between Napoleon and the Allies, in which the former rejected the proposal that he should rule over the France of pre-Revolutionary limits. Population in 1872, 4691.
