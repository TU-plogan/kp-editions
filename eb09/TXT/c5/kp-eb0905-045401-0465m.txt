CHAUDES-AIGUES, an old town of Upper Auvergne in France, in the department of Cantal, 17 miles S.S.W. of St Flour. It is celebrated for its hot mineral springs, which vary in temperature from 135° to 177° Fahr., and at their maximum rank as the hottest in France. The water, which is very slightly alkaline, is employed not only for medical purposes, but also in the washing of fleeces, the incubation of eggs, and various other economic applications; and it furnishes a ready means of heating the houses of the town during winter. In the immediate neighbourhood is the cold chalybeate spring of Condamine. The warm springs were known to the Romans, and are mentioned by Sidonius Apollinaris. The population of the town is about 2000.
