CHAMPÁRAN, a British district in the Behar Province, under the jurisdiction of the Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal, lies between 26° and 28° N. lat., and between 84° and 86° E. long. It is bounded on the N. by the independent state of Nepál; on the E. by the River Bághmatí, which separates it from the district of Tirhut; on the S. by the district of Sáran and the Bará Gandak River; and on the W. by the Oudh district of Gorakhpur. A broad grass-covered road or embankment defines the Nepál frontier, except where rivers or streams form a natural boundary. The district is a vast level except in the north and north-west, where it undulates, and gradually assumes a rugged appearance as it approaches the mountains and forests of Nepál. Wide uncultivated tracts cover its north-western corner; the southern and western parts are carefully cultivated, and teem with an active agricultural population. The principal rivers are the Bará or Great Gandak, navigable all the year round, the Chhotá or Little Gandak, Panch Nadi, Lálbágiá, Kojá, and Teur. Old beds of rivers intersect Champáran in every direction, and one of these forms a chain of lakes which occupy an area of 139 square miles in the centre of the district. Of the total area of Champáran, viz., 3531 square miles, 2350 square miles are cultivated, 433 are grazing lands, and the rest uncultivable waste. The population in 1872 amounted to 1,440,815 persons, living in 2299 villages and 242,228 houses. Of these the Hindus numbered 1,240,264, or 86'1 per cent.; Muhammadans, 199,237, or 13 8 per cent.; Christians, 1307 or 1 per cent.; and persons of unspecified religion, 7. Only two towns contain upwards of 6000 inhabitants (1) Motihári, the headquarters of the district, population 8266; and (2) Bettiah, population 19,708. The principal crops are rice, Indian com, barley, sugar-cane, opium, indigo; the mineral products,—gold, copper, and limestone. Gold is washed, generally in minute particles, but sometimes in nuggets of the size of a pea, in the sandy beds of the rivers flowing from the hills. Indigo, saltpetre, and rope form the only manufactures of the district, the first being chiefly conducted with European capital. The revenue of the district in 1870 was £82,159, of which the land revenue yielded £52,030, or 63 per cent.; the civil expenditure was £20,613. Tn 1872, Champáran had 78 schools under Government inspection, attended by 1222 pupils, costing £293, to which the state contributed £153. Champáran, with the rest of Bengal and Behar, was acquired by the British in 1765. Up to 1866 it remained a subdivision of Sáran. In that year it was separated and formed into a separate district.
