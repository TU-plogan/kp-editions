CHINGLEPUT, the principal town and fortress of a district of the same name, in the presidency of Madras, in British India, on the left bank of the Palar River, 36 miles S.S.W. of Madras in 12° 41' N. lat. and 80° 2 ’ E. long. Chingleput was taken by the French in 1751, and was retaken in 1752 by Clive. During the wars of the British with Hyder Ali, it was one of the few strongholds which withstood his power, and afforded a secure refuge to the natives. In 1780, after the defeat of Colone] Baillie, the army of Sir Hector Munro sought protection under its walls. The town is noted for its manufacture of pottery, and it carries on a trade in rice. Population, 7500.
