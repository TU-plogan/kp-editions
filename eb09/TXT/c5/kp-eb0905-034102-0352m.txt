CENTO, a town of Italy, in the province of Ferrara, 16 miles north by west of Bologna, situated in a fertile plain near the Reno. It is the seat of a bishop, has a cathedral and several fine buildings, and carries on a trade in grain and hemp; but it is chiefly remarkable as the birthplace of the painter Guercino, several of whose works are to be seen in the churches of Â»St Biagio and the Madonna del Rosario.. His house is still preserved, and a statue has been erected to his memory in the middle of the town. Population about 19,000.
