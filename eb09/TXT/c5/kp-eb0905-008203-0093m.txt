CARAMΑΝΙΑ, or Karamania, is a name that has been frequently given by modern geographers to the south coast of Asia Minor, including the whole of the districts between Mount Taurus and the Mediterranean, known in ancient times as Lycia, Pamphylia, and Cilicia. It is in this sense that the term is used by Captain Beaufort, who, by the publication of his work (Karamania : a Description of the South-East Coast of Asia Minor, 8vo, 1816), which contained the first detailed account of the countries in question, did much to perpetuate the usage. But he himself admits that there is no authority for the application of the term in this sense. The only foundation for it was the existence, after the break up of the monarchy of the Seljukian Turks, of an independent Turkish kingdom, comprising a portion of the interior, north of the Taurus, to which for a short time the adjacent maritime provinces were annexed. This state bore the name of Karaman-ili, derived from that of its founder, and after it was finally subdued by the Ottoman Turks in 1486 it still continued to exist as a pashalic or government, the seat of which was fixed at Karaman, a considerable town on the north side of the Taurus, occupying the site of the ancient Laranda. But the pashalic thus named was situated wholly in the interior, north of the great chain of Mount Taurus, and comprised no part of the maritime districts, to which the name of Karamania was applied by European geographers. This erroneous use of the term may be considered as now obsolete, and the name of Karaman is no longer found among the territorial divisions of Turkey. The regions comprised under this appellation as employed by Captain Beaufort and Colonel Leake will be described under the headings Lycia, Pamphylia, and Cilicia.
