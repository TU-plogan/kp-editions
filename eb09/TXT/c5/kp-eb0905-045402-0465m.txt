CHAUMONT, a town of France, the capital of the department of Haute Marne, on an eminence between the Marne and the Suize, 145 miles S.E. of Paris by the railway, which here crosses a fine viaduct. It is the seat of tribunals of primary instance and commerce, is tolerably well built, and has an elegant town-hall, a court-house, a communal college, a hospital, a theatre, a public library, and a botanical garden. A single tower remains of the Castle of Haute Feuille, which belonged to the counts of Champagne -, and there is a triumphal arch erected by Napoleon I. and finished by Louis XVIII. The church of Saint Jean-Baptiste, a building of the 13th century, and the chapel of the old college of the Jesuits, are classed among the historic monuments of France. Coarse woollens, hosiery, and gloves are manufactured in the town; and there is a considerable trade in the iron and iron-wares of the department. The rise of Chaumont into importance dates from 1190, when it received a charter from the counts of Champagne. In the 13th century it became the seat of a provost; and in the 16th it was surrounded with fortifications. It was here that the treaty of 1814 was concluded by which England, Austria, Russia, and Prussia formed an alliance against Napoleon. Population in 1872, 8474.
