CHELSEA, formerly a village about two miles west of London, on the left bank of the Thames, but now an integral part of the great metropolis. It gives its name to a parish and a parliamentary borough, the former with 71,089 inhabitants, and the latter, which includes Fulham, Hammersmith, Kensington, and part of Willesden, with 258,050, at the census of 1871. It is connected with the district of Battersea on the other side of the river by three bridges, known respectively as Battersea, Albert, and Chelsea suspension bridges. Like many of the suburban villages of London, it has an interesting history of its own. In 785 it is mentioned by the name of Cealscythe as the seat of an ecclesiastical synod; and in Domesday Book it appears as Cercehede or Chelched. The name was still written Chelchith in the time of Sir Thomas More, who had a house in the village, but it began to assume the form of Chelsey in the 16th century. The manor was bestowed by Henry VIII. on Catharine Parr, [9:5:458] and it afterwards passed successively into the possession of the duke of Northumberland, Lord Cheyne, and Sir Hans Sloane. It was at Chelsea that Sir John Danvers introduced the Italian style of gardening, which was so greatly admired by Bacon and soon after became prevalent in England; and here in our own day were the gardens of the English botanist William Curtis, arranged according to the Linnean system. During the 18th century the village was the residence of many of the most famous men of the period. Atterbury, Swift, and Arbuthnot lived in Churchlane; Guy, Smollett, and Steele were for a time inmates of Monmouth House; and Count Zinzendorf established a Moravian society at Lindsay House. Sir Robert Walpole’s residence was extant till 1810; and till 1824 the bishops of Winchester had a palace at the end of Cheyne Walk, a fine promenade extending along the river and now fronted by part of the Thames embankment, which has greatly improved its appearance. The house and grounds of the earl of Ranelagh were a favourite resort from 1742 till 1803; and Cremorne, which was built by the earl of Huntingdon, father of Steele’s “Aspasia,” is still a place of popular amusement. The old church and churchyard contain the tombs of Sir Thomas More, Sir Hans Sloane, George Herbert’s mother, Thomas Shadwell, Woodfall the printer of Junius, and other persons of celebrity. Of greater importance than any of the buildings already mentioned is the great Chelsea Hospital for invalid soldiers, built by Sir Christopher Wren (1682-1690), on the site of King James’s College; and to the north of the hospital is the Royal Military Asylum, founded by Frederick Duke of York, for the education of children connected with the army.
