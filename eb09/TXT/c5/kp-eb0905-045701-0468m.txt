CHEKE, Sir John (1514-1557), was born of good family at Cambridge, and was educated at St John’s College. His learning gained him the position of king’s scholar, and in 1540 he was chosen to fill the chair of Greek then instituted by Henry VIII. Together with Sir Thomas Smith he has the honour of being one of the first who revived the knowledge of that language in England. He specially interested himself in its pronunciation; and he finally carried his point, through his popularity with the students, notwithstanding the strenuous opposition of the chancellor, Bishop Gardiner. Among those whom he taught were William Cecil and Roger Ascham, the latter of whom, in his Schoolmaster, gave him the highest praise both for scholarship and character. About 1544 he was appointed tutor to Prince Edward, and on the accession of his pupil to the throne he received several considerable grants, and, among other honours, rose to the position of secretary of state. Unfortunately for himself he followed the duke of Northumberland, and acted as secretary to Lady Jane Grey during her nine days’ nominal reign. In consequence Mary threw him into the Tower, and confiscated his wealth. In September 1554 he obtained his liberty, with leave to travel abroad. He visited Italy, gave lectures on Greek at Padua, and afterwards was forced to support himself by teaching that language at Strasburg. In 1556 he was lured to Brussels by a message that his wife was in that town, and, on his way thither, was seized by order of Philip of Spain, and again brought to the Tower. He was immediately visited by two Catholic priests, who failed to convert him till he was informed that he must recant or be burned. Upon this he yielded, and made two public recantations. He did not long survive his disgrace, and in September 1557 he died in London. Perhaps the most interesting of Cheke’s works is the Hurt of Sedition (1549), which gives advice to the people who had risen in rebellion under Ket. To seek equality, he argues, is to make all poor; and, besides, “riches and inheritance be God’s providence, and given to whom of His wisdom He thinketh good.” He also wrote Latin translations of some of St Chrysostom’s homilies ; De Obitu Martini Buceri (1551); De Pronunciations Groecoe Linguae, 1555); De Superstitione, presented to King Henry VIII.; translation of Leo De Apparatu Bellico ; Carmen Heroicum, aut Fpitaphium in Antonium Deneium.
