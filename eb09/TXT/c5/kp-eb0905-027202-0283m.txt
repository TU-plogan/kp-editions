CAVENDISH, Thomas (1560-1592), the third circumnavigator of the globe, was born at Trimley St Mary, in Suffolk, in 1560. For a short time he studied at Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, but quitting the university without a degree, he followed the court, and in a few years squandered away nearly all his inheritance. Turning his attention to maritime adventure with a view to repairing his fortune, he fitted out a ship in which he accompanied the expedition sent to Virginia in 1585 under the command of Sir Richard Grenville. On his return he resolved upon a predatory expedition against the Spaniards in the New World. Accordingly, on July 21, 1586, he sailed from Plymouth with three small vessels, passed through the Straits of Magellan, cruised along the coasts of Chili, Peru, and Mexico, and burnt and sunk nineteen ships, including the “Santa Anna,” a vessel belonging to the king of Spain, with a cargo of immense value, which he captured off the coast of California. Returning home with his plunder by the Cape of Good Hope he reached Plymouth, [9:5:273] September 9, 1588, having circumnavigated the globe in two years and fifty days. It is said that his sailors were clothed in silk, his sails were damask, and his topmast covered with cloth of gold. His hastily-acquired riches did not last long, for in 1591 he had reduced himself to the necessity of undertaking another expedition with five vessels. This voyage was a most disastrous one. His crews were mutinous, and after leaving the Straits of Magellan they obliged him to steer for England. At this he became dispirited, and died of grief on the homeward voyage in 1592. The only geographical discovery of any importance which can be attributed to Cavendish is that of the harbour named by him Port Desire, on the east coast of Patagonia.
