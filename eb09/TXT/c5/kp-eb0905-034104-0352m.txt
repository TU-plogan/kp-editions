CENTORBI, or Centuripe, the ancient Centuripa, a town of Sicily, on a rugged mountain, in the province of Catania, and 20 miles W.N.W. of the city of that name. At a very early period Centuripa was an important town of the Siculi; and through various vicissitudes it succeeded in maintaining its independence until the first Punic war, when it was besieged by the consuls Otacilius and Valerius Messala. In the time of Cicero it was one of the most flourishing places in the island, and had a population of about 10,000. In 1233 it was destroyed by Frederick II. Extensive remains of the ancient city still exist. The new town has a population of upwards of 7000.
