CASSIS, a small seaport-town of France, in the department of Bouches-du-Rhône, stands in a narrow valley on the Mediterranean, 10 miles south-east of Marseilles. Its harbour is small, but it has some building yards, and a considerable trade in fruits and muscatel wine. The lighthouse is situated in42° 12' 50" N. lat. and 5° 31' 54" E. long. The town is supposed by D’Anville to occupy the site of the Roman Carsicis Portus. It was destroyed by the Lombards in 573, but rebuilt in its present situation in the 13th century. The Abbé Barthélemy was born here in 1716. Population in 1872, 2976.
