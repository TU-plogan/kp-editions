CHAPELAIN, Jean (1595-1674), a French poet and man of letters, was the son of a notary, and was born in Paris. His father destined him for his own profession; but his mother, who had known Ronsard (she was the daughter of a certain Michel Corbière, an intimate friend of the great poet), had determined otherwise. At an early age Chapelain began to qualify himself for literature, acquiring by his own unaided efforts, not only Greek and Latin, but also Italian and Spanish, and even applying himself to medicine. Having finished his studies, he was engaged for a while in teaching Spanish to a young nobleman. He was then appointed tutor to the two sons of a Μ. de la Trousse, grand provost of France. Attached for the next seventeen years to the family of this gentleman, the administration of whose fortune was wholly in his hands, he seems to have published nothing during this period, yet to have acquired a great reputation as a probability. His first work given to the public was a preface for the Adons of Marini, who printed and published that notorious poem at Paris. This was followed by an excellent translation of Mateo Aleman’s novel, Guzman de Alfarache, and by four extremely indifferent odes, one of them addressed to the great Richelieu, whom Chapelain had the honour of grounding in the dramatic unities. Rewarded with a pension of a thousand crowns, and appointed from the first a member of the newly-constituted Academy, Chapelain drew up the plan of the grammar and dictionary, the compilation of which was to be a principal function of the young institution, and at Richelieu’s command prepared a criticism of the Cid. In 1756 he published, in a magnificent form, the first twelve cantos of his celebrated epic La Fuselle, on which he had been engaged during twenty years. His reputation at this time was so great that six editions of the poem were disposed of in eighteen months. But this was the end of Chapelain, “the legist of Parnassus.” The epigrams of Montdor and Furetière, the slashing satire of Boileau (in this case fairly master of his subject), had done their work, and Chapelain (“le plus grand poète· Français qu’ait jamais été et du plus solide jugement,” as he is called in Colbert’s list) had taken his place among the failures of modern art. The last twelve cantos of La Pusells never published. A complete manuscript of it exists, with corrections and a preface in the author’s autograph, in the Bibliothèque Nationale; but its readers, it may be presumed, are few.

In 1662 Chapelain was employed by Colbert to draw up an account of contemporary men of letters, destined to guide the king in his distribution of pensions. In this pamphlet, as in the extracts from his letters published by Camusat in 1726 (Mélanges de Littérature tirés des Lettres manuscrites de Chapelain), he shows to far greater advantage than in his unfortunate epic. His prose is said to be incomparably better than his verse; his criticisms are remarkable for their justice and generosity; his erudition and kindliness of heart are everywhere apparent; the royal attention is directed alike towards the author’s firmest friends and bitterest enemies. The man, indeed, appears to have been as excellent as the poet was worthless. He does not seem to have known jealousy; Corneille was the object of his warmest praises; and to him the young Racine was indebted not only for kindly and seasonable counsel, but also for that pension of six hundred livres which was so useful to him. Moving in the best society, polite and literary, and loaded with honours and pensions, in his old age Chapelain is reported to have become a miser of the most sordid type, the clothes he wore being so patched and clouted as to procure for him the nickname of the Chevalier de 1’Araignée; while Ménage relates that, calling upon the old man after a long estrangement, he found on the hearth the same cinders that he had remarked thereon twelve years before. His avarice, moreover, is said to have been indirectly the cause of his death, which happened in his seventy-ninth year. Some 50,000 crowns, a large fortune for those days, were found in his apartments.

As a poet, Chapelain seems to occupy on the French side of Parnassus a place analogous to that one filled on the English side by Sir Richard Blackmore. La Pucelle is an enormous allegorical nightmare, towards a correct appreciation of which the satire of Boileau is said to be the best guide. As a prose-writer and critic, Chapelain seems to have had real merit; in a passage of his, concerning the legendary epic of the Middle Ages, quoted by Sainte-Beuve (who calls him “homme instruit, sinon poète ”), he would appear to have anticipated much of what modern criticism has had to say on the subject.
