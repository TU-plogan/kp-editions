CATALONIA (in Spanish, Cataluña), an old province of Spain and principality of the crown of Aragon, triangular in shape, and forming the north-east corner of the peninsula, lies between 40° 30' and 42° 51' N. lat., and 0’ 15' and 3° 2Γ E. long., and is bounded on the N. by the Pyrenees, W. by Aragon, S. by Valencia, E. by the Mediterranean. The greatest breadth is 130 miles, the greatest length 185 miles; area, 12,483 square miles. The coast, which is partly sandy, partly rocky, extends about 240 miles; the harbours are mostly unprotected from the wind. The surface is much broken by spurs of the Pyrenees, the direction of which is generally south. Running south-west to north-east, and united on the north with one of the offsets of the Pyrenees, is the range of the Sierra Llena, which bisects the province, and forms its central watershed. The principal rivers are the Ter, the Llobregat, and the Ebro, which all run into the Mediterranean. None of them is navigable. The climate, in spite of frequent mists and rains, sudden changes of temperature, and occasional great mid-day heat, is healthy and favourable to vegetation. The soil is light and loamy. Amongst the rocks of the province maybe mentioned granite, chiastolite schists, porphyry and lava. Near Olot, towards the northeast, is a district containing extinct volcanoes. Oolitic limestone is found in the neighbourhood of Figueras; and in other localities, nummulitic and Miocene deposits are represented. Mining is not much prosecuted; but copper, zinc, manganese, marble, sulphur, and coal are worked, and rock salt in abundance is procured from Cardona. The vegetation of Catalonia varies according to the altitude and nature of different regions. The dwarf-palm, orange, lime, and olive grow in the warmer tracts; and on the higher grounds the thorn-apple, pomegranate, myrtle, esparto, and heaths flourish. There is much woodland, "but meadows and pastures are rare. Maize, millet, rye, flax, liquorice, and fruits of all sorts—especially nuts, almonds, oranges, figs, walnuts, and chestnuts—are produced. "Wheat sufficient for one-fourth of the population is grown, and the vine is extensively cultivated. Few cattle, but numbers of sheep, goats, and swine are reared. Game is plentiful, and thö fisheries on the coast are excellent. The exports are chiefly fruits, cork, and wines. The wines are for the most part rough and strong, though some are very good, especially when matured. They are much used to adulterate those of Oporto, or, after undergoing the operation termed compage, are passed off as Bordeaux wines in France. The best of them, “ prior ato" is chiefly known in England under the disguise of second or third-rate port; it was much used in the military hospitals of America during the Civil War. The imports are chiefly textiles, coal, coke, machinery of all kinds, and salt-fish. The value of imports in 1870 was £5,996,143; of the exports, £2,884,306; the loss of the balance of £3,111,837 against Catalonia being partly borne by the other provinces of Spain, and to a great extent paid in wines, fruits, and corks. The value of exports to the Spanish American colonies in 1873 exceeded £2,220,000. The manufactures of Catalonia are cotton, silk, woollen goods, brandy, paper, cordage, and firearms. The Catalonians are a frugal, sharp-witted, and industrious people, having much national pride, and a strong revolutionary spirit. They are distinct in origin from the other inhabitants of Spain, from whom they differ both in their dialect and costume and in their great energy and their love of enterprize. Irrigation, careful husbandry, and railroad communication have much developed the resources of their country, in themselves excellent; and there are many manufacturing towns and industrial establishments. Catalonia is divided into the provinces Gerona, Barcelona, Tarragona, and Lerida. Its chief towns are the ports of Rosas, Mataro, Tarragona, and the capital Barcelona; and Tortosa, Gerona, Figueras, Lerida, and Manresa. The population, in 1867. was 1,744,520.

Catalonia was one of the first of the Roman possessions in Spain, and formed the north-eastern portion of Hispania Tarraconensis. About 470 it was occupied by the Alans and Goths, and thus came to be called Gothalanιa, whence the modern name of the province. It was taken possession of by the Berbers in 712, who were in turn dispossessed by the Spaniards and the troops of Charlemagne in 788, and was after that ruled by French counts, who soon, however, made themselves independent of France. By the marriage of Count Raymond Berenger of Barcelona with Petronilla of Aragon, in 1137, Catalonia became annexed to the latter province; but this union was frequently severed. In 1640, when Philip IV. attempted to deprive Catalonia of its rights and privileges, it gave itself up to Louis XIII. of France. It was restored to Spain in 1659, and was once more occupied by the French from 1694 to 1697. _ Under Philip V. Catalonia, in 1714, was deprived of its Cortes and liberties. From 1808 to 1813 it was held by France. It was the scene of civil war in 1823, and of important revolutionary operations in the Carlist war.
