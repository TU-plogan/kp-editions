CARTER, Elizabeth (1717-1806), a celebrated lady scholar, and translator of the works of Epictetus, was the daughter of the Rev. Dr Carter of Deal in Kent, and was born in that town, December 16, 1717. Her mother, Margaret Swayne of Bere, in Dorset, lost her fortune by investing it in the South Sea Stocks, and died of a decline when Elizabeth was about ten years old. Dr Carter educated his children, boys and girls alike; but Elizabeth’s slowness of apprehension tired out his patience, and it was only by great perseverance that she conquered her natural incapacity for learning. She studied late at night and early in the morning, taking snuff and chewing green tea to keep herself awake; and she so injured her health by this that she suffered throughout her life from severe headaches. Miss Carter learned Greek and Latin from her father, and was specially proficient in Greek, so that Dr Johnson said concerning a celebrated scholar, that he “understood Greek better than any one whom he had ever known except Elizabeth Carter.” She learned also Hebrew, French, German, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, and lastly some Arabic. She studied astronomy, ancient geography, and ancient and modern history. In 1734 some of her verses appeared in the Gentleman's Magazine under the signature “Eliza,” Carr the editor being a friend of her father. In 1738 she published a small collection of poems, and next year she translated from the French an attack on Pope’s Essay on Man by Μ. Crousaz. In 1739 appeared her translation from the Italian of Algarotti’s Newtonian-isrno per le Dame, calling it Sir Isaac Newton’s Philosophy explained for the use of the Ladies, in six Dialogues on Light and Colours. Her translation of Epictetus was undertaken in 1749 to please her friends Dr Seeker (afterwards archbishop of Canterbury) and Miss Talbot, to whom the translation was sent, sheet by sheet, as it was done. This work was published by guinea subscription in 1758. In 1762 Miss Carter printed a second collection of poems. Dr Carter, from 1762 to his death in 1774, lived with his daughter in a house at Deal, which she had purchased. Her literary earnings were augmented by an annuity settled on her in 1761 by Sir William Pulteney and his wife, who had inherited the fortune of her old friend Lord Bath; and she had another annuity from Mrs Montagu after that lady had become a widow. Among Miss Carter’s friends and correspondents may be mentioned—Johnson (whom she came to know through Cave the bookseller in 1737, and who printed one or two of her papers in the Rambler), Bishop Butler, Savage, Horace Walpole, Richardson, Reynolds, Burke, Mrs Montagu, Hannah More, and Mrs Vesey, the hostess of the Bas-Bleus. Miss Carter never married, and lived to the age of eighty-nine. She died in Clarges Street, Piccadilly, 1806; and her nephew, the Rev. Montagu Pennington, published her Memoirs in 1808.
