CHAUVIN, Étienne (1640-1725), a celebrated minister of the Reformed religion, was born at Nîmes. At the revocation of the Edict of Nantes he retired to Rotterdam; and in 1695 the elector of Brandenburg appointed him professor of philosophy at Berlin, where be enjoyed considerable reputation as a representative of Cartesianism, and as a student of physics. His principal work is a laborious Lexicon Rationale, sive Thesaurus Philosophicus, which he published at Rotterdam in 1692, and of which a new and enlarged edition was printed at Leeuwarden in 1703. He also wrote Theses de Cognitione Dei, and started the Nouveau Journal des Savants (1694-98). - Chauvin died in 1725.
