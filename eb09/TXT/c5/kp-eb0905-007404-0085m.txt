CAPO Dâ€™ISTRIA, John, Count (1780-1831), was born at Corfu, where his father was a physician, in 1780. At first he devoted himself to the study of medicine in the academies of Padua and Venice, but joined the Russian diplomatic service when at the treaty of Tilsit the Ionian Islands were ceded to the French. He held the office of secretary for foreign affairs under the Emperor Alexander, and was president of the Greek republic after the battle of Navarino. Having been suspected of treachery to the republican cause, he was assassinated when entering a church at Nauplia, October 9, 1831. See Greece.
