CATSKILL or KAATSKIL MOUNTAINS, a group of moderate elevation belonging to the great Appalachian system of North America. They are situated for the most part in Greene County, New York, and are mainly remarkable for the beauty of their scenery and the magnificence of the outlook over the neighbouring country. The principal summits are Round Top, High Peak, and Overlook, which attain a height of nearly 4000 feet. To the north of High Peak is situated the celebrated gorge or “clove” of Catterskill, with its waterfall. The cascades are three in number, and the total height is about 300 feet; but the supply of water is often deficient, and has even to be managed by the hotel proprietors. The place can easily be reached from Mountain House, an hotel which is built at an elevation of 2500 feet, on the front of Pine Orchard Mountain, about 12 miles from the town of Catskill. Another hotel has more recently been erected on the summit of Overlook, at a height of 3800 feet.
