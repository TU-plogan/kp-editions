CAVENDISH, Sir William, the second son of Thomas Cavendish of Cavendish in Suffolk, clerk of the pipe in the reign of Henry VIII., was born about the year 1505. Having received a liberal education, he was taken into the family of Cardinal Wolsey, whom he served in the capacity of gentleman-usher of the chamber. Cavendish was with Wolsey when he died, and delayed going to court till he had seen his remains decently interred. The king was so far from disapproving of his conduct that he immediately took him into his household, made him treasurer of his chamber and a privy-councillor, and afterwards conferred on him the order of knighthood. He was also appointed one of the commissioners for receiving the surrender of religious houses. In 1540 he was nominated one of the auditors of the court of augmentations, and soon afterwards obtained a grant of several considerable lordships in Hertfordshire. In the reign of Edward VI. his estates were much increased by royal grants in seven different counties; and he appears to have continued in high favour at court during the reign of Queen Mary. He died in 1557. Sir William was the founder of Chatsworth, and of the vast fortunes of his descendants, the dukes of Devonshire. He wrote Ths Life and Death of Cardinal Wolsey, of which a mutilated copy appeared in 1641. It was first correctly printed in Dr Wordsworthâ€™s Ecclesiastical Biography.
