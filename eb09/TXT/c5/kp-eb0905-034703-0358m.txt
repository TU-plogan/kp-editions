CERTALDO, a market-town of Tuscany, on the right bank of the Elsa, in the province of Florence, and 15 miles south-west of that city. It was the birthplace of Boccaccio, whose house, repaired in 1823 by the Marchesa Lenzoni Medici, is still to be seen. One of the rooms contains, besides some of the ancient furniture, the remnants of the poet’s tomb, his autograph, and his picture. Not far from the house stands the Church of St Michael and St James, from which Boccaccio’s remains were removed in 1783. In December 1875 a monument to his memory was erected by the authorities of the town. The older part of Certaldo is on the summit of a steep and conical hill, and contains the building which was once the stronghold of the Counts Alberti, the lords of the place before it became subject to Florence. There also dwelt the vicars of Certaldo, who ruled the town and district for Florence, till the reign of the reformer Peter Leopold. The new burgh is situated along the course of a road that skirts the foot of the hill. Population about 2000.
