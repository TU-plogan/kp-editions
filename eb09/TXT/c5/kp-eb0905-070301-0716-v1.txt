CHRISTINE DE PISAN (1363-1431), though French by education and renown, was of Italian stock, and was born at Venice. When she was five years old, she went to her father, a councillor of the Venetian Republic, at Paris, where he held office as astrologer to Charles V. Educated at that prince’s court as completely as the age would allow, at fifteen Christine married Étienne du Castel, Charles’s notary and secretary. After the king’s death, her father lost his appointment, and died soon after of grief and infirmity; and lÁs decease being presently fo!lowed by that of her husband, she found herself at five and twenty without a protector, and with three children depending on her for bread. The vexations and discomforts attendant on several suits at law determined her to have recourse to letters as a means of livelihood. Between 1399 and 1405, as she herself declares, without reckoning minor pieces, she composed some fifteen important works. Neither fame nor protection failed her. The earl of Salisbury, in Paris on the occasion of the marriage of Richard II. with Isabella of France (1396), took her eldest son, and reared him as his [9:5:704] own; the boy, after Salisbury’s death (1400), being received and nurtured by Philip of Burgundy, at whose solicitation Christine wrote Le Livre des Faitz et bonnes Moeurs du Saige Roy Charles. Henry IV. of England desired her to make his court her home, and she received a like invitation from Galeazzo Visconti tyrant of Milan. She preferred, however, to sojourn in France, where she enjoyed the favour of Charles VI., the dukes of Berry and Burgundy, the prince of Guienne, and others. Of the circumstances of her death nothing is known. A son of her’s, however, Jean du Castel, is said to have attained distinction as a poet under Charles VIL Christine de Pisan wrote voluminously in prose and verse. Her works are by no means devoid of merit, nor altogether without interest even at the present time, though the language in which they are written is crude and imperfect, and they sin too often on the side of diffuseness. They are principally of a moral character, Christine seldom interfering in the political questions of her age save to clamour for peace and unity. There is no complete edition of her works. One of them, Le Livre des Faitz d'Amies et de Chevalerie, was translated into English and printed by order of Henry VII.
