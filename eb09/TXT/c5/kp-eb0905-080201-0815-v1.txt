CLARE, a maritime county in the south-west of Ireland, in the province of Munster, bounded N.W. by the Atlantic, S. by the estuary of the Shannon, S.E. and N.E. by Limerick, Tipperary, Lough Dearg, and Galway, having an area of 1293 square miles, or 827,994 acres.

Although the surface of the county is hilly, and in some parts even mountainous, it nowhere rises to a great elevation. Much of the western baronies of Moyarta and Ibrickan is composed of bog land. Bogs are frequent also in the mountainous districts elsewhere, except in the limestone barony of Burren, the inhabitants of some parts of which supply themselves with turf from the opposite shores of Connemara. Generally speaking, the eastern parts of the county are mountainous, with tracts of rich pasture land interspersed; the west abounds with bog; and the north is rocky and best adapted for grazing sheep. In the southern part, along the banks of the Fergus and Shannon, are the bands of rich low grounds called corcasses, of various breadth, indenting the land in a great variety of shapes. They are composed of deep rich loam, and are distinguished as the black corcasses, adapted for tillage, and the blue, used more advantageously as meadow land.

The coast is in general rocky, and occasionally bold and precipitous in the extreme, as may be observed at the picturesque cliffs of Moher within a few miles of Ennistymon and Lisdoonvarna, which rise perpendicularly at O’Brien’s tower to an elevation of 580 feet. The coast of Clare is indented with several bays, the chief of which are Ballyvaghan, Liscannor, and Malbay; but from Black Head to Loop Head, that is, along the entire western boundary of the county formed by the Atlantic, there is no safe harbour except Liscannor Bay. The county possesses only one large river, the Fergus; but nearly 100 miles of its boundary-line are washed by the River Shannon, which, after almost dividing Ireland from north to south, and dispensing its bounties to the adjoining counties of Roscommon, Leitrim, Longford, Westmeath, Galway, King’s County, Kerry, Tipperary, and Limerick, enters the Atlantic Ocean between this county and Kerry. The numerous bays and creeks on both sides of this noble river render its navigation safe in every wind; but the passage to and from Limerick is often tedious, and the port of KiΓrush has from that cause gained in importance. The River Fergus is navigable from the Shannon to the town of Clare, which is the terminating point of its natural navigation, and the port of all the central districts of the county. A railway traverses Clare county via Ennis, connecting Limerick with Athenry and Galway.

There are upwards of one hundred lakes and tarns in the county, of which the largest are Loughs O’Grady, Graneg, Tedane, Inchiquin, Inniscronan, and Clonlea; but they are more remarkable for picturesque beauty than size or utility, with the exception of the extensive and navigable Lough Derg, formed by the River Shannon between this county and Tipperary.

Although metals and minerals have been found in many places throughout the county, they do not often show themselves in sufficient abundance to induce the application of capital for their extraction. The principal metals are lead, iron, and manganese. Lead mines were recently worked at Kilbricken in the barony of Bunratty (about six miles from Ennis), and at Annaglough. The Milltown lead mine in the barony of Tulia is probably one of the oldest mines in Ireland, and at one time, if the extent of the ancient excavations may be taken as a guide, there must have been a very rich deposit. The richest lead mine worked in recent times is that of Ballyhickey, about two miles from Kilbricken. Copper pyrites occurs in several parts of Burren, but in small quantity. Coal exists at Labasheeda on the right bank of the Shannon, but the seams are thin. Limestone occupies all the central and northern parts of the county in a tract bounded on the S. by the Shannon, on the E. by a line running parallel with the Ougarnee River to Scariff Bay, on the N. by the mountain of Talla and the confines of Galway, on the W. by Galway Bay and aline including Kilfenora, Corofin, and Ennis, and meeting the Shannon at the mouth of the Fergus. Within half a mile of the Μ ill town lead mine are immense natural vaulted passages of limestone, through which the River Ardsullas winds a singular course. The lower limestone of the eastern portion of the county has been found to contain several very large deposits of argentiferous galena. Flags, easily quarried, are procured near Kilrush, and thinner flags near Ennistymon. Slates are quarried in several places, the best being those of Broadford and Killaloe, which are nearly equal to the finest procured in Wales. A species of very fine black marble is obtained near Ennis; it takes a high polish, and is free from the white spots with which the black Kilkenny marble is marked.

The mineral springs, which are found in many places, are chiefly chalybeate. That of Lisdoonvarna, about eight miles from Ennistymon, has long been celebrated for its medicinal qualities. There are chalybeate springs of less note at Scool, Colneen, Käkishen, Burren, Kilcoran, Broadford, Lahinch, Kilkee, Kilrush, Killadysart, and Cas· sino, near Miltown Malbay. Springs called by the people “holy” or “blessed” wells, generally mineral waters, are common; but the belief in their power of performing cures in inveterate maladies is nearly extinct.

The Atlantic Ocean and the estuary of the Shannon afford many situations admirably adapted for summer bathing-places. Among the best frequented of these localities are Burren, Miltown Malbay, with one of the best beaches on the western coast, Lahinch, about two miles from Ennistymon, and near the interesting cliffs of Moher, [9:5:803] which has a magnificent beach, on Liscannor Bay, and forms a delightful summer residence, Kilkee, perhaps the most fashionable watering-place on the western coast of Ireland, and Kilrush on the Shannon estuary.

The soil and surface of the county is in general better adapted for grazing than for tillage. Agriculture is in a backward state, there not being a fifth part of its area under cultivation. In 1870 the acreage of the county under crops amounted to 147,662 acres, and in 1875 little advance had been made. The number of acres under the principal crops in these two years stood as follows :—

As regards live stock the same stationary condition of its agricultural industry will be apparent from the following figures :—

As regards the property in the county, the land in 1874 was divided among 1025 separate owners, of whom 243 possessed less than one acre, and 782 one acre and upwards. Twelve proprietors owned more than 10,000 acres each, the most extensive demesnes being in the hands of Lord Leconfield, with 37,292 acres; the marquis of Conyngham, with 27,613; E. P. Westby, 25,779; Lord Inchiquin, 20,321; Colonel Vandeleur, 19,790; and the Hon. C. W. White, 18,266. The value of the land was at the same date rated at an average of 8s. 3d. per acre, while that of all Munster was 11s. 2d.

There are no extensive manufactures in the county of Clare, although flannels and friezes are made for home use, and hosiery of various kinds, chiefly coarse and strong, is made around Corofin, Ennistymon, and other places. The Shannon, west of Scattery Island, and the sea along the coasts, are good fishing stations, abounding with cod, haddock, ling, sole, turbot, ray, mackerel, and other fish, but the rugged nature of the coast and the tempestuous sea greatly hinder the operations of the fishermen. Near Pooldoody is the great Burren oyster bed called the Red Bank, where a large establishment is maintained, and from which a constant supply of the excellent Red Bank oysters is furnished to the Dublin and other large markets. Crabs and lobsters are caught on the shores of the Bay of Galway in every creek from Blackhead to Ardfry. The salmon fishery of the Shannon is very considerable, and eels, which abound in every rivulet, form an important article of consumption.

The population of the county shows a remarkable decrease within the 30 years between 1841 and 1871, although, after all, this is exceeded by the neighbouring counties of Cork, Limerick, and Tipperary. In 1841 the inhabitants numbered 286,394; in 1851, 212,440; in 1861, 166,305; and in 1871, 147,864. Of these 144,440 were Roman Catholics, 8027 Episcopalians, 220 Presbyterians, and 177 of other denominations. In 1874 there were 8709 persons who had obtained parochial relief throughout the year, while during the twenty-four years ending 1875 there had emigrated from the county 90,154 persons. At the date of the last census (1871) 64,566 persons could read and write, and 15,972 could read but could not write; and 4432 were returned as speaking Erse only. There were 12 superior and 253 primary schools in the county. The principal towns in Clare are Ennis, population (1871) 6503; Kilrush, 4424; and Kilkee, 1600. The county returns three members to the Imperial

Parliament,—two for the county and one for the borough of Ennis.

The county of Clare, which is divided into 11 baronies, contains 80 parishes, and includes the diocese of Kilfenora, the greater part of Killaloe, and a very small portion of the diocese of Limerick. It is within the military district of Cork, with barracks for infantry at Clare Castle, Ennis, Killaloe, and Kilrush, and for artillery in the forts at Scattery Island, Donnaha, Kilcredano, Blackwater, and Kilkerrin. The assizes are held at Ennis, where the county prison, the county infirmary, and the district lunatic asylum are situated. There are eight poor-law unions.

This county, together with some of the neighbouring district, was anciently called Thomond or Tuadmuin, that is, North Munster, and formed part of the monarchy of the celebrated Brian Boroihme, who held his court at Kincora near Killaloe, where his palace was situated on the banks of the Shannon. The site is still distinguished by extensive earthern ramparts. Settlements were effected by the Danes, and in the 13th century by the Anglo-Normans, but without permanently affecting the possession of the district by its native proprietors. In 1543 Murrogh O’Brien, after dispossessing his nephew, and vainly attempting a rebellion against the English rule, proceeded to England, and submitted to Henry VIII., resigning his name and possessions. He soon received them back by an English tenure, together with the title of earl of Thomond, on condition of adopting the English dress, manners, and customs, and maintaining no kerns or gallowglasses. In 1565 this part of Thomond (sometimes called O’Brien’s country) was added to Connaught, and made one of the six new counties into which that province was divided by Sir Henry Sidney under the Act 11 Eliz. c. 9. It was then named Clare, probably from the name of an English adventurer, Thomas de Clare, who obtained a grant from Henry III. of all the lands he should conquer from the Irish, and whose family for some time maintained a precarious position in the district. In 1602 the county was re-annexed to Munster. The O’Briens and other native chieftains had many fierce contests to preserve their independence against the Anglo-Norman and English adventurers, and generally succeeded in maintaining their position as native kings and chieftains of Thomond. From some cause or other the comparative immunity of Clare in ancient times from foreign rule and settlement, and from absenteeism, has proved of doubtful advantage to its modern condition. The chief ancient families of note in the district were the O’Briens, now represented by Lord Inchiquin of Dromoland, the Macnamaras, and the O’Loghlens.

The county abounds with remains of antiquities, both military and ecclesiastical. There still exist above a hundred fortified castles, several of which are inhabited. They are mostly of small extent, a large portion being fortified dwellings. The chief of them is Bunvatty Castle, built in 1277. Raths or Danish forts are to be found in every part. They are generally circular, composed either of large stones without mortar, or of earth thrown up and surrounded by one or more ditches. The list of abbeys and other religious houses formerly flourishing here (some now only known by name, but many of them surviving in ruins) comprehends upwards of twenty. The most remarkable are •—Quin, considered one of the finest and most perfect specimens of ancient monastic architecture in Ireland; Corcomroe; Ennis, in which is a very fine window of uncommonly elegant workmanship; and those on Inniscattery, or Scattery Island, in the Shannon, said to have been founded by St Senanus. On the same island there is a round tower, and also the ruins of what are called the seven churches. It is called Holy Island, and is still one of the most popular burial-places in the county. Four other round [9:5:804] towers are to be found in various stages of preservation— at I)rumcliffe, Dysert, Kilnby, aud Inniscaltra. The cathedral of the diocese of Killaloe, at the town of that name, is a plain massive building originally erected in 1160; aud uear it are the ruins of the mausoleum of Brian Boroihme. Cromlechs are found, chiefly in the limestone rocky district of Burren, though there are some in other baronies. That at Ballygannor is formed of a stone 40 feet long and 10 broad. The celebrated tomb of Conan, on Mount Callan, is still extant.
