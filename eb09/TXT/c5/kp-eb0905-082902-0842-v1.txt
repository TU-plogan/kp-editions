CLEVES (in German Kleve), a town of Prussia, formerly the capital of the duchy of its own name, and now the chief town of a circle in the government of Düsseldorf, 46 miles N.W. of Düsseldorf and 12 E. of Nimeguen. It is a neatly-built town in the Dutch style, situated on the declivities of three hills known as Kirchberg, Schlossberg, and Heideberg, in a fertile district near the frontiers of [9:5:830] Holland, and about two miles from the Rhine, with which it has been connected since 1848 by a canal. The old castle of Schwanenburg (formerly the residence of the dukes of Cleves, and the birthplace of Anne of Cleves, one of the wives of Henry VIII.) has a massive tower 180 feet high, which was built in 1439 on the traditional site of Caesar’s Tower and commands an extensive view. Cleves has two Roman Catholic and three Protestant churches, a synagogue, a gymnasium, a house of correction, and a zoological garden. The collegiate church dates from 1345, and contains a number of fine ducal monuments, among which the first place is held by that of Adolf VI. of the 14th century. The chief manufactures are linens, cottons, silks, woollens, and tobacco. To the south and west of the city a large district is laid out as a park; in the southern part, known as the Old Park, there is a statue to the memory of the founder, John Maurice of Nassau-Siegen, who governed the town from 1650 to 1679, and in the western part there are mineral welffi with a pump-room and bathing establishment,, which date from about 1848. The town was the seat of the counts of Cleves as early as the 11th century, but it did not receive its incorporation till 1242. It was raised, with the surrounding district on both sides of the Rhine, to the rank of a duchy by the Emperor Sigismund in 1417. On the death of Duke William in 1609, without issue, his inheritance, which also included Jülich and Berg, became the object of a violent contest between no fewer than six competitors; and it was not till 1614 that the dispute was settled by the treaty of Xanten, which assigned the duchy of Cleves to Sigismund, elector of Brandenburg, who had married a niece of the late duke. In 1805 it was ceded by Prussia to France; and in 1806 it was made a grand-duchy by Napoleon and bestowed on Murat. In 1815 it was restored to Prussia. The population of the town in 1871 was 9038.
