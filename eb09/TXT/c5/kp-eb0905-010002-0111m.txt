CARDUCCI, or Carducho, ViNCEÎ»zo (1568-1638), was born in Florence, and was trained as a painter by his brother Bartolommeo, whom he followed to Madrid. He worked a great deal for Philip III. and Philip IV., and his best pictures are those he executed for the former monarch as decorations in the Pardo Gallery. Examples of him are preserved at Toledo, at Valladolid, at Segovia, and at several other Spanish cities. For many years he laboured in Madrid as a teacher of his art, aud from his atelier issued Giovanni Ricci, Pedro Obregon, Vela, Collantes, and other distinguished representatives of the Spanish school during the 17th century. He was also author of a treatise, or dialogue, De las Excelencias de la Pintura, which was published in 1633.
