CAPGRAVE, John (1393-1464), an English historian, was born at Lynn in Norfolk, 21st April 1393. At an early age he was sent to one of the English universities,—most probably Cambridge,—and at a later period of his life he was connected with both. In his twenty-fourth year ho entered the priesthood, and subsequently he prosecuted his studies in London, where he was residing at the time of the birth of King Henry VI. At Oxford he graduated D.D., taught theology publicly in the schools, and lectured on the Old. and New Testaments. Having become an Augustinian friar he settled down in the house belonging to that order in his native town, where, to quote Leland’s expression, he “stuck to his books like a limpet to its rock.” The friary at Lynn was then a flourishing establishment. It possessed a large and valuable library, and afforded a home to no fewer than thirty priests, besides subdeacons and novices to the number of sixteen. It is highly probable that Capgrave became prior of this house, and it is certain that he was chosen provincial of his order in England. Most of his life was spent in the retirement of the cloister at Lynn, but he occasionally visited other Augustinian friaries, and once, at least, went to Rome. He died at Lynn 12th August 1464. Capgrave was justly regarded as one of the most learned men of his age. His works are chiefly theological, consisting of commentaries, sermons, and biographies of saints. To the last class belongs the Nova Legenda Ånglioe, printed in London by Wynkyn de Worde in 1516. Of his historical works the most important is Ths Chronicle of England, published in 1858 under the editorial supervision of the Rev. F. C. Hingeston, and forming one of the series of Chronicles and Memorials of Great Britain and Ireland. This “Chronicle,” written in English, extends to the year 1417,—the accounts of the reigns of the later kings being very full and valuable, and containing many original notices. Mr Hingeston also edited in the same year and for the same series Capgrave’s Liber de Illustribus Henricis, in the original Latin, accompanying it with an English translation in a separate volume. This curious work contains lives of King Henry VI. and other men of eminence who bore the name of Henry. Many other works by Capgrave are preserved in MS., including a Life of St Katherine in quaint English verse; but it is believed that his life of his patron and friend, Humphrey, duke of Gloucester, is irrecoverably lost.
