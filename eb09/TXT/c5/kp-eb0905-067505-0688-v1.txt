CHITTAGONG HILL TRACTS, a district on the eastern frontier of British India, in the Chittagong division, lies between 21° 13' and 23° 47' N. lat., and 91° 46' and 92° 49' E. long., and is bounded on the N. by the semi-independent state of Tipperah, on the E. and S. by the district of Arákán in British Burmah, and on the W. by the regulation district of Chittagong. The general aspect of the country is very hilly, with deep ravines and prominent cliffs, covered with forests and gigantic creepers. Irregular masses of jungle, low hills, water-courses, and swamps fill up the intervals between the chief ranges. The principal hills with their heights are—Básitáng, 2181 feet; Mrungá Tang 1650 feet; Rángráng-dáng, 2789 feet; and Lurain Tang, 2355 feet. The country is divided into four valleys formed by the Phení, Karnaphulí, Sangu, and Mátámurí rivers. Navigation is, however, difficult, owing to the rapidity and violence of their currents, their sharp turns, and whirling eddies; but the hillmen manage to float down timber, bamboo, ratan, thatching grass, cotton, garjαn oil, chalmugrd oil, and a small quantity of wax and ivory. Among the wild animals may be noticed elephants, rhinoceros, bison, and many kinds of deer. The area of the district is 6882 square miles; the population in 1872 was 69,607 souls, or only 10 persons to the square mile. These consist of Hindus, 598, or - 8 per cent.; Muhammadans, 1378, or 2 ’ 0 per cent.; Buddhists, 47,875, or 68 - 8 per cent.; Christians, 31; and persons of unspecified religion, 19,725, or 28 ’ 4 per cent. The hill tribes, who are very primitive in their manners and customs, include the Khyoungthas (children of the river), called also the Jumiá Maghs; Chakmás, Tipperahs, Kumis, Mrus, Khyengs, Bangis, Pankhos, Lusháis or Kukis, and Shendus. Rángámátí village is the capital of the district. The principal crops are rice, Indian corn, tobacco, and cotton, raised every year from soil newly cleared from jungle. Two European landholders have tea-plantations in the district. The Chittagong Hill Tracts were separated from the Chittagong district in 1860, and until lately were subject to the incursions of the wild tribes on their borders. The revenue in 1870-71 was £3545, 14s; the expenditure, £14,332, 12s. The police is a quasi-military force, consisting of 52 officers and 604 men, maintained in 1872 at a total cost of £13,424. This force now suffices to repel the incursions of the border tribes.
