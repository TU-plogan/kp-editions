CARPATHIAN MOUNTAINS, or Keapacks, the eastern wing of the great central mountain system of Europe. They lie between 44° 30' and 49° 40' N. lat., and 17° and 26° E. long., enclosing Transylvania and Hungary, and form a curve 800 miles long, the concavity of which is towards the south-west. The south-eastern extremity of the curve is at Orsova on the Turkish frontier, where the Danube separates it from the northern spurs of the Balkan or Haemus range. The western extremity is at Presburg in Hungary, on the same river. The breadth of the Carpathian Mountains is between 100 and 200 miles. They form the main water-shed between the northern seas and the Black Sea. The valley of the March divides them from the Silesian and Moravian chains; the valley of the Lower Danube, from the system of the Alps. They are almost entirely in Austrian territory. The chief divisions are the Little Carpathians on the west, between the Waag and the March; to the east of these, the Jablunka Mountains; then the Western Carpathians, or Carpathians proper; and lastly, the East Carpathians to the south-east of Transylvania. The Western Carpathians include the groups of the Tatra, Lomnitz, and Bisztra. Of these the highest is the Tatra, some of the peaks of which are free from snow only one month in the year. The Gerlsdorfer Spitze, the loftiest [9:5:127] point, has an altitude of 8685 feet. On the northern side are some small glaciers, which, however, hardly deserve the name. It is here that the mountain lakes, or “eyes of the sea” are found, in deep hollows between the steep and jagged granitic peaks. The main ridge of the Carpathians running east from the Tatra is called the Waldgebirge, the highest points of which are 2800 feet above sea-level. The Tatra and adjoining groups have a very important influence on the climate of the regions lying south of them, serving as a protection from the north wi nd. The East Carpathians, the southernmost member of the chain, occupy a quadrangular tract of about 25,500 square miles. The highest point is Mount Butschetje, in South Transylvania; it is 9528 feet in altitude. The chief passes of the Carpathians are those of Tergova, leading from Orsova to Temesvar; Vulcan, in the valley of the Schyl, and Rothe Thurm, in the Aluta valley, at the foot of Mount Surul, both on the south border of Transylvania; Türsburg, between Bucharest and Kronstadt; Ojitos and Gymos between Moldavia and Transylvania; Borgo, leading from Bistritz to Bukowina; Jablunka on the route from Presburg to Cracow. The Carpathians are rich in metallic ores; lead and quicksilver, and also rock-salt, are obtained from them; there are large copper-workings in Zips, gold and silver mines at Kremnitz and Schemnitz in Hungary, and rich gold ores at Nagyag in Transylvania. Besides these substances, the Carpathians furnish a variety of minerals. Granite is an important constituent of the range. In the Liptau Mountains it is overlain by limestone; and in the Zipfer Mountains it is associated with limestone and gneiss. In the Waldgebirge the large deposits of sandstone afford a poor soil for cultivation. Basalt and other igneous rocks, with the remains of ancient craters, are met with in some districts of the Transylvanian Alps. On the slopes of the Carpathians large quantities of wheat and maize are raised; cattle and sheep are pastured in great numbers; and vineyards and orchards flourish. The vegetation presents four zones, that of the beech extends to 4000 feet above the sea, that of the Scotch fir to 1000 feet higher; above this grows a species of pine, which becomes dwarfed and disappears at an altitude of about 6000 feet, beyond which height is a zone of lichen and moss covered or almost bare rock.
