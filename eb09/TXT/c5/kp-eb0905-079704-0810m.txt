CIVITA DI PENNE, an episcopal town of Italy, at the head of a district in the province of Abruzzo Ulteriore I., 19 miles west of Pescara. Under the name of Pinna it was the chief city of the Vestini, and is celebrated in the history of the Social war for its obstinate resistance to the Roman army by which it was besieged. It has still some remains of ancient buildings, and numerous inscriptions that attest its importance, and it is noted for the manufacture of artificial flowers. Population, 9800.
