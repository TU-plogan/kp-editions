CHARLOTTE TOWN, a town of British America, in the Dominion of Canada, the capital of Prince Edward Island, is situated on gently rising ground on the north bank of Hillsborough River, at its junction with York River, not far from the south coast, in 14° 15' N. laL and 63° 7' W. long. It has a good harbour in Hillsborough Bay, and the river is navigable by the largest vessels for several miles. Besides the Government buildings and the court-house, the town possesses an Episcopal, a Roman Catholic, and a Scotch church, a fort and barracks, a convent, a lunatic asylum, an exchange, a jail, three banks, and an almshouse; its educational institutions include the Prince of Wales College, supported by the province, the Roman Catholic College of St Dunstan’s, the Wesleyan Methodist Academy, founded in 1871, and a normal school; and among its industrial establishments are an iron foundry, a woollen factory, and shipbuilding yards. Large quantities of grain are exported, as well as potatoes, fish, and pork. A steamer plies between the town and Southport every hour, and there is regular communication with several of the other continental ports. A railway, with a total length of 200 miles, runs east to Georgetown and Souris, and west to Somerside, Alberton, and Tignish. Population in 1871, 8807.
