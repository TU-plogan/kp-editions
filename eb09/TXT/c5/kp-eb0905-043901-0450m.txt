CHÂTEAU-THIERRY, a town of France, at the head of an arrondissement in the department of Aisne, on the right bank of the Marne, and connected with an extensive suburb on the opposite bank by a fine stone bridge of three arches. It is the seat of a tribunal of primary instance, aud has a communal college, a public library, and manufactures of linen, cotton, leather, and earthenware. It contains a marble statue erected to the memory of La Fontaine, who was born in the town; and his house is still preserved in the street that was formerly called after the Cordeliers, but now bears the name of the poet. On the top of the hill are the ruins of a castle, which is said to have been built by Charles Martel for Thierry IV., and is plainly the origin of the name of the town. Château-Thierry was formerly the capital of the district of Brie Pouilleuse, and received the title of a duchy from Charles IX. in 1566. Its position has brought upon it numerous disasters from time to time. It was captured by the English in 1421, by Charles V. in 1545, and by the Spanish in 1591. During the wars of the Fronde it was pillaged in 1652; and in the campaign of 1814 it suffered severely. On February 12 of the latter year the Russo-Prussian forces were beaten by Napoleon in the neighbourhood. Population of v the town in 1872, 5347; of the commune, 6623.
