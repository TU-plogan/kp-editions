CARNIVORA, or Flesh-eating Animals, is the name employed to designate the important order of Mammals which contains the dogs, cats, hyaenas, weasels, bears, badgers, and others. By some zoologists the Carnivora are divided into the Pinnipedia, or aquatic carnivora, as the seals and walrus, and the Fissipedia, which are mostly terrestrial, as the dogs, cats, &c. By others again the Pinnipedia are regarded as possessing characters sufficiently distinctive to justify their being placed in a separate order of Mammals. See Mammalia.
