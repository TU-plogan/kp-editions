CHRISTIANIA, the capital of Norway and of a stift of the same name, is situated about 80 miles from the sea, at the head of the Christiania fiord, at the foot of the Egeberg, in a finely-wooded and picturesque neighbourhood, in 59° 54' N. lat. and 10° 45' E. long. It is the seat of the king and of the Storthing or Parliament, of the Hoieste-ret or final court of appeal, and of the bishop of the stift. The new town, or Christiania proper, was founded in 1624 by Christian IV.; the old town, Opslo, commenced in 1058 by King Harold Haardrada, formerly the capital, is now only one of the suburbs of Christiania. The fortress of Agershuus defends the fiord and the greater part of the town; it contains the regalia and national records, and its ramparts afford an agreeable promenade. The streets of Christiania are at right angles to one another, and are lighted by gas; the houses, except in the suburbs, are of brick or stone, and are mostly two-storied. Amongst the buildings may be mentioned the royal palace, containing some of Tidemand’s best pictures; the cathedral, a brick edifice in the shape of a Greek cross; the university, founded in 1811, opened in 1813, with a library of about 150,000 volumes; the legislative hall; the free museums; the observatory; the naval, military, and art schools; the lunatic and two orphan asylums; the prison, near the Opslo Kirke; the railway station, Freemasons’ Hall, Athenaeum, two theatres, and the large dining-hall or Damp-Köjkken. The botanical gardens, about a mile from the town, contain a large collection of plants from Spitzbergen and Iceland. The industrial establishments of Christiania and the circumjacent amt of Agershuus include weaving and cotton-spinning factories, paper and saw-mills, soap and oil works, distilleries, breweries, and tobacco manufactories. As a place of commerce Christiania has surpassed Bergen, and is now the first port of Norway; by the extension of its railway communications it has also become the chief emporium for the inland produce of the country. Its exports are wood, pitch, hides, seal skins, oil and linseed cake, fishmanure, herrings, anchovies, stock-fish, and iron; and it imports wheat, salt, hardware, wines, preserved fruits, and fancy goods. In 1871 the total value of the imports was about £2,151,225; the vessels that entered the port in 1872 were 1787, of total tonnage 393,598, out of which 143 steamers and sailing-ships were British. The customs duties in 1873 amounted to £329,175. Christiania is in steam communication with Gothenburg, Copenhagen, Lübeck, Hamburg, Amsterdam, London, and Hull, as well as with various places on the fiord, and all the ports of Norway. The town is healthy and has an excellent supply of good water. In winter its average temperature is 23° Fahr., in summer 59 o- 9, giving an average for the year of 41 o, 4. The harbour during three or four months of the year is ice-locked, and ships then lie at Drobak, about 18 miles south of the town. The population, which in 1812 did not exceed 10,000, had in 1835 reached 21,757; and at the end of 1873 it was 72,725 or, with that of the suburbs, about 83,000.
