CASHEW NUT, the fruit of the Cashew, Cadju, or Acajou tree, Anacardium occidentale (Nat. Ord. Anacardiaceoe), a native of the West Indian Islands. The fruit is kidney-shaped, about an inch in length, and the kernel is enclosed in two coverings, the outer of which is smooth, grey, and leathery. Inside this external rind is a darkcoloured layer, containing an excessively acrid juice. The kernels have a bland, oily, pleasant taste. They are much eaten, both raw and roasted, in the tropical regions in which the tree is cultivated, and they yield a light-coloured, [9:5:176] sweet-tasted oil, said to be equal to olive oil for culinaÎ¹y purposes. The fruit-stalk, immediately under the fruit, is swollen and fleshy, and assumes a pear-like shape. This swollen portion of the stalk has a pleasant acid taste, and is eaten under the name of Cashew Apple. By fermentation it yields an alcoholic beverage, from which a spirit for drinking is distilled in the West Indies and Brazil The tree also yields a gum analogous to gum arabic.
