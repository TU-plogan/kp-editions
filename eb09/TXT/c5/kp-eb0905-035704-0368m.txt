CETINA, Gutierre de, soldier and poet, was born at Seville during the earlier years of the 16th century. Choosing the career of arms as a means of obtaining the preferment he needed, he served several campaigns in Italy, fought at the leaguer of Tunis (1535) against Barbarossa, and continued in the practice of his profession for some years in Flanders, under Ferdinand of Austria. The death of the prince of Ascoli, his patron and protector, whom he mourned in a fine elegiac sonnet, and his own continued poverty, would seem to have disgusted him with the trade of war. He returned to Seville, departing thence soon afterwards for Mexico, where he had a brother high in office. No more is known of him, saving that he came back again to the city of his birth, and that he died there, it is supposed about 1560. An enthusiast in art, the friend of Boscan and Garcilaso, of Hurtado de Mendoza and Jeronimo de Urrea, Gutierre de Cetina, as may naturally be inferred, followed in the wake of these poets, renouncing the old Castilian creed, and preaching the new evangel of Petrarch. His poems, which were not published till long after his death, consist of sonnets, canzoni, epistles in terza rima, and madrigals, and are remarkable for elegance and simplicity of form, and for grace and tenderness of thought [9:5:358] and feeling. Their author has been often confounded with Doctor Gutierre de Cetina, who was vicar of Madrid. See Rivadaneyraâ€™s Biblioteca, vol. xxxii.
