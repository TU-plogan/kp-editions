CHÉZY, AntoineLéonard (1773-1832), a French orientalist, was born at Neuilly in 1773. He was intended by his father for the profession of engineering; but his taste was for philology; and in 1790 he sought and obtained a post in the Oriental department of the national library. About 1803 he commenced the study of Sanskrit, though he possessed neither grammar nor dictionary, and, by means of great labour, he obtained so complete a knowledge of the language that he composed in it verses which are said to possess great elegance. He had besides a considerable acquaintance with other Eastern languages; and his attainments place him in a high rank among Orientalists. His merits were recognized by his appointment to the chair of Sanskrit in the Collège de France, in 1803, and to the dignity of chevalier of the legion of honour

Among other works he left— Extrait du livre des Merveilles de la Nature, par Molmmmcd; Medjouin et Lĕila, from the Persian; Yadjanadatta Badha, and Sakountala, from the Sanskrit; L’Anthologie érotique d’Amrou; Grammaire sanscrite; Vocabulaire sanscrit, pracrit, et français; Chrestomathie personne; Chrestomathie sanscrite.
