CARTE, Thomas (1686-1754), an English historian, was born at Dusmoon, near Clifton, in 1686. He was educated at Oxford, and was first brought into pubh'c notice by his controversy with Dr Chandler regarding the Irish massacre, in which he defended Charles I. His attachment to the Stuarts also caused him to remain a nonjuror, and on the discovery of the plot of Atterbury, whose secretary he was, he was forced to flee to France. During his residence in that country he collected materials for an English edition of De Thou and Rigault. These papers were purchased by Dr Mead, under whose direction the book was published in a very handsome form. Being recalled to England through the influence of Queen Caroline, he published, in 1738, A General Account of the Necessary Materials for a History of England. The task of collecting these materials he undertook, with the assistance of subscriptions from various sources. The first volume of his history, which is only of value for its vast and careful collection of facts,was published in 1744. By the insertion in it of the statement that the kingâ€™s evil had been cured by the Pretender, Carte forfeited the favour of most of his patrons. He, however, continued to publish; and the 2d volume appeared in 1750, the 3d in 1752, the 4th in 1755. His papers became the property of the University of Oxford, and were deposited in the Bodleian Library.
