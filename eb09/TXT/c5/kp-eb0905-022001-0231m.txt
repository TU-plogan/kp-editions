CATECHU, or Cutch, is an extract obtained from several plants, its chief sources being the wood of two species of Acacia (A. Catechu and A Suma), both natives of India. The extract obtained from these plants is also known as black catechu, Pegu cutch, and Terra japonica. A similar extract, known in pharmacy as pale catechu ( Catechu pallidum), and in general commerce as Gambir, is produced from the leaves of Uιιcaria Gambir and U. acida, Rubiaceous plants growing in the East Indian Archipelago. A third product to which the name catechu is also applied, is obtained from the fruits of the areca or betel palm, Areca Catechu; but this substance is not chemically the same as the other two, neither does it appear to enter to any extent into European commerce.

Ordinary black catechu is usually imported in three different forms. The first and best quality, known as Pegu catechu, is obtained in blocks externally covered with the large leaves of a species of Dipterocarpus ; the second and less pure variety is in masses, which have been moulded in sand; and the third consists of large cubes packed in coarse bags. The wood of the two species of Acacia yielding catechu is taken for the manufacture when the trees have attained a diameter of about 1 foot, The bark is stripped off and used for tanning, and the trunk is split up into small fragments, which are packed into earthenware jars, covered with water, and boiled in the open air. As the liquor becomes thick it is passed into separate vessels in which the evaporation is continued till the proper degree of inspissation is reached. It is then cast into the forms in which it is found in commerce, and further hardened by exposure to the sun. Catechu so prepared is a dark brown, or, in mass, almost black substance, brittle, and having generally a shining lustre. It has a powerfully astringent taste, with a sweetish after-effect. In cold water it disintegrates, and in boiling water, alcohol, acetic acid, and strong caustic alkali it is completely dissolved. Chemically it consists of a mixture of a peculiar variety of tannin termed -catechu-tannic acid with catechin or catechuic acid, and a brown extractiform substance due to the alteration of both these principles. Catechu-tan nie acid is an amorphous body soluble in cold water, while catechin occurs in minute, white, silky, needle-shaped crystals, which do not dissolve in cold water. A very minute proportion of quercetin, a principle yielded by quercitron bark, has been obtained from catechu.

Gambir, which is similar in chemical composition to ordinary catechu, occurs in commerce in the form of cubes of about an inch in size, with a pale brown or yellow colour and an even earthy fracture. For the preparation of this extract the plants above mentioned are stripped of their leaves and young twigs, and these are boiled down in shallow pans. The juice is strained off, evaporated by boiling, and when sufficiently concentrated, poured into vessels for cooling in which it is stirred in a peculiar manner as it cools and thickens. The mass, when it has attained a syrupy consistence is cast into shallow boxes, where, as it hardens and dries, it is cut into small cubes.

Gambir and catechu are extensively employed in dyeing and tanning, and to some extent as astringents in medicine. For dyeing they have been in use in India from the most remote period, but it is only during the present century that they have been placed on the list of European dyeing substances. Catechu is fixed by oxidation of the colouring principle, catechin, on the cloth after dyeing or printing; and treated thus it yields a great variety of most durable tints of drabs, browns, and olives with different mordants. In tanning, catechu is used only for a low class of leather, which, when made into boots, communicates to the stockings a yellow stain. The principal consumption of catechu occurs in the preparation of fibrous substances exposed to water, such as fishing-lines and nets, and for colouring stout canvas used for covering boxes and portmanteaus under the name of tanned canvas. The average annual imports into Great Britain amount to about 5000 tons of catechu, which comes chiefly from Bengal, and 20,000 tons of gambir, coming from the Straits Settlements.
