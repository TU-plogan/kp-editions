CHÁNDÁ, a district of British India, in the Nágpur division of the Central Provinces, situated between 19° 7' and 20° 5Γ N. lat., and 78° 5Γ and 80° 5Γ E. long. It is bounded on the N. by the districts of Ráipur, Bhandåra, and Wardhá, on the E. by Bastár and Ráipur, on the S. by Sironchá, and on the W. by the Wardhá and Pranhítá rivers, which divide it from Berar and the Hyderabad territory. Excepting in the extreme west, hills are thickly dotted over the country, sometimes in detached ranges, occasionally in isolated peaks rising sheer out from the plain. Towards the east they increase in height, and form a broad table-land, at places 2000 feet above sea-level. The Waíngaiigá River flows through the district from north to south, meeting the Wardhá River at Seoní, where their streams unite to form the Pranhítá. The census of 1872 returns the total area of the district at 9700 square miles, and the population at 534,431 souls, residing in 2392 villages and townships, and dwelling in 108,258 houses. Of the total population, 397,540, or 74 - 39 per cent., are Hindus; 8176, or 1 ’ 52 per cent., Muhammadans; 648 or ’ 12 per cent., Buddhists and Jains; 89, or O2 per cent., Christians; and 127,978, or 23 ’ 95 per cent., aboriginal tribes and people returned in the census report under the heading of “others.” Two towns in the district are returned as containing a population of upwards of 5000 souls; viz., Chándá, population 16,233, and Armorí, population 5271. Of the total area of the district, 9700 square miles, only 988 were actually under cultivation in 1873-74, 5200 square miles being returned as cultivable, and 3509 as uncultivable waste. The principal crops are rice, wheat, oil-seeds, sugar-cane, and cotton. Within the last few years extensive coal and iron beds have been discovered, and 20 mines were in operation in 1873-74. A branch line of railway will shortly connect the Chándá coal-measures with the Bombay railway system. Dense woods cover the country. Teak grows everywhere; and in the Government forests, in the eastern part of the district, it attains a large size. The chief manufacture of the district is cotton cloths, both of coarse and fine quality, which are largely exported to Western India. Silkworm breeding is largely carried on, and silk or silk and cotton fabrics are woven. Iron smelting is an important branch of industry. The district trade is conducted at annual fairs, which are held at the towns of Chándá, Bhándak, Chimur, Márkandí, and Warhá, and are numerously attended by visitors from all parts of India. The sales effected at these fairs in 1868-69 amounted to £152,224.

Chándá is thickly studded with fine tanks, or rather artificial lakes, formed by closing the outlets of small valleys, or by throwing a dam across tracts intersected by streams. The broad clear sheets of water thus created are often very picturesque in their surroundings of wood and rock. The chief architectural objects of interest are the cave temples at Bhándak, Winjbásaní, Dewálá, and Ghugus; a rock temple in the bed of the Wardhá River below Ballálpur; the ancient temples at Márkandí, Ambgáon, and elsewhere; the forts of Wairágarh and Ballálpur; and the old walls of the city of Chándá, its system of water-works, and the tombs of the aboriginal Gond kings.

The total revenue of the district in 1873-74 amounted to £38,922,10s., of which £24,402 or 62 ’ 7 per cent., was derived from the land For the education of the people, 67 schools, attended by 3347 pupils, were either entirely supported by the state, or were subsidized under the grant-in-aid rules. For the relief of the sick, 4 charitable dispensaries were maintained, at which 24,448 persons were treated, at a total cost of £660, of which £439 was contributed by Government. The annual rainfall at Chándá town averages 44 ’ 67 inches, but in the hilly wooded region to the east it is considerably higher. The rainy season lasts from the middle of June to the end of September, From the middle of September to the close of [9:5:391] November fever of a malarious type pervails all over the district. Cholera and smallpox are also common.

Chăndá, the principal town in the district of the same name, is situated in 19° 57' N. lat. and 79° 22' E. long., at the junction of the Virái and Jharpat rivers. The town is surrounded by a wall of cut stone five and a half miles in circuit, and crowned with battlements still in perfect preservation. The town contains a total population of 16,233 souls, classified as follows:—Hindus, 14,350; Muhammadans, 1294; Buddhists and Jains, 53; Christians, 76; and “others,” 460. The municipal revenue in 1871 was £ 1120. The population of the town is chiefly Marhattá and Telingá; the traders, shopkeepers, and craftsmen belong to the latter. The principal manufactures are coarse and fine cotton cloths, silk fabrics, brass utensils, leather slippers, and bamboo work. The town is the seat of considerable external trade, the value of the imports in 1868-69 being returned at £178,044, and the exports at £114,342. The civil station lies a little to the north of the city, having the military cantonments to the west, with the civil lines in the centre and east.

i CHANDARN AGAR (popa ∖ sx ∖ yChundernagord), aFrench settlement, with a small adjoining territory, situated on the right bank of the River Húglí, 20 miles above Calcutta, in 22’ 51' 40" N. lat. and 88° 24' 50" E. long. Chandarnagar has played an important part in the European history of Bengal. It became a French settlement towards the close of the 17th century, but did not rise to any importance till the time of Dupleix, during whose administration more than two thousand brick-houses were erected in the town, and a considerable maritime trade was carried on. In 1757, Chandarnagar was bombarded by an English fleet and captured; the fortifications and houses were afterwards demolished. On peace being established, the town was restored to the French in 1763. When hostilities afterwards broke out in 1794, it was again taken possession of by the English, and was held by them till 1816, when it was a second time given up to the French; it has ever since remained in their possession. All the former commercial grandeur of Chandarnagar has now passed away, and at present it is little more than a quiet suburb of Calcutta, without any external trade. The European town is situated at the bottom of a beautiful reach of the Húglí, with clean wide thoroughfares, and many elegant residences along the river bank. The total area of the territory is only 2330 acres, including a few villages outside the town. The authorities of Chandarnagar are subject to the general jurisdiction of the Governor-General of Pondicherrí, to whom is confided the general government of all the French possessions in India.
