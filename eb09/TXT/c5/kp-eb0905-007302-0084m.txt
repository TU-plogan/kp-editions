CAPITO, or Koepplin, WolfgangFabricius (1478- 1541), a Reformed divine, was born of humble parentage at Hagenau in Alsace. He was educated for the medical profession, and he also devoted some time to the study of law, in which he gained the degree of doctor. At the same time he applied himself so earnestly to theology that he received the doctorate in that faculty also, and taught for some time at Freiburg. He acted for three years as pastor in Bruchsal, and was then called to the cathedral church of Basel. In 1520 he removed to Mainz, at the request of Albrecht, archbishop of that city. In 1523 he settled at Strasburg, where he remained till his death. He took a prominent part in the earlier ecclesiastical transactions of the 16th century, was present at the second conference of Zurich and at the conference of Marburg, and along with Bucer was appointed to present to the emperor the confession of Augsburg. From his endeavours to conciliate the Lutheran and Zwinglian parties in regard to the sacraments, he seems to have incurred the suspicions of his own friends; while from his intimacy with several divines of the Socinian school he drew on himself the charge of Arianism. His principal works were,â€” Institutionum Hebraicarum libri duo ; Enarrationes in Habacuc et Hoseam Prophetas; and Explicatio doctissima in Hexaemeron.
