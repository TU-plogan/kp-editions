CEBU, a city of the Philippine Islands, on the eastern side of an island of the same name, about 400 miles S.E. of Manilla. It is the oldest provincial town in the archipelago, and still ranks as one of the best built; while its position renders it the chief commercial centre for the Southern Philippines. It is the residence of a military governor and an alcalde, as well as of the governor-general of the Vissagas; and its public buildings comprise a cathedral, an episcopal palace, and a lazaretto. It exports sugar, hemp, tobacco, and sapan-wood, the quantity of the first two in 1870 being 114,806 and 40,756 piculs respectively. Its foreign goods are obtained via Manilla. There is an old fort built of coral, and in the island of Matan opposite the town is situated the grave of Magellan. The population, inclusive of the suburb of St Nicholas, is reckoned at 34,000.
