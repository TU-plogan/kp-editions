CASTIGLIONE, Giovanni Benedetto (1616-1670), currently named in Italy II Grechetto, and in France Le Benédette, a painter of the Genoese School, was born in Genoa, and studied for some time under Vandyck. He painted portraits, historical pieces, and landscapes, but chiefly excelled in fairs, markets, and rural scenes with animals. His paintings are to be found at Rome, Venice, Naples, Florence, and more especially Genoa and Mantua. He also executed a great number of etchings, which are spirited, free, and full of taste; Diogenes searching for a Man is one of the principal of these. The etchings are remarkable for light and shade, and have even earned for Castiglione the name of “a second Rembrandt.” The Presepio (Nativity of Jesus) in the church of San Luca, Genoa, ranks among his most celebrated paintings; the Louvre also contains eight characteristic examples. In his closing years he lived in Mantua, painting for the court; here he received his name of “Grechetto,” from the classic air of his pastorals, and here he died of gout in 1670. His brother Salvatore aud his son Francesco excelled in the same subjects; and it is thought that many paintings which are ascribed to Benedetto are only copies after him, or perhaps originals by his son or brother.
