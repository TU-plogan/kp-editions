CASTREN, Matthias Alexander (1813-1853), one of the greatest authorities on the ethnology and languages of the Northern Asiatic nations, was born at Tervola, in the parish of Kemi in Finland, on 20th November (2d December) 1813. His father, Christian Castrén, parish minister at Rovaniemi, died in 1825; and Matthias passed under the protection of his uncle, Mathias Castrén, the kindly and learned incumbent of Kemi. At the age of twelve he was sent to school at Uleàborg, and there ho helped to maintain himself by teaching the younger children. On his removal to the Alexander’s University at Helsingfors in 1830, he first devoted himself to Greek and Hebrew with the intention of entering the church; but his interest was soon excited by the language of his native country, and he even began before his course was completed to lay the foundations of a work on Finnish mythology. The necessity of personal explorations among the still unwritten languages of cognate tribes soon made itself evident; and in 1838 he was glad to join a medical fellow-student, Dr Ehrström, in a journey through Lapland. In the following year he travelled in Russian Karelia at the expense of the Literary Society of Finland; and in 1841 he undertook, in company with Dr Elias Lönnrot, the great Finnish philologist, a third journey, which ultimately extended beyond the Ural as far as Obdorsk, and occupied a period of three years. Before starting on this last expedition he had published a translation into Swedish of the Finnish epic of Kalevala ; and on his return he gave to the world his Elementa grammatices Syrjaenoe and Elementa grammatices Tscheremissoe, 1844. No sooner had he recovered from the illness which his last journey had occasioned than he set out, under the auspices of the Academy of St Petersburg and the Helsingfors University, on an exploration of the whole government of Siberia, which resulted in a vast addition to previous knowledge, but seriously affected the health of the adventurous investigator. The first-fruits of his collections were published at St Petersburg in 1849 in the form of a Versuch einer Ostjakischen Sprachlehre. In 1850 he published a treatise De afiixis personalibus linguarum Altaicarum, and was appointed professor at Helsingfors of the new chair of Finnish language and literature. The following year saw him raised to the rank of chancellor of the university; and he was busily engaged in what he regarded as his principal work, a Samoyedic Grammar, when he died on 7th May 1853. Five volumes of his collected works appeared from 1852 to 1858, containing respectively— (1.) Reseminnen från åren 1838-1844; (2.) Reseberättxlser och bref åren 1845-1849; (3.) Foreläsningar i Finsk mythologi ; (4.) Ethnologiska foreläsningar öfver Altaiska folken ; and (5.) Smärre afhandlingar οch akademiska dissertatiοner. A German translation has been published by Anton Schiefner, who was also intrusted by the St Petersburg Academy with the editing of his manuscripts [9:5:201] which had been left to the Helsingfors University. The Samoyedic Grammar(1854),a Samoyede Vocabulary (1855), a Tungusian Dictionary (1856), and studies on the Buriatic (1857), the Koibalic and Karagassic (1857), and the Yenisei Ostiak and Kottian dialects have been published.
