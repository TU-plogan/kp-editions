CAREW, George (1557-1629), Earl of Totness, and Baron Carew of Clopton, Warwickshire, was born in 1557. After completing his studies at Oxford, he joined the army, and held an important command in the Irish wars against the Earl of Desmond and the rebels. He was successively appointed governor of Askeaton castle, lieutenant-general of artillery, and, after the successful expedition to Cadiz (1596), lord-president of Munster, treasurer to the army, and ultimately one of the lords judges of Ireland. When he entered on his duties, the whole country was in open rebellion; but by a prudent and vigorous policy, backed by his own intrepidity in the field, he soon reduced the rebels to submission. His greatest exploit was the capture of Dunboy castle, a success which disappointed the Spanish allies, and in reality put an end to the war. For his services in Ireland he was made governor of Guernsey, and was raised to the peerage. He was afterwards made privycouncillor to James I., and died at London in 1629. Carew wrote an account of the wars in Ireland in a book called Hibernia Poeata, published after his death; and made several collections for the history of Henry V., which were afterwards digested into Speedâ€™s History of Great Britain. Some of his letters have been printed by the Camden Society, 1860.
