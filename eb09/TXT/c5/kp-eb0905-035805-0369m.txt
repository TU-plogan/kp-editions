CÉVENNES, a mountain’chain in the south of France, dividing the valleys of the Lower Saône and Rhone from those of the Loire and the Garonne. On the N. the Cévennes are a continuation of the Lyonnais mountains; and they end on the S. at the Canal du Midi, which separates them from the Pyrenees. They are divided into two parts,—the south consisting of the Montagnes Noires (in Aude and Hérault), the Espinouses (in Tarn, Aveyron, and Hérault), the Garrigues (in Aveyron and Gard), and the Cévennes proper or Lozère or Gévaudan (in Lozère); and the north consisting of the Vivarais (in Árdèche). Sometimes there are also included in the name the Lyonnais (in Rhône) and the Charolais (in Saône-et-Loire). The average height is 3000 to 4000 feet; and the highest peaks are Mount Mezenc (in Ardèche), 5788 feet, and Mount Lozère, 4880. The principal rivers which take their rise in these mountains are the Loire, the Allier, the Lot, and the Tarn. The mountains consist of limestone, greywacke, and granite; and beds of trachyte and lava give evidence of former volcanic action. In the Cévennes are found iron, coal, lead, silver, copper, antimony, marble, and porphyry. The lower slopes are well cultivated; higher up good pasturage is found; while the summits are generally covered with forests of chestnut and pine. The Cévennes are famous as the retreats of the Albigenses, Waldenses, and Camisards.
