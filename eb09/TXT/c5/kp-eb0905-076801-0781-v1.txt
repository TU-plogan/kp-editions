CHUTIÁ (CHOTÁ) NÁGPUR TRIBUTA RY STATES. These are seven in number,—Sirguja, Udaipur, Jashpur, Gangpur, Bonái, Koriá, and Chang Bhakár. At the decline of the Marhattá power in the early part of this century these estates came under British protection. They are now under the political superintendence of the commissioner of Chutiá Nágpur, and the charge of them constitutes what is known as the South-West Frontier Agency Before the rise of the British power in India their chiefs exercised almost absolute sovereignty in their respective territories. The Ráj.ís now pay a light tribute to the British Government, and are invested with magisterial authority to punish offenders by fine not exceeding £5 or by imprisonment not exceeding two years. The states are mountainous, thinly cultivated, and inhabited for the most part by wild aboriginal tribes. They cover an area of 15,419 square miles, the largest states being Sirgujá and Gangpur. Their aggregate population amounts to 405,980 souls, giving an average of 26 persons to the square mile. No towns exist in the Tributary States, and only three villages contain more than 1000 inhabitants. The following is a brief description of each of the States :—

(1.) Sirgujá, the largest, lies between 22° 30' and 24° N. lat., and 82° 35 and 84° 10 E. long. It is bounded on the N. by the independent state of Rewá and the districts of Mirzápur and Lohárdágá, on the E. by the district of Lohárdágá, on the S. by the Biláspur district of the Central Provinces and the states of Udaipur and Jashpur, and on the W. by the state of Koriá. It is very hilly, with elevated table-lands affording good pasturages, and cut up by numerous ravines. The rivers are the Kanhar, Rer, Mahán, Son, and Santch, the last being formerly known as the Diamond River. Hot springs exist in the state. Extensive sál forests cover a large area, affording shelter to herds of wild elephants, antelopes, bisons, buffaloes, and many sorts of deer, and also to tigers, bears, and other beasts of prey. The area is 6103 square mues; the population in 1872, 182,831 souls, residing in 1295 villages and 36,463 houses :—classified, according to religion— Hindus 68,789, or 37'6 per cent.; Muhammadans 1370, or '8 per cent.; aborigines of the Dravidian stock 73,256, of the Kolarian stock 39,416, total 112,672, or 61'6 per cent. The principal agricultural products are rice, Indian corn, and other inferior cereíls, pulses, oilseeds, and cotton; the articles of export—clarified butter, grain, oilseeds, lac, gums, jungle silk cocoons (tasar), &c.; imports— brass and pewter vessels, piece goods, and ornaments. The places of trade are Bisrámpur, the capital of the state, 1’ratáppur, and Jhilmilí. The total revenue of the estates in Sirgujá in possession of the different members of the chief’s family is £7000; the rental of the personal estate of the Rájá, £3000; the expenditure on administration, £212. A small body of police is maintained by the Rájá, and he can at a short notice put himself at the head of 1000 fighting men. Sirgujá pays a tribute of £189 to the British Government.

The country is divided almost equally into high and low lands. The only river of importance is the Eb, in the bed of which diamonds are found, and from time immemorial its sands have been washed for gold. Jashpur iron, smelted by the Kols, is highly prized.

The rivers are the Eb and the Bráhmaní, formed here by the union of the Sankh and the Koel, both navigable by canoes. The Eb was formerly famous on account of diamonds found in its bed, and its sands are still explored for gold. One of the largest coal fields in India extends into the state.

(7.) Chang Bhakár state protrudes like a spur into the Rewá territory, which bounds it to the N., W., and S., the eastern side being bounded by the state of Koriá, of which it was formerly a fief. The natural scenery of the country consists of hills, ravines, and plateaus, covered with forests of sál, with small villages at distant intervals in the jungle. Herds of wild elephants commit sad havoc on the crops, which has caused the desertion of several villages. Area, 906 square miles; population, 8919, viz., 2728 Hindus, 34 Muhammadans, and 6157 aborigines. The chief has an income of about £300, and pays a tribute of £38, 12s. ^ (W. W. H.)
