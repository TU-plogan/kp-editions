CHELSEA, a city of the United States, in Suffolk county, Massachusetts, forming part of the suburbs of Boston. It is situated on the north bank of the Mystic River, which separates it from Charlestown, while Chelsea creek lies between it and East Boston. It communicates both with Charlestown and with East Boston by bridges. (See plan, vol. iv. p. 731). Its public buildings comprise the city hall, Winnisimmet hall, the naval hospital, the marine hospital, an academy of music, a free public library opened in 1870, a high school, a national bank, and about a dozen churches; and among its industrial establishments are several foundries, brick-works, worsted factories, soapworks, and oilworks, a manufactory of washing machines, a brewery, and a salt-refinery. It is supplied with water from the works in Charlestown, which are fed by the Mystic River. In 1871 there were 3092 houses in the city, and in 1874 the population amounted to 20,695, showing an increase since 1830 of 19,925. The first settlement dates from 1630, and in the following year Winnisimmet ferry was established. Till 1738 the place itself was known as Winnisimmet, and was regarded as part of Boston, but in that year it was organized as a separate town, for the convenience of its inhabitants, who found it difficult to attend the municipal meetings of the city. In 1857 it obtained a city-charter of its own.
