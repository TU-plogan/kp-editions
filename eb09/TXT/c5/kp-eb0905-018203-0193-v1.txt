CASSANDER, George (1515-1566), a Flemish theologian, was born at Cadzand (whence his name), a village in Zeeland. He was for some time professor of classics and theology at Bruges and .Ghent; but most of his life was spent in the endeavour to effect a reunion of the Roman Catholic and Protestant churches. In 1561 he published De Officio Pii Viri in hoc Dissidio Religionis, in which he argues that no one has a right, on account of a few abuses, utterly to subvert the church; but, on the other hand, he expresses his disagreement with those who regard the Pope as a deity. His standard is Scripture, explained by the tradition of the fathers, especial deference being paid to those who lived before Gregory I. Four years later, in 1Õ65, he published his famous Consultatio de Articulis Fidei inter Papistas et Protestantes controversis, in which he strives to put a Catholic interpretation into each of the articles of the Confession of Augsburg. Both these books were fiercely attacked by Calvin; and they were also both condemned by the Council of Trent. Cassander’s complete works were published at Paris in 1616.
