CHOCOLATE is a preparation from the seeds of the cocoa or cacao tree {Theobroma Cacao), used as food. The term is corrupted from the Mexican name chocolatl, and the preparation was in use in Central America before the discovery of the Western Continent by Columbus. For the history of the plant and other details see under Cocoa. At the present day the general distinction between the preparations known as chocolate and cocoa respectively is that the former embraces the forms prepared as cakes or stiff paste, while prepared cocoa is chiefly sold as a powder or simply the ground nibs of the seed. Chocolate is prepared usually from the finer varieties of cocoa seeds by first roasting, and. then shelling, or depriving the seeds of their husks. They are then ground up to a very fine uniform paste on a hot plate or bed, the heat of which, by melting the fat, present in seeds to the extent of about 50 per cent, keeps the paste in a fluid condition. To the ground seeds a proportion of sugar, with sometimes arrowroot, and some flavouring essence, most commonly either vanilla or cinnamon, are added, and when thoroughly incorporated the semi-fluid paste is cast into moulds. In addition to being used as a diet drink, a very large quantity of chocolate, specially prepared under various forms for eating, is now consumed as a sweetmeat, and it forms at once a most wholesome, nutritious, and palatable confection. The French and Italians have long excelled in the manufacture of chocolate; but the varieties made by English manufacturers are also deservedly in high repute.
