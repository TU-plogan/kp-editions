CHURCHYARD, Thomas (1520-1604), “the Nestor of the Elizabethan heroes,” was born at Shrewsbury in 1520, and was educated at Oxford. At seventeen he went to court, where he roistered through such money as he had. He then became attached to the earl of Surrey, applying himself during his three or four years of service to books, music, and the practice of poetry. He served his first campaign in Flanders (1542-1544) against the French, and his second (1547) in »Scotland. He fought at Pinkie, but was captured next year at St Monance, and did not return to England till 1550. A tract called David Dicads Dream, written at this time, not only involved Churchyard in a fierce quarrel with a contemporary scribbler, but brought down on him the censure of the Privy Council; he only escaped the pillory through the interest of his patron, the duke of Somerset. A third campaign took him to Ireland, whence he returned in 1552. Having been unsuccessful in a love suit, he once more betook himself to the Continent, to serve his fourth campaign, at Metz and elsewhere, under the great emperor. His absence extended over three years. On his return he began writing harder than ever, dedicating two of his works to Queen Mary. The war with France made him a lieutenant in the English army, and at Guines he acted as mediator between the besieged and the besiegers. He next addressed a poetical appeal to Elizabeth; he got nothing, however, but fair words, and had to write his Tragédie of Lord Mowbray, a contribution to the Mirrour for Magistrates. He fought at the leaguer of Leith in 1560; he again attempted fortune as a courtier; and he went off to Ireland, campaigning under Henry Sidney. In 1566 he wandered to Antwerp, where he headed a great force of religious partizans; but he speedily had to fly the country by reason, he says, of his extreme moderation. Next year he went back as one of Oxford’s agents, returning to England in 1569, when he married. In 1593, after another journey to Scotland, where he witnessed Morton’s execution, Elizabeth gave him a pension; and eleven years later, immediately after the publication of his last work, the Blessed Balm to Search and Salve Sedition, he died. Churchyard seems to have been an active, garrulous, and cheerful adventurer. Strype praises him as a good soldier and poet and a man of honest principles. Of his multifarious publications the Legend of Jane Shore is most highly esteemed, while the Worthinesse of Wales (1587) and Churchyard’s Chippes (1575) have been reprinted,—the former in 1776, the latter, by Mr Chalmers, in 1817.
