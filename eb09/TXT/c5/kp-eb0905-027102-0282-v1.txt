CAVE, Dr William (1637-1713), an English divine, was born at Pickwell in Leicestershire. He was educated at St John’s College, Cambridge, and became successively minister of Hasely in Oxfordshire, of All-Hallows the Great of Islington in London, and of Isleworth in Middlesex. He was chaplain to Charles IL, and in 1684 was installed as a canon of Windsor. The two works on which his reputation principally rests are the Apostolici, or History of Apostles and Fathers in the three first centuries of the church (1677), and Scriptorum Ecclesiasticorum Historia Liter arca (1688). The best edition of the latter is the Clarendon Press, 1740-3, which contains additions by the author and others. In both works he was drawn into controversy with Leclerc, who was then writing his Bibliothèque Universelle, and who accused him of partiality.

Besides these, he wrote Primitive Christianity, or Religion of the Ancient Christians, dec.; Tabulae Ecclesiasticae; Antiquitates Apos-tolicoe; A Dissertation concerning the Government of the Ancient Church, dec.; Ecclesiastici, or History of the Fathers of the 4th century ; and a work entitled Chartophylaχ Ecclesiasticus, which is an abridgment of the Historia Literaria.
