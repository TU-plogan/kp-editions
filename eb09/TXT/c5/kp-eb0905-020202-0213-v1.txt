CASTRO, Inez de (died 1355), called Collo de Garza, i,e., “Heron’s Neck,” was born in Spanish Galicia, in the earlier years of the 14th century. Tradition asserts that her father, Don Pedro Fernandez de Castro, and her mother, Doña Aldonça Soares de Villadares, a noble Portuguese lady, were unmarried, and that Inez and her two brothers were consequently of bastard birth. Educated at the semi-Oriental provincial court of Juan Manuel, duke of Peñafiel, Inez grew up side by side with Costança, the duke’s daughter by a scion of the royal house of Aragon, and her own cousin. After refusing several crowned heads in marriage, Costança was at last persuaded to accept the hand of the Infante Dorn Pedro, son of Alphonse the Proud, king of Portugal. In 1341 the two girls left Peñafiel; Costança’s marriage was celebrated in the same year, and the young Infanta and her cousin went to reside at Lisbon, ør at Coimbra, where Dorn Pedro conceived that luckless and furious passion for Inez which has immortalized them.

Morganatic marriages among the great were rather the rule than the exception in those times. The only person, therefore, who suffered in the contemplation of the lawless alliance between the Infante and Inez was Costança. In 1345, however, the Infanta died in childbed, and the widower was left in undisturbed possession of his mistress. A wayward violent man, bold and irresolute, of terrible passions, but subject to strange lapses of will, Dorn Pedro, doubtful, perhaps, of the illegitimacy of Inez, which debarred her from succession to the throne, took no steps to improve her position in the world’s eye till 1354, nine years after Costança’s death, when he married her in presence of the bishop of Guarda, and of several of the members of their household. No contract of marriage, however, nor documentary proof of any kind was created for this extraordinary occasion. In 1361 Dorn Pedro, then king of Portugal, swore solemnly to Castanhede, that he had been lawfully wedded to Inez; but in 1385 João De Regras had no difficulty whatever, in the absence of written evidence, in setting aside the title of her descendants to the throne.

Alphonso the Proud feared for his grandchild and his kingdom’s peace. The Castro family, as much dreaded in Spain as in Portugal, with Inez ready to mount the throne and her brother Pedro Fernandez de Castro rising daily higher in popularity and importance, had many enemies,— among others, three gentlemen, Alvaro Gonçalves, Pedro Coelho, and Diogo Lopes Pacheco. These men, hateful to and fearful of Pedro Fernandez, are said to have used their influence with Alphonso to persuade him to strike down the family through Inez. The old king listened, refused, wavered, and ended by yielding. He went in secret to the palace at Coimbra, where Inez and the Infante resided, accompanied by his three familiars, and by others who agreed with them. The beauty and tears of Inez disarmed his resolution, and he turned to leave her; but the gentlemen about him had gone too far to recede. Inez was stabbed to death, and was buried immediately in the Church of Santa Clara.

The Infante raised at once the flag of revolt against his father, and was only appeased by the concession of a large share in the government. The three murderers of Inez were sent out of the kingdom by Alphonso, who knew his son too well not to be aware that the vengeance Would be tremendous as the crime. They took refuge in Castile. In 1357, however, Alphonso died, and the Infante was crowned king of Portugal. Pedro the Cruel, his nephew, reigned over Castile; and the murderers were given up as soon as required. Diogo Lopes escaped through the gratitude of a beggar to whom he had formerly done a kindness; but Coelho and Gonçalves were executed, with horrible tortures, in the very presence of the king.

The story of the exhumation and coronation of the corpse of Inez has often been told. It is said that to the dead body, crowned and robed in royal raiment, and enthroned beside the king, the assembled nobility of Portugal paid homage as to its queen, swearing fealty on the withered hand of the corpse. The gravest doubts, however, exist as to the authenticity of this story; Fernão Lopes, the Portuguese Froissart, who is the great authority for the details of the tragedy of the death of Inez, with some of the actors in which he was personally acquainted, says nothing of the ghastly and fantastic ceremony, though he tells at length the tale of the funeral honours that Pedro the king bestowed upon his wife. Inez was buried at Alcobaça with extraordinary magnificence, in a tomb of white marble, surmounted by her crowned statue; and near her sepulchre Pedro caused his own to be placed. The monument, after repeatedly resisting the violence of curiosity, was broken into in 1810 by the French soldiery; the statue was mutilated, and the yellow hair was cut from the broken skeleton, to be preserved in reliquaries and blown away by the wind. The children of Inez shared her habit of misfortune. From her brother, however, Alvaro Perez de Castro, the house regnant of Portugal directly descends.
