CIVITA VECCHIA, a maritime city and port of the Roman territory, which gives its name to a “delegation,” or province.

The articles exported from Civita Vecchia are timber, sulphur, wool and silk, skins, decorative marbles, and anchovies. The imports consist of wines, forged iron, salt provisions, stock-fish, linen, woollen, and cotton cloths, silks, coffee, sugar, and general colonial produce.
