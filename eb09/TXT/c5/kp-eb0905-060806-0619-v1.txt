CHHINDWÁRÁ, a district of British India, in the Nerbudda division of the Central Provinces, situated between 21° 25' and 22° 50' N lat, and between 78° 0' and 79° 30' E. long. It is bounded on the N. by the districts of Hoshangábad and Narsinhpur, on the E. by Seoní, on the S. by Nágpur, and on the W. by Betul, and contains an area of 3852 square miles. The district has two distinct natural subdivisions—the hill country above the slopes of the Sátpurá Mountains, called the Bálághát, and a tract of low land to the south called the Zerghát. The high tableland of the Bálághát lies for the most part upon the great basaltic formation which stretches across the Sátpurás as far east as Jabalpur. The country consists of a regular succession of hills and fertile valleys, formed by the small ranges which cross its surface east and west. The average height of the uplands is 2500 feet, but there are many points of greater elevation. The appearance of the Zerghát below the hills is generally open and undulating. The [9:5:609] country is intersected by several streams, of which the Kanhán is the most considerable. Near the hills and along the streams are strips and patches of jungle; the villages are usually surrounded λvith picturesque groves of tamarind, mango, and other shade-giving trees. The total population of the district, as ascertained by the census of 1872, is 159,116 males and 156,979 females; total 316,095, classified as follows :—Hindus, 191,669; Muhammadans, 9747; Buddhists and Jains, 574; Christians, 105; “other denominations,” consisting of aboriginal tribes, 114,000. The average density of the population is 80 ’ 72 per square mile. Three towns are returned as containing a population of upwards of 5000, viz.: Chhindwárá, the administrative head-quarters of the district, population 8626; Lodhikerá, population 5219; and Pandhurna, population 5218. Important discoveries of coal have been made here of late years; it is estimated that the area under which coal lies is over 250 square miles, some of the seams being as much as 18 feet in thickness. The forests of Chhindwárá are very extensive, and lie principally on the southern slopes of the Sátpurás. The total revenue of the district in 1873-74 amounted to £31,513, of which £21,687, or 68’8 per cent., was derived from the land-tax. For the protection of person and property, and administration of justice, the district contains 6 magisterial and 5 civil and revenue courts, together with a regular police of 361 men of all ranks, maintained at a cost of £5037. The cost of the district officials and police amounted to £10,514. Two charitable dispensaries are maintained for the relief of the sick. In the hill country the climate is temperate and healthy. In the cold season ice is frequently seen in the small tanks at an elevation of about 2000 feet. Until May the hot wind is little felt, while during the rains the weather is cool and agreeable. The average annual rainfall amounts to 36 inches.

Chhindwárá, the principal town aud administrative head-quarters of the district of the same name, situated on the banks of the Bodrí nálá. The site of the town is 2200 feet above sea level, and is surrounded by ranges of low hills. The European station extends for nearly two miles in length, and is well wooded. It is considered very healthy, and forms a resort for European visitors from Nágpur and Kámthí during the hot weather. The conservancy arrangements are good, aud the town is clean and cheerful. The population of the town in 1872 was returned as follows :—Hindus, 6189; Muhammadans, 1865; Buddhists and Jains, 152; Christians, 105; others, 315; total, 8626.
