CAREW, Richard (1555-1620), author of the Survey of Cornwall, was born in 1555. At an early age he became a distinguished student of Christ Church, Oxford, and when only fourteen was chosen to dispute extemporaneously with Sir Philip Sidney, in presence of the earls of Leicester and Warwick and other noblemen. From Oxford he removed to the Middle Temple, where he spent three years, and then went abroad. On his return he was appointed sheriff of Cornwall, and published his Survey of the county, a work which enjoyed a high reputation, and has been several times reprinted. His other works are entitled— The Examination of Men’s Wits, a translation from the Italian, part of which is said to have been executed by his father; The True and Ready Way to learn the Latin Tongue, a tract included in Hartlib’s book on the same subject; and A Translation of the first Five Cantos of Tasso’s Gerusalemme. He died in 1620.
