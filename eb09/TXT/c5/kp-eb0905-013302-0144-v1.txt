CARRANZA, Bartolemé de (1503-1576), a Spanish primate and theologian, was bom of noble family at Miranda in Navarre, in 1503. He studied at the university of Alcala, and entered the Dominican order. The only Spaniard who could pretend to rival him in learning was Melchior Canus, and as professor of theology at Valladolid he gained so brilliant a reputation that students flocked thither from all parts of Spain to hear him. Charles V. selected him as envoy to the Council of Trent (1546). At this council he earnestly maintained that it was the duty of priests to reside in their benefices; and next year he (1547) followed up this appeal by publishing at Venice De necessaria residentia episcoporum et aliarum pastorum. He was also chosen by Charles to accompany to England the prince who afterwards became Philip II., on the visit which he made for the purpose of marrying Mary. Carranza became that queen’s confessor, and laboured very zealously for the re-establishment of Roman Catholicism. In 1557 Philip appointed him to the archbishopric of Toledo, a post he was very reluctant to accept, as he foresaw the jealousy which his promotion would arouse; and indeed the bishop of Lérida the very next year denounced him to the Inquisition as a heretic, taking as pretext his Commentarios sobre el catechismo Christiano, published that year at Antwerp, though that book was approved by a commission of the Council of Trent. It was placed in the Index Expurga· torius, and Carranza was imprisoned for eight years, after which, on appealing to Rome, he was taken thither and confined (1566-1576) in the castle of St Angelo. In 1576 he received final sentence, being made to abjure opinions which he had never held, suspended from his archbishopric for five years, and banished to the Dominican convent of Minerva. Seven days after this judgment he died. The people of Spain honoured him as a saint, and Gregory XĬIL placed a highly laudatory inscription on his tomb. His most famous work, Summa Conciliorum, first published at Venice in 1546, is of considerable value, and has been frequently reprinted.
