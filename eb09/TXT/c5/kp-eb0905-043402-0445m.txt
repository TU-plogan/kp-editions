CHARTREUSE, or more usually, to distinguish it from other establishments of the order, La Grande Chartreuse, a famous Carthusian monastery of France, in the department of Isère, situated about 14 miles north of Grenoble, at a height of 4268 feet above the level of the sea, in one of the upper valleys of a group of calcareous mountains, near the sources of the Guiers Mort and the Guiers Vif, two tributaries of the Rhone. The settlement was originally founded in 1084, and derived its name from a small village a short distance to the south-east, which w as formerly known simply as Chartreuse or Cartusia, but is now distinguished as Saint Pierre de Chartreuse. The first convent on the present site was not erected till 1137, and most of the present edifice is of a later date than 1676. It stands in a large meadow, which slopes to the south-west, and is watered by a tiny tributary of the Guiers Mort; on the north a fine forest rises up to the Col of La Ruchère, while on the west the valley is shut in by well-wooded heights, and on the east is overshadowed by [9:5:435] the white ridges of Grandsom, which rise upwards of 2500 feet above the convent roof. All access to the spot was formerly by difficult and defensible pathways; and before the construction of the modern roads, it was very seldom that alien visitors disturbed the monks in their retreat. One of the principal approaches is by the valley of the Guiers Mort, which the traveller enters at St-Laurent-duPont, a village of about 1800 inhabitants, with a deaf-mute institution supported by the Carthusians. Passing up the left bank of the stream he next reaches the picturesque hamlet of Fourvoirie (Latin forata via), so named from the road which was driven up the pass at the suggestion of Le Roux, the thirty-third general of the order, in the 16th century. It is the seat of iron forges, a saw-mill, a farm, and laboratories belonging to the monks; and it was formerly the site of the first gateway that guarded the entrance to their domain. The river is there spanned by a noble three-storied bridge of a single arch; and about three miles higher up is the bridge of St Bruno, which has replaced the older Pérant bridge still hanging in romantic dilapidation over the torrent. A short distance higher up begins the new part of the road constructed by Μ. Eugène Viaud in 1853-4; it soon leads through the narrow passage of the Oeillette or Aiguillette, formerly guarded by a second gateway, beyond which no female footstep was permitted; and after having passed through four separate tunnels, it brings the traveller in sight of the convent in about three hours from St-Laurent-du-Pont. Other routes of less interest are by the villages of Sappey and La Charmette. There is nothing very striking or beautiful about the architecture of the Chartreuse,—its principal features being the high roofs of dark slate and the cross-surmounted turrets. Within the buildings there are four halls for the reception of monks from the Carthusian provinces of France, Italy, Burgundy, and Germany, about sixty cells for the resident brethren, a church of the 15 th and 16 th centuries, several chapels, and a library, which before the Revolution contained a valuable collection both of books and manuscripts. A short distance from the main building is the infirmary, now set apart under the direction of the sisters of charity for the entertainment of female visitors. Since the revolutionary confiscation of 1793 the domain of Chartreuse has belonged to the state, and the monks, who were permitted to return to the monastery in 1816, pay a nominal rent for the use of the buildings and the right of pasturage, and have no longer any property in the neighbouring forests, which are in great measure due to their predecessors. Their revenue is augmented by the sale of various pharmaceutical preparations known as the Elixir, the Boule d’Acier (a mineral paste or salve), and the Chartreuse. In the manufacture of the last—a famous aromatic liqueur—carnations, absinthium, and the young buds of the pine tree are employed; there are three kinds —a green, a yellow, and a white—differing in degree of strength. The monks are distinguished by an active benevolence, the effects of which are visible in all the surrounding villages, where churches, schools, hospitals, and similar institutions have been erected and maintained at their expense.
