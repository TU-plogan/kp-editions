CHAMBÉRY (in Italian Ciamberi), a city of France, capital of the department of Savoy, pleasantly situated in a fertile district, between two hills, on the rivers Laisse and Albana, 46 miles S.S.W. of Geneva. The town, however, is irregularly and ill built, and has only two good streets—the Place Saint-Léger and the Rue de Boigne, of which the latter is named after a General Boigne who left a fortune of 3,400,000 francs to the town. The principal edifices are the cathedral, dating from the 14th and 15th centuries; the Hotel-Dieu, founded in 1647; the castle, a modern building serving as a prefecture, and preserving only a great square tower belonging to the original structure; the palace of justice, the theatre, the barracks, and the covered market, which dates from 1863. Several of the squares are adorned with fountains; the old ramparts of the city, destroyed during the French Revolution, have been converted into public walks; and various promenades and gardens have been constructed. Chambéry is the seat of an archbishop, and of a superior tribunal; and has also a Jesuit college, a royal academical society, a society of agriculture and commerce, a public library, with 20,000 vols., a museum, a botanic garden, and many charitable institutions. It manufactures silk-gauze, lace, leather, and hats, and has a considerable trade in liqueurs, wine, lead, copper, and other articles. Overlooking the town is the Rock of Lemenc, which derives its name from the Lemincum of the Romans; and in the vicinity is Charmettes, for some time the residence of Rousseau.

The origin of Chambery is unknown, but its lords are mentioned for the first time in 1029. In 1232 it was sold to the count of Savoy, Thomas I., who bestowed several important privileges on the inhabitants. As capital of the duchy of Savoy, it has passed through numerous political vicissitudes. From the middle of the 16th century to 1713 it was in the hands of the French; in 1742 it was captured by a Franco-Spanish army; and in 1792 it was occupied by the Republican forces. Restored to the house of Savoy by the treaties of Vienna and Paris, it was again surrendered to France in 1860. Among the famous men whom it has given to France, the most important are Vaugelas, Saint-Réal, and the brothers Joseph and Xavier de Maistre. Population of the town in 1872, 17,331, and of the commune, 19,144.
