CASSABA, or Casaba, a town of Asia Minor, in the sanjak of Manisa, 63 miles east of Smyrna, with which it is connected by rail. An abundant supply of water is conveyed to the town from a distance of two or three miles by an ancient aqueduct of very solid construction, which passes about 40 feet below the level of the soil, and is ventilated by air-shafts every 200 yards. Fountains are consequently numerous, and a stream of water flows down the middle of many of the streets; but the lack of underground sewers keeps the channels in a very filthy condition. There is a large bazaar, and a very flourishing trade is carried on in the produce of the surrounding district. Cotton is the most important article, and there are four ginning factories in the town; the silk-worm is largely raised and exported; and the “melons of Cassaba” are sent not only to Smyrna but to Constantinople. The influence of the connection with Smyrna is shown by the comparative neglect of several Eastern customs and the [9:5:182] very general use of the Greek language. Though no identification has been attempted, the town probably occupies the site of some ancient city; it is only 21 miles distant from the ruins of Sardis. Its population is estimated at 15,000, of whom about 10,000 are Turks and the rest Greeks and Armenians. In 1865 a large number of houses were destroyed by fire, and the inhabitants were decimated by cholera.
