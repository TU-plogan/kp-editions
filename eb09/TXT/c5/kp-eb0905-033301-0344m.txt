CENEDA, a district in the province of Treviso, Northern Italy, so called from the city of the same name. Its population has varied as follows:—1807, 22,718; 1844. 18,986; 1855, 37,510; 1862, 38,443. It is a highly picturesque region at the foot of the Alps, fertile in corn and wine, the white kind of which has considerable local celebrity. The olives which formerly abounded have almost disappeared. There are saline springs near the [9:5:334] town, which are among the richest in iodine of any known, the proportion being 0 ’ 4032 of iodine in 10,000 parts of water. They are much used by the inhabitants of the neighbouring districts. The little city of Ceneda is charmingly situated on the last slope of the hills inclined from west to east, and has the reputation of being especially healthy. The Emperor Berengarius held a court of justice here, when he gave by diploma to the bishop of Ceneda, which had its own body of statutes compiled in 1339 and published in 1609, the jurisdiction of the whole territory lying between the rivers Piave and Livenza from the Alps to the sea. In the cathedral, a building of the middle of the last century on the site of an older one, there are some not very remarkable paintings of Palma Giovine, Bonifacio, and Tintoretto. The town hall has some good frescoes of Pomponio Amalteo in its “loggia,” and a curious series of portraits within of the bishops of Ceneda, and another of the Podestàs, with the arms of each. The origin of the city, which very numerous finds of urns, inscriptions, coins, lachrymatories, and other objects prove to have existed under the Romans, is uncertain. At the period of the Gothic and Lombard invasions it was a place of some military importance. Alaric fortified it strongly. The Emperor Honorius subsequently gave it with the title of county to one Marcellus. Attila devastated it in 450. The sovereignty of the district was the subject of long contests between the neighbouring counts of Camino and the bishops, with the gradual result of subjecting the city and its district to the republic of Venice, which, however, permitted the bishops and the ancient council of notables to exercise some rights of sovereignty even down to 1776.

It should be added that Ceneda has recently changed its name to Vittorio. This absurd abnegation of its past history has had some little show of reason to excuse it. Ceneda and the neighbouring commune of Serra valle were for many generations hereditary enemies. When the province of Venice was restored to Italy it was determined, among other festive and fraternizing doings, that these two communes should henceforth form but one, to be known as Vittorio,—an appellation which seems to have succeeded in supplanting the old historical name more entirely than usually occurs in similar cases.
