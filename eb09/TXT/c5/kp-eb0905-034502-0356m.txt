CERDONIANS, a Gnostic sect, founded by Cerdo, a Syrian, who came to Rome about 140, but concerning whose history little is known. They held that there are two first causes—the perfectly good and the perfectly evil. The latter is also the creator of the world, the god of the Jews, and the author of the Old Testament. Jesus Christ is the son of the good deity; he was sent into the world to oppose the evil; but his incarnation, and therefore his sufferings were a mere appearance. Regarding the body as the work of the evil deity, the Cerdonians formed a moral system of great severity, prohibiting marriage, wine, and the eating of flesh, and advocating fasting and other austerities. Origen attributes to Cerdo the opinion,— which was certainly held by the more famous Marcion, his contemporary and, in some respects at least, his follower,— that there are three first causes—the perfectly good, the perfectly evil, and the imperfect, whom Marcion calls “the just” (το δίκαιον), and who is the creator of the world and the god of the Jews. Besides the Old Testament, Cerdo rejected also the New, except part of Luke’s Gospel and of St Paul’s Epistles. See Marcion and Gnostics.
