CAPE HAYTIEN, or Cap Haïtien, a town on the north coast of the island of San Domingo in the republic of Hayti, about 19° 46' N. lat. and 72° 14' W. long. Its original Indian name was Guarico; and it has also been known at various times as Cabo Santo, Cap Français, and Cape Henry, while it is familiarly designated as simply Le Cap. It is situated at the foot of a fine range of mountains on a small bay, and possesses a secure and commodious harbour. Its trade is principally with the United States. It has declined considerably from the flourishing condition to which it attained during the French supremacy, when it was the seat of an archbishop, and possessed a university and academies of music and painting, but it is still one of the chief towns of the republic, and is the seat of a civil and criminal court and a tribunal of commerce. It was originally founded by Spaniards from the island of Tortuga, and possesses an eventful history. In 1695 it was burnt by the English; and shortly after the revocation of edict of Nantes it received a French colony. In 1791 it was captured and burnt by Toussaint L’Ouverture; and in almost all the revolutions of the island since that date it has suffered severely. In 1842 it was almost destroyed by an earthquake. The troops of Salnave, who were in possession in 1865, having insulted the British flag, Captain Wake bombarded the town and blew up the arsenal. In 1869 the followers of Saget made themselves masters of the place. The population at present is estimated at 12,000; but in last century it is said to have exceeded 38,000.
