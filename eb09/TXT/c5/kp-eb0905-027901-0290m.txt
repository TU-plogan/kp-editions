CAXAMARCA, or Cajamarca, a city of Peru, capital of a province of the same name, in the department of Truxillo, in 7° 7' S. lat. and 78° 3Γ W. long. It is situated on the east side of the Western Andes, in a fertile valley on the Eriznejas, at an elevation of about 9060 feet above sea-level, 72 miles N.N.E. of Truxillo. The streets are regular and, wide; but the houses are mostly built of clay. The principal buildings are the fine parish church, erected at the expense of Charles II. of Spain, the church of San Antonio, the Franciscan monastery, a nunnery, and the remains of the palace of Atahualpa, the last of the Incas of Peru, who was put to death there by the Spaniards in 1533. At a short distance to the east of the town are the deep sulphur springs of Pultamarca, called the Banos del Inca, or Inca*s Baths, which have a temperature of 156° Fahr., and are still much frequented. The manufactures of Caxamarca are woollen and linen goods, and steel and silver articles; also biscuits, which are much esteemed. Much trade is carried on with Truxillo; and a railway connects the town with the port of Pacasmayo. Population, about 12,000.
