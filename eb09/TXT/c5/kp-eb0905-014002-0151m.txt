CARTAGENA, or Carthagena, a seaport town on the northern coast of South America, in the United States of Colombia, in 10° 25' 48" lat. and 75° 34' W. long. It is situated on a low sandy island, which, with the island south of it, Tierra Bomba, forms the harbour of Cartagena. To the east of the town, and connected with it and the mainland by bridges, is the suburb of Xiximani, on another island. The houses of Cartagena are of stone, with lattices and balconies of wood, and are regularly built, but mostly only one story high. The streets are well-paved, but dark and narrow; arrangementshave lately been made for lighting them by petroleum gas. The principal buildings are the fortresses, some convents and churches, and the public hospitals. The town possesses a park and a theatre. The large cisterns in the walls contain a supply of excellent water. The mean temperature of Cartagena is about 83° Fahr. In the summer the heat is excessive, and yellow fever often commits great ravages; leprosy, also, is not unfrequent. The harbour, which is second to none on the north coast of South America, covers 40,000 acres; it affords complete security to ships in all weathers, and great facilities for loading and unloading. It is divided into three sections, Boca Grande and Pascaballos, and the Caldera, which have a depth of about 15 fathoms; and Boca Chica, which is deeper. The entrance to Boca Chica [9:5:141] is defended by the two forts—Angelo and San Fernando. Its narrowness, the shallows at its mouth, and the irregularity of the tides render a pilot necessary for ships passing through it. The roadstead for large vessels is about three miles from the city. A chain of salt-lakes, which open into the Bay of Cartagena to the S.W., and extend towards the Magdalena, in a valley through which that river may at one time have flowed, was taken advantage of by the Spaniards in former times for the construction of a canal. Very little cutting seems to have been necessary, except at Calamar, the point of junction with the river. During the War of Independence the old channel became choked up; it was reopened, however, in 1846, after which the flooding of the valley rendered the channel once more unnavigable, except for barges of light draught. On account of the closing of the Digue, the rival port of Baranguilla has been created, and a great amount of commerce has been transferred to Santa Martha. The rapidly-increasing requirements of trade in Colombia, and the great superiority of Cartagena as a shipping depot, cannot fail, however, of securing before long the reopening of the route by the Digue. The imports of Cartagena from the United Kingdom are cotton goods, linen and woollen cloth, crockeryware, glass, cutlery and hardware. The exports are sugar, tobacco, coffee, cotton, dividivi and dye woods, ivory-nuts, balsam of Tolu, caoutchouc, cocoa-nuts and fibre, and hides. Most of the cotton is obtained from wild plants, and the export is falling off year by year, as is also that of caoutchouc, from the wasteful cutting down of the indiarubber trees. The cultivation of sugar bids fair to succeed, for the climate and rich soil are adapted for the growth of the cane. The difficulty of obtaining labour has hitherto been a clog on agricultural enterprise in Cartagena. The value of bullion exported from Cartagena on British account in the year ending August 31, 1873, was £6237. The value of the imports was £153,160; the customs revenues, £41,400. There are no duties on exports. The number of vessels which entered the port in 1873 was 50, tonnage 30,637. The population of Cartagena, formerly estimated at 28,000, is now about 9000 only; four-fifths of these are black or coloured people. The town of Cartagena is the chief naval arsenal of New Granada. It was founded in 1533 by Pedro de Heredia; in 1544 it was seized by the French; it was taken in 1585 by Sir Francis Drake, and in 1697 by the French, who obtained from it over a million of money. In 1741 Vernon unsuccessfully besieged the town. It was taken by Bolivar in 1815, and surrendered to the royalists in the same year. Finally, it was captured by the republicans, September 25, 1821.
