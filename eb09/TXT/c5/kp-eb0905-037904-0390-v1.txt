CHAMBERLAIN (Latin camerarius, from camera, a chamber; French chambellan), etymologically, and also historically to a large extent, an officer who superintends the arrangement of domestic affairs. Such were the chamberlains of monasteries, and the chamberlains of cathedrals, who had charge of the finances, gave notice of chapter meetings, and provided the materials required for various services. A royal chamberlain is an officer whose function is in general to attend on the person of the sovereign, and regulate the etiquette of the palace. The Roman emperors appointed this officer under the title of cubicularius. During the Middle Ages, the royal chamberlain usually enjoyed the important privilege of keeping the king’s signet ring; and it seems that the mayoralty of the palace, which gradually acquired such an authority as to overthrow the Merovingian dynasty in France, grew out of an office corresponding to that of the chamberlain. The chamberlain of the Pope enjoys very extensive powers, having the revenues of the church under his charge. In France, the office existed from very early times till the reign of Louis XIV., and was revived by Napoleon.

The Lord Great Chamberlain of England originally took rank after the Lord Privy Seal. The office is hereditary, and belonged at one time to the De Veres, from whom it descended by the female line into the family of Bertie. On the death of the fourth duke of Ancaster in 1777, it passed to the houses of Cholmondeley and Willoughby d’Eresby. From these families alternately a Lord Great Chamberlain is appointed on the death of the reigning monarch. The principal duties of this office are to take charge of the houses of parliament, and to attend on the sovereign at his coronation.

The Lord Chamberlain is an officer distinct from the Lord Great Chamberlain, and of greater importance, though his functions are less responsible than they were formerly. He is regarded as chief officer of the royal household; he has charge of a large number of appointments, such as those of the royal physicians, tradesmen, and private attendants of the sovereign; he is licenser of plays; and he examines the claims of those who desire to be presented at court. He is a member of the privy council, and holds office during the ascendency of the political party to which he belongs.

Many corporations appoint a chamberlain. The most important in England is the chamberlain of the corporation of the city of London, who is treasurer of the corporation, admits persons entitled to the freedom of the city.

and determines disputes between masters and apprentices. He is elected annually by the liverymen.
