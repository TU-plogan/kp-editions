CHARLES XV. (1826-1872), king of Sweden and Norway, succeeded to the throne in 1859, on the death of his father, Oscar I., son of Charles XIV. His rule was popular and liberal. The most important event in his reign was the change which was effected in 1866 in the constitution of the Storthing, or parliament, which, from that time has consisted not of four but of two chambersâ€”the first being elected by the provincial representatives, the second by the people. In character Charles was generous and kindly, and his disposition is shown in his refusal to sanction capital punishment. He possessed considerable taste for literature and art, and published a volume of poems, which were translated into German by A. Van Winderfeld (Berlin, 1866). In 1850 he married Louisa, daughter of the king of the Netherlands, by whom he had one daughter, Louisa, who became the wife of Prince Frederick of Denmark. His relations with Denmark were of the most intimate kind, owing to his personal friendship with the king; but during the struggle of that country against the aggressions of Prussia he was obliged to remain neutral, since neither Sweden nor Norway would take up arms. Charles died September 18, 1872.
