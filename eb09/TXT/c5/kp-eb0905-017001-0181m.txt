CARY, Henry Francis (1772-1844), translator of Dante, and miscellaneous writer, was born at Gibraltar, December 6, 1772. He was the son of a captain in the army, and was educated at Christ Church, Oxford, which he entered at the age of eighteen, having two years earlier made his appearance as an author, in a volume of Sonnets and Odes. In 1796 he took his master’s degree, and having entered the church was presented, in the following year, to the vicarage of Abbott’s Bromley in Staffordshire. This benefice he held till his death. In 1800 he was also presented to the vicarage of Kingsbury in Warwickshire. While still at Christ Church he had devoted much time to the study of modern literature, not only English but French and Italian; and the fruits of his studies in these fields appeared in the notes to his translation of Dante, the work on which his reputation now chiefly rests. The version of the Inferno was published in 1805, together with the original text. The version of the whole Divina Commedia did not appear till 1814. It attracted little attention for some years. But when Coleridge, in his lectures at the Royal Institution spoke of it in terms of high praise, the world was persuaded to acknowledge its merits. It gradually took its place among “standard” works, and passed through four editions in the translator’s lifetime. It has the great merits of accuracy, idiomatic vigour, and readableness, and, although many rivals have since appeared in the field, still holds its honourable place. Its blank verse, however, cannot represent the close woven texture and the stately music of the terza rima of the original· In 1824 Cary published a translation of The Birds of Aristophanes. Two years later he was appointed assistant-librarian in the British Museum, a post which he held for about eleven years. He resigned in consequence of being refused the appointment, in ordinary course on a vacancy, to the post of keeper of the printed books. From this time he applied himself to literary work on his own account, for which his duties at the museum had left him little opportunity. For the old London Magazine he wrote a series of Lives of the early French Poets, and Lives of English Poets (from Johnson to Henry Kirke White), the latter intended as a continuation of Johnson’s Lives of the Poets. These works were published in a collected form in 1846. He was also engaged in editing the works of Cowper, Milton, Pope, and other poets. He published about 1834 a translation of the Odes of Pindar, and at the time of his death was preparing a body ot illustrative notes for a new edition. A pension of £200 per annum was conferred on Cary by Lord Melbourne in 1841. He died in London, August 14, 1844, and his remains were interred in Westminster Abbey. A memoir of his life, with his literary journal and letters, was published in two volumes by his son, the Rev. Henry Cary, Μ. A, in 1847.
