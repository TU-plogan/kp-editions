CESENA (Lat. Coesena, or Coesenia), an episcopal city of Emilia, in the province of Forli, a station on the railroad between Bologna and Ancona, gives its name to a “circondario” and to two subdivisions or “mandamenti” of the same. Population of circondario in 1862, 77,489. A very fertile region, it makes good white wine of some reputation, rears silk-worms to some extent, and has some sulphur mines, lignite, and specially good brick clay; but its principal source of wealth is its hemp, deemed the best in the north of Italy. The city (15 miles E. of Forli, 25 N. of Rimini, 17⅛ S. of Ravenna) has 7777 inhabitants, and lies where the Apennine melts into the plain, at the foot of the Monte Garampo, on which once stood the ancient cathedral, replaced by another of debased Gothic architecture, built in the 15th century, in which are some works of Donatello. On the hill above the city are also the imposing ruins of the castle, believed to have been built by the Emperor Frederick II. The famous sanctuary of Madonna del Monte, with its church by Bramante, is also a prominent object in the landscape. The town, irregularly but well built, and divided by the little river Cesola, has several interesting buildings. The town hall is of good mediaeval architecture, and possesses a very fine Francia, a Sassoferrato, and some other interesting pictures. Cesena has a large and handsome theatre, some fine palaces of the provincial noble families, and a cemetery of which it is specially proud,—one of the handsomest and best ordered in Italy The little city has an interesting history of its own, full of eventful changes. It fell in the 4th century under the tyranny of the Malatesta family, one of the worst races of the Italian mediaeval tyrants. But it was perpetually rebelling, and occasionally recovering its Iiberty and autonomy. Dante, in the 27th canto of the Inferno, characterizes Cesena as living midway between tyranny and freedom, even as she is placed physically between the mountains and the plain. In 1859 Cesena was among the first of the cities of the Romagna which threw off the Papal yoke.
