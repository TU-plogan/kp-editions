CHITTAGONG, a district of British India, in the division of the same name (which also comprises the districts of Noákhálí, Tipperah, Chittagong Hill Tracts, and Independent Hill Tipperah), under the jurisdiction of the lieutenant-governor of Bengal, lies between 20° 45' and 22° 59' N. lat., and 91° 30' and 92° 23' E. long. It is bounded on the N. by Hill Tipperah and the Chittagong Hill Tracts, E. by the Chittagong Hill Tracts and Arákán, S. by Arákán, and W. by the Bay of Bengal. It consists of a strip of low-lying land along the Bay of Bengal, about 165 miles in length, and of an average breadth of 50 miles. A few unimportant ranges rise within the north-eastern portion,—the highest hill being the sacred Sítákund, 1155 feet high. Lofty mountains separate Chittagong district from Upper Burmah. The principal rivers are the Karnaphulí, on which Chittagong town is situated, navigable by sea-going ships and steamers as far as Chittagong port, and by large trading boats for a considerable distance higher up, and the Háldá and the Sangu, which are also navigable by large boats. Several creeks afford means of communi cation with the interior. The wild animals are tigers, elephants, rhinoceros, leopards, and deer. The area extends to 2498 square miles, of which one-third is cultivated, or capable of cultivation. The census of 1872 returns the population at 1,127,402. According to religion, the Hindus numbered 301,138, or 26 - 7 percent.; Muhammadans, 795,013, or 70 - 5 per cent.; Buddhists, 30,149, or 2 ’ 7 per cent.; Christians, 1084 or ’ 1 per cent.; and persons of unspecified religion, 18. The Christian population chiefly consists of the half-caste descendants of the early Portuguese adventurers, or “Firinghis.” The principal articles of trade are rice, which is exported by sea; cotton, brought down from the hills for use in the district; Liverpool salt, imported by sea; bamboo and thatching grass for building purposes; betel-nut, dried fish, petroleum from Burmah,tea, poultry, and miscellaneous articles of food. Revenue of the district in 1870-71, £221,116; expenditure, £56,035. The police force in 1872 consisted of 436 men and officers of the regular police, 62 of the municipal police, 2648 of the village watch, making a total strength of 3146 officers and men, costing £14,185. In 1872-73 the Education Department had under its inspection 88 schools attended by 3512 pupils, and maintained at a total cost of £2168, 8s. The climate of Chittagong is comparatively cool, owing to the sea breeze which prevails during the day; but for the same reason, the atmosphere is very moist, with heavy dews at night and fogs. The average annual temperature is 77° Fahr.; the average rainfall for the 13 years ending 1872, 106.50 inches. Chittagong was ceded to the East Indian Company by Nawáb Mir Kásim in 1760.

Chittagong Port, or Islámábád, the principal town of the above district, is situated on the right bank of the Karnaphulí River, in 22° 20' 55" N. lat. and 91° 52' 35" E. long. The river is here navigable by ships of 20 feet draught, and the port has long been a place of considerable maritime trade. In 1870-71, 215 vessels arrived at the port, with a tonnage of 52,891; and 207 left, with a tonnage of 51,587; total value of imports, £182,765; ditto of exports, £276,019. Shipbuilding is carried on to a considerable extent. The town is an agglomeration of small villages, spread over an area of 9 square miles. In 1872, the population amounted to 20,604 souls, viz.—4687 Hindus, 15,051 Muhammadans, 122 Buddhists, and 744 Christians. The municipal income amounted in 1871 to £2136, 12s., and the expenditure to £2381, 6s.
