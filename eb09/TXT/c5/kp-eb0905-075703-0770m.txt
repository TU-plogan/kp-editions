CHUNAR, or Chunarghuk, a town and. ancient fortress of India, in the district of Mirzapur, in the North-West Provinces, situated on the south bank of the Ganges. The fort [9:5:758] occupies a conspicuous site on the summit of an abrupt rock which commands the river. It was at one time a place of great strength, and still contains a magazine, and is fortified with batteries. In the old citadel on the height, the remains of a Hindu palace with some interesting carvings indicate the former importance of the place. The town, which consists of one or two straggling streets, contains a handsome English church. Chunar is first mentioned in the 16th century, when in possession of Sing Joanpore. In 1530 it became the residence of Shere Khan the Afghan, and forty-five years later was recovered by the Emperor Akbar after sustaining a siege of six months. It fell into the hands of the English under General Carnac in 1763 after a prolonged resistance which caused considerable loss to the assailants. A treaty with the nabob of Oudh was signed here by Hastings on behalf of the East India Company, in September 1781. Population, 11,000.
