CELESTINE, the name of five popes.

Celestine I. was a Roman, and is supposed to have been a near relative of the Emperor Valentinian. Various portions of the liturgy are attributed to him, but without any certainty on the subject. He held the Council of Ephesus in which the Nestorians were condemned, in 431. Four letters written by him on that occasion, dated all of them lõth March 431, together with a few others, to the African bishops, to those of Illyria, of Thessalonica, and of Narbonne, are extant in retranslations from the Greek, the Latin originals having been lost. He actively persecuted the Pelagians, and was zealous for Roman orthodoxy. He sent Palladius, a Greek, to Scotland, and Patricius (St Patrick) to Ireland. He raged against the Novatians in Rome, imprisoning their bishop, and forbidding their worship. He was zealous in refusing to tolerate the smallest innovation on the constitutions of his predecessors, and is recognized by the church as a saint. He occupied the seat of St Peter eight years five months and three days, and died on the 6th April 432. He was buried in the cemetery of St Priscilla in the Via Salaria, but his body, subsequently moved, lies now in the Church of St Prasside.

Celestine II. was elected in 1143, governed the church only five mouths and thirteen days, died 9th March 1144, and was buried at the Lateran. His name had been Guido di Castello, from the small town of which he was a native. He had studied under Peter Abelard. The principal act of his Papacy was the absolution of Louis VII. of France at the request of that penitent monarch, and the removal of the interdict under which that country had lain for three years.

Celestine III., Giacinto Bobone Orsini, of that noble race, was elected Pope 30th March 1191, being then only a deacon, received priest’s orders on the 13th of April, ruled the church six years, nine months, aad nine days (though believed to have been ninety when elected), died 8th January 1193, and was buried at the Lateran. He crowned the Emperor Henry VI. on the day after his election with a ceremonial symbolizing his absolute supremacy, as described by Roger Hoveden, who is believed (more reasonably as it would seem) by Baronius, but discredited by Natalis Alexander. He subsequently excommunicated the same Henry for wrongfully keeping Richard of England in prison. In 1192 he confirmed the statutes of the Teutonic Order of Knights. He would have resigned the Papacy, and recommended a successor shortly before his death, bat was not suffered to do so by the cardinals.

Celestine IV., Godfrey Castiglioni of Milan, a nephew of Urban III., became a monk at Hautecombe in Savoy, there wrote a history of Scotland, and was elected Pope by seven cardinals only, in the midst of troubles caused by the vicinity and violence of the Emperor Frederick IL, on the 22d September 1241. He occupied the throne only seventeen days, died, before consecration, on the 8th October 1241, and was buried at the Vatican.

Celestine V. was known before his election as Peter di Morone. Born in 1215, the son of a peasant in the Neapolitan district, named Angelario, he became a Benedictine m >nk at Faifoli in the diocese of Benevento when he was seventeen. He showed from the first an extraordinary disposition to asceticism and solitude, and in 1239 retired to a solitary cavern on the mountain Morone, whence his name. Five years later he left this retreat, and betook himself, with two companions, to a similar cave on the Mountain of Majella in the Abruzzi, where he lived as strictly as was possible according to the example of St John the Baptist. Terrible accounts are given of the severity of his penitential practices. While living in this manner he founded, in 1244, the order subsequently called after him Celestines. (See Celestines.) The cardinals assembled at Perugia after the death of Nicholas IV., and after long dissensions and difficulties agreed as a means of escaping from them to elect the hermit Pietro di Morone. When sent for he obstinately refused to accept the Papacy, and even, as Petrarch says,^[1. De Vit. Solit.,∖i∖>. ii. sec. 3, ch. 18.] attempted flight, till he was at length persuaded by a deputation of cardinals accompanied by the kings of Naples and Hungary. Elected 7th July 1294, he was crowned in the city of Aquila in the Abruzzi, 29th August. He issued two decrees,—one confirming that of Gregory X., which orders the shutting of the cardinals in conclave; the second declaring the right of any Pope to abdicate the Papacy,—a right he, at the end of five months and eight days, proceeded himself to exercise at Naples on the 13th December 1294. He did one other thing which may be noted, because it seems to be the only instance known to the church in which such a thing occurred. He empowered one Francis of Apt, a Franciscan friar, to confer priest’s orders on Lodovico, son of Charles, king of Sicily,—a fact which seems to have escaped the notice of Bingham, who says that such a thing was never done.^[2. Orig. Eccl., liTχ, ii. cap. 3, sec. 5.] In the formal instrument of his renunciation he recites as the causes moving him to the step, “the desire for humility, for a purer life, for a stainless conscience, the deficiencies of his own physical strength, his ignorance, the perverseness of the people, his longing for the tranquillity of his former life ;” and having divested himself of every outward symbol of dignity, he retired to his old solitude. He was not allowed to remain there, however. His successor, Boniface VIII., sent for him, and finally, despite desperate attempts of the late Pope to escape, got him into his hands, and imprisoned him in the castle of Fumone near Ferentino in Campagna, where, after languishing for ten months in that infected air, he died on the 19th May 1296. He was buried at Ferentino, but his body was subsequently removed to Aquila. Many Dantescan commentators and scholars have thought that the poet stigmatized Celestine V. in the enigmatical verse which speaks of him “Che fece per viltate il gran rifiuto.”^[3. ‘ ‘ Who made from cowardice the grea' refusal,” Inferno, canto iii. line 60.] Recent opinion on the point more reasonably rejects this interpretation. Celestine V., like the first of the name, is recognized by the church as a saint.
