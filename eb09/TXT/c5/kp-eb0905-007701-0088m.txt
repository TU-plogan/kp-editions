CAPPEL, the name of a family of distinguished theologians, scholars, and jurisconsults, of whom the following are the most important. Guillaume Cappel, in 1491, as rector of the university of Paris, had the boldness to forbid the payment of the tithe demanded by Pope Innocent VIIL His son Jacques, jurisconsult and councillor of state under Francis I., is famous for the speech which he delivered in 1537 before the king and nobility of France against Charles V. and the counts of Flanders, Artois, and Charolais. His son, Louis Cappel, sieur de Moniambert (1534-1586), who began life as professor of Greek at Bordeaux, and ended his days as professor of theology at> Sedan, is remarkable for his devotion to the cause of Protestantism, for the sake of which he risked his life on more than one occasion. It was he who, in 1560, presented to Charles IX. the Confession of Faith which had been drawn up by the Parisian Protestants. Another son, Jacques Cappel (1570-1624), was a distinguished jurisconsult. He was the father of Jacques Cappel, author of a number of works of considerable celebrity on theology, history, philology, and antiquities, and of Louis Cappel, noticed below.
