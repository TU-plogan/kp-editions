CHUTIA or CHOTÁ NÁGPUR, a division or commissionership of British India, under the lieutenant-governor of Bengal, comprising the districts of Hazáríbágh, Lohárdágá, Mánbhúm, and Sinhbhúm, and the seven tributary states which constitute the South-West Frontier Agency, lies between 21° and 25° N. lat. and 82° and 87° E. long. It is bounded on the N. by the province of Behar, E. by the Bengal districts of Bánkurá and Midnapur, S. by the Orissa Tributary States and the Central Provinces, and W. by the independent state of Rewá. Of its area of 43,901 square miles a large portion is occupied by hills and jungle, and the population is very sparse. The most important peak, Paresnáth, with its Jaina temples, has a height of 4400 feet. The Chutiá Nágpur plateau is an offshoot of the great Vindhyan range, and its mean elevation is upwards of 2000 feet above the sea level. In the W. it rises to 3600 feet, and to the E. and S. its lower steppe, [9:5:768] from 800 to 1000 feet in elevation, comprises a great portion of the Mánbhúm and Sinhbhúm districts. The whole is about 14,000 square miles in extent, and forms the source of the Barákhar, Dámodar, Kásái, Subanrekhá, Baitaraní, Bráhmaní, Eb, and other rivers. Sal forests abound. The principal jungle products are timber, various kinds of medicinal fruits and herbs, lac, tasar silk, and mahua flowers, which are used as food by the wild tribes and also distilled into a strong country liquor. Coal exists in large quantities, but is at present only worked on a small scale on the Hazáribágh district. Formerly gold was washed from the sands in the bed of the Subanrekhá River, but the operations are now almost wholly abandoned. Iron-ores abound, together with good building stone. The population in 1872 was 3,825,571, residing in 25,766 villages or townships and 752,287 houses. Of these the Hindus numbered 2,567,292, or 67*1 per cent.; Muhammadans, 169,006, or 4 ’ 4 per cent.; Christians, 15,798, or - 4 per cent.; persons of unspecified religion, 1,073,475, or 28T per cent. These last consist of non-Aryan tribes who were driven from the plains by the Hindus and took refuge in the mountain fastnesses of the Chutiá Nágpur plateau. The principal of them are Kols, 292,036 in number; Santáls, 220,096; Uráons or Dhángars,208,343; Mundás, 190,095; and Bhumij, 128,289. These tribes were formerly turbulent, and a source of trouble to the Muhammadan governors of Bengal and Behar; but the introduction of British rule has secured peace and security, and the aboriginal races of Chutiá Nágpur are now peaceful and orderly subjects. Of Iate years missionaries have worked hard among them, and several thousands of the Kols and Santáls have accepted the Christian faith. Only six towns contain upwards of 5000 inhabitants, viz., Ránchí, 12,086; Hazáribágh, 11,050; Ichak, 8999; Chatra, 8818; Puruliá, 5696; and Raghunáthpur, 5380. The principal agricultural products are rice, Indian corn, pulses, oil-seeds and potatoes. A small quantity of tea is grown in Hazáribágh and Lohárdágá districts. Lac and tasar silkcloth are largely manufactured. The revenue of the British portion of Chutiá Nágpur in 1870 was £101,651, the expenditure £79,472. Of the total revenue the receipts from land amounted to £23,698. The police of the British districts consisted in 1872 of 1590 officers and men of the regular force, maintained at a cost of £31,131; 172 officers and men of the municipal police, costing £981; 15,104 men of the village watch, costing £17,592; the total strength being 16,866 officers and men, and the total cost £49,705. In 1872-73, the Educational Department inspected 571 schools attended by 15,871 pupils, and the total cost of Government for the education of the people was £2371. The climate of Chutiá Nágpur is dry and healthy.
