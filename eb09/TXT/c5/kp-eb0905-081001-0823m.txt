CLARKE, Edward Daniel (1769-1822),LL.D., an English traveller, was born at Willingdon, Sussex, June 5, 1769. In 1786 he obtained the office of chapel clerkat Jesus College, Cambridge, but the loss of his father at this time involved him in many difficulties. In 1790 he took his degree, and soon after became private tutor to the Honourable Henry Tufton, nephew of the duke of Dorset. In 1792 he obtained an engagement to travel with Lord Berwick through Germany, Switzerland, and Italy. After crossing the Alps, and visiting a few of the principal cities of Italy, including Rome, he repaired to Naples, where he remained nearly two years. Having returned to England in the summer of 1794, he became tutor in several distinguished families. In 1799 he set out with a Mr Cripps, on a tour through the Continent of Europe, commencing with Norway and Sweden, whence they proceeded through Russia and the Crimea to Constantinople, Rhodes, and afterwards to Egypt and Palestine. After the capitulation of Alexandria, Clarke was of considerable use in securing for England the statues, sarcophagi, maps, manuscripts, &c., which had been collected by the French savans. Greece was the country next visited. From Athens the travellers proceeded by land to Constantinople, and after a short stay in that city, directed their course homewards through Rumelia, Austria, Germany, and France. Clarke, who had now obtained considerable reputation, took up his residence at Cambridge, and there he continued chiefly to reside till the day of his death. He received the degree of LL.D, shortly after his return, on account of the valuable donations, including a colossal statue of the Eleusinian Ceres, which he had made to the university. He was also presented to the college living of Harlton, to which, four years later, his father-in-law added that of Yeldham. Towards the end of 1808 Clarke was appointed to the professorship of mineralogy, then first instituted. Nor was his perseverance as a traveller otherwise unrewarded. The MSS. which he had collected in the course of his travels were sold to the Bodleian Library for £1000; and by the publication of his travels he realized altogether a clear profit of £6095. Besides lecturing on mineralogy and discharging his clerical duties, Dr Clarke eagerly prosecuted the study of chemistry, and made several discoveries, principally by means of the gas blowpipe, which he had brought to a high degree of perfection. His health gave way under too ardent study; and after a short illness he expired at London, March 9,1822. In all the relations of life Dr Clarke was a most amiable man; and his enthusiasm was united with a great capacity for enduring long-continued exertion, both mental and physical. The following is a list of his principal works :—

Testimony of Authors respecting the Colossal Statue of Ceres in the Public Library, Cambridge, 8vo, 1801-3; The Tomb of Alexander, a Dissertation on the Sarcophagus brought from Alexandria, and now in the British Museum, 4 to, 1805; A Methodical Distribution of ths Mineral Kingdom, fol., 1807; A Description of the Greek Marbles brought from the Shores of the Euxine, Archipelago, and Mediterranean, and deposited in the University Library, Cambridge, 8vo, 1809; Travels in various Countries of Europe, Asia, and Africa, 4to, 1810-1819.
