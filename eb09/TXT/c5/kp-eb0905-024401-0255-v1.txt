CATTARO, the chief town of a circle in the Austrian kingdom of Dalmatia, situated on a narrow ledge between the mountains of Montenegro and the Bocca di Cattaro, a winding and beautiful inlet of the Adriatic. It is strongly fortified towards both the sea and land,—towards the sea by the fortress of Castelnuovo, at the mouth of the gulf, and towards land more especially by the Castle of San Giovanni on the heights; the long lines of wall from this castle to the town form a striking feature in the landscape. The town is the seat of a Catholic bishop, and contains a small cathedral, a Catholic collegiate church, and several convents; but the population is largely Slavonic, and the Greek Church is almost on a level with the Latin. The trade is comparatively restricted, and but little advantage is taken of the gulf exceptfor thefisheries. The principal article of export is dried flesh or castradina. Population, 3600.

Cattaro is probably to be identified with the Roman Ascrivium (or Askrouriori) ; but it does not appear under anything like its present name till the 10th century, when it is described by Constantinus Γorphyrogenitus as Dekαterα. In the reign of Basil the Macedonian (867-886) it was captured by the Saracens; but it afterwards maintained itself as a more or less independent republic till 1419, when from fear of the Turks it accepted the protection and dominion of Venice. In the following centuries it was several times besieged by the enemies of Venice; and in 1563 and 1667 it was nearly destroyed by earthquakes. By the peace of Campo-Formio it passed to Austria; but in 1805, by the peace of Presburg, it was assigned to Italy, and in 1810 it united with the French empire. Its restoration to Austria did not take place till 1814. See Tozer, Highlands of Turkey, 1869; Saturday Review, March 1876.
