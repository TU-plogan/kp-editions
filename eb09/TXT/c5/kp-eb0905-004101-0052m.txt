CAPE COAST CASTLE, or Cabo Corso, a town of Western Africa, the capital of the British settlements on the Gold Coast, is situated in Upper Guinea, about 70 miles to the W. of Aera, in 5° 5' 24" N. lat. and l o 13' 38" W. long. It occupies a low bank of gneiss and micaceous slate, which runs out into the sea and protects the lιarbour from the violence of the surf. Besides the principal fortress there are two outposts,—Fort Victoria on the west and Fort William on the east. With the exception of the European residences and the houses of the wealthier natives, which are built of brick, the whole of the town is composed of “awish” or mud huts, thatched with rushes, and having the walls white-washed. The population consists mainly of negroes of the Fanti tribe, but there are also a number of mulattoes and a colony of Kroomen. The earhest European settlement on the spot was that of the Portuguese in 1610. In 1652 the Swedes erected the fort of Karlsborg which was captured by the Danes in 1658, by the Dutch in 1659, and by the English in 1664. Since the last date the post has remained in English possession, in spite of the French attack in 1757 and various assaults by the native tribes. In 1827 the public establishments were withdrawn, and the forts were handed over to the mercantile companies; but in 1844 the Government resumed its possession. The population is estimated at about 10,000.
