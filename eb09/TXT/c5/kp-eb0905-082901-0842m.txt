CLEVELAND, John (1613-1658), a poet and satirist, was born at Loughborough. He was educated at Hinckley school, whence he repaired to Cambridge, becoming in 1634 a fellow of St John’s, and being appointed college-tutor and reader in rhetoric. The Latinity and oratorical ability displayed by him in the exercise of the latter function were warmly praised by Fuller, who also commends the “lofty fancy” of his verse. He was the most distinguished and the earliest of loyal satirists. Joining the Cavaliers at Oxford, he was warmly received by the king; and having lost his fellowship and his college places, he was named judge-advocate in the garrison at Newark. The captain in command at that fortress, however, deprived him (1646) of this office, and he was fain to wander through the country depending on the alms of Royalists for bread. Arrested at Norwich, as one “whose great abilities rendered him able to do the greater disservice,” he was held in durance of some months at Yarmouth, but was released at last by Cromwell (who seems to have behaved admirably towards the strolling libeller), and went to London, where he resided till his death, in the enjoyment of much consideration from his party. Cleveland, who was more highly esteemed than Milton by his contemporaries, was exceedingly popular. His serious poetry is perhaps the most extravagantly conceited in the language; his satires are more deserving, the best being the Petition to the Lord-Protector for the Scots Rebel. See Nichols, History of Leicestershire, and Cleveland’s Works, London, 1687.
