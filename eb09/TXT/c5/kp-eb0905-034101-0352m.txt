CENTLIVRE, Susanna (1667-1723), a dramatic writer, was born in 1667, or perhaps a year or two later, probably in Ireland, whither her father, Mr Freeman, a Lincolnshire gentleman, had been forced to flee at the Restoration on account of his Parliamentarian principles. Being left an orphan about the age of eleven she came to London, where, at the age of sixteen she married a nephew of Sir Stephen Fox. About twelve months afterwards her husband died; and she then married a military officer named Carrol. Carrol was killed in a duel about a year and a half after their marriage, and his widow was left to support herself by her pen and by acting. Her first attempt was a tragedy called the Perjured Husband ; but almost all her subsequent pieces were comedies, several of which, throughtheirliveliness, enjoyed very considerable popularity, as for example the well-known Busibody (which has been represented within the last few years), A Bold Stroke for a Wife, The Basset table, The Wonder â€” a Woman keeps a Secret, Love at a Venture. Her wit and personal attractions also gained her the support of Steele, Farquhar, Rowe, and many others of high position in literature and society. In 1706 she married Mr Joseph Centlivre, principal cook to Queen Anne, with whom she lived till her death in 1723. Her dramatic works were published, with a biography, in 3 vols. 12mo, 1761, reprinted 1872.
