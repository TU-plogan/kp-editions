CITRON, a species of Citrus ((7. medica, Risso), belonging to the Natural Order Aurantiaceoe, which furnishes also the orange, lime, and shaddock. The citron-tree is an evergreen growing to a height of about 8 feet; it has long, pendent, and, in the wild varieties, spiny branches, pale-green, oblong, and sub-serrate leaves, and flowers purpje without and white within. The fruit is ovate or oblong, protuberant at the tip, and from 5 to 6 inches long, with a rough, furrowed, adherent rind, the inner portion of which is thick, white, and fleshy, the outer, thin, greenish-yellow, and very fragrant. The pulp is sub-acid and edible, and its seeds are bitter. There are many varieties of the fruit, some of them of great weight and size. The Madras citron has the form of an oblate sphere; and in the “fingered citron” of China, the lobes are separated into finger-like divisions.

Gallesio and De Candolle consider citrons and lemons to be distinct species; but the former authority states that seed produced by lemon-trees growing amongst citron-trees gave varieties which were intermediate between the two species; and by some botanists citrons, lemons, and oranges are held to be all varieties of the wild Citrus medixa. According to Dr G. Birdwood, however, the orange and lemon are both natives of Upper India, the former being derived from the wild Citrus Aurantiumoí Gurhwal, Sikkim, and Khasia, and the lemon, lime, and probably citron also, from the wild Citrus Limonum of the valleys of Sikkim and Kumaon, of which the Citrus medica was the first cultivated variety (Athenoeum, No. 2544, July 29, 1876., p. 151).

The citron-tree thrives in the open air in China, Persia, the West Indies, Madeira, Sicily, Corsica, and the warmer parts of Spain and Italy; and in conservatories it is often to be seen in more northerly regions. It was described by Theophrastus as growing in Media; it appears, however, not to be indigenous to Persia, but to have been introduced into that country and other lands from North India, where it was found growing wild by Dr Royle. It was early known to the ancients, and the fruit was held in great esteem by them; but they seem to have been acquainted with no other member of the Aurantiaceoe, the introduction of orangesand lemons into the countries of the Mediterranean being due to the Arabs, between the 1Oth and 15th centuries. Josephus tells us that “the law of the Jews required, that at the feast of tabernacles every one should have branches of palm-tree and citron-tree” (Antiq., xiii. 13, 5); and the Hebrew word tappuadι, rendered “apples” and “apple-tree” in Cant. ii. 3, 5, Prov. xxv. 11, &c., probably signifies the citron-tree and its fruit. Oribasius in the 4th century describes the fruit, accurately distinguishing the three parts of it. About the 3d century the tree was introduced into Italy; and, as Gallesio informs us, it was much grown at Salerno in the 11th century. In China, citrons are placed in apartments to make them fragrant. The rind of the citron yields two perfumes, oil of cedra and oil of citron, isomeric with oil of turpentine; and when preserved it is much esteemed as a sweetmeat.
