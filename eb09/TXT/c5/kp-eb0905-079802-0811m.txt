CLAIRAULT, or Claieaut, Alexis-Claude (1713— 1765), a French mathematician, was born on May 7,1713, at Paris, where his father was a teacher of mathematics. Under his father’s tuition he made so rapid progress in mathematical studies, that in his thirteenth year he read, before the French Academy an account of the properties of four curves which he had then discovered. When only sixteen, he finished his treatise on Curves of Double Curvature, which, on its publication two years later, procured his admission into the Academy of Sciences, although even then he was below the legal age. In 1736, together with his friend Maupertuis, he took part in the famous expedition to Lapland, which was undertaken for the purpose of estimating a degree of the meridian, and on his return he published his treatise Sur la figure de la terre. In his work on this subject he promulgated his theorem in regard to the variation of gravity, which has been corrected by Sir G. Airy. He obtained an ingenious approximate solution of the problem of the three bodies; in 1750 he gained the prize of the St Petersburg Academy for his treatise on the Lunar Theory; and in 1759 he calculated the perihelion of Halley’s comet. Clairault died at Paris, May 17, 1765.
