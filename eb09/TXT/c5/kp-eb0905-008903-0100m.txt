CARBUNCLE, an acute local inflammation of the deeper layers of the skin, followed by sloughing. It is met with in those who are weakened by any cause, and in certain unhealthy constitutional states. It is accompanied by great constitutional disturbance; in the early stages of the disease the pain is considerable. A hard flattened swelling of a deep red colour is noticed on the back, face, or extremities. This gradually extends until in some instances it may become as large as a dinner-plate. Towards the centre of the mass numerous small openings form on the surface. From them blood and matter escape, and through these openings a yellow slough, of leathery consistence, can be seen. The treatment generally adopted is free incisions through the mass, relieving the tension and alleviating the pain. Poultices are then applied to encourage the separation of the slough. After this comes away a healthy ulcer is left which heals rapidly, leaving an indelible scar. Opium is given in order to relieve the pain. The patient requires supporting diet, stimulants, good food, and the administration of iron. Occurring as it does in people of an unhealthy tendency, it may in severe cases occasion death. Some surgeons do not interfere with the knife, but give opium in large doses, and allow the slough to separate by natural processes.
