CHERIBON, or Sheribon, a seaport town on the north coast of Java, capital of a residency of the same name, and the seat of a Dutch governor, is situated at the head of a wide bay 125 miles E.S.E. of Batavia, in 6° 48' S. lat. and 108° 38' E. long. It was formerly a place of importance, but it has never fully recovered from the effects of a disastrous plague which visited the place at the beginning of this century. The town and harbour are defended by a fort called the Bcschermer or Protector which also serves as a convict prison. A church, founded in 1842, is used in common by Protestants and Roman Catholics; the Mussulman population has its mosque, and the Chinese their klin-ting or temple. A school for European children was opened in 1824, and a Government school in 1854. The Chinese district is pretty populous; but no estimate exists of the actual number. At some distance from the town are the graves of the sultans, among whom the most remarkable is Ibnu Mulana, who introduced the Mahometan religion here in 1406. The district is very fertile, and produces the finest coffee raised in the island. Timber, cotton, indigo, sugar, and pepper are exported in large quantities. Total population of district in 1856, 769,331.
