CHARTRES, the chief town of the department of Eure-et-Loir, 55 miles south-west from Paris by railway, stands on a slope skirted by the River Eure, which flows partly within and partly beyond the ramparts. Its houses are antique and straggling; but there are four fine squares, in one of which, used as the herb-market, is an obelisk in memory of General Marceau, a native of the town. Chartres is theseat of a tribunal of the first instance, a tribunal of commerce, a communal college, and a diocesan seminary; and it has a weekly corn-market, which is one of the largest in France and is well managed by a corporation of women. Its chief manufactures are woollens and leather. Its cathedral of Nôtre Dame, a vast Gothic edifice, with two spires of different construction, is reckoned one of the finest cathedrals in France. It was founded in the 11th century by Bishop Fulbert on the site of an earlier church destroyed by fire in 1020. In 1194 another conflagration laid waste the new building then hardly completed; but clergy and people set zealously to work, and the main part of the present structure was finished by 1240. Though there have been numerous minor additions and alterations since that time, the general character of the cathedral is unimpaired. The upper woodwork was consumed by fire in 1830, as well as the beautiful belfry of the old tower, but the rest of the building was saved; and it still preserves some of its magnificent stained-glass windows of the 13th century. (See Bulteau, Descript, de la cathxdr. de Chartres, 1850.) The churches of St Pierre and St Andró may also be noticed.

Chartres was one of the principal towns of the Carnutes, and by the Romans was called Autricum, from the river Autura (Eure). From the Romans it passed into the hands of the Frankish kings, and was successively taken by Thierry II., king of Orleans and Burgundy, and by the Normans, who burnt it in 852 and 872. It afterwards fell into the hands of the English, from whom it was recovered in 1432. It was attacked unsuccessfully by the Protestants in 1568, and was taken in 1591 by Henry IV., who was consecrated there three years afterwards. In the Franco-Prussian War it was seized by the Germans on 21st Oct. 1870, and continued during the rest of the campaign an important centre of operations. During the Middle Ages it was the chief town of the district of Beauce, and gave its name to the counts of Chartres; and since the time of Louis XIII. the title of duke of Chartres has been hereditary in the family of Orleans. Population of the town in 1872, 19,322; and of the commune, 19,580.
