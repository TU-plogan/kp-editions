CLERMONT EN BEAUVOISIS, frequently but by mistake called Clermont sur Oise, a town of France, at the head of an arrondissement in the department of Oise, is situated about 36 miles by rail to the north of Paris, near a small tributary of the Oise, called the Brèche. The town-hall and the church of St Samson date from the 13th century, and the hill on which the town is built is surmounted by an old castle partly of the 10 th or 11 th, now transformed into a penitentiary capable of accommodating upwards of 1000 female prisoners. The principal industries are the manufacture of cotton goods and stained paper. Clermont was an important post in the Middle Ages. It was frequently taken and retaken in the wars of the English, and in 1437 it was surrendered to them as a ransom for the great national leader La Hire. In 1569 it was sold to the duke of Brunswick by Charles IX., and about thirty years later it was resold by the duchess of Brunswick to the duke of Lorraine. In 1595 it was captured by Henry IV., and in 1615 it was held by Condé. Cassini the astronomer was a native of the town. Population in 1872, 5774.
