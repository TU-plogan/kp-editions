CLERMONT, or Clermont Ferrand, a city of France, formerly the chief town of Basse Auvergne, and now of the department of Puy-de-Dôme, is situated on a hill composed chiefly of volcanic tufa, in the fertile district of Limagne, and surrounded on the S. and W. by a line of mountains, of which the Puy-de-Dôme is the culminating point. It lies in 45° 46' N. lat. and 3° 5' E. long., and is 220 miles S. by E. from Paris. Since 1633 it is composed of the two towns of Clermont and Mount Ferrand, connected by a fine avenue of walnut trees and willows, two miles in length. The streets are generally ill laid out, narrow, and crooked; and the houses are built of dull, grey lava, which had a gloomy effect until the fashion was introduced of covering them with white-wash. It has several handsome squares ornamented with fountains, and is well supplied with water brought by subterranean conduits from Royat, a league distant. The principal public building is the cathedral, a Gothic edifice of the 13 th century, and though still unfinished its interior is considered one of the finest existing specimens of Gothic architecture. The church of Nôtre-Dame-du-Port is curiously decorated externally with mosaic work and bas-reliefs, and is very ancient—parts of it dating from 870. Clermont has also a university-academy, a royal college, a botanic garden, a public library of 30,000 vols, (among which are several ancient MSS. of great value), museums of natural history and antiquities, two hospitals, and a theatre. The manufactures are woollen and linen goods, silk stockings, paper, cutlery, and jewellery. Being the entrepôt for the produce of the surrounding departments, the town carries on a considerable trade in hemp, flax, corn, wine, cheese, wool, hides, and cattle. In the suburb of St Allyre, to the north-west of the city, is a remarkable calcareous spring, the copious deposits of which have formed a curious natural bridge over a small stream. The population of Clermont in the end of the 18th century was about 16,000; in 1851, 30,566; and in 1872, 32,963.

Clermont (ι.β,, Clarus Mons or Clarimontium) is identified with the ancient Augustonemetum, the chief town of the Arvemi, and it still preserves some remains of the Roman period. The present name occurs as early as the 8th century, but was at first applied to the castle alone. During the disintegration of the Roman empire Clermont suffered as much perhaps from capture and pillage as any city in the country; but it preserved its municipal liberties down to the Middle Ages, and, even after it was incorporated in the domain of its bishops, maintained the rights of its communal charter. It was the seat of no fewer than seven ecclesiastical councils, held respectively in the years 535, 549, 587, 1095, 1110, 1124, and 1130; and of these the council of 1095 is for ever memorable as that in which Pope Urban II. first formally organized the great crasade. In the national wars of the 15th and the civil wars of the 16th century the town had its full participation; and in 1665 it acquired a terrible notoriety by the trial and execution of a number of robber chieftains who had infested the neighbouring district. The proceedings lasted six months, and the episode is still known as les Grands Jours de Clermont. Before the great Revolution the town possessed several monastic establishments, of which the most important was the abbey of Saint Allyre, founded, it is said, by St Austramonius, the apostle of Auvergne, and the abbey of St André, where the counts of Clermont were interred. Among the great men whom the town has produced are Gregory of Tours, Pascal, and Montlosier.
