CASTELLO, Valerio (1625-1659), was the youngest son of Bernardo Castello, noticed above. He surpassed his father, and particularly excelled in painting battle-scenes. He painted the Rape of the Sabines, now in the Palazzo Brignole, Genoa, and decorated the cupola of the Church of the Annunciation in the same city. In these works he is regarded by his admirers as combining the fire of Tintoretto with the general style of Paolo Veronese; his premature death cut short a career of high hopes.
