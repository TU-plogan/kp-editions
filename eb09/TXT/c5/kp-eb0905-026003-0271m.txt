CAVALIER, Jean (c. 1680-1740), the famous chief of the Camisards, was born at Ribaute, near Anduse, in Lower Languedoc. The date of his birth is variously given between 1679 and 1685. It could hardly be so late as the last-named year, and may probably be assigned to the period between 1679 and 1681. He was the son of a peasant, and in boyhood was employed first in keeping sheep, and afterwards as a baker’s apprentice. A pious mother trained him in the Reformed faith. The persecution of Protestants, which began after the revocation of the Edict of Nantes, and which was carried on with pitiless cruelty in the Cevennes, drove him from his native land in 1701, and he took refuge at Geneva. By the dragonnades of Louis XIV. the Protestants of the Cevennes were at last driven to revolt; and Cavalier, inspired with the hope of being their deliverer, a hope which was raised to the pitch of enthusiasm, it is said, by certain prophecies, returned to his own country in 1702. The insurrection broke out in July of that year, and Cavalier was one of the chosen leaders. Roland was named generalissimo, but Cavalier soon rose to share the chief command with him. Untrained in arms, he displayed not only a fiery courage, but extraordinary military skill. This must have been owing to some extent to the eager attention which he had paid, while keeping his sheep, to the manoeuvres of the troops which were stationed in his native district. Although the enfants de Dieu, as the insurgents were called, numbered at the most only 3000 men in arms, they coped successfully again and again with the much more numerous forces of the king, and were never entirely conquered. After several affairs Cavalier changed the theatre of war to the Vivarais; and on the 10th of February 1703 be defeated the royalist troops on the Ardèche. A few days later he was completely defeated on the same ground and was supposed to have fallen. But he reappeared, was again defeated at Tour-de-Bellot (April 30), and again recovered himself, recruits flocking to him to fill up the places of the slain. By a long series of successes he raised his reputation to the highest pitch, and gained the full confidence of the people. It was in vain that more and more rigorous measures were adopted against the Camisards; in vain that their mountain district was ravaged, sacked, and burned by the Catholics. Cavalier boldly carried the war into the plain, made terrible reprisals, and threatened even Nîmes itself. On April 16, 1704, he encountered Marshal Montrevel himself at the bridge of Nages, with 1000 men against 5000; and though defeated after a desperate conflict, he made a successful retreat with two thirds of his men. Marshal Villars was next sent against him, and instead of fighting proposed negotiation. Roland resolutely turned a deaf ear to him; but Cavalier agreed to treat. A conference was held at Nîmes, hostages being given to Cavalier; and he appeared with an armed and mounted escort, which was drawn up facing the guard of the marshal. The terms proposed were deferred to the decision of the king, Cavalier in the meanwhile retiring tσ Calvisson. In this place for some days the Camisard∆ held their meetings openly, and thousands eagerly flocked to them. The result of the negotiation was that Cavalier received for himself a commission with a pension of 1200 livres, and for his brother a captain’s commission. He was authorized to form a regiment of Camisards to be sent to Spain; and liberty was restored to his father and other Protestant prisoners. The treaty, which did not include any provision for general liberty of conscience, excited great indignation among the companions of Cavalier. They called him traitor and coward, and deserted him. Disheartened, and with little confidence in the promises of the court, Cavalier afterwards visited Paris for the purpose of an interview with Louis XIV. He was presented privately to the king at Versailles, but was ill received. His disappointment[9:5:261] and the reports which were current of intended attempts on his life or liberty induced him to leave France. He went to Switzerland, and afterwards to Holland; and there he married a daughter of Madame Dunoyer, the latter a lady of Nîmes, who had once been sought in marriage by Voltaire. He then passed into England for the purpose of recruiting his regiment of Camisards. He had an interview with Queen Anne, of which conflicting accounts are given. But so highly was his military genius valued that he was sent with his regiment to take part in the famous expedition to Spain, under the earl of Peterborough and Sir Cloudesley Shovel (May 1705). At the battle of Almanza his Camisards encountered a French regiment which they had met in the Cevennes, and, without firing, the foes rushed to a hand to hand fight and made a fearful slaughter. Cavalier was severely wounded, and was saved from death by an English officer. On his return to England a small pension was given him, and after long waiting he was made a major-general and named governor of J ersey. This post was afterwards exchanged for the governorship of the Isle of Wight. Cavalier died at Chelsea, in the first half of May 1740, and there his remains were interred. Malesherbes, the courageous friend and defender of Louis XVI., bears the following eloquent testimony to this young hero of the Cevennes :—“I confess,” he says, “that this warrior, who, without ever having served, found himself by the mere gift of nature a great general,—this Camisard who was bold to punish a crime in the presence of a fierce troop which maintained itself by like crimes,—this coarse peasant who, when admitted at twenty years of age into the society of cultivated people, caught their manners and won their love and esteem,—this man who, though accustomed to a stormy life, and having just cause to be proud of his success, had yet enough philosophy in him by nature to enjoy for thirty-five years a tranquil private life,—appears to me to be one of the rarest characters to be found in history.” There is a work, little esteemed, entitled Memoirs of the War in the Cevennes, under Colonel Cavalier, which appears to have been written not by Cavalier himself but by a French refugee named Galli. For a more detailed account see Mrs Bray’s Revolt of the Protestants of the Cevennes, published in 1870.
