CINNA, Lucius Cornelius, a Roman patrician, conspicuous in the contest between Marius and Sulla. After serving in the war with the Marsi as pretorian legate, he was elected consul in 87 b.c. Breaking the oath he had sworn to Sulla that he would not attempt any revolution in the state, Cinna allied himself with Marius, raised an army of Italians, and took possession of the city. Soon after his triumphant entry and the massacre of the friends of Sulla, by which he had satisfied his vengeance, Marius died. L. Valerius Flaccus became Cinna’s colleague, and on the murder of Flaccus, Cn. Papirius Carbo. In 84, however, Cinna, who was still consul, was forced to advance against Sulla; but while embarking his troops he was killed in a mutiny. See Roman History.
