CARIES, ulceration of boue, is the result of inflammation, and resembles in its chief characteristics ulceration in soft tissues, as skin and muscle. Situated in a tissue largely composed of inorganic material, it is chronic in its course, and cured with difficulty. The exciting cause is generally an injury. It is frequently associated with scrofula. The cancellated tissue of bone is specially liable; the short bones of the hand and foot, the articular extremities of the long bones, and the bones forming the vertebral column are its chief seats. It is preceded by the formation of matter, and when this escapes, either by natural processes or by the assistance of the surgeon, the diseased boue can be felt by the aid of a probe, passed through tliQ sinus or channel which leads to the carious bone. This sinus does not heal until the disease heals or is removed. The treatment generally adopted consists in removing the diseased bone by gouging or by excision. If the primary abscess is opened and dressed antiseptically for a lengthened period, the ulcerated bone often heals without further operation. This method of treatment is most valuable in cases of caries of the vertebral column, in which it would be impossible to remove the disease by gouging or excision.
