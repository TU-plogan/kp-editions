CECIL, William, Lord Burghley or Burleigh (1520- 1598), an English statesman, born in 1520, was the son of Richard Cecil, Master of the Robes to Henry VIII. After distinguishing himself at Cambridge, he entered Gray’s Inn at twenty-one, and soon after obtained the reversion of the office of custos brevium at the Court of Common Pleas. He increased his political influence by marriage, first with the sister of Sir John Cheke, and then with the daughter of Sir Anthony Cook; and, at length, through friendship with the protector, Somerset, he became Secretary of State in 1548. After sharing the imprisonment of Somerset, his prudence and sagacity enabled him to regain his office under Northumberland. Yet, when Edward died, he contrived to escape the danger which threatened him on every side. He signed the instrument making over the crown to Lady Jane Grey, but only as a witness; and he kept clear of religious difficulties by displaying no dislike to Catholicism. Indeed it is probable that he really felt little or none. He confessed, attended mass, took a priest into his house; he escorted Cardinal Pole from Brussels, and cultivated his friendship. And, though he opposed the court party in parliament, and thus kept up his connection with his old friends, his opposition was so moderate as to be perfectly safe. He maintained a constant correspondence with the Princess Elizabeth, and on the death of her sister at once prepared a proclamation declaring her queen. He was immediately appointed Secretary of State, and member of the Privy Council; and from this time he was the foremost minister of the Crown. Foreign ambassadors often regarded him as the possessor of unbounded power, and as practically head of the Government and ruler of the queen, but, in fact, his influence was not so supreme, nor his favour with Elizabeth so uniform. No man, indeed, could always guide that strong-willed monarch; and Cecil had no ambition to be a mere favourite and tool. Though not an enthusiast, and though he never fought for a hopeless cause, he had far nobler aims than personal advancement. Though his statesmanship lay not so much in a power of deep and rapid insight as in the possession of a mind patient to take account of the minutest points, and able to weigh all considerations impartially, he was capable of independent thought and firm decision, and his plans often conflicted with the inconstant intrigues of the queen. On such occasions he did not shrink from telling her that she was wrong; he rebuked her stinginess and treachery, and he several times braved her passionate resentment. From her accession he was Secretary of State, and from 1572 he was Lord High Treasurer; but his services brought him pecuniary loss, and he received no honours but the Mastership of the Court of Wards, the order of the Garter, and the barony conferred upon him in 1571, after thirteen years of service. He was absolutely incorruptible. He refused to use or to sell the office of Royal Exchanger, though it would have brought him several hundred thousand pounds. Mendoza in vain tried to bribe him; to Catherine of Medici’s splendid offers he replied that he served none but his God, his mistress, and his country; and he refused to share in the gold of which Drake had robbed the Spaniards. Into the deeper passions of his time he did not enter, It is true that as his life advanced he grew more and more attached to the Protestant cause. He saw that his country had identified herself with that cause, and he was, besides, firmly opposed on political grounds to the pretensions of the Papacy. He appears, however, to have had no special devotion to any form of doctrine; and he opposed the persecution of loyal Puritans and of loyal Catholics. When, indeed, either Catholic or Puritan became disloyal or otherwise dangerous he lost all compunction. He hated and persecuted the Jesuits because they placed the Pope above the laws, but he twice took the trouble to explain to the world that this was the sole reason. He was affected with no inconvenient weakness of sympathy; he could ruthlessly crush any one who seemed dangerous to the state. Essentially honest as he was, he scrupled at no espionage or treachery to gain the secrets of his enemies. His emissaries were everywhere. He kept Herle in the Marshalsea, examined him before the council, and threatened him with torture that the Catholic prisoners might believe him to be a martyr to their cause, and might intrust him with their plans; and he made Bishop Parker appear in the guise of the Catholic Dr Story to take the confessions of a prisoner whom torture could not move. When his policy was opposed to Spain he did not scruple to get up demonstrations against the Spanish ambassador, and to cast into prison all the Spanish merchants in London. Plots against his own life never deprived him of his calmness; he watched De Quadra’s conspirators quietly, day after day, though every day he knew they might attempt to murder him, and let them alone till he had gained all the information to be got. Day after day Norfolk and [9:5:284] Arundel came to the council intending to arrest him; and day after day his cool sagacity defeated them. Yet when occasion required he knew how to act with prompt and vigorous decision. He was always struggling against the queen’s variability. Being eager that she should marry, he urged her again and again to decide at once; and a paper is extant which he presented to the queen when the last marriage proposal was finally cast aside. In it he sketches a great and able policy. Preparations were to be made for war by land and sea; honours and wealth were to be applied to attach the hearts of the foremost men of the nation, and no longer wasted on useless favourites; Ireland was to be ruled with attentive care and in a conciliatory spirit; and, lastly, there was to be a grand alliance of all Protestants—of England, Sweden, Denmark, Scotland, and the Protestants in Germany, France, and Flanders. With regard to the Queen of Scots he pressed for the most vigorous action. Undeterred by the anger which Elizabeth showed in striking his name from the list of lords-lieutenant, he appeared at Mary’s trial to meet her denial of the charges made against her with a stern contradiction. When, at last, Elizabeth signed the warrant, he ventured to oppose her express wish by calling the council to his own house to discuss the matter; and he dared to intercede for Davison when, in a torrent of passion, she sent him to the Tower. The result was that he was fiercely ordered out of her presence, and for two months the queen refused to see him.

In the industry of the country Cecil took the greatest interest. He entertained the serious apprehensions which were commonly felt on account of the increase of importation, the exportation of gold, and the falling off of agriculture; and he protested against the growing use of wine, silk, and other foreign commodities. To make up for the loss to the shipping which the downfall of Catholicism had caused by diminishing the demand for fish, he obtained the passing of a curious law which made the eating of flesh on Friday and Saturday, and on Wednesday unless fish dishes were also placed on the table, a misdemeanour. In short, Cecil devoted himself to the service of his country with the most painstaking and disinterested laboriousness. From the peculiarity of his method of working we have more complete information concerning the details of his career than is usually the case with statesmen; for it was his practice not only to draw up papers of advice to the queen, but also before deciding on any question to set out on paper all the considerations on both sides; and many of these documents, together with many of the letters which he either received or wrote, can still be consulted (see Scrinia Ceciliana, 1663, the state papers published in 1740 and 1759, and Tytler’s Ancient Letters, 1839). Cecil died in office in August 1598.

Among hia writings are characteristic Precepts for the well-ordering of a man's life (1637), and The Execution of Justice in England for ths Maintenance of Public and Christian Pease (1581 and 1583; Latin version, 1584). The latter is a defence of the queen’s commissioners appointed to examine Papists, with special reference to the use of torture, and a declaration that purely religious belief was never the cause of punishment. An interesting paper of advice to the Queen (1583) is to be found in the Somers Tracts. A voluminous life by Nares appeared in 1828-31. See Fronde’s History.
