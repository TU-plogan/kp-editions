CHÂTELLERAULT, a town of France, at the head of an arrondissement in the department of Vienne, on the right bank of the Vienne, here crossed by a handsome stone bridge, which connects it with the suburb of Châteauneuf on the opposite side of the river, 24 miles N.N.E. of Poitiers. It stands in a fertile valley, and has several fine promenades, but is irregularly built. It has tribunals of primary instance and commerce, a fine Gothic church, a public fountain, a communal college, an exchange, a hospital, a society of agriculture, and a theatre. It is one of the chief seats of the manufacture of cutlery in France; and has a Government manufactory of swords and bayonets, established in 1820. There is a large trade in wines, dried fruits, slates, iron, corn, hemp, and timber. Population in 1872, 13,363.

Châtellerault, or Castrum Heroidi, derives its name from a castle built in the 11th century. In 1514 it was made a duchy in favour of Gilbert of Bourbon, count of Montpensier, but not long after it was reunited to the Crown. In 1548 it was bestowed on James Hamilton, second earl of Arran; but it was forfeited by failure of male issue. The title, however, continued to be claimed by the dukes of Hamilton and the earls of Abercorn, who were both descended by the female side from the original possessor. A decree of the French Council of State decided against the earl, and the title was rebestowed on the duke of Hamilton by Napoleon III.
