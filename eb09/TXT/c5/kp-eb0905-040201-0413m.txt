CHARITON, of Aphrodisias in Caria, probably one of the last of the Greek erotic writers, lived about the 5th century a.d., and was the author of a romance entitled The Loves of Choereas and Callirrhoe. It has been translated into German and French. The best edition is that by Dâ€™Orville, reprinted by Beck, Lips., 1783.
