CHIOGGIA, or Chiozza, a town of Italy, in an island of the same name in the Gulf of Venice, 15 miles south of the city of that name. It is united to the mainland by a bridge of 43 arches, protected at the further extremity by Fort Malghera or Haynau; and the port is likewise defended by Forts Caraman and San Felice. The cathedral of Longhera, founded in 1633, is its most remarkable building; the church of S. Andrea was of much gr eater antiquity, but it was restored in 1734. From Chioggia to Malamocco stretches the great sea-wall of the Murazzi, which protects Venice from the inroads of the ocean. Chioggia is the Roman Fossa Claudia, and began to bear the name of Clugia in the 4th century. In 809 it was destroyed by Pepin, and in 901 by the Slavonic invaders. In 1100 it was chosen as his see by the bishop of Malamocco. With the exception of the years from 1379 to 1381, when it was held by the Genoese, it continued subject to Venice till the fall of the republic; but in spite of its proximity and political connection, it has maintained to the present day some peculiarities of language and custom. Population, 26,336.
