CALICUT, or Kolikod, a seaport town of India on the western coast, in the British district of Malabar and the presidency of Madras, situated about 560 miles S. of Bombay, in 11 15' N. lat. and 75Â° 52' E. long. The town stands on the sea-shore in a low and unsheltered position; and as there is neither river nor harbour, ships are compelled to anchor in five or six fathoms water, about two or three miles from land. The houses are for the most part built either of sun-dried brick or laterite, and have a tidy appearance. In the quarter of the Moplahs or Mapillas there are several mosques, and the Portuguese quarter possesses a Roman Catholic church One of the largest buildings is the jail, which can accommodate 600 prisoners. The port is frequented by vessels from the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf, which return with freights of rice, cocoa-nuts, ginger, cardamoms, sandal-wood, and teak. The weaving of cotton, for which the place was at one time so famous that its name became identified with its calico, is no longer of any importance. Calicut is of considerable antiquity; and about the 7th century it had its population largely increased by the immigration of the Moplahs, a fanatical race of Mahometans from Arabia, who entered enthusiastically into commercial life. It was the first place in India visited by any European navigator, for it was there that Vasco de Gama arrived in May 1498, ten months and two day s after his departure from Lisbon. At that time it was a very flourishing city, and contained several stately buildings, among which was especially mentioned a Brahminical temple, not inferior to the largest monastery in Portugal. In 1509 the Marshal Don Fernando Continho made an unsuccessful attack on the city; and in the following year it was again assailed by Albuquerque with 3000 troops. On this occasion the palace was plundered and the town burnt; but the Portuguese were finally repulsed, and fled [9:4:694] to their ships after heavy loss Not long after they concluded a peace with Prince Zamorin or Tamuri, and were allowed to build a fortified factory in the town. An English factory was founded in 1616. The town was taken in 1765 by Hyder Ali, who expelled all the merchants and factors, and destroyed the cocoa-nut trees, sandal-wood, and pepper vines, that the country, reduced to ruin, might present no temptation to the cupidity of Europeans. In 1782 the troops of Hyder were driven from Calicut by the British: but in 1789 it was taken and destroyed by his son Tippoo, who carried off the inhabitants to Beypore, and treated them with great cruelty. In the latter part of 1790 the country was occupied by the British; and under the treaty concluded in 1792, whereby Tippoo was de prived of half his dominions, Calicut fell to the British. After this event the inhabitants returned and rebuilt the town, which in 1800 consisted of 5000 houses. The present population is upwards of 25,000, composed largely of Moplahs, but including about 4000 or 5000 Portuguese, besides Parsees, English, &c.
