CAMDEN, William (1551-1623), 9 celebrated antiquary and historian, was born in London, May 2, 1551. His father, who was a native of Lichfield, settled in London, where he became a member of the company of paper-stainers. His mother was of the ancient family of Curwen of Workington in Cumberland. Young Camden received his early education at Christ’s Hospital and St Paul’s School; and in 1566 he entered as a servitor of Magdalen College, Oxford; but not succeeding in getting a demi’s place, he removed to Broadgate Hall, and, somewhat more than two years afterwards, to Christ Church, where he was supported by his friend and patron Dr Thornton. About this time he became a candidate for a fellowship at All Souls College, which he lost through the adverse influence of the Roman Catholic party. In 1570 he supplicated the regents of the university to be admitted bachelor of arts, but in this also he was disappointed. The following year Camden came to London, where he prosecuted his favourite study of antiquity, under the patronage of Dr Goodman, dean of Westminster, by whose interest he was made, in 1575, second master of Westminster school. From the time of his leaving the university to this period, he had travelled through great part of England, with a view to make observations and collect materials for his Britannia, on which he was now seriously engaged. In 1581 he became intimately acquainted with the learned President Brisson, who was then in England, and in 1586 he published the first edition of the Britannia, a survey of the British isles, written in elegant Latin. In 1593 he succeeded to the head mastership of Westminster school, on the resignation of Dr Grant. In this office he continued till 1597, when he was promoted to be Clarencieux king-at-arms. In 1600 Camden made a tour to the north, as far as Carlisle, accompanied by his friend Mr (afterwards Sir Robert) Cotton. In 1606 he began his correspondence with the celebrated President de Thou, which continued to the death of that historian. In the following year he published his last edition of the Britannia, from which the several English translations have been made; and in 1608 he began to digest his materials for a history of the reign of Queen Elizabeth. In 1609, after recovering from a dangerous illness, he retired to Chiselhurst in Kent, where he continued to spend the summer months during the remainder of his life. The first part of his annals of the queen did not appear till 1615, and he determined that the second volume should not appear till after his death. The work was entirely finished in 1617; and from that time he was principally employed in collecting materials for the further improvement of his Britannia. In 1622, being now upwards of seventy, he determined to lose no time in executing his design of founding a history lecture in the university of Oxford. His deed of gift was accordingly transmitted by his friend Mr Heather to Mr Gregory Wheare, who was by himself appointed the first professor. Camden died at Chiselhurst, Nov. 9, 1623, in the seventy-third year of his age, and was buried with great solemnity in Westminster Abbey, where a monument was erected to his memory. He was a man of great modesty and integrity, profoundly learned in the history and antiquities of England, and a judicious and conscientious historian. The Camden Society, founded in 1838 for historical research, was so named in honour of him. Besides the works already mentioned, he was author of an excellent Greek grammar, and of several tracts in Hearne’s collection. His greatest and most useful work is the Britannia. It was first translated into English, and published in folio in London in 1611, by Dr Philemon Holland, who is thought to have consulted the author himself; and therefore great respect has been paid to his additions and explanations, on the supposition that they may belong to Camden. But in a later edition of the same translation, published in 1636, the doctor has taken liberties which cannot be excused. A new translation, made with the utmost fidelity from the last edition, was published in 1695, by Edmund Gibson of Queen’s College, Oxford, afterwards bishop of London; in which, besides the addition of notes, and of all that deserved to be taken notice of in Dr Holland’s first edition, there are many other augmentations [9:4:735] and improvements, all properly distinguished from the genuine work of the author.

Gibson’s edition was reprinted in 1722, and several times subsequently. The latest and best editions are those by Gough, 1789-90, 3 vols, fol., and by Gough and Nichols, 1806, 4 vols. fol.
