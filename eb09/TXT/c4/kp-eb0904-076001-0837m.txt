CAMPE, Joachim Heinrich (1746-1818), a German educationist, was born at Deensen in Brunswick in 1746. He studied theology at the university of Halle, and after acting for some time as chaplain at Potsdam, he accepted a post as director of studies in the Philanthropin at Dessau. He soon after set up an educational establishment of his own at Trittow, near Hamburg, which he was obliged to give up to one of his assistants within a few years, in consequence of feeble health. In 1787 he proceeded to Brunswick as counsellor of education, and purchased the Schulbuchhandlung, which under his direction became a most prosperous business. He died in 1818. His numerous educational works were widely used throughout Germany. Among the most popular were the Kleine Kinderbibliothek, 12 vols., 11th ed., 1815; Robinson der Jüngere, 59th ed., 1861, translated into English and into nearly every European language; and Sämmtliche Kinder-und Jugendschriften, 37 vols.
