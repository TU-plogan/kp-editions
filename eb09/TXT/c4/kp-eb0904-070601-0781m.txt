CALIGUL χA,, Caius Caesar, the third of the Roman emperors, was the son of Germanicus and Agrippina, and was born in 12 a.d. He was brought up in his father’s camp among the soldiers, and received the name Caligula, from the caligoe, or foot-soldiers’ shoes, which he used to wear. In 32 he was summoned to Tiberius, who was then living at Capreae, and did all in his power to ingratiate himself with the tyrant. Perhaps about 35 he married his first wife, Junia Claudia, who died in the following year. Caligula seems then to have resolved upon obtaining the succession to the empire. For this purpose he leagued himself with Macro, commander of the praetorian guards, whose wife he had seduced, and there can be no doubt that the death of Tiberius was hastened by one or both of them. The senate conferred the imperial power upon Caligula alone, although Tiberius, the grandson of the preceding emperor, had been designated as co-heir, and he entered on his first consulship in July 37. For an account of his reign and character see Roman History.
