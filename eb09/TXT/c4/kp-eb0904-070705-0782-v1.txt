CALLAO, the chief port of Peru, lies 8½ miles from Lima, the capital city, in 12° 4' S. lat., 77° 13' W. long It is built on a flat point of land in the recess of a spacious and well-sheltered bay, which is partly enclosed by the islands of San Lorenzo and Fronton, and affords the best anchorage on the Peruvian coast. The modern town lies half a mile north of the site of an older city, destroyed by an earthquake and invasion of the sea in 1746. It consists mainly of houses built of wicker-work and plastered with mud, stronger buildings being dangerous from the frequency of earthquakes; but a walled quadrangular fortress, built by the Spanish Government between 1770 and 1775, extends over about 15 acres, and is now used for the custom-house offices and stores. There are also several forts mounting cannon, and among the public buildings are the military and naval Government offices and barracks, three . Catholic churches and a Protestant chapel, two clubs, a hospital, and four banks. Several newspapers are published in the town. Callao is the headquarters of the Pacific Steam Navigation Company in South America (incorporated in 1840), and the works in connection with their large fleet of steam-vessels— foundries, carpenters’ shops, flour-mills, bakeries, and gasworks—occupy a large area near the custom-house. A large steam sugar-refinery is also in operation. Harbour works, consisting of sea walls of concrete blocks, and docks, with [9:4:708] berthing space for thirty large vessels, begun in 1871, were completed in February 1875, superseding the old and inconvenient pier and boat harbour. These works comprise also eighteen steam-cranes for loading goods, a triple line of railway along the dock walls, gas illumination, and supplies of fresh water. A floating dock, 300 feet in length, capable of taking up a vessel of 21 feet draught, and 5000 tons weight, was built in Glasgow and sent out to Callao harbour in 1863. The phenomenon of the bubbling up of sulphuretted hydrogen gas in the harbour, known as “Callao painter,” from its action on the paint of ships, has generally been ascribed to volcanic action, the belief having been that Callao is in the crater of an extinct volcano; but the borings for the new works discovered the cause of this to be in strongly impregnated springs forcing their way up through a stratum of clay and mud. Callao communicates with Lima by carriage road, and by a railway, completed in 1852, which is now extended through the capital towards Oroya over the Maritime Andes. The Pacific Company despatches or receives an ocean steamer almost every week to or from Liverpool by Valparaiso, the Strait of Magellan, and Rio de Janeiro; a separate bi-weekly steam line unites the port with Valparaiso, and communication is maintained with Panama by steamers four times a month each way. French and German steam lines have also headquarters at Callao. Trade is carried on mainly with Britain, the United States, France, Italy, Germany, Norway, and Central America, an average of nearly 2000 vessels entering the harbour annually, and frequently clearing in ballast for the Guano Islands, although exportation from the former main source of supply of guano — the Chincha Islands—ceased in 1872. This substance continues to be the most valuable export; after it come sugar, cotton, wool, hides, silver, and gold. Callao imports timber and railway material, wheat, ice, cattle, coal, and mixed cargoes of manufactures from foreign countries, and considerable quantities of flour from Chili. The whole value of imports and exports exceeds £6,000,000 annually. Since 1850, with the exception of the years between 1856 and 1861, when the immigration was prohibited by Congress, Chinese coolies have been imported in considerable numbers through Callao from the Portuguese possession of Macao in China. Perhaps 100,000 male Chinese have been introduced under contracts to serve for eight years; the passages have too often been attended with great hardships and frightful mortality, but the Chinese prove valuable workers on the great railroads now constructing in Peru.

Though the climate of Callao is good, having the pure breeze from the Pacific, and a temperature rarely exceeding 77° or falling below 65° Fahr., yet, in the absence of all hygiene, diseases, such as fevers and smallpox, are very prevalent, and the rate of mortality is high. The population, in default of recent exact enumeration, may be taken at from 15,000 to 18,000; the census of 1866, the latest, gave 14,800, a decrease of upwards of 2000 in seven years, and the number was further reduced by the havoc made by yellow fever in 1868. The traffic and business, and with these probably the population, of the port are, however, increasing.
