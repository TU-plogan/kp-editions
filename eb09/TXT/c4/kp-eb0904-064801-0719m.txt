CAIUS, Kaye, or Keye, Dr John (1510-1573), the founder of Caius College in Cambridge, was born at Norwich in 1510. He was admitted while very young a student at Gonville Hall, Cambridge. From his exercises performed there it seems probable that he intended to prosecute the study of divinity. He visited Italy, where he studied under the celebrated Montanus at Padua; and in 1541 he took his degree in physic at Bologna. In 1543 he visited several parts of Italy, Germany, and France; and returning to England, he began to practise first at Cambridge, then at Shrewsbury, and afterwards at Norwich. He removed to London in 1547, and was admitted fellow of the College of Physicians, of which he was for many years president. In 1557, being then physician to Queen Mary, he obtained a licence to advance Gonville Hall into a college, and he endowed it with several considerable estates, adding an entire new square at the expense of £1834. Of this college he accepted the mastership, which he held till within a short period of his death. He was physician to Edward VI., Queen Mary, and Queen Elizabeth. Towards the end of his life he retired to his own college at Cambridge, where having resigned the mastership to Dr Leggie of Norwich, he spent the remainder of his life as a fellow commoner. He died in July 1573, and was buried in the college chapel. Dr Caius was a learned, active, and benevolent man. In 1557 he erected a monument in St Paul’s to the memory of Linacre. In 1563 he obtained a grant for the College of Physicians to take the bodies of two malefactors annually for dissection; and he was the inventor of the insignia which distinguish the president from the rest of the fellows.

His works are—1. Annals of the College from 1555 to 1572. 2. Translation of several of Galen’s works, printed at different times abroad. 3. Hippocrates de Medicamentis, first discovered and published by Dr Cains; also De Ratione Victus, Lov. 1556, 8vo. 4. De Mendeti Methodo, Basel, 1554; Lond. 1556, 8vo. 5. Account of the Sweating Sickness in England, Lond. 1556, 1721. It is entitled De Ephemera Britannica. 6. History of the University of Cambridge, Lond. 1568, 8vo; 1574, 4to, in Latin. 7. De Thermis Britannicis ; but it is doubtful whether this work was ever printed. 8. Of some Rare Plants and Animals, Lond. 1570. 9. De Canibus Britannicis, 1570, 1729. 10. De Pronuntiatione Grcccoe et Latinae Linguae, Lond. 1574. 11. De Libris propriis, Lond. 1570. He also wrote numerous other works which were never printed.
