CALIPH, or Khalif, the sovereign dignitary among the Mahometans, vested with an almost absolute authority in all matters relating to religion and civil polity. In the Arabic it signifies successor or vicar, the caliphs bearing the same relation to Mahomet that the popes, in [9:4:707] the estimation of Roman Catholics, bear to St Fcter. It is at this day one of the titles of the grand seignior or sultan, who claims to be successor to Mahomet, through the line including Abu-Bekr, Oman, and Othman (the Sunnite view), and also of the Sophi or Sufi of Persia as claimant through Ali (the Shiite view). The history of the rule of the Sophis may occasionally remind the student of the saying current respecting Russian autocracy some fifty years ago, that it was “despotism tempered by assassination.” When Louis XIV. was one day, in the presence of some courtiers, extolling the government of the Sophis as something approaching to an almost ideal excellence, the Marshal d’Estrees replied, “But, sire, I have seen three of them strangled during my lifetime.” One of the chief functions of the caliph, in his quality of imaum or chief priest of Islamism, was to begin the public prayers every Friday in the chief mosque, and to deliver the khootba or sermon. In after times they had assistants for this latter office; but the former was always performed by the caliph in person. The caliph was also obliged to lead the pilgrims to Mecca in person, and to march at the head of the armies of his empire. He granted investiture to princes and sent swords, standards, gowns, and the like, as presents to princes of the Mahometan religion, who, though they had thrown off the yoke of the caliphate, held of it as vassals. The caliphs usually went to the mosque mounted on mules; and the Seljukian sultans, though masters of Baghdad, held their stirrups and led their mules by the bridle some distance on foot, till the caliphs gave them the sign to mount on horseback. At a window of the caliph’s palace there always hung a piece of black velvet 20 cubits long, which reached to the ground, and was called the caliph's sleeve; this the grandees of his court kissed daily with great respect. After the destruction of the caliphate by Hulagu, the Mahometan princes appointed a particular officer in their respective dominions to sustain the sacred authority of caliph. In Turkey this officer is called mufti, and in Persia sadne.

The successions of caliphs continued from the death of Mahomet till the 655th year of the Hegira, when Baghdad was taken by the Tatars. After this, however, there were persons who claimed the caliphate, as pretending to be of the family of the Abbassides, and to them the sultans of Egypt rendered great honours at Cairo, as the true successors of Mahomet; but this honour was merely titular, and the right allowed them only in matters of religion; and though they bore the sovereign title of caliphs, they were subjects and dependents of the sultans. In the year of the Hegira 361, a kind of caliphate was erected by the Fatimites in Africa, and lasted till it was suppressed by Saladin. Historians also speak of a third caliphate in Yemen or Arabia Felix, erected by some princes of the family of the Jobites. The emperors of Marocco assume the title of grand scherιfs, and pretend to be the true caliphs, or successors of Mahomet, though under another name. For particulars concerning the caliphs and caliphate see works bearing on Mahometan rule, such as Ockley’s History of the Saracens ; Gibbon’s Decline and Fall, chap, li.; Von Hammer, Histoire des Ottomans ; and for a brief survey, Freeman’s History and Conquests of the Saracens, Oxford, 1856.
