CALATAFIMI, a town of Sicily, in the province of Trapani and district of Alcamo, about 30 miles from Palermo. It lies between two hills in a fine corn country, and is celebrated for its cattle and its cheese. In one of its churches, Santa Croce, there is a fine altar of mosaic work; and in the neighbourhood are the extensive and well-preserved ruins of Segesta. On the hill above the town stands the Saracenic castle of Kalat-al-Fimi, from which it derives its name, and about four miles distant is the battle-field on which Garibaldi won his first victory over the Neapolitans on May 15,1860. Population, 9414.
