CANNAe, in Ancient Geography, a town of Apulia, on the River Aufidus, 6 miles from its mouth. It is famous for a terrible defeat which the Romans received there from the Carthaginians under Hannibal, 216 B.c. A great diversity of opinion has prevailed as to the exact spot on which the battle was fought, whether, as has been the general belief, on the south side of the river, or on the north bank, as is maintained by the best authorities, including Niebuhr, Swinburne, &c. The site of the town, which continued to exist at least till the 13th century, is still marked by ancient ruins, among which the most important are those of an aqueduct, an amphitheatre, and a triumphal arch. In a neighbouring rock are several large sepulchral excavations, in which vases and paintings have been discovered.
