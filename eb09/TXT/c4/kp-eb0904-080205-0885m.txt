CANDIAC, Jean Louis Pierre Elizabeth de Montcalm de, a child of astonishing precocity, born at the Château de Candiac, in the diocese of Nîmes in France, in 1719. At four years of age he read Latin, either printed or in manuscript; and at six he understood Greek and Hebrew, had an astonishing acquaintance with arithmetic, history, geography, and heraldry, and had read many of the best authors. His extraordinary powers attracted the attention of the learned; and it was for his benefit that the typographic board was contrived by Μ. Dumas, who superintended his instruction. He died at Paris in 1726.
