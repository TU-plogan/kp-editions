CALMAR, or Kalmar, the capital of a province of the same name in Sweden, on Calmar Sound opposite the island of Öland, about 190 miles from Stockholm, in 56° 40' N. lat., 16° 20' E. long. It is built on the island of Quarnholm, and communicates with the suburbs on the mainland by a bridge of boats. Most of the houses are built of wood; but the cathedral, erected in the 17th century by Nicodemus Tessin the younger, the castle, the town-house, and other public edifices are of stone, of which there are good quarries in the island of Öland. It has a gymnasium, and several smaller educational establishments. The harbour is safe and commodious, but a large part of the trade has been transferred to Stockholm. Besides its manufactures of woollen stuffs, leather, tobacco, and potash, the town carries on shipbuilding and an export trade in flax, timber, iron, alum, pitch, &c. Calmar was once a flourishing and strongly-fortified town; and, previous to the conflagration of 1647, was built on the mainland. It is frequently mentioned both in the military and political aunals of Sweden, and especially gives name to the treaty by which Sweden, Denmark, and Norway were, in 1397, erected into one kingdom under Queen Margaret. Population in 1868, 9420.
