CAMPAGNA DI ROMA, is, in the wider application of the word, an extensive plain of central Italy, almost coinciding with the ancient Latium, and, in a more restricted signification, that portion of the larger area which lies immediately round the city of Rome between the Tiber and the Anio. The circumference of the latter “might be marked,” says Gregorovius, “by a series of well-known points,—Civita Vecchia, Tolfa, Ronciglione, Soracte, Tivoli, Palestrina, Albano, and Ostia;” while the former may be regarded as bounded on the N. by the Mountains of Viterbo (Sylva Ciminia), on the E. by the lower ranges of the Apennines, and on the S. and W. by the Tyrrhenian Sea. It extends about 84 miles in length from Civita Vecchia to Terracina, and has a breadth of 24 miles,—its area being nearly 1400 square miles. Of distinctly volcanic formation, the surface presents a very undulating appearance, broken by deep gullies and studded with extinct craters, that now form the basins of lakes, such as those of Bolsena, Vico, and Baccano. In ancient times it seems to have been a well-peopled region, and was the seat of numerous cities; but in the 3d and 4th centuries b.c. the Roman aristocracy turned the most of the district into huge estates, and thus led to the disappearance of the agricultural population. In the earlier period of the empire its condition grew worse and worse, and many parts of the plain became covered with pestilential marshes. The emperors Claudius, Nerva, and Trajan turned their attention to the amelioration of the district, and under their example and exhortation the Roman aristocracy erected numerous villas within its boundaries, and used them at least for summer residence. With the ruin of the empire and the inroad of the barbarian hordes the desolation of the Campagna was complete; but, again, in the Middle. Ages, it became dotted over with the baronial castles of the rival families of Rome—the Orsini, the Colonnas, the Savelli, the Conti, and the Caetani-—who ruthlessly destroyed the remains of earlier edifices to obtain materials for their own. Several of the popes, as Boniface IX., Sixtus IV., and Julius III., made unsuccessful attempts to improve the sanitary condition of the Campagna; and equally fruitless in more recent times—as far, at least, as the general purpose is concerned—have been the efforts of Popes Pius VI. and VII., and of General Miollis, the French governor of Rome. The most healthy portions of the territory are in the north and east, embracing the slopes of the Apennines which are watered by the Teverone and Saccho; and the most pestilential is the stretch between the Lepini Hills and the sea. The Pontine marshes, included in the latter division, were drained, according to the plan of Bolognini, by Pius VI.; but though they have been restored to cultivation, their insalubrity is still notorious. The soil in many parts is very fertile; and the atmosphere, which is so deadly to man, has no hurtful effect on the lower animals. In summer, indeed, the vast expanse is little better than an arid steppe; but in the winter it furnishes abundant pasture to flocks of sheep and herds of silver-grey oxen and shaggy black horses. The land is for the most part let by the proprietors to Mercaηti di Campagna, who employ a subordinate class of factors (fattori) to manage their affairs on the spot. It is evident that the malaria which renders the Campagna almost uninhabitable during the summer is owing to natural causes affecting a wide area with which it is very difficult to deal, and that no merely local improvements can have any effect. The regulation of the rivers is so defective that they annually overflow a great extent of surface; the character of the soil allows the waters to gather in fetid masses, and the heat of summer turns them into noxious vapours. The attention∙of the Italian Government and of General Garibaldi has recently been turned towards the systematic sanitary improvement of the district, —with what results remains to be seen. The planting of the Eucalyptus globulus and the Helianthus annuus has been partially resorted to, especially in the district of Tre Fontani, and, it is reported, with some success.
