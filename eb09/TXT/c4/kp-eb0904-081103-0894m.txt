CANO, or Canus, Melchior (1523-1560), a learned Spanish bishop and theologian, who was pupil and successor of Vittoria as professor of theology at Salamanca. He had one, and only one, rival as to erudition in Spain, Bartolomeo de Carranza, like himself a Dominican, and the university was divided between the partizans of the two professors. On account of his violent opposition to the establishment of the Jesuits in his native country, he was summoned by Pope Paul III. to the Council of Trent, and appointed to the distant see of the Canaries. But his influence with Philip II. procured his recall to Castile, where he became provincial of the Dominican order. His principal works are entitled Praelectiones de Poenitentia, De Sacramentis, and Locorum Theologicorum Libri XII.
