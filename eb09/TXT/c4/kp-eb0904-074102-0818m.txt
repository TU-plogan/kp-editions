CAMERARIUS, Joachim (1500-1574), whose family name was Liebhard, one of the most learned classical scholars of his time, was born at Bamberg on the 12th A pril 1500. He studied at Leipsic, Erfurt, and Wittenberg, and in the last-mentioned town he enjoyed the friendship of Melanchthon. For some years he was teacher of history and Greek at the Gymnasium, Nuremberg. In 1530 he was sent as deputy for Nuremberg to the Diet of Augsburg, where he rendered important assistance to Melanchthon. Five years later he was commissioned by Duke Ulrich of Würtemberg to recognize the university of Tübingen; and he subsequently rendered a similar service at Leipsic, where the remainder of his life was chiefly spent. He translated into Latin Herodotus, Demosthenes, Xenophon, Homer, Theocritus, Sophocles, Lucian, Theodoret, Nicephorus, and other Greek writers. He published upwards of 150 works, including a Catalogue of the Bishops of the principal Sees ; Greek Epistles ; Accounts of his Journeys, in Latin verse; a Commentary on Plautus: Euclid, in Latin; and the Lives of Helius Eobanus Hessus and Philip Melanchthon. He died at Leipsic in 1574.
