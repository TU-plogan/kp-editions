CALMUCKS, Kalmucks, or Kalmuiks, a people of Mongolian race who inhabit various parts of the Russian and Chinese empires, as well as other portions of Central Asia. They are of the middle height, fairly proportioned, and of considerable strength; their cheek-bones are prominent, the chin short, the nose turned up, the beard thin, and the hair scrubby. For the most part still in the nomadic stage, they inhabit conical felt tents, which they set up in regular lines like the streets of a town. Their wealth consists entirely in small but high-spirited horses, excellent cattle, and broad-tailed, rough-fleeced sheep. They are so much addicted to gaming that they not unfrequently stake everything they possess. In religion they are adherents of Lamaism, and their conduct is greatly under the control of their priests. Their language is closely connected with Mongolian proper, and is written with a similar alphabet; its grammar and vocabulary have been made known to Europeans more especially by A. H. Zwick about 1853. Of their literature the great proportion is religious, and is derived from Indian originals. The Siddhi Kiir, a collection of stories, which is one of their most famous productions, was published with a German translation, a glossary, and notes, by B. Jülg, at Leipsic in 1866. As early as the 16th century the Calmucks possessed an extensive district of Central Asia between the Altai mountains and the Thian Shan, and between the desert of Gobi and the Balkash or Tengis Lake; and they were also settled in what is now the southern part of the Yeniseisk government, where indeed they were first met by Russian emigrants. At that time they bore the name of Derben Oirat, or Four Confederates, being divided into the four tribes of Jungars, Turguts, Khoshots, and Durbots. In the 17th century the Calmucks grew extremely strong, and after violent feuds united themselves, under the leadership of Batur and his son Galdan, into the powerful Jun-garian kingdom. The strife which preceded the unification occasioned important movements of some Calmuck bands towards the E. and S.E. of Russia. Under Kour-liuk, the great mass of the Turguts appeared for the first time within the Russian territory on the eastern side of the Volga in 1630. They conquered the nomadic Nogais of the district, but on this first occasion turned back to the Kirghiz steppes. In 1636 as many as 50,000 kibitkas, or more than 200,000 men and women crossed the Emba, and took possession of the Trans-Volga steppes of the present Astrakhan government; and plundering incursions began to be made on the Russian settlements, in Saratoff, Penza, and Tamboff, while Tobolsk, in Siberia, had to defend itself with arms in 1646. After the fall of Kour-liuk, in an attack on Astrakhan itself, the Calmucks became less aggressive, and in 1655 passed of their own accord under Russian authority. Down to the middle of the 18th century bands, however, continued to arrive, and the depredations on Russian ground did not cease during all the long reign of the Khan Ayuka (1670-1724). This chief more than once broke his oath to the Russian Government; but he also on several occasions supplied veιy important contingents to the imperial army. His power is shown by the fact that his court was visited in 1713 by an ambassador from China. In the reign of the Empress Catharine the Russian Government created great discontent among the Calmucks by their general treatment, and still more by refusing to confirm Ubashi, the grandson of Ayuka, in his dignities. A Calmuck chieftain from Jungaria skilfully took advantage of this condition of affairs to persuade Ubashi and his subjects to return to Jungaria, and attempt its conquest. The result was the wonderful and disastrous flight of the Calmucks from Russia in 1771, so graphically described by De Quincey. The number of the fugitives amounted, according to some authorities, to 120,000. Harassed on all sides by savage troops of Cossacks and Khirghises, the wretched Calmucks pursued their way across the barren steppes, and their main body was routed in a terrible battle on the shores of the Balkash. The remnants were settled on the banks of the Hi by the Chinese emperor Kien Long, and there their descendants are still to be found. There still remained in Russia the Durbots, who were living in the Don territory, and those of the Astrakhan Calmucks who at the time of the flight happened to be on the right bank of the Volga.

The total number now in the Russian empire may be estimated at 120,000. In the Chinese territory, where they ire known as Eliots, or Olüts, their numbers are considerable, but are not precisely known.
