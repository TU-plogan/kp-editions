CAMALDULIANS, Camaldunians, or Camaldolites, an order of religious persons, founded by Romuald, an Italian, in the beginning of the 11th century, in the desolate waste of Camaldoli, or Campo Malduli, on the lofty heights of the Apennines. Their rule was that of St Benedict; and their houses were never erected at less than five leagues from cities. The monks Were divided into cenobites and eremites. The Camaldulians, till the close of the 11th century, were called generally Romualdins; previously, Camal-dulianwas a particular name for those of the desert Camaldoli. Guido Grandi (1671-1742), a Camaldulian monk, and mathematician to the grand duke of Tuscany, published Camaldulian Dissertations, on the origin and establishment of this order. Pope Gregory XIII. was a Camaldulian.
