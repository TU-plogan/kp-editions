CAMARINA, an ancient city of Sicily, situated on the south coast, near the mouth of the Hippuris or Fiume di Camarana, as it is still called, about 20 miles E. of Gela or Terranova. It was originally founded by the Syracusans in the 6th century b.c., but was shortly afterwards destroyed by the mother city, because it had thrown off its allegiance. Restored in 495 b.c. by Hippocrates of Gela, it was again depopulated by Gelon, the conquerer of Syracuse, and did not receive a permanent establishment till 461. During the next century the mainspring of its political action was usually antipathy to Syracuse, but on the Athenian invasion it ultimately sent assistance to the beleaguered city. The Carthaginians struck a severe blow at its prosperity in the 5th century B.C., and in 258 a large part of its inhabitants were sold as slaves by the Roman consuls. The town continued to exist in the 2d century of the Christian era, and its site is still marked by a considerable mass of ruins. Mù κiveι [9:4:722] Kaμapιrav, “ Do not stir Kamarina,” a proverb somewhat equivalent to our advice to “let well alone,” is said to have been originally the answer of the Delphic oracle to the citizens when they consulted as to the draining of a neighbouring lake.
