CALC-SPAR, or Calcareous Spar, is the popular name for certain of the crystalline forms of carbonate of lime or calcite (CaCO 3 ), containing in 100 parts 56 of lime and 44 of carbonic acid. The name includes only the varieties of calcite which belong to the rhombohedral or hexagonal order, to the exclusion of aragonite, which, having the same composition, belongs to the rhombic or right prismatic system, the two minerals forming a striking example of dimorphism. Calc-spar is also the same in chemical composition as marble, limestone, chalk, stalagmitic deposits, <fcc., which are among the most abundant ingredients in the rocky masses of the earth. The primary form of calc-spar is an obtuse rhombohedron, the faces of which are inclined to each other in the terminal edges at an angle of 105 o, 5, and all secondary crystals, however various they may be, tend to break or split up into that primary form. The variety of crystalline forms assumed by the mineral is exceedingly great, upwards of 800 being enumerated, of which 700 have been figured by Count Bournon in his treatise on carbonate of lime. The forms, although thus numerous, fall chiefly under the two heads of rhombohedrons, of which Iceland spar is a type, and scalenohedrons, which may be represented by the variety known as dog’s-tooth spar. (See Mineralogy.) Pure calc-spar is a transparent, colourless mineral with a vitreous lustre; its specific gravity is about 2 ’ 721; and in hardness it is intermediate between gypsum and fluor-spar, occupying the third place in the standard scale. It is frequently tinted in red, yellow, green, brown, and grey, from the presence of foreign matter. Pure, transparent rhombohedral crystals, obtained by cleavage or otherwise, are distinguished as Iceland spar, on account of the largest and finest crystals being found in that island, or as doubly-refracting spar (German, Doppel-spath), from their exhibiting in the highest degree the double refraction of light. Before the blow-pipe it is reduced to caustic lime, and moistened with hydrochloric or other acid it displays a brisk effervescence. It occurs abundantly in almost all parts of the world,—Andreasberg in the Hartz and the Derbyshire lead mines being noted localities for large fine crystals. Magnificent cleavage rhombohedrons are obtained from Iceland, one having been noted which exceeded 6 yards long and 3 yards high. Professor Dana notices one nearly transparent crystal, weighing 165 ft>, now in the cabinet of Yale College, found in the Rossie Lèad Mine, New York State, and he cites a large number of other localities in the United States where crystals occur. Iceland spar, on account of its high double refracting property, is very extensively employed in optical research. It is most conveniently used in the form of a Nicol’s prism, which consists of a long rhomboidal crystal cut obliquely into two equal portions in a plane perpendicular to the plane of the longer diagonal of the base. The two halves are cemented together in their original position with Canada balsam; and in this condition the ordinary ray undergoes total reflection from the prism, whilst the extraordinary ray passes through.
