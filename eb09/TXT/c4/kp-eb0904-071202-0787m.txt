CALTAGIRONE, or Calatagirone, a town of Sicily, the seat of a bishop, in the province of Catania, and about 34 miles S.W. of the city of that name, is situated on two rocky eminences united by a bridge, about 2170 feet above the level of the sea. It is well built and possesses a fine market-place, the ruins of a castle, a cathedral, several churches, and ten convents, a casa communale or town-house, built on ancient substructions, an orphanage, and a [9:4:713] hospital. Its inhabitants are said to have a much greater amount of culture than is common in the provincial towns of Sicily, and great encouragement is given by the higher classes to the cause of education. The most remarkable industry in the town is the manufacture of terra-cotta figures, representing different types of Italian costume. The remains of an aqueduct, an ancient subterranean road cut out of the rock, and various mosaics and other antiquities discovered by excavation, show that the site'of the town was already occupied at a very early date; and according to some an identification may be effected with Hybla Minor. The present city, however, owes its origin to the Saracens, who defeated the Greeks there in 83âˆ™1, and remained in possession till 1060. Population, 25,978.
