CAeSAR, Sir Julius (1557-1636), a learned civilian, descended by the female line from the Dukes de’ Cesarini in Italy, was born near Tottenham in Middlesex. He was educated at Oxford, and afterwards studied at the university of Paris, where in the year 1581 he was created doctor of the civil law. Two years later he was admitted to the same degree at Oxford, and also became doctor of the canon law. He held many high offices during the reigns of Elizabeth and James I., and for the last twenty years of his life was master of the rolls. He was so remarkable for his bounty and charity to all persons of worth, that it was said of him that he seemed to be the almoner-general of the nation. His manuscripts, many of which are now in the British Museum, were sold by auction in 1757 for upwards of £500. See E.Lodge, Life of Sir Julius Caesar, 1810.
