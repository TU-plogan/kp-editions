CAMUCCINI, Vincenzo (1775-1844), the most famous of the modern historical painters of Italy, was born at Rome in 1775. He was educated by his brother Pietro, a picturerestorer, and Bombelli, an engraver, and, up to the age of thirty, attempted nothing higher than copies of the great masters, his especial study being Raffaelle. As an original painter, Camuccini belongs to the school of David. His works are rather the fruits of great cleverness and patient care than of fresh and original genius; and his style was essentially imitative. He enjoyed immense popularity, both personally and as an artist, and received many honours and preferments from the Papal and other Italian courts. He was appointed director of the Academy of San Luca and of the Neapolitan Academy at Rome, and conservator of the pictures of the Vatican. He was also made chevalier of nearly all the orders in Italy, and member of the Legion of Honour. His chief works are the classical paintings of the Assassination of Caesar, the Death of Virginia, the Devotion of the Roman Women, Young Romulus and Remus, Horatius Coeles, the St Thomas, which was copied in mosaic for St Peter’s, the Presentation of Christin the Temple, and a number of excellent portraits. He died at Rome September 2, 1844.
