CALLISTHENES, a philosopher of Olÿnthus, and a relation and pupil of Aristotle, through whose recommendation he was appointed to attend Alexander in his Asiatic expedition, 334 b.c. He had the imprudence to censure the conqueror’s adoption of Oriental customs, inveighing especially against the servile ceremony of adoration. Having by the boldness of his censures rendered himself highly obnoxious to the king, he was accused of being privy to a treasonable conspiracy; and after being kept in chains for seven months he died, either by torture, or of a disease arising from excessive obesity. Callisthenes wrote an account of Alexander’s expedition, a history of Greece, and other works, all of which have perished.
