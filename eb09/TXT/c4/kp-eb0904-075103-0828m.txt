CAMPAN, Jeanne Louise Henriette (1752-1822), née Genest, was born at Paris in 1752. Carefully educated, and surrounded by the most cultivated society, at the age of fifteen she had gained so high a reputation for her accomplishments as to be appointed reader to the young princesses. At court she was a general favourite, and when she bestowed her hand upon Μ. Campan, son of the secretary of the royal cabinet, the king gave her an annuity of 5000 livres as dowry. She was soon after appointed first lady of the bedchamber by Marie Antoinette; and she continued to be the faithful attendant of that princess till she was forcibly separated from her at the sacking of the Tuileries, on 20th June 1792. After this event Mme. Campan, almost penniless, and thrown on her own resources by the illness of her husband, bravely determined to support herself by establishing a school at Saint-Germain. The institution prospered, and was patronized by Mme. Beauharnais, whose influence led to the appointment of Mme. Campan as superintendent of the academy founded by Napoleon at Ecouen, for the education of the daughters and sisters of members of the Legion of Honour. This post she held till it was abolished at the restoration of the Bourbons, when she retired to Mantes, where she spent the rest of her life amid the kind attentions of affectionate friends, but saddened by the loss of her only son, and by the calumnies circulated on account of her connection with the Bonapartes. She died in 1822, leaving interesting Mémoires szιr la vie privée de Marie Antoinette, suivis de souvenirs et anecdotes historiques sur les règnes de Louis XI V.-XV. (Paris, 1823); a treatise De VEducation des Femmes; and one or two small didactic works, written in a clear and natural style.
