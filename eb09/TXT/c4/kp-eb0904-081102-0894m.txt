CANO, Alonzo (1600-1667), one of the most vigorous of the Spanish painters, and also, like Michelangelo, with whom he is usually compared, an architect and sculptor of great merit. He has left in Spain a very great number of specimens of his genius, which display the boldness of his design, the facility of his pencil, the purity of his fleshtints, and his knowledge of chiaroscuro. He was a native of Granada, and a contemporary of Velasquez and Pacheco, whom he rivalled without imitating. As a statuary, his most famous works are the Madonna and Child in the church of Nebrissa, and the colossal figures of San Pedro and San Pablo. As an architect, he indulged in too profuse ornamentation, and gave way too much to the fancies of his day. Philip IV. made him royal architect and kingâ€™s painter, and gave him the church preferment of a canon. He was notorious for his ungovernable temper; and it is said that once he risked his life by committing the then capital offence of dashing to pieces the statue of a saint, when in a rage with the purchaser who grudged the price he demanded. His known passionateness also (according to another story) caused him to be suspected, and even tortured, for the murder of his wife, though all other circumstances pointed to his servant as the culprit.
