CANA, of Galilee, a village of Palestine, remarkable as the birthplace of Nathanael, and the scene of Christ’s “beginning of miracles.” Its exact site is unknown, but it is evident from the Biblical narrative that it was in the neighbourhood of Capernaum. By a tradition as old as the 8th century it is identified with Kefr Kenna, and by a more modern hypothesis with Kana-el-Jelil. The former lies about 4½ miles N.W. of Nazareth, and contains the ruins of a church and a small Christian population; the latter is an uninhabited village about 9 miles N. of Nazareth, with no remains of antiquity but a few cisterns.
