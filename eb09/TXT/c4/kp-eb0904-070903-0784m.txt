CALLIRRHOE, in Greek legend, was a daughter of the river god Achelous, and became the wife of Alcmaeon, who had wandered from Argos to be purified in the water of the Achelous from the crime of having killed his mother Eriphyle. He had taken with him from Argos the ill-omened necklace and peplos of Harmonia, with which his mother had been misled by Polynices, but he had left them in Arcadia. Callirrhoe pressed so hard to obtain them that he was compelled to go for that purpose to Phegeus, the king of Psophis in Arcadia, with whom he had left them. While returning he was waylaid by Phegeus and killed. Callirrhoe now implored the gods to cause her two young sons to grow at once to manhood to avenge their fatherâ€™s death. This was granted, and her sons slew Phegeus with his two sons, and returning with the necklace and peplos, dedicated them at Delphi.
