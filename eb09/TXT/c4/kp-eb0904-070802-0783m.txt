CALLCOTT, John Wall (1766—1821), brother of the preceding, was born at Kensington in 1766, and was the son of a builder. At the age of seven he was sent to a neighbouring day school, where he continued for five years, studying chiefly Latin and Greek. During this time he frequently went to Kensington church, in the repairs of which his father was employed, and the impression he received on hearing the organ of that church seems to have roused his love for music. The organist at that time was Henry Whitney, from whom Callcott received his first musical instruction. He did not, however, choose music as a profession, being desirous to become a surgeon, only when on witnessing a surgical operation he found his nervous system seriously affected by the sight, he determined to devote himself to music. His intimacy with Dr Arnold and other leading musicians of the day procured him access to artistic circles; and his successful competition for the prize offered by a musical society called the “Catch Club” soon spread his reputation as composer of glees, catches, canons, and other pieces of concerted vocal music. On these his reputation as a creative musician is mainly founded. In them he displays considerable skill and talent, and some of his glees retain their popularity at the present day. They are well adapted to the voice, and their melodies are pleasing and not without feeling. As an instrumental composer Callcott never succeeded, not even after he had taken lessons from Haydn. But of far greater importance than his compositions are his theoretical writings, and it is chiefly for the sake of the latter that he is noteworthy beyond other English composers of equal merit. His Musical Grammar, published in 1806 (3d edition, 1817), was long considered as the standard work of musical instruction in this country, and has not been superseded up to the present day by any other book produced by an English musician. It is a scholarly and lucid treatment of the rudiments of the art, but at present, of course, antiquated to a great extent, and, indeed, all but useless to the student of modern music. Callcott was a much esteemed teacher of music for many years. He also held the position of organist at various churches. In 1800 he took his degree of Mus. D. at Oxford, and in 1805 he succeeded Dr Crotch as musical lecturer at the Royal Institution. Towards the end of his life his artistic career was frequently interrupted by ill-health. He died, after much suffering, in 1821. A posthumous collection of his most favourite vocal pieces was published with a memoir of his life by his son-in-law, Mr W. Horsley, himself a composer of note. Numerous other works remain in manuscript.
