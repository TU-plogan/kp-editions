CALTANISETTA, or Calatanisetta, the capital of a province of the same name in Sicily, is situated in an extensive and fertile plain, dominated by Monte San Giuliano, near the right bank of the Salso, 62 miles S.E. of Palermo. It is well built, and contains several handsome edifices, is defended by a castle, and is the seat of judicial courts. In the neighbourhood, at Terra-Pilata, are several springs emitting hydrogen gas, a mud-volcano, and extensive sulphur-works; and about 2 miles distant is the Abbey of Santo Spirito, founded by Roger I., where a great national festival is held every Whitmonday. The town is of Saracenic origin, as indeed its name suggests—Kalat-al-Nisa, the Ladies’ Castle; but it has been completely modernized. In 1820 the people of Palermo were defeated near it by the Neapolitan General Pepe. Population, 26,156.
