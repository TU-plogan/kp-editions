CANDLISH, Robert Smith, D.D. (1806-1873), an eminent Scottish clergyman, was born at Edinburgh on the 23d March 1806. His father, who was a teacher of medicine, having died a few weeks after his birth, the widow and family removed to Glasgow, where young Candlish was brought up and educated. In 1818 he entered the University of Glasgow, and after a curriculum of five sessions, during which he carried off many honours, he duly graduated Μ. A. Entering immediately on his professional studies, he passed during the years 1823-26 through the prescribed course at the divinity hall, then presided over by Dr Stevenson MacGill. While carrying on his studies he had been largely occupied, according to the common Scotch practice, with private teaching, and on leaving the divinity hall he accompanied a pupil as private tutor to Eton. On the termination of this engagement in 1829, he entered upon his own proper work, having been licensed to preach during the summer vacation of the previous year. He was employed for two years as assistant to the minister of the parish of St Andrews, Glasgow, and he subsequently occupied a similar situation for about the same period in the parish of Bonhill, Dumbartonshire. In each case the entire duties of the charge devolved upon him, and he fulfilled them with characteristic energy and zeal. It was not until 1834, after he had offered himself for service in Canada, in the belief that he was not to find a sphere of labour at home, that he obtained a settled charge as minister of the important parish of St George’s, Edinburgh. Here he at once took the place he so long held as one of the ablest preachers in Scotland. Destitute of natural oratorical gifts, and somewhat ungainly in his manner, he attracted and even rivetted the attention of his audience by a rare combination of intellectual keenness, emotional fervour, spiritual insight, and power of dramatic representation of character and life. His theology was that of the Scottish Calvinistic school, but he combined with the narrowness that springs from strong conviction the breadth that springs from tender sympathy. With such qualities it was natural that he should gather round him one of the largest and most intelligent congregations in the Scottish metropolis.

From the very commencement of his ministry in Edinburgh, Candlish took the deepest interest in ecclesiastical[9:4:805] questions, and he soon became involved as one of the chief actors in the struggle which was then agitating the church. His first Assembly speech, delivered in 1839, placed him at once among the leaders of the party that afterwards formed the Free Church, and his influence in bringing about what is known as the Disruption was inferior only to that of Chalmers. As a debater he had powers of the highest order, which would have won for him a foremost place in any deliberative assembly. Great as was his popularity as a preacher, it was in the ecclesiastical arena that his ability chiefly showed itself, and probably no other single man had from first to last so large a share in shaping the constitution and guiding the policy of the Free Church. He was actively engaged at one time or other in ^nearly all the various schemes of the church, but speciaí mention should be made of his services in the Education Committee, of which he was convener from 1846 to 1863, and in the unsuccessful negotiations for union among the non-established Presbyterian denominations of Scotland, which were carried on during the years 1863-73. In the Assembly of 1861 he filled the moderator’s chair.

As a theologian the position of Candlish was perhaps inferior to that which he held as a preacher and ecclesiastic, but it was not inconsiderable. So early as 1841 his reputation in this department was sufficient to secure for him the nomination to the newly-founded chair of Biblical Criticism in the University of Edinburgh. The appointment was, however, not ratified by the Home Secretary in consequence of a representation made in the House of Lords, by the earl of Aberdeen, that Candlish had set himself in opposition to the law of the land by preaching in the parish of Huntly in spite of an interdict from the Court of Session. By a somewhat curious coincidence a second appointment to a professorship was also nullified, though in this case by his own act, and after a few months’ tenure of the office. In 1847 Candlish, who had received the degree of D.D. from Princeton, New Jersey, in 1841, was chosen by the Assembly of the Free Church to succeed Chalmers in the chair of divinity iu the New College, Edinburgh. After partially fulfilling the duties of the office for one session, he was led to resume the charge of St George’s, the clergyman who had been chosen by the congregation as his successor having died before entering on his work. In 1862 he was again connected with the New College, being appointed principal in succession to Cunningham, with the understanding that he should still retain his position as minister of St George’s. Some months before this he had obtained the assistance of a colleague in his pastoral work,but he continued to preach, with one or two intervals of somewhat protracted illness, until within a short time of his death, which occurred on the 19th October 1873.

Though his greatest power was not displayed through the press, Candlish made a number of somewhat important contributions to theological literature. In 1842 he published the first volume of his Contributions towards ths Exposition of ihs Book of Genesis, a work which was completed in three volumes several years later. In 1854 he delivered, in Exeter Hall, London, a lfecture on the Theological Essays of the Rev. F. D. Maurice, which he afterwards published, along with a fuller examination of the doctrine of the essays. A treatise entitled The Atonement ; its Reality, Completeness, and Extent (1861) was based upon a smaller work which first appeared in 1845. In 1864 he delivered the first series of Cunningham lectures, taking for his subject The Fatherhood of God. Published immediately afterwards, the lectures excited considerable discussion on account of the peculiar views they represented. Further illustrations of these views were given in two works published about the same time as the lectures, one a treatise On ths Sonship and Brotherhood of Believers, and the other an exposition of the first epistle of St John. Among his other works were Life in a Risen Saviour ; Scripture Characters ; Reason and Revelation; and The Christian’s Sacrifice and Service of Praise. A posthumous volume of sermons with a short prefatory biographical sketch appeared in 1874.
