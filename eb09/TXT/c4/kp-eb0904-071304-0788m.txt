CALVERT, George, Lord Baltimore (1582-1632), one of the principal secretaries of state under James I., was born at Kipling in Yorkshire in 1582. He was educated at Oxford, and after travelling on the Continent entered public service as secretary to Robert Cecil, afterwards earl of Salisbury. In 1617 he was knighted, and in 1619 he was made one of the principal secretaries of state. He retained office for five years, at the end of which term he resigned, alleging as a reason that he had recently adopted the Catholic faith. He still continued at court, however, in the capacity of a privy-councillor. In 1625 he was made Baron Baltimore, in the county of Longford, Ireland, and among other rewards he received for his services was a patent as lord of the province of Avalon in Newfoundland. As this colony was much exposed to the attacks of the French he left it, and obtained another patent for Maryland, in the north of Virginia. He died in 1632 before the grant was confirmed, but in that year it was made out in the name of his son Cecil. The city of Baltimore derives its name from the title of this family.
