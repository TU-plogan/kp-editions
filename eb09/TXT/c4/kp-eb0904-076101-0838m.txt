CAMPHUYSEN, Dirk Rafaelsz (1586-1627), a Dutch painter, poet, and theologian, the son of a surgeon at Gorcum, was born in 1586. As he manifested, great artistic talent, his brother, in whose charge he was left on the death of his parents, placed him under the painter Govitz. But at that time there was intense interest in theology; and Camphuysen, sharing in the prevailing enthusiasm, deserted the pursuit of art, to become first tutor of the sons of the lord of Nieuport, and then minister of Vleuten. As, however, he had embraced the doctrines of Arminius with fervour, he was driven from this post, and suffered much persecution. His chief solace was poetry; and he has left a translation of the Psalms, and a number of short pieces, remarkable for their freshness and depth of poetic feeling. He is also the author of several theological works of fair merit, among which is a Compendium Doctrines Socimorum ; but his fame chiefly rests on his artistic power. His pictures, like his poems, are mostly small, but of great beauty; the colouring, though thin, is pure; the composition and pencilling are exquisite, and the perspective above criticism. The best of his works are his sunset and moonlight scenes and his views of the Rhine and other rivers. The close of his life was spent at Dokkum, where he died in 1627.
