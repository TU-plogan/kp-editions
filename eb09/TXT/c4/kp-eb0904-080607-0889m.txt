CANINI, Giovanni Agnolo (1617-1666), a designer and engraver, born at Rome in 1617. He was a pupil of Domenichino, and afterwards of Barbalunga. He painted some altarpieces at Rome, including two admired pictures for the church of San Martino aâ€™ Monti, representing the Martyrdom of St Stephen and of St Bartholomew. His painting aimed at general effect, not at precision of detail. Having accompanied Cardinal Chigi to France, he was encouraged by the minister Colbert to carry into execution his project of designing, from medals, antique gems, and similar sources, a series of portraits of the most illustrious characters of antiquity, accompanied with memoirs; but shortly after the commencement of the undertaking Canini died at Rome, in 1666. The work, however, was prosecuted by his brother Marcantonio, who, with the assistance of Picard and Valet, completed and published it in [9:4:807] 1699, under the title of Iconografia di Gio. Ag. Canini. It contains 150 engravings. A reprint in Italian and French appeared at Amsterdam in 1731.
