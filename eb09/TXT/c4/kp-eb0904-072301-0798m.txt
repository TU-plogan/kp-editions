CAMBAY, or Kambay, a town of Western India, in Guzerat, or the northern division of the province of Bombay, and forming the capital of the native state of the same name, which has an area of about 350 square miles, and a population of about 175,000. It is situated on the River Mahi, at the upper part of the Gulf of Cambay, 230 miles N. of Bombay, in 22° 18' N. lat. and 72° 39' E. long. It is supposed to be the Camanes of Ptolemy, and was formerly a very flourishing city, the seat of an extensive trade, and celebrated for its manufactures of silk, chintz, and gold stuffs; but owing principally to the gradually increasing difficulty of access by water, its commerce has long since fallen away, and the town has become poor and dilapidated. The tides rise upwards of 30 feet, and at high water ships anchor near the town. The trade is chiefly confined to the export of cotton. The town is celebrated for its agates and carnelians, which are wrought into a variety of trinkets of reputation principally in China. The houses in many instances are built of stone (a circumstance which indicates the former wealth of the city, as the material had to be brought from a very considerable distance); and a brick wall, three miles in circumference, surrounds the town, enclosing four large reservoirs of good water and three bazaars. To the south-east there are very extensive ruins of subterranean temples and other buildings half-buried in the sand by which the ancient town was overwhelmed. These temples belong to the Jains, and contain two massive statues of their deities, the one black, the other white. The principal one, as the inscription intimates, is Pariswanath, or Parswanatha, carved in the reign of the Emperor Akbar; the black one has the date of 1651 inscribed. It is supposed that Cambay about the 5 th century was the capital of the Hindu emperors of Western India. In 1780 it was taken possession of by the army of General Goddard, was restored to the Mahrattas in 1783, and was afterwards ceded to the British by the Peishwa under the treaty of 1803. The nawab, who is one of the 153 feudatory princes of British India by Sunηud or patent, pays £5876 of annual tribute to the viceroy of India from his revenue of £35,000. His military establishment consists of 800 horse and foot, who are employed indiscriminately in revenue, police, and miscellaneous duties; and a few pieces of ordnance complete his resources.

The Gulf of Cambay, which is shallow and abounds in shoals and sand-banks, penetrates the coast of India for about 80 miles. It is supposed that the depth of water in this gulf has been decreasing for more than two cen turies past. The tides, which are very high, run into it with amazing velocity, but at low water the bottom is left nearly dry for some distance below the latitude of the town of Cambay. It is, however, an important inlet, being the channel by which the valuable produce of central Guzerat and the British districts of Ahmedabad and Broach is exported; but the railway from Bombay to Baroda and Ahmedabad, near Cambay, is gradually attracting the trade to itself. The gulf extends between 21° and 22° 10' N. lat., and 71° 50' and 72° 40' E. long.
