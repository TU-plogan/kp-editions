CAILLIE, or Caillé, René (1799-1838), a French traveller in Africa, was born in 1799 at Mauzé, and died in 1838. His school education extended no farther than reading aud writing; and at the age of sixteen he commenced his career by a voyage to Senegal. But already Robinson Crusoe had kindled within him an enthusiastic admiration for the life of the discoverer; and in 1827, having collected 2000 francs by toiling on an indigo plantation, he set out on his most important mission. From Kakundy he travelled east by Cambaya, Kankan, Time, and Tangrera, and north-east by Donasso as far as Galia, through a hitherto unvisited district; and from Galia he passed through the country explored by Mungo Park to Timbuctoo, which he reached on April 20, 1828. He thus won the prize of 10,000 francs offered by the Geographical Society of Paris to the first traveller who should gain exact information of Timbuctoo, to be compared with that given by Mungo Park. He also received the order of the Legion of Honour, a pension, and other distinctions, and it was at the public expense that his Journal d ’ uη Voyage à Tembouetou et Jeune dans V Afrique Centrale, &e., was published in 1830.
