CAMBERT, Robert (1628—1677), the earliest composer of French operas, was born at Paris in 1628. His master for the clavecin, and probably also for composition, was Chambonnières. He was organist of the church of St Honoré, and also held the office of musical superintendent to Queen Anne of Austria, mother of Louis XIV. His earlier works, the words of which were furnished by the Abbé Perrin, continúed to be performed before the court at Vincennes, till the death of his patron Cardinal Mazarin. Displeased at his subsequent neglect, and jealous of the favour shown to Lulli, who was musical superintendent to the king, he went, in 1673, to London, where he was appointed soon after his arrival master of the band to Charles II. One at least of his operas, Pornone, was performed in London under his direction, but it did not suit the popular taste. His principal operatic pieces were entitled Ariadne οu les Amours de Bacchus, Pomone, and Les Peines et les Plaisirs de Γ Amour. Cambert died in London about 1677.
