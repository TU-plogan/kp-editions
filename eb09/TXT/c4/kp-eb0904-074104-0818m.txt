CAMERINO, formerly the capital of a delegation of the same name in the States of the Church, and now the chief town of a district, in the province of Macerata, in Italy, is situated on a height at the foot of the Apennines, 41 miles W. of Ancona. It is the seat of an archbishop, and possesses a small university founded in 1727, a theological seminary, nineteen conventual buildings, and a* bronze statue of Pope Sixtus V., dating from 1587. Its cathedral, Sansovino, is built on the site of an ancient temple to Jupiter, and contains a number of excellent paintings. The culture and manufacture of silk is by far the most important branch of industry; to which may be added the preparation of leather. Camerino occupies the site of the ancient Camerinum, an Umbrian city, whose inhabitants, the Camertes, are mentioned as an important people at a very early date. About the beginning of the Christian era its lands were bestowed on military colonists; but it continued to enjoy considerable prosperity. In the Middle Ages it originally formed part of the duchy of Spoleto; but it passed in the 13th century to the Varani family, and in 1520 was made an independent duchy by Leo X. About seventy years afterwards it was incorporated by the Papal States. The painter Carlo Maratta, the last of the so-called Roman school, was a native of the city. Population, 11,880.
