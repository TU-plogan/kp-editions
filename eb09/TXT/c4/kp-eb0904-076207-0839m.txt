CAMUS, Charles Etienne Louis (1699-1768), a French mathematician and mechanician, was born at Crécy-en-Brie, near Meaux, on the 25th August 1699. At the age of twelve he was able to maintain himself by teaching at the Collège de Navarre in Paris, where he devoted himself to mathematics, civil and military architecture, and astronomy. He became Associate of the Académie des Sciences, professor of geometry, secretary to the Academy of Architecture, and member of the Royal Society of London. In 1736 he accompanied Maupertuis and Clairvaut in an expedition to Lapland for the measurement of a degree of the meridian, when he rendered essential service, not only as a geometrician and astronomer, but also by his remarkable skill in the mechanical arts. He died on the 2d February 1768. He was the author of a Cours de Mathématiques (Paris, 1766), and a number of essays on mathematical and mechanical subjects.
