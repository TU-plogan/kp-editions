CABET, Etienne (1788-1856), an active French Communist, was born, the son of a cooper, at Dijon in 1788. He chose the profession of advocate without succeeding in it, but erelong became notable as the persevering apostle of republicanism and communism. He assisted in a secondary way in the Revolution of 1830, and obtained a legal appointment in Corsica under the Government of Louis Philippe; but, being dissatisfied with the moderation of the new rule, he began to attack it even in public, and was dismissed. Elected, notwithstanding, to the Chamber of Deputies, he was prosecuted for his bitter criticism of the Government, and obliged to go into exile in England. On the amnesty of 1839, he returned to France, and attracted some notice by the publication of a badly-written and fiercely democratic history of the Revolution of 1789 (4 vols., 1840), and of a social romance, Voyage en Icarie, in which he set forth his peculiar views. These works met with some success among the radical working-men of Paris. An opportunity at length occurred of realizing his schemes. Pressed by his friends, he made arrangements for an experiment in communism on American soil. In his journal, Le Populaire, he announced the purchase of a considerable tract of land on the Red River, Texas, and a treaty by which Cabet was made the dictator of an intending colony, and the depositary of all the funds, community of property being the distinctive principle of the society. Accordingly, in 1848, an expedition of 150 sailed to America; but unexpected difficulties arose and the complaints of the disenchanted settlers soon reached Europe. Cabet, who had remained in France, had more than one judicial investigation to undergo in consequence, but was honourably acquitted. In 1849 he went out in person to America, but on his arrival, finding that the Mormons had been expelled from their city Nauvoo, in Illinois, he transferred his settlement thither. There, with the exception of a journey to France, where he returned to defend himself successfully before the tribunals, he remained, the dictator of his little society. In 1856, however, he was expelled, and died the same year at St Louis. He had not the advantages of either birth or eloquence, or even of ability. The little success he obtained was due entirely to the singularity of his opinions, and the straightforward persistency with which he advocated them.
