CALAMY, Edmund (1600-1666), a Presbyterian divine, was born at London in February 1600, and educated at Pembroke Hall, Cambridge, where his opposition to the Arminian party, then powerful in that society, excluded him from a fellowship. Dr Felton, bishop of Ely, however, made him his chaplain, and gave him a living which he held till 1626. He then removed to Bury St Edmunds, where he acted as lecturer for ten years. In 1636 he was appointed, to the rectory of Rochford in Essex, which was so unhealthy that he had soon to leave it; and in 1639 he was chosen minister of St Mary Aldermanbury in London. Upon the opening of the Long Parliament he distinguished himself in defence of the Presbyterian cause, and had a principal share in writing the work commonly known under the appellation Smectymnuus, against Episcopacy. The initials of the names of the several contributors formed the name under which it was published, viz., S. Marshal, E. Calamy, T. Young, Μ. Newcomen, and W. Spurstow. Calamy was afterwards an active member in the assembly of divines, and a strenuous opposer of sectaries. In Cromwell’s time he lived privately, but’ was assiduous in promoting the king’s return; for this he was afterwards offered a bishopric, but declined it. He was, however, made one of Charles’s chaplains. He was ejected for nonconformity in 1662, and was so affected by the sight of the devastation caused by the great fire of London, that he died shortly afterwards, October 29, 1666.
