ARAUCARIA, a genus of Coniferous trees included under the tribe Abietineae, and the sub-tribe Araucariae. The sub-tribe has been thus defined :—Leaves flat,* often four-angled, arranged more or less in a spiral manner; male flowers in cylindrical terminal spikes, anthers six or more in two rows; female flowers in cones, which are large and globose; scales of the cone linear, arranged in a spiral manner, deciduous (falling off); seeds solitary, pendulous, usually without wings; cotyledons two, entire or divided into two. The species of the genus are magnificent evergreen trees with whorled branches, and stiff, flattened, pointed leaves, found in Brazil and Chili, Polynesia and Australia. The name of the genus is derived from Araucania, the district of South America where the trees grow. Araucaria imbricata, the imbricate-leaved pine, or the Chili pine, was introduced into Britain in 1796. It is largely cultivated, and usually stands the winter of Britain; but in some years, when the temperature fell very low, the trees have suffered much. On Christmas 1860, the temperature in the Edinburgh Botanic Garden fell to -8° Fahr., and some fine Araucarias, 24 and 25 feet high, were killed. Care should be taken in planting these trees to select a spot somewhat elevated and well drained. The tree grows to the height of 150 feet in the Cordilleras of Chili. The cones borne by the trees are from 8 to 8⅜ inches broad, and 7 to 7∣ inches long. The wood of the tree is hard and durable. This is the only species which can be cultivated in the open air in Britain. Araucaria brasiliana (A. Rich.), the Brazil pine, is another species of the genus. It is a native of Brazil, and was introduced into Britain in 1819. It is not so hardy as A. imbricata, and requires protection during winter. It is grown in conservatories for half-hardy plants. Araucaria excelsa (R. Br.), the Norfolk Island pine, receives also the names of Altingia excelsa, Eutassa and Eutacta excelsa. It is a native of Norfolk Island and New Caledonia. It was introduced into Britain in 1793. It cannot be grown in the open air in Great Britain, as it requires protection from frost. It is more tender than the Brazilian pine. It is a majestic tree, sometimes attaining a height of more than 220 feet, The scales of its cones are winged, and have a hook at the apex. Araucaria Cunninghami, called also Eutacta. Cunninghami, the Moreton Bay pine, is a tall tree found on the shores of Moreton Bay, Australia. It requires protection in this country during the winter.

Araucaria Bidwilli (Hook.), the Bunya-Bunya pine, found on the mountains of Eastern Australia, between the rivers Brisbane and Burnett, at 27° S. lat., is a noble tree, attaining a height of 100 to 150 feet, with a straight trunk and white wood. It bears cones as large as a man’s head. Its seeds are very large, and are used as food by the natives. Araucaria Rulei (Muell.) is another species. It is a tree of New Caledonia, which attains a height of 50 or 60 feet. Araucaria Cookii (R. Brown) is another coniferous tree of New Caledonia, attaining a height of 150 feet. It is found also in the Isle of Pines, and in the New Hebrides.
