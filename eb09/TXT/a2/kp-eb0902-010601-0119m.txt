ANTHON, Charles, an American philologist and professor of classics, was born in New York city in 1797, and died there 29th July 1867. After graduating with honours at Columbia College in 1815, he commenced the study of law, and in 1819 was admitted to the bar. But in 1820 he was appointed assistant professor of languages in his alma-mater, and he thenceforth devoted himself solely to classical literature. Soon after he commenced his well-known editions of the classics, the best known being that of the Poems of Horace, with extensive notes and comments, published in 1830. In the latter year he was made rector of the grammar school attached to his college, and in 1835 he succeeded to the chair of Professor Morse.
