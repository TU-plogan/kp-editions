ANSELM, of Laon, a famous theologian, - was born of very humble parents at Laon before the middle of the 11th century. He is said to have studied under St Anselm at Bee. About 1076 he taught at Paris with great success, but not long afterwards removed to his native place, where his school for theology rapidly became the most famous in Europe. He died 1117. His greatest work was an interlinear gloss on the Scriptures, which has been frequently reprinted. Other commentaries apparently by him have been ascribed to various writers, principally to the great Anselm. A list of them, with notice of Anselm’s life, is contained in the Histoire Littéraire de la France, x. 170-189.
