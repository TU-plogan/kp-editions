ARCHIDONA, a town in the province of Malaga, in Spain, situated on the slope of a hill, about 10 miles W.N. W. of Loja. It seems to have been a flourishing place under the Romans, to judge by the statues, columns, and other remains which are found, but it is now, in the words of O’Shea, a “wretched village with nothing to visit.” The inhabitants, about 7600 in number, are employed in fruit-growing, weaving, oil-pressing, and bacon-curing.
