ANTWERP (Dutch, Antwerpen; French, Anvers; Spanish, Ambeτes; Old German, Antorff; from “aent werf,” “on the wharf”), a province of Belgium, bounded by the Dutch province of North Brabant on the N., and by the Belgian provinces of Limbourg on the E., South Brabant on the S., and East Flanders on the W. The greater part of the province, which consists of an extensive plain of 1096 square miles, scarcely diversified by a single elevation, is sandy but fertile, producing grain, flax, hemp, fruit, and tobacco, as well as cattle, sheep, and horses; on the north and north-east, however, ’ there are considerable tracts of morass and heath. The principal rivers, the Scheldt and its tributaries, the Rupel, the Nèthe, and the Dyle, are navigable to a large extent, while railways intersect the country in various directions, and there are also several canals. The chief towns are Antwerp, Mechlin (Malines), Turnhout, Lierre, and Boom. Population in 1870, 492,482.

Antwerp, the capital of the province of the same name, is situated about ⅞0 miles from the open sea, and

25 north of Brussels, in a level tract on the right bank of the Scheldt, which is there about 2200 feet broad, and has a depth at ebb-tide of from 30 to 40 feet, with a rise at spring-tides of 12 or 14. Antwerp seems to have been founded by people of Saxon race some time before the 8th century, when the Antwerpians or Ganerbians, as they began to be called, were converted to Christianity by St Willebrod and some Irish monks. A certain Rohingus of that period styles himself prince of Antwerp; and mention is made of a market-toll in force in 726. In 837 the town fell into the hands of the Northmen, who kept possession of it for about sixty years. It was erected into a marquisate of the Holy Roman empire by Henry II. in 1008, and, as such, was bestowed by Henry IV., in 1076, on Godfrey of Bouillon. About the beginning of the 12th century it had considerable commercial prosperity; and in the 13th, its municipal institutions took definite shape. It is worthy of notice that the law of 1290 ’ contained provisions identical with those of the Habeas Corpus Act in England, maintaining the inviolability of the citizen’s dwelling, and acknowledging the right of every man to be judged by his peers, and to have a voice in the imposition of taxes. As the result of such security and freedom, the commerce of the city rapidly increased. The English wools for the great manufactories at Louvain, Brussels, Tirlemont, Diest, and Leau, were imported through Antwerp; and the English merchants, who formed a “factory” there in 1296, received special protection by charters (1305, 1341, 1346, 1349) from the [9:2:145] Dukes of Brabant, at that time in possession of the marquisate. In 1338, while Edward III. of England was spending the winter in the city with his queen Philippa, she gave birth to Lionel, afterwards Duke of Clarence, and the event was celebrated by a magnificent tournament. To the king, then in great need of money, the merchants of Antwerp advanced 400,000 florins. The marquisate passed successively into the hands of the counts of Flanders and the house of Burgundy, and returned to Brabant about 1406. In 1474 the town made over a large house in Billinck Street to the English,in 1550 an “English Bourse” was established, and in 1558 the beautiful Hop van Lyere— now a military hospital—was ceded for the accommodation of our merchants. Between 1488 and 1570 was the time of the greatest prosperity which Antwerp was destined to attain for several centuries. The discovery of America in 1492, and of the passage to India in 1497, produced a great change in all European navigation, and permanently altered the old courses of commerce. While, in consequence of this, the cities of the Hanseatic League had withered, and Venice, and Nuremberg, and Bruges were sinking into decay, Antwerp was growing daily more worthy of the name which she soon acquired, “Dives Antιverpia," “the wealthy Antwerp.” By contemporaneous writers, such as Guicciardini and Scribanius, the most glowing accounts have been left of her greatness. The annual fairs of Pentecost and St Badon’s—which have now no commercial importance—attracted merchants from all parts of Europe. No fewer than 500 ships would enter the port in a day, and as many as 2500 were to be seen lying in the river at one time. On an average 500 waggons laden with goods daily entered the gates; above 500,000,000 guilders were annually put in circulation; and the population is said to have numbered upwards of 100,000. But from this height of prosperity the city was suddenly cast down by the wars of the 16th century. In 1576 it was taken by the Spaniards, and given up to a three days’ pillage; it was besieged, though in vain, by the duke of Alençon in 1583; and, after a very obstinate defence, it fell before the assaults of the duke of Parma, whose triumphal entry took place on the 17th of August 1585. Its glory departed; its commerce was ruined; its inhabitants were scattered. As the people of Bruges had flocked to Antwerp, so now the people of Antwerp flocked to Hamburg. The Dutch, in their jealousy, endeavoured to complete its ruin by building forts on the river to intercept the passage of ships; and finally, by the peace of Westphalia, in 1648, the Scheldt was definitively closed. In 1794 the city fell into the hands of the French, who opened the river and made Antwerp the capital of the department of Deux Nèthee. Napoleon, who visited the place in 1803, attempted to make it a great military and commercial centre, and spent no less than<£2,000,000 sterling in the construction of docks. He was wont to speak of it as un pistolet charge que je tiens sur la gorge de l'Angleterre. It continued in French possession till 1814, when it was surrendered after the treaty of Paris by Carnot, who up to that time had defended it with great bravery against the allied army under Graham. From 1815 to 1830, Antwerp with the rest of Belgium united with Holland in forming the kingdom of the Netherlands. In 1830, during the Belgian revolution, the citadel •was held by the old Dutch general Chassé, who resolutely refused to surrender. At length, however, in 1832 he was forced to capitulate by the French, under Marshal Gerard, and the city was handed over to the Belgians. All matters of dispute between Belgium and Holland being finally settled by the treaty of 1839, Antwerp has continued peacefully to advance in prosperity ever since. In 1860 the ancient fortifications were destroyed, and new fortifications erected at a considerable distance from the city; while a line of detached forts were built towards the south-east, in an arc of a circle, which it has been proposed to complete on both sides of the river. The famous “citadel of the south,” which was originally built by the duke of Alva in 1567, has been bought from the Belgian Government by the Société Immobilière and the town of Antwerp, and the site is to be appropriated for new docks and a new quarter of the city —the docks to be for the accommodation of river-boats and lighters. A loan of 60,000,000 francs (£250,000) is to be contracted for the carrying out of the improvements. Since the destruction of the old fortifications, fine boulevards, avenues, and streets have been laid out, and the town is rapidly and constantly increasing in size. There are now seventeen quays or wharves, and a series of 6 or 8 docks communicating with each other. The two oldest, which were constructed under Napoleon, and preserved when his other establishments were destroyed, are respectively about 574 feet by 492, and 1312 by 574. Since Napoleon’s time the city has added the Bassin de Jonction, the large Kattendyk Dock (opened in 1856), the Bassin Sas, the Bassin aux Bois, or timber-dock, the Bassin de la Campine, and the Bassin du Canal. The whole system has an area of nearly 100 acres, affording over 21,000 feet of quay-room. In spite of all this extension of accommodation, the commercial traffic is so great that ships are often delayed through lack of sufficient room for lading or unlading. In 1826, 909 vessels entered with a tonnage of 122,221, of which 126 were British, with a tonnage of 16,178; in 1862 the number of vessels was 2292, with a total tonnage of 579,899, of which 777 were British, with a tonnage of 199,000; and by 1872 the vessels amounted to 4206, and had a tonnage of 1,656,984, 2172 of them being British, and having a tonnage of 1,007,165. Of the British traffic, a very large proportion is carried on by means of steam-ships. The chief imports arc steel, copper, iron, and other metals, machinery, coals (chiefly from Britain), salt, soda, grain, cotton (chiefly from New Orleans and Bombay), cotton yarn and goods, wool (mostly undressed), hides (raw and tanned), sugar (chiefly raw), tea, coffee, tobacco, rice, and oil-seeds. The chief exports are flax, woollen goods, refined sugar, metals, glass, and tallow. There is regular steam communication with London, Hull, Liverpool, and other English ports, and, indeed, with all the most important ports in Europe. There are also regular lines to the United States, Brazil, La Plata, and Chili. By the river and several canals there is communication with most of the other Belgian cities. The “Canal de la Campine" is the most important, and joins the Scheldt with the Meuse, through the Willem Canal, which was made by the Dutch Government. The railway system with which Antwerp is connected is extensive, but is far from sufficient to satisfy the demands of trade. Tho manufactures of Antwerp are various and considerable, the principal being lace, silk, linen, jute, cotton, tapestry, galloon, twine, sugar, white-lead, litmus, starch, printer’s ink, and malt liquors. There are about 20 sugar refineries, 7 rice-mills, 3 sulphur refineries, several cigar manufactories, distilleries, petroleum refineries, stearine candle manufactories, and wool-mills. The lapidaries of Antwerp are celebrated for their skill in cutting diamonds.

The National Bank of Belgium has a branch in the city, and several other banks transact extensive business. The Exchange, built in 1531, was one of the finest buildings of the kind in Europe, and is said to have been chosen by Sir Thomas Gresham as a model for the old Royal Exchange in London. Burnt down in 1858, it was rebuilt in the same Gothic style as before, and opened again for business in 1872. The old magazine of the Hanseatic League (1564), known as the Maison IIanseatique, still stands a “massive and venerable” building. The cathedral of Notre Dame, probablv founded about the middle of the [9:2:146] 14 th century, but not completed till 1518, is one of the most beautiful specimens of Gothic architecture in Belgium. It is about 500 feet long and 250 broad, and is the only church in Europe with six aisles. Of its two projected towers, the one rises to a height of 403 feet, the other remains unfinished. It contains, besides other remarkable pictures, Rubens’s “Descent from the Cross,” his “Elevation of the Cross,” and his “Assumption.” The cathedral, however, is greatly surpassed in the splendour of its decorations and the profusion of its monuments by the church of St James (15th century), which contains, in addition to other mortuary chapels and shrines, the family-chapel and tomb of Rubens, with a beautiful altarpiece, the workmanship of the great painter. The high altar of the church was also designed by Rubens. Of the remaining churches, the most important are St Paul’s, St Andrew’s, and the church of the Augustines. The church that formerly belonged to the Corporation of Tanners is now the Anglican place of worship. The Hôtel de Ville is a fine building in the Italian style, with a façade that exhibits four orders of architecture, one above the other; but within, there is not much to attract attention. Antwerp possesses an Athenaeum, in which most of the usual branches of literature and science are taught; an academy of the fine arts, where the students receive instruction in painting, sculpture, architecture, and engraving; a “Museum” or Gallery of over 560 pictures, including some very fine specimens of Rubens, Vandyck, Titian, Teniers, Jordaens, Quintin Matsys, and other masters; a medical and surgical college; a school of navigation; zoological and botanical gardens; a theatre; and various scientific and literary societies. The town library contains 30,000 volumes. The library of the famous printer, Plantin, his workshop, presses, and printing materials, as left by the Moretus family who succeeded him, and a fine collection of paintings, drawings, manuscripts, &c., were purchased by the town for about a million and a half of francs (£62,500), and form an interesting typographic museum.

Antwerp is the birth-place of a number of distinguished men in various departments, as the painters Vandyck (b. 1599), Teniers the elder (1582), Teniers the younger (1610), Jordaens (1594), Frans Floris (1520), Gonzales Cocques (1618); the philologist Grater (1560), the geographer Ortelius (1527), the engraver Edelinck (1649), and, among more modern celebrities, Van Meteren the historian, Ogier the dramatist, and Henri Conscience the novelist. Rubens was born at Cologne, but his family belonged to Antwerp, and he was educated, resided, and died in the latter city.

According to the general census of 1846, Antwerp contained 88,487 inhabitants, of whom 85,961 were Roman Catholics, and 1312 Protestants. In 1851 the population was 95,501, and in 1873,126,663, or, including the suburbs now situated within the fortifications, above 180,000. The majority of the inhabitants speak Dutch or Flemish, and the rest, for the most part, French or Walloon.
