APOSTOLICI, or Apostolic Brethren, a name assumed by three different sects, which professed a close adherence to the doctrines and practice of the apostles. The earliest, known also as the Apotactici, were a branch of the Encratites, and came into existence in the 3d century. According to Epiphanius, their principles were communistic. The second sect of the name was formed in the district surrounding Cologne about the middle of the 12tn century. Its members were zealous reformers, rejecting the authority of the Pope and the rites and ceremonies of the church. It is not certain that they absolutely rejected marriage, though they preferred celibacy. Founding on the authority of St Paul, the celibates took spiritual sisters, with whom they lived in concubinage. Bernard of Clairvaux wrote against the sect, and some of its most prominent members being brought before the archbishop of Cologne were condemned to the flames. The third sect of Apostolici in chronological order was founded by Gerhard Segarelli, a mechanic of Parma, towards the close of the 13th century. Segarelli, who had sought admission unsuccessfully to the Franciscan order, was much impressed, it is said, by a picture of the apostles which hung in the Franciscan chapel at Parma. Becoming convinced that the much-needed reform of the church could only be effected by a return to the apostolic practice, he sought to establish a community in which the life of the apostles should be imitated as closely as possible. By slow degrees he gathered a considerable number of followers, chiefly from the lower orders, who went about from place to place clad in white robes, with long beards, dishevelled hair, and bare heads, accompanied by women whom they called their spiritual sisters. Like the other two sects of the same name, they established a community of goods. Though their practice was thus peculiar, their doctrinal teaching did not for a considerable period seriously diverge from the orthodox standard. The arrest of their leader by the bishop of Parma (1280), and condemnatory decrees issued by Honorius IV. (1286) and Nicolas IV. (1290), changed their position into one of open hostility to the Church of Rome. Accepting the predictions of the Abbot Joachim of Flora, they looked for the downfall of the papacy, which they described as the Babylon of Scripture, and the establishment of a new and purer church upon its ruins. Segarelli was accused of heresy in 1294, but escaped for the time by recantation. In 1300, however, he was condemned as a relapsed heretic to the flames. His place was immediately taken by Dolcino of Novara, the natural son of a priest, under whom the sect became still larger and more formidable. He seems to have been a man of superior power to Segarelli in all respects, and especially to have had considerable talent as a military leader, having succeeded in carrying on a war for two years against Raynerius, bishop of Vercelli. In 1307 he was defeated, taken prisoner, and put to a cruel death at Vercelli. The name “Dolcinists,” frequently applied to the sect, marks the extent of Dolcino’s influence, as does also an allusion to him in Dante’s Inferno. The sect of the Apostolici maintained its existence in spite of continual persecution until the beginning of the 15 th century, when it became extinct or was merged in other sects. (See Muratori’s “Historia Dulcini,” in his Rerum Italicarum Scriptores, ix. § 425; Mosheim’s Geschichte des Apostelordens, 1748; Neander ’ s Church History, vol. viii.; Mariotti’s Fra Dolcino and his Times, 1853; Milman’s Latin Christianity, vol. vii.)
