APURIMAC, or Tambo, a Peruvian river which rises in the lagoon of Villafro, near Caylloma, flows in a generally northward direction, and, receiving the waters of the Velille, the San Tomas, the Mamara, the Pachachaca, the Pampas, the Mantaro, and the Perene, falls into the Ucayali, an affluent of the Amazon. The river formed by the Tambo— or Catongo, as it is called in this part of its course—and the Mantaro receives the name of Ene, and is joined by the Perene, a river large enough for the passage of steamers. About 30 miles further down it forms a great cataract, which breaks the navigation. After receiving the Muyupu and the Vilcamayu or Urubamba, the stream, under the name of Ucayali, flows north to join the other head-streams of the Amazon near Nauta. The navigation of the Apurimac below the falls is greatly hindered by its strong and rapid current. The whole length of its course is about 600 miles.
