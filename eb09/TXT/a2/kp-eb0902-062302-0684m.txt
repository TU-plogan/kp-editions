ARNHEM, or Abnheim (according to some the Arenacum of the Romans, Arnoldi Villa in the Middle Ages), the chief town in the province of Guelderland, in the Netherlands, on the right bank of the Rhine along the slope of the Veluwe Hills. It is a clean and prosperous place, in a pleasant and beautiful district, and is much frequented by the wealthy merchants of the Low Countries, whose villas and gardens adorn its environs. The Groote Kerk, or principal church, formerly dedicated to St Martin, and now to St Eusebius, contains, besides other objects of interest, the marble monument of Charles of Egmont. The Stadhuis, or town-house, by Maarten van R ossum, is remarkable for the grotesque ornamentation which has earned it the name of the Duivelshuis. There are also a governmenthouse, a court-house, a gymnasium, an orphanage, a hospital for invalided soldiers (Bronbeek’s), a large assemblyhall (Musis Sacrum), a library, a theatre, barracks, and a good number of churches and schools. The town, formerly connected with the Hanseatic League, has still a considerable traffic by river and canal and rail, manufactures tobacco, which is largely cultivated in the neighbourhood, woollen and cotton goods, paper, earthenware, soap, <kc., carries on wool-combing and dyeing, and has oil and bark mills. Arnhem was fortified in 1233 by Otho III., duke of Guelders. In 1505 it received the right of coining from Philip of Spain, duke of Burgundy. In 1514 Charles of Egmont took it from the Burgundians. In 1543 Charles V. made it the seat of the Council of Guelders. The States-General got possession of it in 1585, and it resisted all the attacks of the Spaniards. In 1586 Sir Philip Sydney died there from the effects of his wound. The French took the town in 1672, but left it dismantled in 1674. It was refortified by Coehoorn in the beginning of the 18th century. In 1795 it was again stormed by the French, and in 1813 it was taken from them by the Prussians under Bülow.
