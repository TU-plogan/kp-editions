ASTRONOMY (from aστpov, a star, and veμ,ω, to classify or arrange) is the science which deals with the distribution, motions, and characteristics of the heavenly bodies. It is here treated of under two heads: first, the History of Astronomy; and, secondly, Theoretical Astronomy, in which the different theories of the motions of the celestial bodies are explained, and such facts, described as observation has made known respecting their nature and constitution.

Part I.— History of Astronomy.

Astronomy may probably be regarded as the most ancient of the sciences. Even the least civilised races must have recognised the regular vicissitudes of day and night (and, therefore, the diurnal course of the sun), while before long the variety and succession of the seasons would be noted, and their cause—the oblique annual motion of the same luminary—would be recognised. The moon in the sun’s absence is so conspicuous and so useful that her motions, her various phases, and her regular disappearance and return after equal intervals of time, must have been watched in the earliest times with attention and interest. The occurrence of eclipses and other unusual phenomena would stimulate closer scrutiny. The spectacle of the starry heavens, seemingly unchangeable, save for the motions of a few wandering orbs along a certain zone of the star-sphere, early suggested an association between the fates of men and nations and these emblems of unchanging destiny on the one hand and of the changeful lot of mankind on the other. Thus astrology had its origin,—a superstition which bore the same relation to astronomy that alchemy bore to chemistry. Like alchemy, astrology was of service— superstition though it was—in encouraging observation and in leading to discoveries of interest.

But though mankind were probably first impelled by motives of mere curiosity to observe the courses of the stars, no great length of time could have elapsed ere they perceived that the regular and uniform revolutions of the heavens might be rendered subservient to their own wants and con-veniencies. By the help of the stars the shepherd, during the night, could count the hours, the traveller track his course through the uniform wastes of the desert, and the mariner guide his bark over the ocean: the husbandman, also, learned to regulate his labours by the appearance of certain constellations, which gave him warning of the approaching seasons. The indications derived from the simple observation of such phenomena were doubtless extremely vague; but as civilisation advanced, the necessity of determining accurately the length of the solar year and of the lunar month, in order to regulate the calendar and the religious festivals, led to the accumulation and comparison of different observations, whereby errors were gradually diminished, and the foundations laid of a more perfect science.

Astronomy thus presenting so many objects of curiosity and interest, and having so many practical uses, could not fail to be one of the sciences first cultivated by mankind. Its origin is, consequently, hid amidst the obscurity of remote ages, and is, in fact, coeval with the earliest development of the human intellect. The records or traditions of almost every ancient nation furnish some traces of attention to the state of the heavens, and of some rude attempts to discover the laws, the order, and the period of the most remarkable phenomena, such as eclipses of the sun and moon, the motions of the planets, and the heliacal risings of the principal stars and constellations. The Chaldeans and Egyptians, Chinese and Indians, Gauls and Peruvians, equally regard themselves as the founders of astronomy,—an honour, however, of which Josephus deprives them all, in order to ascribe it to the antediluvian patriarchs. The fables relating to the two columns of brick and marble which these sages are said to have erected, and on which they engraved the elements of their astronomy, to preserve them from the universal destruction by fire and water to which they are said to have learned from Adam the earth was doomed, are not worth the trouble of repetition; nor is there any better proof than the assertion of that credulous historian, of their acquaintance with the annus magnus, the astronomical cycle of 600 years, which brings back the sun and moon to the same points of the heavens so nearly, that its discovery implies a pretty correct knowledge of the solar and lunar motions. Passing over those details of traditional observations or unimportant facts, we proceed to give a brief account of the state of astronomy among some early nations who have undoubtedly contributed to the improvement of the science, or who, at least, have transmitted to future ages some records of their astronomical labours.

Astronomy of the Chaldeans, Egyptians, Phoenidans, Chinese, and Indians.

According to the unanimous testimony of the Greek historians, the earliest traces of astronomical science are to be met with among the Chaldeans and Egyptians. The spacious level and unclouded horizon of Chaldea afforded < the utmost facilities for observing the celestial phenomena; and its inhabitants, enjoying the leisure afforded by a pastoral life, and stimulated by the vain desire of obtaining a knowledge of the future from the aspects of the stars, assiduously cultivated astronomy and astrology. By a long series of observations of eclipses, extending, according to the testimony of some authors, over nineteen centuries, or even a longer period, they had discovered the cycle of 223 lunations, or eighteen solar years, which, by bringing back the moon to nearly the same position with respect to her nodes, her perigee, and the sun, brings back the eclipses in the same order. This is supposed to be the period which they distinguished by the name of Saros. They had others, to which they gave the names of Sossos and Neros ; but nothing positive is known with regard to their nature or extent. It is certain, however, that these Chaldaic periods, whatever they were, were purely empirical. Detected by the comparison of recorded observations, they imply neither theory nor science, unless, indeed, a simple arithmetical operation is to be considered as such; nor is there any reason to suppose that the Chaldeans employed any process of computation whatever in their predictions of eclipses. Having once established their cycle they were in possession of a simple means of predicting all those which occurred in the course of it, with as great a degree of accuracy as they considered requisite.

The Egyptians were in ancient times the rivals of j the Chaldeans in the cultivation of astronomy; and although they have left behind them still fewer monuments of their labours, they have obtained, through the exaggerated statements of the Greeks, even a greater reputation. The Greeks acknowledge themselves indebted to the Egyptians for their science and civilisation; but regarding themselves likewise as descendants of that ancient people, they indulged their vain-glory in magnifying the accounts of the antiquity and knowledge of their supposed ancestors. It is not improbable that some traditional observations of the [9:2:745] heavens, along with some arts indispensable to society even in its earliest stages, were carried into Europe by tribes migrating from the banks of the Nile; and it is certain that the early philosophers of Greece travelled into Egypt for the purpose of acquiring a more perfect knowledge of astronomy than could be obtained in their own country. But the facts from which it can be inferred that the Egyptians had much to communicate, are few and ill-attested. They are also blended with so much absurdity and fable, that no accurate notions can be formed, from the accounts that have been transmitted to us, of the real advances which that people had made in astronomical science. The priests were the depositaries of the national knowledge; and they carefully concealed it from the common people by shrouding it in allegories, traces of which, it has been remarked, may be detected in the institutions even of the present day.

The Phoenicians are also generally enumerated among the nations who cultivated astronomy at a very early period, though it does not appear, from any facts mentioned by ancient authors, that they devoted themselves specially to the observation of the heavens, or made any discoveries relative to the motions of the planets. That they excelled in the art of navigation is certain, from the commercial intercourse which they carried on with many places on the coasts of Africa and Spain, and with the principal islands of the Mediterranean; and it may readily be allowed that in their long voyages they would direct their course during the night by the circumpolar stars. If they had any speculative notions of astronomy, these were probably derived from the Chaldeans or Egyptians.

In China, astronomy has been cultivated from the remotest ages, and has always been considered a science indispensably necessary to the civil government of the state. The Chinese boast of a series of eclipses, recorded in the annals of the nation, extending over a period of 3858 years, all of which, they affirm, were not only carefully observed, but were calculated and figured previous to their occurrence. The same motives which led the Chaldeans and Egyptians to attend to the celestial phenomena, namely, the regulation and division of time, had equal influence among the Chinese, and we accordingly find the care of the calendar occupying the attention of their earliest princes. The emperor Fou-Hi, whose reign commenced about 2857 years before our era, is said to have assiduously studied the motions of the celestial bodies, and laboured to instruct his ignorant subjects in the mysteries of astronomy. But as they were not yet enlightened enough to comprehend his theories, he was obliged to content himself with giving them a rule for the computation of time by means of the numbers 10 and 12, the combination of which produces the cycle of 60 years, which is the standard or unit from which they deduce their hours, days, and months. Tradition is silent with respect to the sources from which Fou-Hi derived his ι own knowledge. In the year 2608 b.c., Hoang-Ti caused an observatory to be built, for the purpose of correcting the calendar, which had already fallen into great confusion, and appointed one set of astronomers to observe the course of the sun, another that of the moon, and a third that of the stars. It was then discovered that the twelve lunar months do not exactly correspond with a solar year; and that, in order to restore the coincidence, it was necessary to intercalate seven lunations in the space of nineteen years. If this fact rested on undoubted evidence, it would follow that the Chinese had anticipated the Greeks by 2000 years in the discovery of the Metonic cycle. The reign of Πoang-Ti is also rendered memorable by the institution of the Mathematical Tribunal, for promoting the science of astronomy, and regularly predicting eclipses, to which an extraordinary importance has always been attached in China. The members of this celebrated tribunal were made responsible with their lives for the accuracy of their predictions, by a law of the empire, which ordained that, “whether the instant of the occurrence of any celestial phenomenon was erroneously assigned, or the phenomenon itself not foreseen and predicted, either negligence should be punished with death.” In the reign of Tchong-Kang, the two mathematicians of the empire, Ho and Hi, were the victims of this sanguinary law—an eclipse having taken place which their skill had not enabled them to foresee. The emperor Yao, who mounted the throne, according to the Chinese annals, about the year 2317 B.C., gave a new impulse to the study of astronomy, which had begun already to decline. He ordered his astronomers to observe with the utmost care the motions of the sun and moon, of the planets and the stars, and to determine the exact length of each of the four seasons. To this emperor are attributed the Chinese division of the zodiac into 28 constellations, called the houses of the moon, and the severe laws already noticed in regard to the erroneous prediction of the celestial phenomena. From the time of Yao the Chinese year consisted of 365 J days. They also divided the circle into 365 J degrees, so that the sun daily described in his orbit an arc of one Chinese degree. Their common lunar year consisted of 364j⅛f days; and by combining this number with 365∣, they formed the period of 4617 years, after which the sun and moon again occupy the same relative positions.

The earliest Chinese observations we are acquainted with, sufficiently precise to afford any result useful to astronomy, were made by Tcheou-Kong, whose reign commenced about the year 1100 before our era. Two of these observations are meridional altitudes of the sun, observed with great care at the village of Loyang, at the time of the summer and winter solstices. The obliquity of the ecliptic thus determined at that remote epoch is 23° 5 4' 3" , 15—a result which perfectly agrees with the theory of universal gravitation. Another observation made about the same time relates to the position of the winter solstice in the heavens; and it also corresponds to within a minute of a degree with the calculations of Laplace. Laplace considers this extraordinary conformity as an indubitable proof of the authenticity of those ancient observations. The golden age of Chinese astronomy extended from the reign of Fou-Hi to the year 480 b.c., —that is, over a space of 2500 years. It is only, however, towards the latter part of this long period that the history of China becomes in any degree authentic; and the true date which must be assigned for the commencement of observations on which any reliance can be placed, is the year 722 b.c., that is, 25 years posterior to the era of Nabonassar. From that period to the year 400 B.C., Confucius reckons a series of 36 eclipses, and of these 31 have been verified by modern astronomers. After this the science fell into great neglect, notwithstanding the inveterate tenacity with which the Chinese in general adhere to their ancient customs. The decline of their astronomy is ascribed, whether justly or not, to the barbarous policy of the emperor Tsin-Chi-Hong-Ti, who, in the year 221 B.C., ordered all the books to be destroyed, excepting those only which related to agriculture, medicine, and astrology, the only sciences which he considered as being of any use to mankind. In this manner, it is said, the precious mass of astronomical observations and precepts which had been accumulating for ages was irretrievably lost.

On considering attentively the accounts which have been given of the Chinese astronomy, we find that it consisted only in the practice of observations which led to nothing more than the knowledge of a few isolated facts. The missionaries who were sent out by the Jesuits about the end of the 17th century, to whom we are indebted for [9:2:746] what is known of the early history of China, either seduced by some appearances of truth, or thinking it prudent to conciliate the people whom they were attempting to convert, adopted their marvellous relations regarding the antiquity of their science, and spread them over Europe. As the history of the nation begins to become more authentic, their astronomy shrinks into its real, insignificant dimensions. Superstitiously attached to their ancient usages, and blindly adopting the habits of their ancestors, the Chinese continued to observe the heavens from century to century without making the slightest advances in theoretical knowledge. In later times they have adopted many improvements, for which they are entirely indebted to foreigners. During the time of the caliphs many Mahometans passed into China, carrying with them the astronomical methods and knowledge of the Arabians. The missionaries introduced the science of Europe; and the most that can be said in praise of the Chinese is, that their Government sometimes relaxed so far its spirit of jealousy and exclusion, as to afford protection to these strangers, adopt their arts, and place them at the head of the Mathematical Tribunal.

The astronomy of the Indians forms one of the most curious problems which the history of science presents, and one which, notwithstanding much discussion, still continues involved in great uncertainty. Of the science of the ancient nations of which we have already spoken, the accounts which have come down to our times are founded on conjecture and tradition; for few monuments remain to confirm or confute the glowing descriptions which authors have given of its high antiquity and great perfection. But the claims of the Indians rest on a more solid foundation. We are in possession of the tables from which they compute the eclipses and places of the planets, and of the methods by which they effect the computation; we have, in short, an Indian astronomy committed to writing, which represents the celestial phenomena with considerable exactness, and which, therefore, could only be produced by a people far advanced in science. But the difficulty the problem presents is the determination of the sources whence this science originated and the epoch of its existence—the question whether it was created by the people who now blindly follow its precepts without understanding its principles, or was communicated to them by another race of a more original genius through channels with which we are unacquainted. Some authors regard India as the cradle of ail the sciences, particularly of astronomy, which they suppose to have been cultivated there from the remotest ages; others date the origin of the Indian astronomy from the period when Pythagoras travelled into that country, and carried thither the arts and sciences of the Greeks; a third opinion is, that astronomy was conveyed to India by the Arabians in the 9th century of our era, and that the Brahmins are only entitled to the humble merit of adapting the rules and practices of that people to their own peculiar methods of calculation.

Astronomy of the Greeks.

The origin of astronomy in Greece, as in other early nations, ascends beyond the period of authentic history. The true foundations of Grecian science were laid by Thales, who was born at Miletus 640 years before our era. He formed a sect which has been distinguished by the title of the “Ionian School.” His doctrines regarding astronomy contain a few truths which do honour to his sagacity and observation, though they are mixed with much error and absurdity. He taught that the stars are formed of fire; that the moon receives her light from the sun, and is invisible at her conjunctions, because she is hid in the sun’s rays. He also taught the sphericity of the earth, which he placed at the centre of the universe. He divided the sphere into five zones, by the arctic and antarctie circles, and the two tropics; and held that the equator is cut obliquely by the ecliptic, and perpendicularly by the meridian. He is also said to have observed eclipses; and Herodotus relates that he predicted the famous one which put a stop to the war between the Medes and the Lydians. It does not appear, however, that he ventured to assign either the day or the month of the eclipse, so that his prediction must have been confined to the year. According to Callimachus, he determined the positions of the stars which form the Lesser Bear, by which the Phoenicians guided themselves in their voyages. It is difficult, however, to conceive how Thales, unacquainted with instruments, could determine the positions of stars with so much accuracy as to render any essential assistance to the navigator. It is probable that he only pointed out the configuration and some of the more brilliant stars of that constellation, among which he might remark that which is nearest the pole of the heavens. Thales was succeeded by Anaximander, to whom also is attributed a knowledge of the sphere and of the zodiac. According to Diogenes Laertius, he, like his master Thales, supposed the earth to be spherical, and placed at the centre of the universe; but Plutarch ascribes to him the less philosophical opinion of its resemblance to a column. He supposed the sun to be of equal magnitude with the earth. He invented the gnomon, and placed one at Lacedaemon to observe the solstices and equinoxes. The circumstance which best entitles Anaximander to the gratitude of posterity is the invention of geographical chaιis. Anaximenes succeeded Anaximander in the Ionian school, and maintained nearly the same doctrines. Pliny says he was the first who taught the art of constructing dials, an invention which, as we have just seen, has also been ascribed to Anaximander. These two philosophers probably revived the knowledge of an instrument, the use of which had been forgotten amidst the general rudeness and ignorance of their countrymen. Before their time the Greeks only marked the divisions of the day by the different lengths of the sun’s shadow. Anaxagoras was the disciple and successor of Anaximenes. If this philosopher really entertained the ridiculous opinions ascribed to him by Plutarch, the Ionian school must rather have retrograded than advanced in sound philosophy from the time of Thales. He is said to have believed that the sun is a mass of red-hot iron, or of heated stone, somewhat bigger than the Peloponnesus, that the heaven is a vault of stones, which is prevented from tumbling only by the rapidity of its circular motion, and that the sun is prevented from advancing beyond the tropics by a thick and dense atmosphere, which forces him to retrace his course. These alleged opinions are probably greatly exaggerated; but it does not appear that Anaxagoras contributed much to extend the knowledge of the heavens. His disregard for the superstitious notions of his age brought its usual penal consequences. Having shown the reason of the éclipsée of the moon, he was accused of ascribing to natural causes the attributes and power of the gods; and having taught the existence of only one God, he was accused of impiety and treason towards his country. Sentence of death was pronounced on the philosopher and all his family; and it required the powerful interest of his friend and disciple Pericles to obtain a commutation of the sentence into one of perpetual banishment.

While the Ionian sect was so successfully employed in cultivating and propagating a knowledge of nature in Greece, another, still more celebrated, was founded in Italy by Pythagoras. Pythagoras is said to have acquired in Egypt the knowledge of the obliquity of the ecliptic, and of the identity of the morning and evening stars.
[9:2:747]

What he chiefly deserves to be commemorated for in the history of astronomy, is his philosophical doctrine regarding the motion of the earth. He taught publicly that the earth is placed at the centre of the universe; but among his chosen disciples he propagated the doctrine that the sun occupies the centre of the planetary world, and that the earth is a planet revolving round the sun. This system, which still retains his name, being called the old or Pythagorean system of the universe, is that which was revived by Copernicus. It is, however, only just to the latter to observe, that there is a vast difference between the bare statement of the possibility of a fact, and the demonstration of its existence by irrefragable arguments. Pythagoras having remarked the relation which subsists between the tone of a musical chord and the rapidity of its vibration, was led by analogy to extend the same relation to the planets, and to suppose that they emit sounds proportional to their respective distances, and form a celestial concert too melodious to affect the gross organs of mankind. Another fancy into which he was led by his passion for analogies, was the application of the five geometrical solids to the elements of the world. The cube symbolically represented the earth; the pyramid, fire; the octahedron, air; the icosahedron, or twenty-sided figure, water; and the dodecahedron, or figure with twelve faces, the exterior sphere of the universe. Pythagoras left no writings; and it is doubtful whether he really entertained many of the opinions and reveries which have usually been ascribed to him. Philolaus of Crotona, a disciple of Pythagoras, embraced the doctrine of his master with regard to the revolution of the earth about the sun. He supposed the sun to be a disk of glass which reflects the light of the universe. He made the lunar month consist of 29∣ days, the lunar year of 354 days, and the solar year of 365 J days. Nicetas of Syracuse seems to have been the first who openly taught the Pythagorean system of the universe. Cicero, on the authority of Theophrastus, the ancient historian of astronomy, gives him the credit of maintaining that the apparent motion of the stars arises from the diurnal motion of the earth about its axis;^[1. “Nicetas Syracusius, ut ait Theophrastus, coelum, solem, lunam, stellas, supera denique omnia, stare censet; neque, praeter terram, rem ullam in mundo moveri; quae cum circum axem se summa celeritate convertat et torqueat, eadem effici omnia, quasi, stante terra, coelum moveretur.”—(Cicero, Acad. Qucest., lib. iv. cap. 39.) Copernicus himself could not have stated the doctrine with greater precision. ] x but this rational doctrine seems to have been first broached by Heraclides of Pontus, and Ecphantus, a disciple of Pythagoras.

The introduction of the Metonic cycle forms an era in the history of the early astronomy of Greece. The Chaldeans, as we have already stated, established several lunisolar periods; and the difficulty of reconciling the motions of the sun and moon, or of assigning a period at the end of which these two luminaries again occupy the same positions relatively to the stars, had long embarrassed those who had the care of regulating the festivals. Meton and Euctemon had the merit of first obviating this difficulty, at least for a time; for the motions of the sun and moon being incommensurable, no period can be assigned which will bring them back to precisely the same situations. These two astronomers formed a cycle of nineteen lunar years, twelve of which contained each 12 lunations, and the seven others each 13, which they intercalated among the former. It had long been known that the synodic month consisted of 29∣ days nearly; and in order to avoid the fraction, it had been usual to make the twelve synodic months, which compose the solar year, to consist of 29 and 30 days alternately; the former being called deficient and the latter full months. Meton made his period consist of

125 full and 110 deficient months, which gives 6940 days for the 235 lunations, and is nearly equal to 19 solar years. This cycle commenced on the 16th of July in the year 433 b.c. It was received with acclamation by the people assembled at the Olympic games, and adopted in all the cities and colonies of Greece. It was also engraved in golden letters on tables of brass, whence it received the appellation of the golden number, and has been the basis of the calendars of all the nations of modern Europe. It is still in ecclesiastical use, with such modifications as time has rendered necessary.

Eudoxus of Cnidus, about the year 370 b.c., obtained great reputation as an astronomer. According to Pliny, he introduced the year of 365jdays into Greece. Archimedes says that he supposed the diameter of the sun to be nine times greater than that of the moon, which shows that he had in some degree overcome the illusions of sense. The titles of three of his works have been preserved,—the Period or Circumference of the Earth, the Phenomena, and the Mirror. His observatory was still standing at Cnidus in the time of Strabo. He is noteworthy for his contempt of the Chaldean predictions, and for having contributed to separate true astronomy from the reveries of judicial astrology. Eudoxus seems to have been the first who attempted to give a mechanical explanation of the apparent motions of the planets. He supposed that each planet occupies a particular part of the heavens, and that the path which it describes is determined by the combined motion of several spheres performed in different directions. The sun and moon had each three spheres: one revolving round an axis which passes through the poles of the earth, and which occasions the diurnal motion; a second revolving round the poles of the ecliptic, in a contrary direction, and causing the annual and monthly revolutions; the third revolving in a direction perpendicular to the first, and causing the changes of declination. Each of the planets had a fourth sphere to explain the stations and retrogradations. As new inequalities and motions were discovered, new spheres were added, till the machinery became so complicated as to be altogether unintelligible.

Although Plato can hardly be cited as an astronomer, yet the progress of the science was accelerated by means of the lights struck out by his penetrating genius. He seems to have had just notions of the causes of eclipses; and he imagined that the celestial bodies originally moved in straight lines, but that gravity altered their directions, and compelled them to move in curves. He proposed to astronomers the problem of representing the courses of the stars and planets by circular and regular motions. Geometry was assiduously cultivated in the school of Plato; and on this account he claims a distinguished place among the promoters of true astronomy.

Astronomy is also under some obligations to Aristotle. In a treatise which he composed on this science, he recorded a number of observations which he had made; and, among others, mentions an occultation of Mars by the moon, and another of a star in the constellation Gemini by the planet Jupiter. As such phenomena are of rare occurrence, their observation proves that he had paid considerable attention to the planetary motions.

A great number of astronomers flourished about this time whose labours and observations prepared the way for the reformation of the science which was shortly after effected by Hipparchus. Helicon of Cyzicus is renowned for the prediction of an eclipse, which took place, as Plutarch affirms, at the time announced. History records the names of only three individuals in ancient Greece who predicted eclipses,—Thales, Helicon, and Eudemus. Eudemus composed a history of astronomy, a fragment of which, consisting of only a few lines, is preserved by [9:2:748] Fabricius in the Bibliotheca Graeca. In this it is mentioned that the axes of the ecliptic and equator are separated from each other by the side of a pentedecagon, which is equivalent to saying that they contain an angle of 24°. This is the first value which we find assigned by the Greeks to the obliquity of the ecliptic. It is given in round numbers, and may easily be supposed to contain an error of a quarter of a degree.

Calippus is celebrated for the period which he formed of four Metonic cycles. Having observed, by means of an eclipse of the moon which took place about six years before the death of Alexander, that the Metonic cycle contained an error of a fourth of a day, he introduced the period of 940 lunations, containing four Metonic cycles, diminished by one day. He likewise formed a collection of observations on the heliacal risings of the planets. Theophrastus wrote a history of astronomy, and supposed the Milky Way to be produced by the imperfect junction of the two hemispheres, which allowed the light to penetrate from the firmament beyond. Autolycus of Pitane wrote two books,—one on the movable sphere, the other on the risings and settings of the stars. These are the most ancient of the astronomical works of the Greeks which have come down to our times.

Pytheas of Marseilles, about the time of Alexander the Great, determined the length of the solstitial shadows in various countries by means of the gnomon. He found the shadows equal at Marseilles and Byzantium—a circumstance which does not give a favourable idea of the accuracy of his observations, inasmuch as the difference of the latitudes of the two places amounts to 2∣ degrees. The observation is, however, interesting, as it is the most ancient of the kind which has been preserved after that of Tcheou-Kong, and as it confirms the successive diminution of the obliquity of the ecliptic. Pytheas undertook several voyages for the purpose of obtaining geographical and astronomical information, and advanced northwards as far as Iceland. His accounts have been treated as fabulous by Strabo and Polybius, but the accuracy of the greater number of them has been confirmed by modern observation and experience. He was the first who distinguished the climates by the different lengths of the days and nights.

Astronomy in the School of Alexandria.

The first astronomers of the Alexandrian school were Aristillus and Timocharis, who flourished under the first Ptolemy, about 300 years before Christ. The chief object of their labours was the determination of the relative positions of the principal stars of the zodiac instead of merely announcing their risings and settings, as had been the practice of the Orientals and the ancient Greeks. The observations of these two astronomers conducted Hipparchus to the important discovery of the precession of the equinoxes, and served as the basis of the theory which Ptolemy, some centuries afterwards, gave of that phenomenon.

Aristarchus of Samos, the next in order of the Alexandrian astronomers, composed a treatise On the Magnitudes andDistances of theSun and Moon, which has been preserved to our times. In this treatise he describes an ingenious method which he employed to obtain the relative distances of the two luminaries. At the instant when the moon is dichotomised, that is, when the exact half of her disk appears to a spectator on the earth to be illuminated by the sun’s light, the visual ray passing from the centre of the moon to the eye of the observer is perpendicular to the line which joins the centre of the moon and sun. At that instant, therefore, he measured the angular distance of the two bodies, and finding it to be 87°, he concluded, by the resolution of a right-angled triangle, that the distance of the sun is between eighteen and nineteen times greater than that of the moon. This method is perfectly correct in theory, but it is difficult to be assured of the exact instant of the moon’s dichotomy, and in an angle of such magnitude a very small error greatly affects the result. The error of Aristarchus is very considerable, the true angle being about 87° 5O'. The estimated distance of the sun is by consequence far too small; yet the determination, faulty as it was, contributed to expand greatly the existing notions relative to the boundaries of the universe, for the Pythagoreans had taught that the sun is only three, or at most three and a half times more distant than the moon. Another delicate observation made by Aristarchus was that of the magnitude of the sun’s diameter, which, as we learn from Archimedes, he determined to be the 720th part of the circumference of the circle which the sun describes in his diurnal revolution. This estimate is not very far from the truth, and the observation is by no means an easy one. He embraced the doctrine of Pythagoras respecting the earth’s motion, and appears to have entertained juster notions than any of the astronomers who preceded him, regarding the magnitude and extent of the universe. The treatise On the Magnitudes and Distances is published in the third volume of the works of Dr Wallis, with a Latin translation by Commandine, and some notes.

Eratosthenes, the successor of Aristarchus, a native of Cyrene, was invited to Alexandria by Ptolemy Euergetes, who appointed him keeper of the royal library. He is supposed to have been the inventor of armillary spheres, a species of instrument extensively used by the ancient astronomers. By means of an instrument of this kind he observed the distance between the tropics to be to the whole circumference of a great circle as 11 to 83,—a ratio equivalent to 47° 42' 39", half of which gives 23° 51' 19"∙5 for the obliquity of the ecliptic. This is a very important observation, and confirms the gradual diminution of the obliquity as indicated by theory. Eratosthenes is celebrated as the first who attempted, on correct principles, to determine the magnitude of the earth. Having remarked, by some means with which we are unacquainted, that Syene, the most southern of the cities of ancient Egypt, is situated nearly on the same meridian as Alexandria, he conceived the idea of determining the amplitude of the celestial arc intercepted between the zeniths of the two places, and of measuring at the same time their distance on the ground,—operations which would afford data for the determination of the whole length of the terrestrial meridian. Syene was known to be situated exactly under the tropic; for at the summer solstice the gnomon had no shadow, and the sun’s rays illumined the bottom of a deep well in that city. On the day of the solstice he found the meridional distance of the sun from the zenith of Alexandria to be 7° 12', or a fiftieth part of the circumference. It had also been ascertained by the bematists or surveyors of Alexander and the Ptolemies, that the itinerary distance between Alexandria and Syene was 5000 stadia; therefore 5000 × 50 = 250,000 stadia form the circumference of a great circle of the earth, or the length of the terrestrial meridian. Unfortunately, on account of the uncertainty respecting the length of the stadium here employed, we possess no means of estimating the degree of approximation afforded by this rude though ingenious attempt.

About this time the science of astronomy was enriched by the discoveries of some of the distinguished geometricians whose labours have so greatly extended the glory of the Alexandrian school. Euclid, the celebrated author of the Elements, lived in the reign of the first Ptolemy. He composed a book on the sphere, which probably served as a model for future works of the same kind, and was the first who treated in a geometrical manner the phenomena of the different inclinations of the sphere. Conon of [9:2:749] Samos, the friend of Archimedes, collected the records of eclipses, which had been observed by the ancient Egyptians; and Callimachus ascribes to him the constellation of Berenice’s hair. Archimedes also claims a high rank among the cultivators of astronomy. His celebrated planetarium, which represented the motions of the sun, moon, planets, and starry sphere, has been a frequent theme of the praises of the poets :—
Jura poli, rerumque fidem, legesque deorum,
Ecce Syracosius transtulit arte senex.”
— Claudian , Epigr. 18.

Apollonius of Perga solved the important problem of the stations and retrogradations of the planets by means of epicycles and deferents; and he is entitled to the glory of having formed the alliance between geometry and astronomy, which has been productive of the greatest advantages to both.

Astronomy, which had as yet only consisted of a knowledge of isolated facts, acquired a systematic form, and almost a new existence, from the genius of Hipparchus, perhaps the greatest of all ancient philosophers in the sciences which are not purely speculative. This illustrious founder of astronomical science was born at Nicaea in Bithynia, and observed at Rhodes. Flamsteed and Cassini, probably misled by some ambiguous expressions of Ptolemy, have related that his observations were made at Alexandria; and this opinion seems generally to have been adopted by historians. The question has been examined carefully, and at considerable length, by Delambre (Astronomie Ancienne), who comes to the conclusion that there is no reason whatever to infer that Hipparchus ever saw Alexandria. Ptolemy, in reporting the observations of Hipparchus, supposed Rhodes and Alexandria to be situated on the same meridian, and consequently does not find it necessary to mention the place at which the observations were made. Hipparchus commenced his brilliant career by verifying the determination of the obliquity of the ecliptic made by Eratosthenes. He next directed his attention to the length of the tropical year. By comparing one of his own observations of the summer solstice with a similar one made by Aristarchus 140 years before, he found that the anciently received value of 365∣ days was too great by seven minutes. This leaves the tropical year a value still too great; but it is probable that the error arose from the inaccuracy of the observation of Aristarchus; for the observations of Hipparchus, compared with those of the moderns, make the length of the tropical year amount to 365 days, 5 hours, and 49 minutes, which is only 12 seconde greater than the truth. By a careful observation of the solstices and equinoxes, he discovered that the year is not divided by these pointe into four equal parts, the sun occupying 94∣ days in passing from the vernal equinox to the summer solstice, and only 92⅜ from the same solstice to the equinox of autumn. The sun, consequently, remained 187 days in that part of the ecliptic which lies between the equator and the north pole, and therefore only about 178 in the other part. This observation led Hipparchus to the great discovery of the eccentricity of the solar orbit. He accounted for the apparent inequality of the sun’s motion by supposing that the earth is not placed exactly at the centre of the circular orbit of the sun, and that, consequently, his distance from the earth is subject to variation. When the sun is at his greatest distance, he appears to move more slowly; and when he approaches nearer, his motion becomes more rapid. The distance of the earth from the centre of the orbit is called the eccentricity; it produces an equation between the real and apparent motions which is called the “equation of the centre.” He determined the magnitude of this equation in terms of the radius of the ecliptic, and fixed the position of the line of the apsides, or that which joins the two opposite points of the orbit which are at the greatest and least distance from the earth. With these data he formed the first tables of the sun which are mentioned in the history of astronomy. The discovery of the eccentricity also led Hipparchus to that of the inequality of the lengths of the solar days at different seasons of the year. In the interval which elapses between the sun’s passage over the meridian and his return to it the following day, the sun advances by his own proper motion towards the east nearly a degree. But the rate of this motion is unequal, varying between 57 and 61 minutes of a degree; and the accumulation of the inequalities forms what is called the equation of time, that is, the difference between the true time, as shown by the sun, and the mean time, shown by a well-regulated clock, the motions of which are equal and uniform.

The attention of Hipparchus was next directed to the motions of the moon; and on this subject his researches were attended with equal success. From the comparison of a great number of the most circumstantial and accurate observations of eclipses recorded by the Chaldeans, he was enabled to determine the period of the moon’s revolution relatively to the stars, to the sun, to her nodes, and to her apogee. These determinations are among the most valuable results of ancient astronomy, inasmuch as they corroborate one of the finest theoretical deductions—the acceleration of the mean lunar motion—and thus furnish one of the most delicate tests of the truth of Newton’s law of gravitation. It was indeed, by a comparison of the observations of Hipparchus with those of the Arabian and modern astronomers that Dr Halley was led to the discovery of that important phenomenon. Hipparchus also determined the eccentricity of the lunar orbit, and its inclination to the plane of the ecliptic; and the values which he assigned to these elements, making allowance for the evection and the inequalities of the moon’s motion in latitude, are within a few minutes the same as those which are now observed. .He had also an idea of the second inequality of the moon’s motion, namely, the evection, and made all the necessary preparations for a discovery which was reserved for Ptolemy. He likewise approximated to the parallax of the moon, which he attempted to deduce from that of the sun, by determining the length of the frustum cut off from the cone of the terrestrial shadow by the moon, when she traverses it in her eclipses. From the parallax he concluded that the greatest and least distances of the moon are respectively equal to 78 and 67 semi-diameters of the earth, and that the distance of the sun is equal to 1300 of the same semi-diameters. The first of these determinations exceeds the truth, the second falls greatly short of it, the distance of the sun being nearly equal to 24,000 terrestrial semi-diameters. It may, however, be remarked that Ptolemy, who undertook to correct Hipparchus with regard to the parallax, deviated still farther from the truth.

The apparition of a new star in the time of Hipparchus induced him to undertake the formation of a catalogue of all the stars visible above his horizon, to fix their relative positions, and mark their configurations, in order that posterity might have the means of observing any changes which might in future take place in the state of the heavens. This arduous undertaking was rewarded by the important discovery of the precession of the equinoxes, one of the fundamental elements of astronomy. By comparing his own observations with those of Aristillus and Timocharis, he found that the first point of Aries, which, in the time of these astronomers, or 150 years before, corresponded with the vernal equinox, had advanced two degrees, according to the order of the signs, or at the rate of 48 seconds a year. This determination is not very far from [9:2:750] the truth; for, according to modern observations, the rate of the precession is about 50T seconds annually. His catalogue contained 1080 stars,—not, as has sometimes been erroneously stated, 1022, the number in that of Ptolemy, in which the nebulous and some obscure stars are omitted. He also commenced a series of observations to furnish his successors with the means of forming a theory of the planets. Hipparchus likewise invented the planisphere, or method of representing the starry firmament on a plane surface, which afforded the means of solving the problems of spherical trigonometry in a manner often more exact and more convenient than the globe itself. He was the first who demonstrated the methods of calculating triangles, whether rectilineal or spherical; and he constructed a table of chords, from which he drew nearly the same advantages as we derive at present from the tables of sines. Geography is also indebted to him for the happy idea of fixing the position of places on the earth by means of their latitudes and longitudes; and he was the first who determined the longitude by the eclipses of the moon.

After the death of Hipparchus nearly three centuries elapsed before any successor arose worthy of the name. During this long period astronomy made no essential advancement. Some rough observations, scarcely superior to those of the Chaldeans, and a few meagre treatises, are the only monuments which exist to testify that science had not fallen into utter oblivion in an age so fertile of poets and orators. Geminus and Cleomedes wrote .treatises, which have been preserved to our times; Agrippa and Menelaus are said to have observed; the Roman calendar was reformed by Julius Caesar and the Egyptian astronomer Sosigenes; and Posidonius measured a degree, and remarked that the laws of the tides depend on the motions of the sun and moon.

Ptolemy was born at Ptolemais in Egypt, and flourished at Alexandria about the 130th year of our era, under the reigns of Hadrian and Antoninus. This illustrious ornament of the Alexandrian school is entitled by his own discoveries to the high rank among astronomers which has universally been assigned to him; but the most signal service which he conferred on science was the collection and arrangement of the ancient observations. Out of these materials he formed the Μεγάλη Swra^tç, or Great Composition, a collection which exhibits a complete view of the state of astronomy in the time of Ptolemy, and which contains the germ of most of the methods in use at the present day. The hypothesis which Ptolemy adopted for the purpose of explaining the apparent motions, was that which had been followed by Hipparchus. To account for the uniform circular motion, Apollonius imagined the ingenious apparatus of epicycles and deferents; and Hipparchus advanced a step farther, by placing the centre of the sun’s circle at a small distance from the earth. Ptolemy adopted both hypotheses, and supposed the planet to describe an epicycle by a uniform revolution in a circle, the centre of which was carried forward uniformly in an eccentric round the earth. By means of these suppositions, and by assigning proper relations between the radii of the epicycle and deferent circle, and also between the velocity of the planet and the centre of its epicycle, he was enabled to represent with tolerable accuracy the apparent motions of the planets, and particularly the phenomena of the stations and retrogradations, which formed the principal object of the researches of the ancient astronomers. The notions of Apollonius and Hipparchus were thus reduced to a systematic form, and the proportions of the eccentrics and epicycles of all the planets assigned, by Ptolemy; on which account the system has been generally ascribed to him, and has obtained the name of the Ptolemaic System of the universe.

r lhe most important discovery which astronomy ewes to Ptolemy is that of the evection of the moon. Hipparchus had discovered the first lunar inequality, or the equation of the centre, which serves to correct the mean motion at the syzygies, and had also remarked the necessity of another correction for the quadratures. He even undertook a set of observations, with a view to ascertain its amount and its law; but death put a stop to his labours before he had brought them to a successful issue. Ptolemy completed the investigation, and discovered that the eccentricity of the lunar orbit is itself subject to an annual variation, depending on the motion of the line of the apsides. The variation of the position of the apsides produces an inequality of the moon’s motion in her quarters, which has been technically denominated the evection. The equation given by Ptolemy, though of course empirical, is remarkably exact.

Ptolemy employed a very simple process for determining the moon’s parallax, which was probably suggested to him by the situation of Alexandria, where he observed. He determined the latitude of a place a little to the south of that city, over the zenith of which the moon was observed to pass when her northern declination was the greatest possible. But when the moon is in the zenith, or in the same straight line with the observer and the centre of the earth, she has no parallax; consequently the obliquity of the ecliptic and the latitude of the station being known, the moon’s greatest northern latitude was also determined. The next step was to observe the moon’s meridian altitude fifteen days after the first observation, when her southern latitude was necessarily the greatest possible. This observation gave the apparent altitude of the moon, but her greatest northern and southern declinations being supposed equal, her true altitude, as seen from the centre of the earth, was easily computed from the previous observation, and the difference between the true and apparent altitudes gave the amount of the parallax.

The observations of Hipparchus relative to the motion of the stars in longitude, or the regression of the equinoctial points, were confirmed by Ptolemy, although he mistook his amount, and diminished a quantity which Hipparchus had already estimated too low. According to Hipparchus the regression is at the rate of two degrees in 150 years. Ptolemy reduced it to one degree in 90 years. This disagreement would seem to indicate an error of more than a degree in the observations, which can with difficulty be admitted, considering the accordance which subsists among the different observations cited by Ptolemy in support of his own determination. For this and some other reasons Ptolemy has been accused of altering the observations of Hipparchus, and accommodating them to his own theory; and there would appear to be but too just grounds for the imputation. The error with regard to the regression may, however, have arisen from the circumstance, that Hipparchus had assigned too great a value to the length of the year, whence the motion of the sun with regard to the equinoxes would be made too slow, and the longitudes employed by Ptolemy consequently diminished.

Ptolemy has been called The Prince of Astronomers,—a title which may perhaps be justified by the universal and long-continued prevalence of his system, but to which he has no claim from the number or value of his own observations. After a laborious and minute examination of the Almagest, Delambre doubts whether anything is contained in that great work, beyond the author’s own statement, from which it can be decisively inferred that Ptolemy ever observed at all. He, indeed, frequently makes mention of observations made by himself; but his solar tables, rate of the precession, eclipses, determination of the moon’s motion and parallax, arid above all, his catalogue of stars, render it impossible to doubt that the greater part of the [9:2:751] results which he has given as observations arc merely computed from the tables of Hipparchus. He never in any instance cites a single observation more than is just necessary for the object he has immediately in view, and consequently, by precluding all comparison of one observation with another, has deprived us of the means even of guessing at the probable amount of the errors of his solar, lunar, and planetary tables. If an astronomer, as Delambre justly remarks, were to adopt the same course at the present day, he would be certain of forfeiting all claim to confidence; but Ptolemy stood alone; he had neither judges nor rivals; and now no one condescends to calculate the few observations he has left us. His catalogue contains only 1022 stars, and is therefore less extensive than that of Hipparchus, but it is exceedingly valuable on account of its details.

Λ⅛∕ronomy of the Arabians.

The most celebrated of the Arabian astronomers was Albategni, or Muhammed Ben Geber Al-Batani, so called from Batan, a city of Mesopotamia, where he was born about 850. He was a prince of Syria, and resided at Rakka in Mesopotamia; but many of his observations were made at Antioch. Having studied the Syntaxis of Ptolemy, and made himself acquainted with the methods practised by the Greek astronomers, he began to observe, and soon found that the places assigned to many of the stars in Ptolemy’s tables were considerably different from their actual situations, in consequence of the error which the latter had committed with regard to the precession of the equinoxes. Albategni measured the rate of the precession with greater accuracy than had been done by Ptolemy; and he had still better success in his attempt to determine the eccentricity of the solar orbitis value of which differs extremely little from that which results from modern observations. In assigning the length of the year, however, he fell into an error of more than two minutes; but this proceeded, as has been shown by Dr Halley, from too great confidence in the observations of Ptolemy. Albategni also remarked that the place of the sun’s apogee is not immovable, as former astronomers had supposed, but that it advances at a slow rate, according to the order of the signs,—a discovery which has been confirmed by the theory of gravitation. A new set of astronomical tables, more accurate than those of Ptolemy, likewise resulted from the indefatigable labours of Albategni; and his observations, important in themselves, are doubly interesting on account of the fact that they form a link of connection between those of the astronomers of Alexandria and of modern Europe. The works of Albategni were published in 1537 under the title of De Scientia Stellarum.

Ibn-Junis, who flourished at the beginning of the 11th century, constructed a set of tables, and composed a sort of celestial history, in which he has recorded numerous observations of his own and of other astronomers belonging to the same country. This work, imperfectly known through some extracts, long excited the curiosity of astronomers, as it was supposed to contain observations tending to establish the acceleration of the mean motion of the moon. A manuscript copy of it, belonging to the University of Leyden, was, in 1804, transmitted to the French I nstitute, and translated by Professor Caussin. It contains 28 observations of eclipses from the year 829 to 1004; seven observations of the equinoxes; one of the summer solstice; one of the obliquity of the ecliptic made at Damascus, by which the value of that element is found to be 23° 35'; and likewise a portion of tables of the sun and moon, with some other matter illustrative of the state of astronomy among the Arabians. The observations which regard the acceleration of the mean lunar motion are two eclipses of the sun and one of the moon, observed by Ibn-Junis, near Cairo, in the years 977, 978, and 979, and they agree with theory in confirming the existence of that phenomenon.

Ulugh Begh, a Tartar prince, and grandson of the great Tamerlane, not only encouraged the study of astronomy, but was himself a diligent and successful observer. At Samarcand, the capital of his dominions, he established an academy of astronomers, and caused the most magnificent instruments to be constructed for their use. By means of a gnomon 180 feet in height, he determined the obliquity of the ecliptic to be 23° 30' 20", the precession of the equinoxes at 1° in 70 years, and obtained elements for the construction of tables which have been found to be scarcely inferior in accuracy to those of Tycho Brahe. The ancient astronomy had produced only one catalogue of the fixed stars, that of Hipparchus. Ulugh Begh has the honour of having formed a second, after an interval of sixteen centuries.

Revival of Astronomy in Europe.

After the death of Ulugh Begh, astronomy received no farther accessions in the East. But the seeds of knowledge had now begun to take root in a more propitious soil, and Europe, destined to carry the development of the human energies to its fullest extent, began to awake from the lethargy in which it had continued during so many ages.

The 14th century produced no astronomer from whose labours the science gained any accessions. George Purbach, or Beurbach, so named from a small town in Austria, where he was born in 1423, obtained great celebrity as a professor. He studied at Vienna, and after giving proofs of exceptional talent, he travelled into Italy, where he was favourably received by Cardinal de Cusa, who himself cultivated astronomy. On his return to Vienna he undertook a translation of the Almagest; and although ignorant both of Greek and Arabic, his perfect acquaintance with the subject enabled him to correct many errors which had been introduced through the carelesness or ignorance of former translators. Purbach had the good fortune to form a disciple who executed many of the plans which had been interrupted by his premature death. This was the celebrated John Müller of Königsberg, better known by the name of Regiomontanus. Attracted to Vienna in his youth by the great reputation of Purbach, he continued to study there during ten years, and on the death of his master repaired to Rome for the purpose of acquiring the Greek language, and of making himself, through it, acquainted with the Almagest. At Rome he continued his observations, and translated into Latin the works of Ptolemy, the Conics of Apollonius, and some other treatises of ancient science. In 1471 he retired to Nuremberg, where, with the aid of Bernard Walther, a wealthy burgess, he founded an observatory and furnished it with excellent instruments principally of his own invention, by means of which he was enabled to detect many errors in the ancient tables. After the death of Regiomontanus, Walther continued to observe at Nuremberg during thirty years. His observations were collected by order of the senate of Nuremberg, and published by Schöner in 1544, a second time by Snellius, and, lastly, along with those of Tycho Brahe. In 1484 Walther began to make use of clocks, then a recent invention, to measure time in celestial observations. He was also the first who employed the planet Venus in determining the longitudes of the stars.

Nuremberg had the honour of producing another astronomer of some celebrity. John Werner was the first who explained the method, which was afterwards brought into general use by Maskelyne, of finding the longitude at sea, by observing the distance between a fixed star and the [9:2:752] moon. He published some mathematical and geographical treatises, and made a number of observations to determine the obliquity of the ecliptic and the precession of the equinoxes.

We come now to the period of the overthrow of the Ptolemaic system and the total renovation of the science of astronomy, which was due to the labours of Copernicus. The system which is associated with the name of Copernicus is now so familiar to every one, that it is almost unnecessary to describe it. The heaven, composed of stars perfectly at rest, occupies the remotest bounds of space, then the orbit of Saturn, next Jupiter, Mars, the Earth (accompanied by its moon), Venus, Mercury, and, lastly, the Sun immovable at the centre. By this arrangement the stations and retrogradations of the planets became simple mathematical corollaries, following from the differences of the radii of their orbits and their unequal motions. The diurnal rotation of the earth explained more simply and rationally the apparent daily revolution of the heavens; and the precession of the equinoxes was referred to a small variation in the inclination of the earth’s axis to the plane of the ecliptic. But the simplicity of the system, and its consequent probability, were the only arguments which Copernicus was able to bring forward in proof of its reality. The motion of the earth can, indeed, never be made an object of ocular demonstration; but after Richer’s discovery of the diminution of gravity towards the equator, it was impossible to doubt longer of the existence of its rotatory motion; and when Roemer had measured the velocity of light, and Bradley observed the phenomena of aberration, the evidences of its annual revolution were rendered equally convincing. Great, however, as were the merits of Copernicus, it must.be acknowledged that he left his system in a very imperfect state. After the example of the ancients, he assumed as an axiom the uniform circular motion of the planets; and as the only motions which are observed are in a state of incessant variation, he was obliged, in order to explain the inequalities, to suppose a different centre to each of his orbits. The sun was placed within the orbit of each of the planets, but not in the centre of any of them, consequently he had no other office to perform than to distribute light and heat; being excluded from any influence on the system, he became as it were a stranger to all the motions. Yet notwithstanding these and other imperfections, the establishment of the doctrine of the earth’s motion, with an evidence which dissipated the illusions of sense, was a great step towards the true knowledge of the planetary system; and when we consider the ignorance and prejudices of the age, we cannot hesitate to admit his claim to a high rank among philosophers. But whether the actual services which he rendered to astronomy are commensurate with the great fame he has obtained, may admit of doubt. He revived an ancient opinion opposed to the prejudices and religious dogmas of his times, and fortified it with new and strong, though not absolutely convincing, proofs. It seldom happens, however, with regard to those sciences which ultimately appeal to experience, that general reasoning, even of the soundest kind, tends much to their real advancement; and there is little reason for thinking that astronomy would have been less perfect, or that any discoveries since made in it would have been retarded a single day, even if Copernicus had never lived. His great merit, like that of Lord Bacon, consists in the sound views which he took of nature, and in advancing so far before the general attainments of his age. For the events of his life see Copernicus.

Tycho Brahe stands next in chronological order on the roll of those who have contributed to the progress of astronomy. As an indefatigable and skilful observer, he is justly considered as far superior to any astronomer who had preceded him since the revival of the science in Europe. His ample fortune gave him the means of procuring the best instruments which the age could produce; and by his ingenuity and persevering application, he was admirably qualified to employ them to the best advantage. He computed the first table of refractions, and if it extended only to 45°, the reason was, that the effects of refraction, at a higher altitude, were altogether insensible to his instruments. His solar tables were brought to so great a degree of exactness, that he affirms he could never detect an error in them exceeding a quarter of a minute; but there is reason to suspect some exaggeration in this statement, particularly as Cassini, a century after, with much better means, could scarcely answer for errors of a whole minute. He contributed greatly to the improvement of the lunar tables, and detected a considerable inequality in the moon’s motion in longitude, to which he gave the name of the Variation, by which it has ever since been distinguished. He also discovered an equation in latitude similar to the evection which had been observed by Hipparchus, and fixed its amount with great accuracy. He remarked the fourth inequality of the moon in longitude, although he failed in his attempt to ascertain its amount, or assign its law. He represented the inequalities of the motions of the nodes, and in the inclination of the lunar orbit, by the motion of the pole of that orbit in a small circle round the pole of the ecliptic. He demonstrated that the region of the comets is far beyond the orbit of the moon, and determined the relative and absolute positions of 777 fixed stars with scrupulous exactness, which gave his catalogue an immense superiority over those of Hipparchus and Ulugh Begh; and he left to his successors a regular series of observations of the planets, amassed for the purpose of establishing, the truth of his own system, but of which Kepler made a better use by employing them to establish the system of Copernicus. For an account of his life, see Brahe, Tycho.

The great mass of accurate observations accumulated by Tycho furnished the materials out of which his disciple Kepler may be said to have constructed the edifice of the universe. The observations of the Danish astronomer had furnished the latter with the means of establishing with certainty the truth or inaccuracy of the various hypotheses which he successively imagined; and the diligence with which he laboured in comparing and calculating these observations during 20 years, was finally rewarded by some of the most important discoveries which had yet been made in astronomy. Deceived by an opinion which had been adopted by Copernicus, and had never been called in question by the ancients, that all the celestial motions are performed in circles, he long fruitlessly endeavoured to represent by that hypothesis the irregular motions of Mars; and after having computed with incredible labour the observations of seven oppositions of that planet, he at length discovered that the motions could only be accurately represented by supposing the planet to move in an ellipse, having the sun in one of its foci. Having arrived at this important result, he next proceeded to consider the angular motion of the planet, and finding that it was not uniform in respect of any point situated within the orbit, he concluded that uniform motion, till then universally received as an axiom, had no existence in nature. He perceived, however, that the areas described in equal times by the radius vector of the planet, at its greatest and least distances, were equal; and subsequent observations enabled him to demonstrate that this equality extended to every point of the orbit. It was therefore discovered that Mars moves in an elliptic orbit, of which the sun occupies a focus, and in such a manner, that the area described by a line drawn from the centre of the planet to that of the [9:2:753] sun is always proportional to the time of description. The same conclusions he found to be true in respect of the orbit of the earth; and therefore he could no longer hesitate to extend them by analogy to the other plants. These are two of the three general principles which are known by the name of the “Laws of Kepler.”

It was some years later before Kepler arrived at the knowledge of the analogy which subsists between the distances of the several planets from the sun, and the periods in which they complete their revolutions. To the discovery of this analogy he attached the greatest importance, and regarded all his other labours as incomplete without it. After having imagined numberless hypotheses, it at last occurred to him to compare the different powers of the numbers which express the distances and times of revolutions; and he found, that the squares of the periodic times of the planets are always in the same proportion as the cubes of their mean distances from the sun. This is the third law of Kepler. He demonstrated it to be true of all the planets then known. It has been found to be equally true in regard to those which have been since discovered, and likewise to prevail in the systems of the satellites of Jupiter and Saturn. It is, indeed, as can be shown mathematically, a necessary consequence of the law of gravitation—directly as the masses, and inversely as the squares of the distances.

By these brilliant discoveries, the solar system was reduced to that degree of beautiful simplicity which had been conceived by Copernicus, but from which that great astronomer had found himself constrained to depart. The sun could not occupy the common centre of the circular orbits, but his place is in the common focus of the elliptic orbits of all the planets; and it is to this focu3 that every motion is to be referred, and from this that every distance is to be measured. The discovery of the elliptic motion, of the proportionality of the areas to the times, and the method of dividing an ellipse, by straight lines drawn from the focus to the periphery, into segments having a given ratio, formed the solution of a problem which had been the constant object of the labours of all astronomers from Ptolemy to Tycho, namely, to assign the place of a planet at any instant of time whatever. The tables which he computed for the elliptic motions form the model of those in present use. Some additions have been made in consequence of perturbations which the geometry of Kepler was inadequate to estimate, and which were only partially detected by the genius of Newton. It has been considered matter of surprise that Kepler did not think of extending the laws of the elliptic motion to the comets. Prepossessed with the idea that they never return after their passage to the sun, he imagined that it would only be a waste of time to attempt the calculation of the orbits of bodies which had «ο transitory an existence. He supposed the tail to be produced by the action of the solar rays, which, in traversing the body of the comet, continually carry off the most subtile particles, so that the whole mass must be ultimately annihilated by the successive detachment of the particles. He therefore neglected to study their motions, and left to 0ther3 a share of the glory resulting from the discovery of the true paths of the celestial bodies.

The observations of eclipses had formed the principal object of the earliest astronomers, but it was Kepler who first showed the practical advantages which may be •derived from them, by giving an example of the method of calculating a difference of meridians from an eclipse of the «un. The method extends to occultations of the stars, and is deservedly considered as the best we possess for determining geographical longitudes and correcting the tables. He composed a work on optics, replete with new and interesting views, and gave the first idea of the telescope with two convex glasses, which has since been advantageously substituted for that of Galileo. Prompt to seize every happy idea of his contemporaries, he perceived with delight the advantages which practical astronomy would derive from the new invention of the logarithms, and he immediately constructed a table, from which the logarithms of the natural numbers, sines, and tangents could be taken at once.

Kepler was not merely an observer and calculator; he inquired with great diligence into the physical causes of every phenomenon, and made a near approach to the discovery of that great principle which maintains and regulates the planetary motions. He possessed some very sound and accurate notions of the nature of gravity, but unfortunately conceived it to diminish simply in proportion to the distance, although he had demonstrated that the intensity of light is reciprocally proportional to the surface over which it is spread, or inversely as the square of the distance from the luminous body. In his famous work De Stella Martis, which contains the discovery of the laws of the planetary motions, he distinctly states that gravity 13 a corporeal affection, reciprocal between two bodies of the same kind, which tends, like the action of the magnet, to bring them together, so that when the earth attracts a stone, the stone at the same time attracts the earth, but by a force feebler in proportion as it contains a smaller quantity of matter. Further, if the moon and the earth were not retained in their respective orbits by an animal or other equipollent force, the earth would mount towards the moon one fifty-fourth part of the interval which separates them, and the moon would descend the fifty-three remaining parts, supposing each to have the same density. He likewise very clearly explains the cause of the tides in the following passage :—“If the earth ceased to attract its waters, the whole sea would mount up and unite itself with the moon. The sphere of the attracting force of the moon extends even to the earth, and draws the waters towards the torrid zone, so that they rise to the point which has the moon in the zenith.” It is not difficult to imagine how much these views must have contributed to the immortal discovery of Newton. (See Kepler.)

Contemporary with Kepler was the illustrious Galileo G whose discoveries, being of a more popular nature, and far more striking and intelligible to the generality of mankind, had a much greater immediate effect on the opinions of the age, and in hastening the revolution which was soon about to change the whole face of physics and astronomy. While residing at Venice, he heard it reported that Metius, a Dutch optician, had discovered a certain combination of lenses, by means of which distant objects were approximated to the sight. This vague and scanty intelligence sufficed to excite the curiosity of Galileo, who immediately set about inquiring into the means whereby such an effect could be produced. His researches were attended with prompt success, and on the following day he had a telescope which magnified about three times. It was formed by the combination of two lenses, a plano-convex and planoconcave, fitted in a leaden tube. In a second trial he obtained one which magnified seven or eight times; and subsequent essays enabled him to increase the magnifying power to 32 times. On directing his telescope to the moon, he perceived numerous inequalities on her surface, the diversified appearances of which led him to conclude almost with certainty that the moon is an opaque body similar to the earth, and reflecting the light of the sun unequally, in consequence of her superficial asperities. The planet Venus exhibited phases perfectly similar to those of the moon. These phases had been formerly announced by Copernicus as a necessary consequence ci [9:2:754] lιis system; and the actual discovery of their existence made it impossible to doubt the revolution of Venus round the sun. He detected the four satellites or moons of Jupiter, and, in honour of his patron, gave them the name of the “Medicean Stars.” The discovery of these little bodies circulating round the huge orb of Jupiter afforded him a strong analogical proof of the annual revolution of the earth, accompanied by its moon. He perceived spots on the disk of the sun, from the motions of which he deduced the rotation of that body about its axis in the space of 27 days. The singular appearances of Saturn were beheld by him with no less pleasure than astonishment. His telescope was not sufficiently powerful to separate the ring from the body of the planet; and to explain the appearances he supposed Saturn to be composed of three stars almost in contact with one another. These discoveries proved that the substances of the celestial bodies are similar to that of the earth, and demolished the Aristotelian doctrine of their divine essence and incorruptible nature. They enlarged the ideas of mankind respecting the planetary system, and furnished the most convincing arguments in favour of the doctrines of Copernicus.

Science is indebted to Galileo for two other discoveries of a different kind, less brilliant perhaps, but of far greater importance than those which we have yet enumerated. These are the isochronism of the vibrations of the pendulum, and the law of the acceleration of falling bodies. His telescopic discoveries could not have remained long unknown; in fact, with the exception of those of the phases of Venus, and of the triple form of Saturn, they were all fiercely disputed, even during his own lifetime. It is now universally admitted that he was the first who discovered the satellites of Jupiter, and the spots of the sun; but the very circumstance of other claimants to these discoveries having arisen, proves that they were within the reach of ordinary observers. For an account of his eventful life see Galileo.

While astronomy was making these rapid advances in the hands of Kepler and Galileo, an event occurred in Scotland which contributed, though less directly, no less powerfully, to the acceleration of its progress. This was the invention of logarithms by Lord Napier, baron of Merchiston; “an admirable artifice,” says Laplace, “which by reducing to a few days the labour of many months, doubles the life of the astronomer, and spares him the errors and disgust inseparable from long calculations,—an invention of which the human mind has the more reason to be proud, inasmuch as it was derived exclusively from its own resources.” It may be added, that without this, or some equivalent artifice, the computations rendered necessary by more correct observations would far exceed the limits of human patience or industry, and astronomy could never have acquired that precision and accuracy by which it is now distinguished above all the other branches of human knowledge.

The same epoch presents to us a great number of excellent observers, who, although they did not produce any revolution in the state of astronomy, still rendered it useful service. Scheiner is celebrated for his observations of the solar spots, and his disputes with Galileo. John Bayer of Augsburg published a description of the constellations, accompanied by maps, in which the stars are marked by Greek letters,—a simple idea, which has been universally adopted. Lansberg, a Flemish mathematician, published in 1632 a set of astronomical tables, which, though filled with inaccuracies, rendered good service to science by apprising Horrox of the transit of Venus over the sun’s disk, which that young astronomer and his friend Crabtree had the satisfaction of observing on the 24th of November 1639. They were the first who ever witnessed that rare phenomenon. Snellius is celebrated for his measurement of the earth. Gassendi, who had the merit along witlι Descartes of hastening the downfall of the Aristotelian philosophy in France, made some useful observations, particularly one of a transit of Mercury in 1631. His works, which fill six folio volumes, abound with curious and useful researches. Riccioli, a Jesuit, born at Ferrara in 1598, contributed to the progress of astronomy, not so much by his own discoveries, as by collecting and rendering an account of those of others. He rejected the system of Copernicus, and was more zealous in maintaining the doctrines of the church than in investigating nature; but his works form a vast repertory of useful information. His Novum Almagestum is a collection of the observations, opinions, and physical explanations of the phenomena, together with all the methods of computation then known. He was assisted in his labours by Grimaldi, who discovered the inflection of light, and he gave to the principal spots of the moon the names which are now used by astronomers.

The most accurate observations that were ever made prior to the adaptation of the telescope to astronomical instruments were those of Hevelius, a rich citizen of Dantzic, who devoted his life and a large fortune to the service of astronomy. Having fitted up an observatory, and furnished it with the best instruments which could be procured, he commenced a course of observations, which he followed assiduously upwards of forty years. In his Selenographia he has given an accurate description of the face and spots of the moon, accompanied with excellent delineations of her appearance in her different phases and librations. The idea of making drawings of the different phases of the moon had previously occurred to Gassendi and Peiresc, but they had not been able to execute the project; indeed, the difficulty attending it was such, that it occupied Hevelius, who was an excellent draughtsman, as well as observer, during a great number of years. Hevelius made an immense number of researches on comets; and finding that the observations could not be represented by rectilinear or circular orbits, he supposed them to move in parabolas. During a temporary absence from Dantzic he had the misfortune to lose, in a great fire which occurred in the city, his observatory, instruments, manuscripts, and almost the entire copy of the second volume of his Machina Coelestis, which contained the results of his protracted labours. He was now in his old age, but his zeal did not give way under the terrible calamity. He patiently recommenced all his calculations, reconstructed tables of the sun, and prepared for publication his Firmamentuni Sobiescianum, or celestial chart, which did not appear till after his death. Towards the latter part of his life the use of telescopic sights began to be generally adopted. Hevelius, however, resisted the innovation, and continued to employ plain sights. This preference given to the ancient method by so skilful an observer induced Dr Halley to visit him at Dantzic, for the purpose of ascertaining, by a comparison of observations made at the same time and place, which of the two methods gave the most correct results. Dr Halley observed with the telescope, and Hevelius with his own instruments; but such was the dexterity he had acquired through long practice, that the difference of their observations seldom amounted to more than a few seconds, and in no case to so much as a minute. Notwithstanding this agreement, it is to be regretted that Hevelius did not adopt the new method; for, on account of the greater precision given to instruments by the use of the telescope, his observations, which were made without it, cannot now be admitted in the construction of tables, and consequently are for the most part useless to astronomy.

Few individuals have rendered more important services [9:2:755] to science than Huyghens. His improvement of the telescope and hi3 application of the pendulum to clocks were valuable additions to the machinery of astronomical investigation. By means of his telescopes he discovered that the extraordinary appearance exhibited by Saturn was occasioned by a ring surrounding the body of the planet, and inclined to the ecliptic in an angle which he estimated at 21°. He published his observations of this planet in a work entitled Systema Saturnium, which still shows some traces of that species of reasoning from final causes which so greatly disfigures the writings of Kepler. For example, on discovering the satellite, he conceived that as the number of satellites now equalled the number of planets, it was vain to look for more, the equality being necessary to the harmony of the system. He lived, however, to witness the discovery of four more satellites belonging to the same planet. (See Huyghens.)

The application of telescopes and micrometers to graduated instruments forms an important epoch in the history of astronomy. This happy improvement was first brought into use by Picard in 1667. Morin, indeed, had applied a telescope to the quadrant so early as 1634, and perceived the stars in full day in 1635. In 1669 Picard began to observe the stars on the meridian in the day time, with a quadrant, to which, in concert with Azout, he had applied an astronomical telescope having cross wires in its focus. Huyghens invented the plate micrometer in 1650; Malvasia that with the fixed wires in 1662; and Azout that with the movable wire in 1666. (See Delambre, Astronomie du Moyen Aye, p. 618; note by Bouvard.) It is principally to these ingenious inventions and the fine application of the pendulum to clocks by Huyghens in 1656, that we must attribute the rapid progress since made in practical astronomy, and the extreme precision of modern observations. Picard was also the first who introduced the modern method of determining the right ascensions of the stars, by observing their meridional passages, and employed the pendulum for that purpose. He likewise introduced the method of corresponding altitudes, and is entitled to be regarded as the founder of modern astronomy in France. Roemer, the friend and pupil of Picard, discovered the progressive motion of light in 1675, and measured its velocity by means of the eclipses of Jupiter’s satellites. He was the first who erected a transit instrument, which gave a new accuracy to observations of right ascension.

The Royal Observatory of Paris was completed in 1670, and its direction intrusted to Dominic Cassini, who enriched astronomy with a great number of valuable observations and new discoveries. He determined the motions of Jupiter’s satellites from observations of their eclipses, and constructed tables of them, which were found to be remarkably exact. He observed that the ring of Saturn is double, and discovered four of the satellites of that planet. He also determined the rotation of Jupiter and Mars, and made a number of observations on Venus with the same view. He observed the zodiacal light, and made a near approximation to the parallax of the sun. We also owe to him the first table of refractions calculated on correct principles, and a complete theory of the libration of the moon. Galileo had only observed the libration in latitude; Hevelius explained the libration in longitude, by supposing that the moon always presents the same face to the centre of her orbit, of which the earth occupies a focus. Cassini made the important remark, that the axis of rotation of the moon is inclined to the ecliptic, and that its nodes coincide with those of the lunar orbit, so that the poles of the orbit, ecliptic, and equator of the moon, are on the same circle of latitude, the pole of the ecliptic being situated between the other two. Though the greater number of these discoveries were only of secondary importance, Cassini, nevertheless, obtained an extraordinary reputation. Lalande remarks, that in his hand astronomy underwent the most signal revolutions, and that his name is, in France, almost synonymous with that of creator of the science. Delambre has, however, expressed a different and far more accurate view of the real services of Cassini in the following terms :—

“The revolution in astronomy was brought about by Copernicus, by the laws of Kepler, by the pendulum of Huyghens, by the micrometers of Azout and Picard, by the sectors and mural of Picard and his method of corresponding altitudes, by the transit instruments of Roemer; and Cassini appears to us an entire stranger to all these innovations, lie followed another route; he devoted a long life to painful observations, which at last deprived him of sight. Let us not refuse him the praise which he has so well merited, but let us reserve a place in our esteem for labours less brilliant perhaps, but of greater and more permanent utility, and which evince at least equal talent and sagacity.”

Cassini was assisted in his observations by his nephew, James Philip Maraldi, who determined the regression of the nodes, and the progressive motion of the apsides of the orbit of Jupiter. This astronomer also corrected the theory of Mars, and observed the sun’s parallax. He rejected the hypothesis of the progressive motion of light, as being insufficient to explain the inequalities of Jupiter’s satellites; and he conceived the design of forming a new catalogue of the stars, which, however, was never executed. He died in 1729.

There is no period in the history of mankind so distinguished by great and important discoveries, or so remarkable for the rapid development of the human intellect, as the 17th century. We have already noticed the invention of the pendulum, and its application to regulate the motion of timekeepers; the invention of the telescope, bringing within the range of vision the phenomena of new worlds; of logarithms, by which computations are so much abridged; and of the mechanical contrivances for measuring minute angles in the heavens. The same century witnessed the application of algebra to geometry, the discovery of the laws of the planetary motions, the infinitesimal calculus, the acceleration of falling bodies, the sublime theory of central forces, and the great principle of gravitation which connects the celestial orbs, and regulates the motions which it had been the business of the astronomer to observe since the earliest ages of the world. The service which the discovery of these primary laws rendered to the progress of astronomy can scarcely be exaggerated. Many of the inequalities of the planetary motions, in consequence of their minuteness and the slowness with which they occur, could not have been detected by observation; others might perhaps have been perceived, but we should still have been ignorant whether their constant accumulation might not ultimately change the state of the system, and, by destroying all confidence in the tables, demolish the fabric which had been reared at such a vast expense of time and labour. But when these inequalities are detected by theory, and separated from the mean motions with which they were blended, it becomes an object of the highest interest to confirm their existence by the most delicate and accurate observations. Hence, a more refined practice has constantly followed every theoretical discovery. Besides, it is the perfection of theory, and not tho mere knowledge of isolated facts, which gives astronomy its greatest value in the eyes of the philosopher. Numerous and important as its applications are, they have but a subordinate interest, in comparison with the knowledge of those general laws to which every particle of matter in the universe is subject, and by the discovery of which man has penetrated so deeply into the mysteries of nature.

By the discovery of the law of gravitation, Newton laid the foundations of physical astronomy; and by the consequences which he deduced from that law, he proceeded far in [9:2:756] the erection of the superstructure. He showed that the motions of all the bodies of the planetary system are regulated by its influence; he determined the figure of the earth on the supposition of its homogeneity; he gave a theory of the tides, discovered the cause of the precession of the equinoxes, and determined some of the principal lunar inequalities and planetary perturbations. Many of his theories were left in an imperfect state; for it is not in matters of science that it is given to the same individual to invent and bring to perfection: their complete development required that several subsidiary sciences should be farther advanced; but it has been the triumph of his system, that every subsequent discovery has only tended to strengthen and confirm it.

While physical astronomy was undergoing a complete revolution in the hands of Newton, the practical part was receiving great improvement from Flamsteed, the first astronomer royal, who conducted the Greenwich Observatory. This celebrated institution, from which so many important discoveries have emanated, was erected under the reign of Charles IL, in 1675. Flamsteed was appointed to it in 1676, and continued with indefatigable zeal to discharge the duties of the office during the long period of 33 years. In the course of this time he made an immense number of excellent observations, the results of which are given in the Historia Coelestis, the first edition of which was published in 1712, at the expense of Prince George of Denmark, the husband of Queen Anne. The second appeared in 1723, some time after the death of the author, in three volumes folio. The first volume contains the observations which he made, first at Derby, and afterwards at Greenwich, of the fixed stars, planets, comets, spots of the sun, and Jupiter’s satellites. The second volume contains the transits of the planets and stars over the meridian, and the places of the planets deduced from these observations. The third contains a historical notice, in which he gives a description of the instruments used lay Tycho and himself; catalogues of fixed stars by Ptolemy, Ulugh Begh, Tycho, the landgrave of Hesse, and Hevelius; together with the British Catalogue, containing the places of 2884 stars. The labours of Flamsteed were, however, confined entirely to the practical part of astronomy. He made no improvements in theory; but he is entitled to the merit of having been the first who brought into common use the method of simultaneously observing the right ascension of the sun and a star, a method by means of which the determination of the positions of the stars is reduced to the observation of meridional transits and altitudes. He was likewise the first who explained the true principles of the equation of time; and he improved the lunar tables by introducing into them the annual equation which had been suggested by Horrox.

Flamsteed was succeeded in the observatory by Halley, who held a prominent place among English astronomers. From early youth he applied himself with ardour to the study of mathematics and astronomy; and having procured a few instruments, he began to make observations, by which he was led to remark the inaccuracy of the tables of Jupiter and Saturn. In his 19th year he published a direct and geometrical method of finding the eccentricities and aphelia of the orbits of the planets; and in the year following he undertook a voyage to St Helena, with a view to form a catalogue of the stars in the southern hemisphere. The station was unfortunately chosen, for, owing to the incessant rains and foggy atmosphere of that island, he was able to determine the places of only 360 stars in the course of a whole year. He had, however, the satisfaction of observing a transit of Mercury over the sun’s disk, a phenomenon which suggested to him the important idea, that the transits of the inferior planets might be advantageously employed in determining one of the most essential elements of the planetary system, viz., the parallax of the sun, and consequently the diameters of the orbits. The method has since been successfully employed in the case of Venus: the transits of Mercury, though much more frequent, are not so well adapted to the purpose. The other additions which he made to astronomical knowledge are chiefly recorded in his Synopsis Astronomiae Cometicoe, — a work abounding in profound and original views, and which, in respect of theory, formed perhaps the most remarkable accession to the science that had been made since the time of Kepler. In this work he revived an ancient opinion, that the comets belong to the solar system, and move in very eccentric orbits round the sun, returning after stated but long intervals. He also ventured to predict that the comet of 1681 would again return to its perihelion in 1759,—the first prediction of the kind ever verified. In 1720 Halley was appointed to succeed Flamsteed in the Royal Observatory; and though then in the 64th year of his age, he undertook, with a view to improve the lunar theory, to observe the moon through a whole revolution of her nodes, erroneously supposing that after such a revolution the errors of the tables would again appear in the same order. He was the first who, by a comparison of ancient and modern observations, remarked the acceleration of the mean motion of the moon, and thus called the attention of mathematicians to an important and curious phenomenon, the physical cause of which was at length detected by the powerful analysis of Laplace. He was also the first who pointed out the secular inequalities of Jupiter and Saturn, occasioned by their mutual perturbations,—a theory that formed the subject of several profound memoirs of Euler and Lagrange, and for the complete development of which astronomy is likewise indebted to Laplace. (See Halley.)

The discoveries of Bradley, who succeeded Halley as astronomer royal, form a memorable epoch in the history of the science. It was reserved to him to give the theoretical explanation of a singular motion of the polar star which had been first observed by Picard, who had remarked that the inequality was annual, and amounted to about 40 seconds, but had been unable to refer it to any law. Hooke, in 1674, a few years after the observations of Picard, imagined that he had discovered a parallax in some of the stars; and Flamsteed, following the ideas of Hooke, explained, by means of parallax, the minute changes of position which he had observed in Polaris and some circumpolar stars. Manfredi and Cassini demonstrated the error of Flamsteed, but were not more successful in their attempts to explain the motion in question. Samuel Molyneux conceived the idea of verifying all that had been said respecting the supposed parallaxes, and for this purpose commenced a series of observations at Kew, with an excellent 24-feet sector constructed by Graham. Bradley, who happened at that time to reside at Kew, took part in these observations, the result of which was, that the remarks of Picard were confirmed beyond the possibility of doubt. It was, however, abundantly evident that the apparent motions observed were not connected in any manner with parallax; it therefore became an object of the greatest interest to determine their physical cause, and assign their law and period. The first idea that occurred was to inquire whether they arose from a change of position in the earth’s axis; but this supposition was found to be inadequate to the explanation of the phenomena. Molyneux having been in the meantime appointed a lord of the Admiralty, the observations were discontinued at Kew; they were, however, shortly after resumed by Bradley at Wanstead, with a smaller but more convenient instrument; and after they had been continued several years, it was [9:2:757] found that the star (γ Draconis) on which they were principally made, appeared to describe annually a small ellipse, the transverse axis of which amounted to 40". This was an important determination; for the ellipse afforded the means of computing at all times the aberration of any star whatever, whether in longitude, latitude, declination, or right ascension. Bradley also pointed out the physical cause of the aberration, and demonstrated that it resulted from the combination of the motion of light with the annual motion of the earth. This very remarkable and important discovery was made in 1728.

Bradley, anxious to verify his ingenious theory, continued his observations, and soon felt the difficulty that had so much embarrassed Picard. The places of the stars, calculated according to his formula for the aberration, could not be reconciled with the observations. The errors continued to augment during nine years, after which they went on diminishing during the nine years following. This inequality, of which the period, like that of the nodes of the moon, was 18 years, was readily explained by supposing a slight oscillation of the earth’s axis, occasioned by the action of the moon on the protuberant parts surrounding the equator of the terrestrial spheroid. After assiduously observing its effects during twenty years, Bradley found that the phenomena could be accurately represented by giving the pole of the equator a retrograde motion about its mean place in an ellipse whose axes are 18" and 16", and completing its revolution in the period of 18 years. This result was communicated to the Royal Society in 1748. To these tw o grand discoveries of Bradley, the aberration and nutation, modern astronomy is greatly indebted for its accuracy and precision; and as Delambre remarks, they assure to their author a distinguished place, after Hipparchus and Kepler, among the astronomers of all ages and all countries. For the biography see Bradley, James.

While England was witnessing the brilliant discoveries of Bradley, France produced a number of excellent astronomers, by whose successful labours every department of the science -was signally promoted. Among these Lacaille is distinguished, both by his scientific zeal and the importance of his observations. In 1751 he undertook a voyage to the Cape of Good Hope, the primary objects of which were to determine the sun’s parallax, by means of observations of the parallaxes of Mars and Venus, while similar observations were made in Europe, and to form a catalogue of the southern circumpolar stars. No undertaking for the benefit of science was ever more successfully executed. In the course of a single year, Lacaille, without assistance, observed upwards of 10,000 stars, situated between the tropic of Capricorn and the pole, and computed the places of 1942 of them. The details of his observations were published in the Caelum Australe Stelliferum, which appeared in 1763. During the same time he measured a degree of the meridian, and made numerous observations of the moon simultaneous with those of Lalande (who observed at Berlin), in order to determine the moon’s parallax by means of direct observations made at the extremities of a meridional arc of upwards of 85°. Astronomy is likewise indebted to Lacaille for a table of refractions, which he computed from a comparison of above 300 observations made at the Cape and at Paris. In 1757 he published his Astronomiae Fundamenta, in which he gave rules and tables for computing the apparent motions of the stars, which continued to be employed till Lambert supplied the corrections depending on the nutation, and Delambre those depending on the aberration.

The question of the figure of the earth furnished ample materials for the practical as well as the speculative astronomer during the 18th century. The results of the measurement of the meridian by Cassini were at variance with the theories of Newton and Huyghens; and the Academy of Sciences resolved on making a decisive experiment by the actual measurement of the lengths of two degrees, one at the equator, and another in as high a latitude as could be reached. In the year 1735, three astronomers—Godin, Bouguer, and La Condamine—were commissioned by the French Government to accomplish the first of these objects in Peru; and the year following, Maupertuis, Clairaut, Camus, and Lemonnier went, to Lapland to execute the second under the polar circle. Notwithstanding the greater difficulties they had to contend with, the first party were the more successful; but the result of both operations established the compression of the earth at the poles. Bouguer published the details of the Peruvian measurement in an admirable work On the Figure of the Earth, in which he has also inserted an account of a great number of experiments made by him in the same country to determine the length of the seconds’ pendulum, and the effects of the attraction of mountains on the plumb-line. Bouguer is likewise the author of an excellent treatise on light. The details of the labours of numerous other observers in the various countries of Europe will be found under their respective names. Here it is sufficient to indicate briefly the share each had in the development of the science.

Delisle formed a school of astronomy in Russia, ana left a method of computing the heliocentric places of the sun’s spots and of Mercury and Venus in their transits over the sun’s disk, and likewise of determining, by means of the stereographic projection, the directions of their paths when they enter and leave the disk. Wargentin, secretary of the Academy of Sciences of Stockholm, devoted himself specially to the correction of the tables of the satellites of Jupiter. The theory of the satellites was not then far advanced; but when theory failed him, he profited by the remarks of others and by his own reflections, and endeavoured by repeated trials to find empirical equations capable of reconciling the tables with the best observations. By confining himself almost exclusively to this subject he acquired a high reputation, and was ranked among the first astronomers of an epoch which abounds in great names. His tables of the satellites have, on account of their superior accuracy, been employed in determining the masses and other elements, which serve as the basis of the analytical theories.

Maskelyne, the second English astronomer royal after Bradley, was appointed, in 1761, to observe the transit of Venus at the island of St Helena, and endeavour to verify the existence of a small parallax of the star Sirius, "which seemed to be indicated by the observations of Lacaille at the Cape. Unfortunately, the state of the weather prevented him from observing the transit; and his observations on Sirius were abandoned in consequence of the discovery of a defect in the zenith sector which he had carried out with him for the purpose of making the observations in question. The main objects of his voyage were thus frustrated; but some indirect advantages, notably the improvement of the sector by Ramsden, resulted from it, which compensated in some measure for the disappointment. At St Helena he made several interesting observations of the tides, the variation of the compass, the moon’s horary parallaxes, &c. In going out and returning home he paid particular attention to the different methods of finding the longitude at sea, and practised that which depends on observations of the lunar distances from known stars, taken with Hadley’s sextant, or some other reflecting instrument. In the year 1765 he was appointed astronomer royal, and soon after recommended to the Board of Longitude the general adoption in the navy of the lunar [9:2:758] method of finding the longitude, and proposed that tables for facilitating that method should be calculated and published in the Nautical Almanac. This recommendation was adopted, and the Nautical Almanac continued to be published under his superintendence during forty-eight successive years.

Sir William Herschel, born in Hanover in 1738, has rendered his name immortal by the discovery of a new planet beyond the orbit of Saturn, and thereby doubling the ancient boundaries of the solar system. Having settled in England at Bath, he began to devote his leisure to the construction of telescopes and the polishing of reflecting mirrors. Endowed with equal skill and patience, he soon obtained instruments superior to any that had been known before, by means of which he was led to the most brilliant discoveries that have been made in the heavens since the time of Galileo. Being employed in making a review of the sky with a powerful telescope, he perceived, on the 13th of March 1781, near the feet of Gemini, a star of the fifth magnitude, having a disk perfectly well defined, and differing in appearance from other stars which afforded the same quantity of light. On observing it with a telescope whose magnifying power was 932, he perceived its diameter was enlarged while that of the stars underwent no change. These circumstances were sufficient to draw his attention to the star, and nothing more was requisite to enable him speedily to discover that it had a slow motion. He at first supposed it was a comet, and acquainted Dr Maskelyne with the discovery. The circumstance was soon made known at Paris; and it was gradually perceived, that as the distance of the star did not sensibly vary, it was necessary to regard it as a seventh planet. Herschel, in honour of his patron George III., gave it the name of the Georgium Sidus ; but the mythological appellation of Uranus has prevailed. On the 11th of January 1787 he discovered two satellites revolving round the new planet, and subsequently found that it was accompanied by four others. It was soon noticed that Uranus had been observed by Flamsteed, Mayer, and Lemonnier, who had each supposed it to be one of the fixed stars. Their observations enabled Delambre to correct the elements of the orbit, and calculate tables of its motion. By means of his powerful telescopes Herschel determined the figure and rotation of Saturn, discovered the parallel belts on his surface, and perceived that the ring is double. In 1789 he discovered two new satellites belonging to this planet, revolving near the ring. From some appearances indicated by the fixed stars, Herschel was led to conclude that the whole solar system is in motion about some distant centre, and that its direction is at present towards the constellation Hercules,—a conclusion which recent investigations have verified. His observations on nebulae and double stars opened up a new field of research, boundless in extent, and interesting by reason of the variety of the objects it presents to the attention of the observer. The extraordinary activity with which he pursued his favourite occupations is attested by 67 memoirs communicated by him from time to time to the Royal Society.

Few individuals have contributed so much to the perfection of modern astronomy as Delambre, for many years perpetual secretary of the Academy of Sciences. Associated with Mechain, he was employed during the troubles of the French Revolution in measuring the meridian from Dunkirk to Barcelona,—a labour which was prosecuted with admirable zeal in the face of innumerable difficulties, and even dangers of the most formidable kind. By an immense number of excellent observations he determined the constants which enter into the formulae deduced from theory by the profound researches of Lagrange and Laplace, and also formed a set of tables much more exact than any that had appeared before them. His Astronomie Théorique et Pratique, in three quarto volumes, contains the best rules and methods which have yet been devised for the guidance of the practical astronomer; and his Histoire, in six large quarto volumes, gives an account of every successive improvement which has been made in the science, and a full abstract of every work of celebrity which has been written respecting it, from the first rude observations of the Greeks to the end of the last century. It is invaluable to the historian, and will always attest the profound learning and laborious research of its author.

The observatory which was established at Palermo about the year 1790, under the active superintendence of Piazzi, holds a distinguished rank among the similar institutions of Europe. Piazzi, born in 1746, took the habit of the religious order of the Theatins at Milan, and finished his noviciate in the convent of St Anthony. Among his preceptors he had the advantage of counting Tiraboschi, Beccaria, Le Soeur, and Jacquier; and from these illustrious masters he speedily acquired a taste for mathematics and astronomy. After holding several professorships in the colleges of the Jesuits at Rome and Ravenna, he was appointed, in 1780, professor of the higher mathematics in the Academy of Palermo. A few years after his appointment he obtained from the prince of Caramanico, viceroy of the island, permission to found an observatory, and undertook a voyage to France and England in order to provide the instruments necessary for the new establishment. Having procured a vertical circle, a transit, and some other instruments from Ramsden, he returned to Palermo and commenced his observations. His first care was to prepare a new catalogue of stars, the exact positions of which he justly considered as the basis of all true astronomy. In prosecuting this object he did not content himself with a single observation, but before he fixed the position of any star, observed it several times successively; and, by this laborious but accurate method, he constructed his first great catalogue of 6748 stars, which was crowned by the Academy of Sciences of France, and received with admiration by the astronomers of all countries. His constant practice of repeating his observations led to another brilliant result, the discovery of an eighth planet. On the 1st of January 1891, Piazzi, searching for the star 87 of the catalogue of Mayer, cursorily observed a small star of the eighth magnitude between Aries and Taurus. On the following day he remarked that the star had changed its position, and accordingly supposed it to be a comet. He communicated his observations to Oriani, who, seeing that this luminous point had no nebulosity like the comets, and that it had been stationary and retrograded within comparatively small limits like the planets, computed its elements on the hypothesis of a circular orbit. He found that this hypothesis agreed with the observations, and other astronomers soon confirmed its accuracy. He gave the planet the name of Geres Ferdinandea, in honour of Ferdinand, king of Naples, in whose dominions he had made the discovery, and who proposed to commemorate the event by a gold medal, struck with the effigy of the astronomer; but Piazzi, preferring the interests of science to vain honours which could add nothing to his glory, requested that the money destined for this purpose should be employed in the purchase of an equatorial, which was still wanting to his observatory. In 1814 he published a new catalogue, extended to 7646 stars,—a splendid monument of indefatigable zeal and activity. He made an uninterrupted series of solstitial observations from 1791 to 1816, for the purpose of determining the obliquity of the ecliptic, which, compared with those of Bradley, Mayer, and Lacaille, in 1750, give a diminution of 44" in a year.

We will conclude this part of the article by briefly [9:2:759] adverting to the researches of some illustrious mathematicians who have developed the theory of Newton, and by whose investigations physical astronomy has been raised to its present position. Although the law of gravitation, as proposed by Newton, had from the first been admitted by all the most eminent astronomers of Britain, it was for a long time either opposed or neglected on the Continent. In fact, great improvements were required both in analysis and mechanics before it admitted of other applications than had been made by its great author, or could be regarded as anything more than a plausible hypothesis. Newton demonstrated that if two bodies only were projected in space, mutually attracting each other with forces proportional directly to their masses and inversely to the squares of their distance, they would each accurately describe an ellipse round the common centre of gravity; and the spaces described by the straight line joining that centre and the moving body would be proportional to the time of description, according to the second law of Kepler. But when it is attempted to apply Newton’s law to the case of the solar system, great difficulties immediately present themselves. Any one planet in the system is not only attracted by the sun, but also, though in a much smaller degree, by all the other planets, in consequence of which it is compelled to deviate from the elliptic path which it would pursue in virtue of the sun’s attraction alone. Now, the calculation of the effects of this disturbing force was the problem which geometers had to resolve. In its most general form it greatly transcends the power of analysis; but there are particular cases of it (and those, too, the cases presented by nature), in which, by reason of certain limitations in the conditions, it is possible to obtain an approximate solution to any required degree of exactness. For example, the Sun, Moon, and Earth form in a manner a system by themselves, which is very slightly affected by the aggregate attractions of the other planets. In the same way the Sun, Jupiter, and Saturn, form another system, in which the motions are very little influenced by the action of any other body. In these two cases, then, the number of bodies to be taken into consideration is only three; and in this restricted form, the problem, celebrated in the history of analysis under the denomination of “the Problem of Three Bodies,” is susceptible of being treated mathematically. With the hope of improving the lunar tables, and of completing the investigations which Newton had commenced in the Principia, three distinguished geometers—Clairaut, D’Alembert, and Euler—about the middle of the last century, undertook, simultaneously, and without the knowledge of each other, the investigation of the problem of three bodies, and commenced that series of brilliant discoveries which our own times have seen completed. .

Clairaut’s solution of the problem of three bodies was presented to the Academy of Sciences in 1747, and was applied to the case of the moon. From this solution he deduced with great facility, not only the inequality of the variation, which Newton had obtained by the application of a more complicated though very ingenious method, but also the evection, the annual equation, and many other inequalities which Newton had not succeeded in connecting with his theory. It happened, however, curiously enough, that in the calculation of one effect of the disturbing force, namely, the progression of the moon’s apogee, Clairaut was led into an error which produced a result that threatened to overturn the system of gravitation. The error consisted in the omission of some of the terms of the series expressing the quantity in question, which he wrongly supposed to have only an insensible value; and by reason of this omission, his first approximation gave only half of tho observed progressive motion of the apogee. As this result was confirmed by D’Alembert and Euler, who had both fallen into the same error, it seemed to follow, as a necessary consequence, either that the phenomenon depended on some other cause than the disturbing force of the sun, or that the law of gravitation was not exactly proportional to the inverse square of the distance. The triumph which this result gave to the Cartesians was not of long duration. Clairaut soon perceived the cause of his error; and by repeating the process, and carrying the approximations farther, he found the computed to agree exactly with the observed progression,—a result which had the effect of dissipating for ever all doubt respecting the law of gravitation. The researches of Clairaut were followed by a set of lunar tables, much more correct than any which had been previously computed.

The return of the comet of 1G82, which Halley had predicted for the end of 1758 or beginning of 1759, afforded an excellent opportunity for putting to the test both the theory of gravitation and the power of the new calculus. Clairaut applied his solution of the problem of three bodies to the perturbations which this comet sustained from Jupiter and Saturn, and, after calculations of enormous labour, announced to the Academy of Sciences, in November 1758, that the comet would return in the beginning of the following year, and pass through its perihelion about the 15th of April. It returned according to the prediction, but passed its perihelion on the 13th of March. The correction of an error of computation reduced the difference to nineteen days; and if Clairaut had been aware of the existence of the planet Uranus, he might have come still nearer the truth.

Besides these important researches on the system of the universe, Clairaut composed an admirable little treatise on the figure of the earth, in which he gave the differential equations, till then unknown, of the equilibrium of fluids, whether homogeneous or heterogeneous, supposing an attractive force, following any law whatever, to exist among the molecules. He applied these equations to the earth; demonstrated that the elliptic figure satisfies the conditions of equilibrium; and assigned the ellipticity of the different strata of which the earth may be supposed to be formed, together with the law of gravitation at the exterior surface. He likewise discovered the important theorem which establishes a relation between the oblateness of the terrestrial spheroid and the increase of gravitation towards the poles, on every supposition which can be imagined relative to the interior construction of the earth. By means of this theorem the ellipticity of the spheroid is deduced from observations of the lengths of the seconds pendulum at different points of the earth’s surface.

D’Alembert, as has already been mentioned, presented a solution of the problem of three bodies to the Academy of Sciences at the same time as Clairaut. In the year 1749 he published his treatise on the precession of the equinoxes,— a work remarkable in the history of analysis and mechanics. By means of his newly invented “Calculus of Partial Differences,” and the discovery of a fertile principle in dynamics, he determined from theory the rate of the precession, rather more than 50" in a year. He also determined the nutation of the earth’s axis, which had been discovered by Bradley, and assigned the ratio of the axes of the small ellipse which the true pole of the earth describes around its mean place in the same time in which the nodes of the lunar orbit complete a revolution. The solution of this problem led to the determination of the ratio of the attractive forces of the sun and moon, which D’Alembert found to be that of seven to three very nearly; whence he inferred that the mass of the earth is 70 times greater than that of the moon. He proved likewise that the precession and nutation are the same in every hypothesis[9:2:760] concerning the interior constitution of the earth. In 1754 he published the first two volumes of his liesearches on the System of the World. In this work he applied the formulae by which he had calculated the motions of the moon to the motions of the planets disturbed by their mutual attraction, and pointed out the simplest method of determining the perturbations of the motions of a planet occasioned by the action of its own satellites. D’Alembert also treated the subject of the figure of the earth in a much more general manner than had been done by Clairaut, who had confined his investigations to the case of a spheroid of revolution. He determined the attraction of a spheroid of small eccentricity, whose surface can be represented by an algebraic equation of any order whatever, even supposing the spheroid to be composed of strata of different densities.

The first memoir of Euler on the planetary perturbations was transmitted to the secretary of the Academy of Sciences in July 1747, some months before Clairaut and D’Alembert had communicated their solutions of the problem of three bodies, and it carried off the prize which the academy had offered for the analytical theory of the motions of Jupiter and Saturn. In this memoir Euler gave the differential equations of the elements of the disturbed planet, but withheld the analysis by which he had been conducted to them. This analysis, however, he subsequently expanded in two memoirs, the first of which appeared in the Berlin Memoirs in 1749, and the second in those of St Petersburg in 1750. Of these supplementary memoirs the first is remarkable on several accounts. It contains the first example of a method which has been fruitful of important consequences—namely, that of the variation of the arbitrary constants in differential equations, and the development of the radical quantity which expresses the distance between two planets in a series of angles, multiples of the elongations. The expressions which he gave for the several terms of this series were simple and elegant; and he demonstrated a curious relation subsisting among any three consecutive terms, by means of which all the terms of the series may be calculated from the first two. He was thus enabled to develop the perturbing forces in terms of the sines and cosines of angles increasing with the time, and thereby to surmount a very great analytical difficulty. Notwithstanding, however, the great merit of Euler’s memoir, several of the formulae expressing the secular and periodic inequalities were found to be inaccurate; and in order to procure a correction of these errors, and give greater perfection to so important a theory, the academy again proposed the same subject for the prize of 1752. This prize was also carried off by Euler. In the memoir which he presented on this occasion, he considered simultaneously the motions of Jupiter and Saturn, and determined, in the first instance, the amount of their various inequalities, independently of the consideration of the eccentricities of their orbits. Pushing the approximations farther, and having regard to the inequalities depending on the eccentricities, he arrived at a most important result relative to the periodic nature of the inequalities occasioned by the mutual perturbations of the planets; which laid the foundation of the subsequent discovery by Lagrange and Laplace of the permanent stability of the planetary system. He demonstrated that the eccentricities and places of the apheliaof Jupiter and Saturn are subject to constant variation, which is confined, however, within certain fixed limits; and he computed that the elements of the orbits of the two planets recover their original values after a lapse of about 30,000 years. In the year 1756 the Academy of Sciences crowned a third memoir of Euler on the same subject as the two former, namely, the inequalities of the motions of the planets produced by their reciprocal attractions. This memoir analytically considered is also of great value. The method which he followed and illustrated has since been generally adopted in researches of the same nature, and consists in regarding as variable, in consequence of the disturbing forces, the six elements of the elliptic motion, viz.,—lsi, the major axis of the orbit, which, by the law of Kepler, gives the ratio of the differential of the mean longitude to the element of the time; 2<Z, the epoch of this longitude; 3cZ, the eccentricity of the orbit; ⅛th, the motion of the aphelion; 5th, the inclination of the orbit to a given fixed plane; and, Gth, the longitude of the node. By considering separately the variations introduced into each of these elements by the disturbing forces, Euler obtained some important results; but even in this memoir his theory was not rendered complete. He did not consider the variation of the epoch; and the expression which he gave for the motion of the aphelion did not include that part of it which depends on the ratio of the eccentricities of the orbits of the disturbed and disturbing planet. Besides, the third memoir, liko the two former, contained several errors of computation, which, by leading to results known to be wrong, probably-prevented the author himself from being aware of the full value of the ingenious methods of procedure which he had described. Euler concluded this important memoir by making an extended application of his formulae to the orbit of the earth as disturbed by the action of the planets. From some probable suppositions, first employed by Newton, relative to the ratios of the masses of the planets to that of the sun, he determined the variation of the obliquity of the ecliptic at 48" in a century,—a result which agrees well with observation. By this determination the secular variation of the obliquity of the ecliptic, which had been regarded by Lahire, Lemonnier, D’Alembert, and other eminent astronomers as uncertain, was placed beyond doubt. The three memoirs which we have mentioned contain the principal part of Euler’s labours on the perturbations; but physical astronomy is indebted to him for many other researches. He gave a solution of the problem of the precession of the equinoxes, and made several important steps in the lunar theory, with which he seems to have occupied himself before he undertook the investigation of the planetary perturbations. In the year 1772, when entirely blind, he directed his son, Albert Euler, and twα illustrious pupils, Krafft and Lexell, in the composition of a work of enormous labour on the same subject, which was undertaken with a view to discover the cause of the moon’s acceleration. This work was concluded with a set of lunar tables deduced entirely from theory; but they were found to be far inferior to those of Mayer, and in some respects hardly equal to those of Clairaut.

The first theory of Euler formed the basis of the excellent lunar tables which were calculated by Tobias Mayer, and first published in the Memoirs of the Academy of Göttingen in 1753. Mayer was a skilful astronomer, and determined the co-efficients of the arguments of the different lunar inequalities from his own observations. He continued to correct and improve his tables till the time of his death, which happened in 1762, when a copy of them, containing his last corrections, was presented by his widow to the Board of Longitude in London. They were printed along with the author’s lunar theory in 1765. Subsequently, the Board of Longitude directed Mason, who had been assistant to Bradley, to revise them, under the superintendence of Dr Maskelyne. Mason compared them with about 1200 of Bradley’s observations, corrected the coefficients of Mayer, and introduced some new equations which had been indicated by that astronomer, but -which he had considered as too uncertain, or of too small a value, to render it necessary to load his tables with them.
[9:2:761]

Mayer’s tables, thus corrected, were published in 1784, Λ∏d for a long time continued to be the most accurate that had appeared.

The solution of the problem of three bodies by Clairaut, D’Alembert, and Euler, gave rise to many other important works relative to the theory of the moon, into the merits of which, however, our limits will not permit us to enter. Thomas Simpson, Walmesley, Frisi, Lambert, Schulze, and Matthew Stewart treated the subject with more or less success; but the complete explication of the theory of the lunar and planetary perturbations was reserved for two mathematicians, whose discoveries perfected the theory of gravitation, aud explained the last inequalities which remained to be accounted for in the celestial motions,—Lagrange and Laplace.

In the year 1764, the Academy of Sciences of Paris, which had so successfully promoted the great efforts that had already been made to perfect the theory of attraction, proposed for the subject of a prize the theory of the libration of the moon. Lagrange had the honour of carrying off the prize; but although he treated the subject in a manner altogether new, and with extraordinary analytical skill, he did not on this occasion arrive at a complete solution of the problem. In 1766 he obtained another prize for a theory of Jupiter’s satellites. In the admirable memoir which Lagrange presented to the academy on this subject, he included in the differential equations of the disturbed motion of a satellite the attracting force of the sun, as well as of all the other satellites, and thus, in fact, had to consider a problem of six bodies. His analysis of this problem is remarkable, inasmuch as it contained the first general method which was given for determining the variations which the mutual attractions of the satellites produce in the forms and positions of their orbits, and pointed out the plan which has since been so successfully followed in the treatment of similar questions.

Of all the grand discoveries by which the name of Lagrange has been immortalised, the most remarkable is that of the invariability of the mean distances of the planets from the sun. We have already mentioned that Euler had perceived that the inequalities of Jupiter and Saturn, in consequence of their mutual actions, are ultimately compensated, though after a very long period. In prosecuting this subject, which Euler had left imperfect, Laplace had discovered that, on neglecting the fourth powers in the expressions of the eccentricities and inclinations of the orbits and the squares of the disturbing masses, the mean motions of the planets and their mean distances from the sun are invariable. In a short memoir of 14 pages, -which appeared among those of the Berlin Academy for 1776, Lagrange demonstrated generally, and by a very simple and luminous analysis, that whatever powers of the eccentricities and inclinations are included in the calculation of the perturbations, no secular inequality, or term proportional to the time, can possibly enter into the expression of the greater axis of the orbit, or, consequently, into the mean motion connected with it by the third law of Kepler. From this conclusion, which is a necessary consequence of the peculiar conditions of the planetary system, it results that all the changes to which the orbits of the planets are subject in consequence of their reciprocal gravitation, are periodic, and that the system contains within itself no principle of destruction, but is calculated to endure for ever.

In 1780 Lagrange undertook a second time the subject of the moon’s libration; and it is to the memoir which he now presented to the Berlin Academy that we must look for the complete and rigorous solution of this difficult problem, which had not been resolved before in a satisfactory manner, either on the footing of analysis or observation. In the same year he obtained the prize of the Academy of Sciences on the subject of the perturba tions of comets. In 1781 he published, in the Berlin Memoirs, the first of a series of five papers on the seculaι and periodic inequalities of the planets, which together formed by far the most important work that had yet appeared on physical astronomy since the publication of the Principia. This series did not, properly speaking, contain any new discovery, but it embodied and brought into one view all the results and peculiar analytical methods which had appeared in his former memoirs, and contained the germs of all the happy ideas which he afterwards developed in the Mécanique Analytique.

On account of the brilliant discoveries and important labours which we have thus briefly noticed, Lagrange must be considered as one of the most successful of those illustrious men who have undertaken to perfect the theory of Newton, and pursue the principle of gravitation to its remotest consequences. But the value of his services to science is not limited to his discoveries in physical astronomy, great and numerous as these were. After Euler, he has contributed more than any other to increase the power and extend the applications of the calculus, and thereby to arm future inquirers with an instrument of greater efficiency, by means of which they may push their conquests into new and unexplored fields of discovery.

With the name of Lagrange is associated that of Laplace, their rival labours dividing the admiration of the scientific world during half a century. Like Newton and Lagrange, Laplace raised himself at an early age to the very highest rank in science. Before completing his 24th year, he had signalised himself by the important discovery of the invariability of the mean distances of the planets from the sun, on an hypothesis restricted, indeed, but which, as we have already mentioned, was afterwards generalised by Lagrange. About the same time he was admitted into the Academy of Sciences, and thenceforward devoted himself to the development of the laws which regulate the system of the world, and to the composition of a series of memoirs on the most important subjects connected with astronomy and analysis. His researches embraced the whole theory of gravitation; and he had the high honour of perfecting what had been left incomplete by his predecessors.

Among the numerous inequalities which affect the motion of the moon, one still remained which no philosopher as yet had been able to explain. This was the acceleration of the mean lunar motion, which had been first suspected by Halley, from a comparison of the ancient Babylonian observations, recorded by Hipparchus, with those of Alba-tegni and the moderns. The existence of the acceleration had been confirmed by Dunthorne and Mayer, and its quantity assigned at 10" in a century, but the cause of it remained doubtful. Lagrange demonstrated that it could not be occasioned by any peculiarity in the form of the earth; Bossut ascribed it to the resistance of the medium in which he supposed the moon to move; and Laplace himself at first explained it on the supposition that gravity is not transmitted from one body to another instantaneously, but successively, in the manner of sound or light. Having afterwards remarked, however, in the course of his researches on Jupiter’s satellites, that the secular variation of the eccentricity of the orbit of Jupiter occasions a secular variation of the mean moticns cf the satellites, he hastened to transfer this result to the moon, and had the satisfaction to find that the acceleration observed by astronomers is occasioned by the secular variation of the eccentricity of the terrestrial orbit. This conclusion has, however, been partly invalidated by the recent researches of Adams of Cambridge.
[9:2:762]

Another discover}’ relative to the constitution of the planetary system, which does infinite honour to the sagacity of Laplace, is the cause of the secular inequalities indicated by ancient and modern observations in the mean motions of Jupiter and Saturn. On examining the differential equations of the motions of these planets, Laplace remarked, that as their mean motions are nearly commensurable (five times the mean motion of Saturn being nearly equal to twice that of Jupiter), those terms of which the arguments are five times the mean longitude of Saturn, minus twice that of Jupiter, may become very sensible by integration, although multiplied by the cubes and products of three dimensions of the eccentricities and inclinations of the orbits. The result of a laborious calculation confirmed his conjecture, and showed him that in the mean motion of Saturn there existed a great inequality, amounting at its maximum to 48' 2"*3, and of which the period is 929 years; and that in the case of Jupiter there exists a corresponding inequality of nearly the same period, of which the maximum value is 19' 46", but which is affected by a contrary sign, that is to say, it diminishes while the first increases, and vice versa. He also perceived that the magnitude of the co-efficients of these inequalities, and the duration of their periods, are not always the same, but participate in the secular variations of the elements of the orbit.

The theory of the figures of the planets, scarcely less interesting than that of their motions, was ajso greatly advanced by the researches of Laplace. He confirmed the results of Clairaut, Maclaurin, and D’Alembert, relative to the figure of the earth, and treated the question in a much more general way than had been done by those three great mathematicians. From two lunar inequalities depending on the non-sphericity of the earth, he determined the ellipticity of the meridian to be u ⅜ τ very nearly.

Newton, in the Principia, explained the cause of the phenomena of the tides, and laid the foundations of a theory which was prosecuted and extended by Daniel Bernouilli, Maclaurin, Euler, and D’Alembert; but as none of these geometers had taken into account the effects of the rotatory motion of the earth, the subject was in a great measure new when it was taken up by Laplace in 1774. Aided by D’Alembert’s recent discovery of the calculus of partial differences, and by an improved theory of hydrodynamics, he succeeded in obtaining the differential equations of the motion of the fluids which surround the earth, having regard to all the forces by which these motions are produced or modified, and published them in the memoirs of the academy in 1775. By a careful examination of these equations, he was led to the curious remark, that the differences between the heights of two consecutive tides about the time of the solstices, as indicated by Newton’s theory, are not owing, as Newton and his successors had supposed, to the inertia of the waters of the ocean, but depend on a totally different cause, namely, the law of the depth of the sea, and that it would disappear entirely if the sea were of a uniform and constant depth. He also arrived at the important conclusion, that the fluidity of the sea has no influence on the motions of the terrestrial axis, which are exactly the same as they would be if the sea formed a solid mass with the earth. The same analysis conducted him to the knowledge of the conditions necessary to ensure the permanent equilibrium of the waters of the ocean. He found that if the mean density of the earth exceeds that of the sea, the fluid, deranged by any causes whatever, from its state of equilibrium, will never depart from that state but by very small quantities. It follows from this, that, since the mean density of the earth is known to be about five times greater than that of the sea, the great changes which have taken place in the relative situation of the waters and dry land must be referred to other causes than the instability of the equilibrium of the ocean.

The chief steps in the progress of the study of tides since the time of Laplace have consisted in co-ordinating the results of observation, and analysing them into their partial phenomena, by the help of Newton’s and Bernouilli’s theory. This labour has been greatly advanced by Dr Whewell, and also by Sir John Lubbock. The former has constructed maps of “cotidal lines,’’ which, indicating the relative time of high water in different parts of the globe, give us a graphic conception of the course and propagation of the tidal wave. The tides of the Eastern Pacific are but little known; but a vast wave advances northwards between Australia and Africa, diverted or retarded by the obstacles it meets with in the Indian Archipelago. Another (and to us the most important) branch sets from south to north up the vast canal of the Atlantic, where it is gradually complicated by local tides, having their origin in the wide expanse between Africa and the Gulf of Mexico. The two sets of waves sometimes reinforce, sometimes oppose one another; they are prolonged to the western shores of England and Norway, where the tidal impulse arrives twenty-four hours after it passed the Cape of Good Hope. It is propagated most rapidly at a distance from coasts, and is retarded in narrows and shallows. It sends offshoots into every bay and strait, always greatly retarded in point of time (apparently by friction), but often increased in elevation by concentration of the effect in a gradually narrowing channel, as we see in the exaggerated tides of the river Amazon, the Severn, and the Bay of Fundy. The same place may be the seat of several tides at once, which may increase or destroy one another; thus, a small tide is propagated through the Straits of Dover as far as the Dutch coast, where it only arrives simultaneously with the principal wave, which has made the entire tour of Great Britain.

As regards the progress of theory, Dr Thomas Young, one of the greatest philosophers of this century, next after Laplace grappled with the difficulties of this arduous subject. Employing mathematical methods of inferior power but greater directness, and taking into account causes of local action which Laplace had not ventured to include in his analysis, he gradually matured a theory adequate to represent many of the results of experience, of which Laplace gives no account. He distinguishes the results of the forced and free oscillations of the sea: the former resulting from the direct action of the sun and moon combined with the rotation of the earth, and whose periods of rise and fall are determined solely by those external causes; the free waves, on the contrary, derived from the former, are transmitted with velocities depending on the mechanism of the fluid itself, on its depth, and on the resistances arising from friction to which those motions are exposed. These all-important modifications of the dynamical theory of the tides were deduced by Young from the general theory of oscillations and resistances, and from the laws of fluids detected by Du Buat, and he applied them with no ordinary skill to the solution of the problems of tides in oceans, estuaries, and rivers. It is satisfactory to find that by an independent and very different method Airy subsequently arrived at substantially the same results as Young.

Closely connected with the problem of the tides is that of the precession of the equinoxes, which also received similar improvements in passing through the hands of Laplace. He demonstrated, as has been mentioned, that the fluidity of the sea has no influence on the phenomena of precession and nutation. He considered some of the effects of the oblate figure of the earth which had not been [9:2:763] attended to by D’Alembert, and showed that the annual variation of the precession causes a corresponding variation in the length of the tropical year, which at present is about 9 or 10 seconds shorter than it was in the time of Hipparchus. He proved that the secular inequalities of the motions of the earth and moon have no sensible effect in displacing the axis of the earth’s rotation; and he determined the nutation of the lunar orbit corresponding to the nutation of the terrestrial equator.

Physical astronomy is also indebted to Laplace for a complete theory of the system of Jupiter’s satellites, from which Delambre constructed a set of tables representing the motions of these bodies with all desirable accuracy. And when to these numerous and most important researches we add the mathematical theories of molecular attraction, and the propagation of sound, together with many great improvements in analysis,—and reflect, besides, that he is the author of the Mécanique Céleste, the Système du Monde, and the Théorie des Probabilités, — we shall not hesitate to rank him next to Newton among the greatest benefactors of the mathematical and physical sciences.

By the brilliant discoveries of Laplace, the analytical solution of the great problem of physical astronomy was completed. The principle of gravitation, which had been found by Newton to confine the moon and the planets to their respective orbits, was shown to occasion every apparent irregularity, however minute, in the motions of the planets and satellites; and those very irregularities which were at first brought forward as objections to the hypothesis have been ultimately found to afford the most triumphant proofs of its accuracy, and have placed the truth of the Newtonian law beyond the reach of all future cavil. Such is the state to which analysis has now attained, that the geometer embraces iu his formulae every circumstance which affects the motions or positions of the different bodies of the planetary system; and the conditions of that system being made known to him at any given instant of time, he can determine its conditions at any other instant in the past or future duration of the world. He ascends to remote ages to compare the results of his theories with the most ancient observations; he passes on to ages yet to come, and predicts changes which the lapse of centuries will hardly be sufficient to render sensible to the observer. But notwithstanding the comparative perfection to which the theory of astronomy has been brought, it is still far from having reached the limit beyond which further refinement becomes superfluous. The masses of the planets, and some other elements, remain to be determined with still greater precision, by a diligent comparison of the analytical formulae with good observations; and the labours of the geometer may still be beneficially employed in giving greater simplicity to the calculus, or in extending its power over subjects which have hitherto eluded its grasp. The observation of periodic comets that complete their revolutions in comparatively short intervals of time, 0pen3 up an interesting field for speculation and research, and will doubtless be the means of throwing light on some curious and as yet very obscure points, respecting the appearances, motions, and physical constitution of those strange bodies.

In the other departments of astronomy, also, numerous questions still remain to be discussed, the solution of which will occupy and reward the future labours of astronomers, and in which much progress has been made during the present century, by means of the powerful instruments now employed at the great observatories of every civilised country, and the improved methods of analysis brought to bear upon the results of observation. The curious phenomena of double and multiple stars, some of which are found to form connected systems of bodies revolving about one another, or a common centre of motion,—the variable stars,—the proper motions of the stars,—the translation of the solar system in space,—the progressive condensation of nebulae,—are subjects still in a great measure new: for it is only of late years that observers have begun to direct the requisite attention towards them, or indeed have been in possession of instruments of sufficient power and delicacy to observe and measure the minute changes which take place beyond the boundaries of our own system. The discoveries in astronomy during the present century have been so brilliant and numerous, and the progress in every department is so rapid, and involves so many details, that it would be impossible to give here a detailed account of that progress. Moreover, there is a reason for not attempting this, in the circumstance that we have brought the history of our subject as far as is possible without considering the work of men still living. For although some to whom the astronomy of the present day is indebted, and not a few who must always be regarded as among the leading astronomers of the century, have passed away, yet the consideration even of their work would necessarily introduce the discussion of the labours of those whose labours are still in progress. It seems on all accounts better, therefore, to content ourselves with the discussion of the various results obtained during recent years, without attempting the invidious task of apportioning to the several workers their relative positions.

Paet II.— Theoretical Astronomy. Chapter I.— Apparent Motion of the Star-sphere.

When we look at the heavens on a clear night, we perceive a concave hemisphere on which are strewn multitudes of bright points. As we watch these hour after hour, we find that they are carried round precisely as though they were fixed on the interior surface of a spherical shell turning on a fixed axis. New groups are seen to rise above the eastern horizon, while those above the western horizon descend and finally disappear. Turning towards the south, we see that the groups of stars which pass above the horizon Somewhat to the east of the south attain but a slight elevation when at their highest in the south, and then descending set as far to the west of the south point as they had risen to the east of it. Turning to the north, we see that there are groups of stars which remain visible the whole night, wheeling around a fixed point, and describing circles of greater or less magnitude according as they are at a greater or less distance from that point. Supposing our stand point to be in or near London, the point thus remaining fixed is due north, and about 51∣ 0 above the horizon,—therefore, about 38⅜ 0 from the point directly overhead. If the heavens be observed night after night, similar phenomena are seen; and we recognise the uniformity of the motion of the (imaginary) star-sphere about its (imaginary) axis; for in any assigned interval, on any night in the year, the star-sphere turns by the same amount. It is soon found that the rate of turning is such that a complete rotation is effected in the course of about one day. But before many days have passed we find that this uniform turning motion does not correspond exactly to our common day. For though on several successive nights the stars may appear to be nearly in the same situation with respect to the horizon at any assigned hour, yet before long (or even in twenty-four hours if exact observation be made) it is found that the stars occupy the same position, not at the same hour on successive nights, but about four minutes earlier night after night. Thus, in the course of about fifteen days, the star-sphere has gained one hour’s rotation; in about thirty days two hours’ rotation, and so on: until in the [9:2:764] course of a year the star-sphere has gained a complete rotation, and the stars have the same apparent position at any assigned hour of the night as they had when the observations were commenced.

Limiting our attention for the present to the stars,— though already, in speaking of the common day, we have in fact referred to the sun,—the idea suggested by the observed phenomena is that the apparent star-sphere revolves around the earth precisely as it seeme to do, turning about an axis, with a perfectly uniform motion, completing one rotation in twenty-four hours, less about four minutes. The natural steps for determining whether this really is the case, are—first, a series of careful observations at one fixed station; and, secondly, a study of the effects produced by change of station.

For the former purpose we require to adopt certain fixed points or circles on the concave hemisphere visible above the horizon, in order that we may refer the apparent motions to these points or circles as unmoving standards.

Let, then, NESW (fig. 1) represent the seemingly circular horizon line around the observer at O; N being the north point, S the south, E the east, and AV the west, so that the lines SON and WOE are at right angles to each other. Let Z be the point immediately overhead; and let P, so placed on the quadrant ZPN that PN is an arc of 51∣ o , be the apparently fixed point on the heavens already described, so that POP' is the imaginary axis about which the star-sphere appears to revolve. Then the points P and P' are called the poles of the heavens. P is distinguished as the visible pole from P', which is the invisible pole, for the station of the observer at 0; PP' is called the polar axis. The point Z immediately overhead, or geometrically defined by the fact that OZ is perpendicular to the plane of the horizon NESW, is called the zenith; and Z', the point in which ZO produced intersects the invisible hemisphere, is called the nadir. The line OZ is called the vertical. Any great circle of the sphere, whose plane passes through ZZ', as the circle SZNZ' or the circle EZWZ', is called a vertical circle. The vertical circle SZPNZ', which passes through the pole, is called the meridian circle, and its plane is called the meridian; because when the sun is on this circle it is true mid-day. The points N and S, in which the meridian circle meets the horizon, are called the north and south points of the horizon, the north point being distinguished from the south as being the extremity of the quadrant ZPN, on which is the visible pole P. (Reference is here made to the pole seen at the supposed station of the observer; that pole is the north pole of the heavens, and the north point of the horizon is N on the quadrant ZPN through the north pole.) The points N and S divide the horizon into halves, SEN, SWN—the former being the half along which the stars rise, the latter being the half along which they set. A vertical circle EZWZ', having its plane at right angles to the meridian, is called the prime vertical, and intersects the horizon in two points, E and W, called respectively th° east and west points of the horizon, the east being distinguished from the west as being on the part of the horizon crossed by rising stars, while the west is on the part crossed by setting stars.

Next, let EMWM' (fig. 2) represent the path of a star which rises due east. Then EMWM' is a circle whose plane passes through WOE, and is therefore a great circle of the sphere. The diameter WOE divides this circle into the semicircles EMW and WM'E, one above, the other below the horizon circle NESW,— that is to say, a star which rises in the east has one-half of its course above the horizon, and the other half below the horizon. Again, since the circle SZNZ' has the points

E and W for its poles, the arcs EM, MAY, WM', and M'E are quadrants,—that is to say, when a star rises in the east, one-fourth of a complete rotation brings it to the meridian, another fourth brings it to the west point, the next fourth part brings it again to the meridian at M' below the horizon, and the remaining fourth part brings it to the east point again. The circle EMWM' is called the celestial equator. It is the great circle having for its poles the points P and P', which are the poles of the heavens. (It is sometimes, but perhaps not very correctly, called the equinoctial, because when the sun is on this circle, one-half of his course is above and the other below the horizon, and therefore day and night are equal; but, strictly speaking, the term equinoctial is applied to the geographical equator because there all the year round the nights are of equal length.)

A star at N will clearly be carried by the diurnal motion round the circle Nemw to N again, not passing below the horizon; and any star on the segment of the sphere PNewtw> will be always above the horizon. Hence the circle of ~Semιυ is called the circle of perpetual apparition, as limiting the region of the stars which never set. Such stars are called circumpolar stars. There is evidently an equal opposite region, P'Sw'm'e', around the invisible pole, the stars in which are never seen above the plane of the horizon. It is clear that any circle parallel to the equator, between the circle of perpetual apparition and the equator, has more than its half above the horizon, and so much the more as it lies nearer to the circle of perpetual apparition; that is to say, stars rising in the quadrant EN are above the horizon for more than half the time of a complete rotation of the star-sphere, and the nearer they rise to N the longer they continue above the horizon. In like manner stars rising in the quadrant ES are above the horizon for less than half the time of a complete rotation, and the nearer they rise to S the shorter is the time during which they are above the horizon.

Let us suppose the sphere of fig. 2 so placed (fig. 3) that the horizon plane appears as a straight line SON, O being the place where the east and west points coalesce. Thus the equator appears as the straight line MOM' at right angles to the polar axis POP'; the circles mN, S7√ of fig. 2 become the straight lines mN, Sm' parallel to MM' in fig. 3. And parallel circles intermediate between these two and the equator appear as the parallel straight lines AC1>, A'C'B'; while parallel circles outside the circles mN and Sm' appear as the parallel straight lines acb and a!cb'. All these parallels being at right angles to ΓP' are bisected [9:2:765] by PF. Now, if we consider that the straight line AIIB represents a circle seen edgewise, we perceive that All represents two equal arcs of the circumference of this circle, one arc being that on which a star moving along that circle by the diurnal motion is carried from the horizon to the meridian at A,and the other being the arc on which the star is carried from A to the horizon again. In like manner H'A' represents two equal arcs of a star’s diurnal course,—that is to say, the arcs of a star’s visible path on the two sides of the meridian are equal to one another. Similarly the meridian divides the invisible part of a star’s course into equal parts. In the case of a star within the circle of perpetual apparition we perceive that acl> represents two semicircles of such a star’s diurnal circuit, one-half lying on the east of the meridian, the other lying on the west; in this case, then, as in the former, the meridian separates the ascending from the descending paths, which are equal, but the ascent is from a point on the meridian below the pole, not from the horizon, and the descent is to the same point of the subpolar meridian. It will be noticed that a in fig. 3 lies to the north of the zenith Z; but it is also clear from the figure that some of the circumpolar stars cross the meridional arc SMP to the south of the zenith.

We see from fig. 3 that a star is always at its highest above the horizon when on the part PZS of the meridional circle. A star is said to culminate, or to reach its culmination, when on the meridian. The arc of the meridian intercepted between the star and the south point is called the star’s meridian altitude; and the arc of the meridian between the star and the zenith is called the star’s zenith distance, or more correctly, the meridional zenith distance. The arc-distance of a star from the equator is called its declination, and is northern or southern according as the star is in the northern or southern of the two hemispheres into which the equator divides the celestial sphere. The arc-distance of a star from the north pole is called the north polar distance, the supplement of this arc (the arc-distance from the south pole) being called the south polar distance. It is evident that the north polar distance of a star having northern declination is complementary to the declination,— that is, N.P.∙D. = 90°- N. Dec. But when a star has southern declination N.P.D. = 90° + S. Dec. When we know the declination or polar distance of a star, we know where it will culminate. For we see from fig. 3 that

Arc SA = SM + MA.

In other words, the altitude of a star culminating at A is equal to the altitude of the equator on the meridian added to the northern declination of the star. (The arc SM is obviously equal to ZP, the zenith distance of the pole, or the complement of the pole’s altitude above the horizon.) Again—

Arc SA' = SM-MA', or the altitude of a star culminating at A' is equal to the altitude of the equator on the meridian diminished by the southern declination. These relations hold so long as the star culminates on the arc SZ. For a star culminating at α, we have still

Sα = MS + Mα.

But the altitude of the star, being in this case measured from the north point N, is the supplement of the arc obtained by thus adding the north declination to the meridional altitude of the equator.

We see then that the declination of a star (or its north polar distance) determines the altitude of its culminating point. To determine the time at which the star culminates it is necessary that another co-ordinate should be known.

As we measure the declination from the equator, or in other words, determine the altitude of culmination by a reference to the equator, it is manifestly convenient to measure the time of a star’s culmination by referring it to the time of culmination of some selected point on the equator. This is the course adopted by astronomers. The point selected for the purpose is one of the two points in which a great circle on the celestial sphere, called the ecliptic, and presently to be more particularly described, cuts the equator. This point is called the first point of Aries, and is indicated by the sign f P. At present it is only necessary to note that this point is in reality affected by a slow motion on the star-sphere, due to the fact that the axis on which the star-sphere apparently turns undergoes a slow change of position within the star-sphere itself, so that the equator is not really a fixed circle on the heavens. But for the purpose we have at present in view this slow change may be neglected; and we assume that the observer on earth has the equator as a fixed circle from which tc measure the declination of stars, and that he also has a fixed point on the equator by which to time the culmination of each star. Knowing the declination of a star, he knows at what altitude it will culminate as viewed from the fixed station at which thus far we have supposed him to be placed. Let him now note the exact moment at which the first point of Aries culminates, and let him observe the precise interval in time between that moment and the moment when a star of known declination culminates; this interval is constant, and thereafter he will always know not only at what altitude that star will culminate, but at what time after the culmination of the point T. The interval in time between the culmination of T and the culmination of a given star is called the right ascension of the star. It may be measured, indeed, as an arc, viz., as the arc on the equator intercepted between T and that point in which a meridian circle through the star intersects the equator, the arc being measured in the direction opposite to that in which the star-sphere rotates. But the right ascension is more conveniently and now almost always measured in time.

The time measurement employed is the rotation of the star-sphere itself. The interval in time between the successive culminations of T is called a sidereal day. It is divided into 24 hours (numbered 0, 1, 2, 3 . . . to 24), each hour into 60 minutes, each minute into 60 seconds. If we have a clock showing 24 hours, and so rated as always to show 0 hour 0 min. 0 sec., when T is at its culmination, that clock will always show true sidereal time. Such a clock would gain nearly 4 min. a day as compared with an ordinary clock; but we need not at present dwell upon this point. Now the right ascension (or, as it is written, the R.A.) is indicated in sidereal time, and therefore corresponds to the time shown by the sidereal clock when that star is culminating. Thus, if a star’s right ascension is 3 h. 2 m. 6 s., then when the sidereal clock shows time 3 h. 2 in. 6 s., that star is culminating. Whether it be day or night the astronomer knows this certainly, that is, if his sidereal clock is trustworthy.

It will be manifest that an observer at a fixed station, as we have thus far supposed our observer to be, requires to have the means of determining—(1) the moment at which a star culminates (or is on the meridian), and (2) the star’s [9:2:766] altitude when at its culmination. We have seen how the movement of the star-sphere determines the cardinal points of the horizon. Suppose now a telescope or pointer, so set as to turn upon a horizontal axis lying exactly east and west, as in fig. 4. We see that when the telescope is rotated on this axis, the line of sight, es, or the optical axis of the telescope, sweeps round in the plane of the meridian. It can be directed due south towards S, or to Ae (the culminating poi nt of the celestial equator), or to s, a star on the meridian, or to the zenith Z, or to the pole P, or to the north point N,—in fine, to any point on the celestial meridian.

Now, if any contrivance be adopted to enable the observer to note the exact moment of sidereal time when a star crosses the middle of the field of view of such a telescope, then the right ascension of that star is known at once. If also the angle ZOs can be determined, we learn the star’s zenith distance. This added to ZP, the zenith distance of the pole, is the star’s north polar distance, PZs; and in this instance the complement of the zenith distance is the north declination. Such an instrument, if devised simply or mainly for noting the moment of culmination, is called a transit instrument. If arranged with circles so that angles—as the zenith distance Zs—can be determined, the instrument is called a transit circle. An arrangement, now little used, in which a meridional circle bearing a telescope works against a fixed plane surface or wall (necessarily standing in a north-and-south position) is called a mural circle. At present, however, we need not discuss these varieties of construction. The point to be specially noted in this plan is that, from observations of the starsphere, we determine the cardinal points; and then the position of any star in the heavens can be determined by an instrument contrived so as to swing in the plane of the meridian. This done, a clock, carefully rated to show sidereal time, enables the astronomer at a fixed station to turn his transit instrument to the point of culmination of a star at the exact time when the star will culminate, and at the true place of such culmination.

Chapter II.— The Earth shorvn to be a Globe within the Star-Sphere.

But now let us suppose our observer to travel in a north-and-south direction, in order to determine what change, if any, will be produced by such voyages. The first effect noticed is that the pole of the heavens rises higher and higher above the northern horizon, as he travels farther and farther north, whereas the pole sinks lower and lower down towards the northern horizon the farther the observer travels towards the south. Close observation shows that the change of the pole’s elevation is either exactly proportional to the observer’s change of place in a north-and-south direction, or so nearly so that any discrepancy will require the closest and most exact scrutiny. The observer also notices that the stars retain their relative positions abso lutely unaltered, but that new stars are seen in the south when he travels southward. This shows that the starsphere is either truly a spherical enclosure,—all the stars lying at the same distance,—or else that the distances of the stars are so enormous that the displacement of the observer on the earth, even by several hundred miles, is as nothing by comparison. The uniform change in the pole’s elevation cannot be explained, however, by merely supposing the stars very far away compared with terrestrial distances. For let us suppose that A, B, C, D (fig. 5) represent four equidistant stations along a straight north-and-south line SN, and that AP is the direction in which the polar axis seems to lie, as seen from the station A, then from D it is seen at a greater elevation, or as in direction DP. Now, if we suppose P to be the actual pole of the heavens, then BP and CP should represent the polar axis as observed at B and C; but the angles PAN, PBN, PCN, PDN, do not increase uniformly, for this would imply that the angles APB, BPC, and CPD are equal, which we know from geometry not to be the case. Moreover, the star-sphere cannot rotate uniformly about two different axes, as PA and PD.

It is manifest that we can only explain the observed facts by assuming that the course pursued by the supposed observer is not a straight line as SN (fig. 5), but curved, and that it is curved uniformly, since the polar elevation changes uniformly when the observer travels at a uniform rate. It follows, therefore, that the path of the observer must be part of a circular arc such as d a g in fig. 6. Here suppose a the first position of the observer, and that when he travels southwards he passes over the equal arcs a b, be, cd, <fcc., while his northward course from a carries him over the equal arcs a e, e f, f g. From a let the north pole of the heavens be seen in the direction aP a , and for convenience, instead of drawing the south-and-north horizon line at a (which would be a tangent to the arc d g at a, and would be confused with other tangents required to be drawn [9:2:767] from b, c, d, <fcc.), let us draw a vertical line downwards from a to G, that is, towards the nadir, and let us draw Ca at right angles to aC, meeting the circle EaE', of which dg is an arc, in a. Through C, the centre of this circle, draw PCP' parallel to aP a . Then we suppose throughout that the pole of the celestial sphere is so far off compared with the dimensions of the circlo EaE', that the apparent direction of the polar axis at all points of the arc d g is the same, and therefore parallel to CP. Thus the polar axis at b is represented by the line bP b , at c by the line cP e , and so on. Draw the vertical lines bC, cC, dC, <fcc., and at right angles to them, through C, draw Cδ, Cc, Cd, <fcc.; then clearly the angular elevation of the pole at a, or the angle P a ae, is equal to the angle PCa; at b the elevation of the pole, or the angle P b ba, is equal to the angle PCδ,∙ at c to PCc, and at d to PCc∕. But these angles PCα, PCδ, PCc, PC/ diminish uniformly. In other words, to an observer travelling uniformly along an arc abed towards the south, the angular elevation of the pole would diminish uniformly, as it is observed to do, if (1) the arc da is circular, and (2) the pole of the heavens so far from the observer that lines drawn to it are appreciably parallel. Similarly the uniform increase of the polar elevation, to an observer travelling northwards along the arc ag, is explained, since the elevation of the pole, as he passes to the stations e, f, and g, changes through the values PCe, PC/, PCy, increasing therefore uniformly.

Continuing this voyage beyond ad, southwards, the observer finds the pole continues to sink, until at length when he has arrived at a station E, the north pole of the heavens is on the horizon due north, or in direction EP e . All the phenomena of celestial rotation continue unchanged, except that towards the south many new stars have come into view. Moreover, the south pole of the heavens has now risen to the horizon, and lies due south, or in direction EP' e . If the observer were now to retrace his course, he would, of course, find the north pole of the heavens rising uniformly again. But if instead of this he continue his journey southwards, he finds the south pole of the heavens rising uniformly. As he travels onwards to the successive stations d', c', b', a', <fcc., so placed that Ed' = Ed, Ec' = Ec, (fcc,, the phenomena presented may be described exactly as for the northern stations d, c, b, a, <fcc., respectively, except that for northern must be written southern, and for southern northern, throughout.

The difference in the position of observers on the northern and southern sides of E, fig. 6, may be conveniently illustrated as in fig. 7, where G represents the place of an observer near Greenwich, and C the place of an observer near Cape Town, but due south of the former, and HZΔ, H'Z7⅛', are supposed to represent the apparent hemispherical dome of the heavens above and around these respective observers. (These hemispherical domes should, of course, be very much larger in proportion, each being here represented with a radius of about 3500 miles, whereas the nearest of the celestial bodies, our moon, is nearly 240,000 from us.) Gp represents the apparent direction of the northern celestial pole as seen from Greenwich, raised about 51⅜ 0 above the north point of the horizon at h, and Ge is the direction of the southern or culminating point of the celestial equator, about 38⅜ o above the south point H of the Greenwich horizon. (The east and west points of the horizon-circle are projected at the point G.) At C, Cp' is the direction of the southern celestial pole, about 34∣ o above the southern horizon at II'; Ce' is the direction of the culminating or north point of the celestial equator, about 55∣ 0 above the northern horizon at h'.

We see that journeys taken in a north-and-south direction lead to apparent changes of the dome of the heavens, only explicable on the assumption that the path traversed is a circular arc, or nearly so. It is clear also that the radius of this circular arc is determinable if the observer notes how much the elevation of the pole is changed for any given distance traversed by him in a north-and-south direction. Suppose, for instance, that in travelling from a to b (fig. 6) he finds the elevation of the pole diminished by 7°, and that he has travelled about 480 miles, then (as already shown) he knows that ab = ab = change in polar elevation = an arc of 7° of the circumference of the circle along which he is travelling. Hence the whole 360

circumference = — × 480 miles = 24,686 miles; whence y the diameter of the circle = (roughly) 24,686 × — = 7855 miles. This is not the true diameter of the earth’s globe, being supposed to be the result of only a rough observation; but the method serves sufficiently to show how in very early times astronomers obtained a measure of the earth. For from whatever station the observer starts on north-and-south journeys, the same uniform elevation or depression of the visible pole as he travels towards or from it is observed; and the inference, therefore, is that the earth is a globe, since all the lines drawn on it in a north-and-south direction are circular arcs of equal radius. The points corresponding to E, where the poles are both on the horizon, mark the place of the terrestrial equator; and the points on the earth, P and P' (which have never yet been reached), where the north and south celestial poles are respectively vertical, are the terrestrial or geographical poles.

Thus far we have considered only journeys made along a north-and-south course. Journeys pursued due east or due west, that is, always towards the point of the horizon which is 90° to the right or to the left of the north point, show equally that the observer is travelling on the surface of a globe, though they produce no apparent change either in the elevation of the pole or in the position of the points at which known stars rise, culminate, and set. We have seen that the observer who remains always at one station can determine the absolute time when any given star will culminate. Let us suppose that when journeying eastward or westward he can carry with him his sidereal time-measurer, and that this continues throughout to show the true sidereal time of his original station. Then if he is travelling eastward he will find that any given star, instead of culminating at the time noted for that star as observed at his original station, will culminate earlier. The right ascension of the star will remain unchanged, for this is the difference between its time of [9:2:768] cuL·niuation and the t>rιe when the point T culminates. But instead of V Eliminating when the clock points to 0 h. 0 m. 0 s. of sidereal time, it will culminate before the clock so points; and each star will culminate as much before its sidereal time, that is, before the sidereal time corresponding to its right ascension. On the contrary, if the observer travels westwards from his original station, he finds that each star culminates later. Moreover, the observer finds that the amount of change in point of time corresponds to the distance he travels. »Suppose a, fig. 8, to be his original station, and let ad be a small circle of a globe, having P and P', as before determined (see fig. 6), for poles. Then the observer finds that the change in the time of a star’s culmination corresponds exactly to the length of arc traversed by him round the circle ad, on the assumption that a complete circumference of this circle corresponds to 24 hours of sidereal time. Thus, if a is at Greenwich, the polar elevation is 51⅜ 0 , and, therefore, Eα (from what has been already shown in explaining fig. 6), is an arc of 51|°; ao, the radius of ad, = EO sin. 51∣ o , and the observer finds that T, the change of time in the culmination of T, or any given star, for a given easterly or westerly distance d traversed from Greenwich, is such that

T: a sidereal day :: d : 2τr. EO. sin. 51∣ 0 .

This corresponds with the result of the former series of observations in showing that the earth is a globe, suspended, as it were, within the star-sphere; and that either the starsphere turns uniformly around this terrestrial globe from east to west once in 24 sidereal hours, or else the terrestrial globe turns uniformly round the axis PP' (fig. G) once in 24 sidereal hours from west to east.

Chapter III.— Of the Apparent Motions of the Sun.

The earth has now been shown to be a globe within the star-sphere, and whether the earth rotates within the starsphere, or the star-sphere rotates round the earth, or both the earth and the star-sphere rotate, it is known that, relatively to the earth, the star-sphere rotates from east to west once in 24 sidereal hours. This rotation, whether apparent or real, takes place without any appreciable change in the relative position of the fixed stars. And the law of rotation having once been ascertained, it follows that the time of culmination of any star, and the position of the star at the time, are known, insomuch that a telescope or pointer can be directed to the place of the star at the moment of culmination with perfect exactness. Moreover, a star can be followed by an instrument properly devised, in such sort that a pointer shall continue directed upon the star all through the 24 sidereal hours. Suppose, for example, that PP' (fig. 9) is a rod turning on pivots P and P' so placed that the axis of the rod points to the pole of the heavens; then if TT' be a telescope so attached to an axis in or on PP' (as at 0) that it can be turned in any angle to PP'; then if this telescope be placed so that es, its optical axis, is directed towards a star (in which case, necessarily, the angle POs will be equal to the star’s north polar distance), it is clear that by rotating the axis PP' uniformly once in 24 sidereal hours, and in the direction corresponding to the rotation of the heavens, the optical axis es will continue to be directed towards the star throughout the whole of those 24 hours, even when the star is below the horizon. If a star’s north polar distance be known, a telescope thus mounted can be placed so that POs is the proper angle, without seeing the star. If, further, we know the star’s right ascension, and also the true sidereal time, we can not only set the telescope so that POs shall be the proper angle, but can rotate the axis PP' in such sort that the telescope shall be pointed directly towards the star. Suppose, for example, that the star’s N.P.D. = 75°, and the R.A. = 1 hour 26 min. (or 2⅛ 0 ), (in other words, the star is close to η of the constellation Pisces); and let the time indicated by the sidereal clock be 3 hours 10 min. Then set TT' (fig. 9) so that the angle POs = 75°, turn the axle PP' so that TT' or es lies in the meridian,—in other words, let the telescope be directed due south, only with an elevation of 53⅜ 0 , which is the supplement of 75° + the polar elevation at Greenwich, where the observation is made. Then, since the sidereal time is 3 hours 10 min., we know that the point T was on the meridian 3 hours 10 min. before the moment of observation; and since the star’s R.A. = 1 hour 26 min., we know that the star was on the meridian 1 hour 26 min. after T; hence the star was on the meridian 1 hour 44 min. (3 hours 10 min. — 1 hour 26 min.) before the moment of observation. We have then only to rotate the axis PP' so as to follow the rotation of the star-sphere through an angle of 26° (the angle corresponding to 1 hour 44 min., since 360° corresponds to 24 hours) to have the telescope directed upon the star. And as we can thus direct a telescope, mounted as shown in fig. 9, towards a star at any hour (even when a star is below the horizon, in which case, of course, the telescope will be directed downwards), so conversely, it is clear that when the telescope is directed in any manner we can tell towards what point of the star-sphere the tube is turned. Thus, if the time shown by the sidereal clock is 3 hours 10 min., and the telescope be in such a position that, in order to bring it to the meridian, it would have to be turned round the polar axis backwards through an arc of 26°, corresponding to the rotation of the heavens in 1 hour 44 min., then we know that it is directed to a point in the star-sphere whose right ascension is 3 hours 10 min. - 1 hour 44 min., or 1 hour 26 min. If, further, we note that the angle POs is one of 75°, we know that the north polar distance of the point towards which the telescope is directed is 75°. The point, therefore, is known, and is close to the star η Piscium.

We perceive, then, that if any celestial object is visible, whether by day or night, then by simply directing towards it such a telescope as is shown in fig. 9, we can ascertain in what part of the stellar heavens that celestial object lies. And if the object is moving upon the stellar heavens,— or, in other words, if it is other than one of these fixed stars with which we have hitherto been dealing,—then by turning a telescope towards it from time to time we can determino its apparent path among the stars. So that in the case of the sun, which is never seen in company with the stars.

simply because bis light, by illuminating our air, veils the stars from view, we can nevertheless ascertain exactly along what path on the star-sphere he seems to move, at what rate, and whether the rate is uniform or variable.

But before we examine the results of observations carried out for this purpose, it will be well to consider a circumstance affecting observations made in this manner. We refer to the refractive action of the earth’s atmosphere, by which the apparent positions of the celestial bodies are to some degree affected. This is the proper place to mention the effects of refraction, because there can be little doubt that it was during observations of the sun that the refractive action of the atmosphere was first discovered. However, in explaining this action reference will be made to the stars as heretofore, in order that the inquiry into the sun’s apparent motions may be referred solely to the sphere of the fixed stars.

By a well-known optical law, a ray of light in passing obliquely from one medium to another of greater density is refracted or bent towards the normal to their common surface. We may regard our atmosphere as composed of an infinity of concentric spherical shells, whose densities increase the nearer they are to the earth’s surface. When a ray of light from a star enters the atmosphere, therefore, it is inflected towards the earth, and the inflection is increased by every successive stratum of the atmosphere through which the light passes. In fig. 10, let AA', BB', CC', represent the boundaries of successive strata, supposed for convenience to have a finite thickness. A ray of light from S, reaching the highest stratum at a, leaves its original direction Sax, and travels in the direction aby ∖ reaching the next stratum at δ it is further bent, viz., from direction dby to the direction bz; and at c it is deflected in the direction cθ. In its progress from a to 0, it has therefore successively moved in the direction of the sides of the polygon dbcQ∙, and to the spectator at O, the star from which it proceeded, instead of appearing in its true place at S, will appear to be at S', or in the last direction of the visual ray. N ow if A A is the most elevated stratum of the atmosphere into which the ray enters in the direction Sα, it is clear that the whole effect is produced by the atmospherical strata situated below AA, and that the length of Sα is perfectly indifferent; hence the refraction is entirely independent of the distance of the stars, provided they are beyond the limits of the earth’s atmosphere.

The decrease of the density of the atmosphere, from the surface of the earth upwards, follows the law of continuity, or takes place by insensible degrees; so that the luminous ray, in traversing the atmosphere, enters at every instant into a denser medium, and is therefore continually brought nearer and nearer to the vertical direction. Hence the true path of the ray is curvilinear, and concave towards the earth, as represented in fig. 11. This 13 equivalent to the supposition that the thickness of the different concentric strata of uniform density is infinitely small, and that the light, as it successively penetrates each, deviates from its former path by an infinitely small angle, which may be considered as the differential of the refraction, the total amount of which will therefore be obtained by integration. The direction of the ray, when it reaches the eye of the observer, is the tangent to the last portion of its curvilinear path; and the apparent zenith distance of the star will be ZOS', while the real zenith distance is ZOS. The difference of these two angles, namely SOS, is what is denominated the Astronomical Refraction. It is evident that the whole path of the ray is confined to the vertical plane in which the star and the eye of the observer are situated; for the earth and its atmosphere being very nearly spherical, that plane will divide the strata symmetrically; there will, therefore, be no displacement in a lateral direction, i.e., no refraction out of the vertical plane. When the observed star is due north or south, the vertical plane is the plane of the meridian; hence, in meridional observations, the whole of the refraction takes place in declination, while the right ascension remains unaltered.

It is evident that the amount of the refraction is greater in proportion as the observed star is nearer to the horizon; for in this case the luminous rays strike the tangent planes of the atmospherical strata more obliquely, and have besides to traverse a greater extent of atmosphere before they arrive at the eye of the observer. On determining by experiment the refraction at every altitude from zero to 90°, tables of Refraction may be constructed, which will furnish the means of discovering the law of its diminution; but as such a process would be exceedingly tedious, and likewise apt to lead to erroneous results on account of the inevitable errors of observation, it is found more convenient to assume some hypothesis for a basis of calculation, and to verify the results which it leads to by comparing them with observation. In regard to media which may be said to be permanent,—such, for instance, as water and glass,—the determination of the refraction is not attended with great difficulty; but the circumstances are greatly altered when we come to make experiments on the atmosphere. In this case the difficulty arises from the incessant changes which the atmosphere is undergoing relatively to its refractive power,—changes which it is impossible for the observer fully to appreciate, inasmuch as he can ouly determine its physical state within a short distance of the earth, while that of the upper strata remains wholly unknown to him. The refractive power of the atmosphere is affected by its density and temperature. The effects of the humidity are insensible; for the most accurate experiments seem to prove that the watery vapours diminish the density of the air in the same ratio as their refractive power is greater. It is therefore only necessary, even in delicate experiments, to have regard to the state of the barometer and thermometer at the time the observation is made. At a medium density, and at the temperature of melting ice, it was found by Biot and Arago, from a great number of exact experiments, that at any altitude between 10° and the zenith the refraction is very nearly represented by the formula r = 60" ’ 6 tan. (Z - 325 × r), in which r is the refraction corresponding to a given zenith distance Z. With the exception of the numerical coefficients, this formula was first given by Bradley; but whether it was deduced from theory by that astronomer, or was only empirical, is [9:2:770] uncertain. Bradley’s formula was r = 57 tan. (Z — 3 × r). When the direction of the luminous rays makes a smaller angle than 10° with the horizon, it becomes indispensable to take into account, in the calculation of the refraction, the law of the variation of the density of the atmosphere at different altitudes,—a law which is subject to incessant variation, from the operation of winds and other causes which agitate the atmosphere, as well as the decrease of temperature in the superior regions. For this reason all astronomical observations which have not refraction directly for their object, or which are not by their nature independent of its influence, are made at an elevation exceeding 10°. For lower altitudes it is to be feared that no theory will ever be found sufficiently exact to entitle the observations to much confidence.

[It may be explained here in passing that the refraction of the rays of light in traversing the earth’s atmosphere is the cause of Twilight, which sensibly lengthens the duration of the day, and prevents a sudden transition from light to darkness on the disappearance of the sun. When the sun is more than 33' below the horizon, the refraction is not powerful enough to bring his rays sufficiently near the earth to reach our eyes; they pass over our heads, and are irregularly reflected by the molecules of the atmosphere. By this means a portion of the celestial vault is enlightened, while the sun is invisible. This illumination of the upper regions is called the twilight. It commences as soon as objects can be distinguished before sunrise, and terminates when they cease to be visible after the sun has set. The time, however, at which the twilight commences and terminates cannot be assigned with any degree of precision. It is generally supposed to be limited by the depression of the sun 18° below the horizon. Lacaille found the limit in the torrid zone to be between 16° and 17°. According to Lemonnier, it varies in France between 17° and 21°. The duration of the twilight will evidently be longer or shorter according as the inclination of the sun’s motion to the horizon is more or less oblique.

The apparent enlargement of the sun and m )on near the horizon is an optical illusion, connected in some measure with the atmosphere, of which various explanations have been given since the time of Ptolemy. According to the ordinary laws of vision, the celestial bodies, particularly the moon, which is nearest to the earth, ought to appear largest in the meridian, because their distance is then less than when they are near the horizon; yet daily experience proves that the contrary takes place. To an observer placed at E (fig. 12), the visual angle subtended by the moon, in the horizon at M, is somewhat less than that under which she appears in the zenith at 0; and this fact, a consequence indeed of her circular motion, is proved by accurate measurement of her diameters in those circumstances by the micrometer. The mean apparent diameter of the moon, at her greatest height, is 3Γ in round numbers, but in the horizon she seems to the eye two or three times larger. The commonly received explanation of this phenomenon was first given by Descartes, and after him by Dr Wallis, James Gregory, Malebranche, Huyghens, and others, and may be stated as follows :—The opinion which we form of the magnitude of a distant body does not depend exclusively on the visual angle under which it appears, but also on its distance; and we judge of the distance by a comparison with other bodies. When the moon is near the zenith there is no interposing object with which we can compare her, the matter of the atmosphere being scarcely visible. Deceived by the absence of intermediate objects, we suppose her to be very near. On the other hand, we are used to observe a large extent of land lying between us and objects near the horizon, at the extremity of which the sky begins to appear; we therefore suppose the sky, with all the objects which are visible in it, to be at a great distance. The illusion is also greatly aided by the comparative feebleness of the light of the moon in the horizon, which renders us in a manner sensible of the interposition of the atmosphere. Hence the moon, though seen under nearly the same angle, alternately appears very large and very small. Desaguliers illustrated the doctrine of the horizontal moon by the supposition of our imagining the visible heavens to be only a small portion of a spherical surface, as mnop (fig. 12), in which case the moon, at different altitudes, will appear to be at different distances, and will therefore seem to vary in magnitude, as at m, n, o.]

Correction being made for refraction, the true position of the sun on the star-sphere can be ascertained day after day; and thus his apparent motions, as we have said, can be determined.

The result of such observations is to show that in a period of about 365 days the sun traverses a great circle of the star-sphere inclined to the equator. This period is called a year, and is familiar to all as the period in which the sun’s varying positions, alternately north and south of the equator, bring about the circuit of the seasons. For we have already seen that a star to the north of the equator is above the horizon more than half the sidereal day, and at its meridian culmination has an altitude exceeding that of the south point of the equator. When the sun is north of the equator he has a daily arc like that of a star similarly placed, so that day lasts longer than night, and at mid-day the sun pours his heat more directly on the earth than if he were on the equator. In like manner it is shown that, when the sun is south of the equator, night lasts longer than day, and the sun at mid-day has a smaller altitude than if he were on the equator. The result of constant experience shows, that the sun’s declination reaches its maximum on the south side of the equator about the 22d of December, when it amounts to 23 0- 465. From this time it gradually diminishes till about the 21st of March, when the sun reaches the plane of the equator. At this time the days and nights are of equal length all over the earth, and the instant of time at which the sun’s centre is in the equatorial plane is called the instant of the equinox. The sun then passes to the northern side of the equator, and his declination or meridional altitude continues to increase till about the 2 2d of June, when he becomes stationary, and then again shapes his course towards the equator. His maximum declination on the north side of the equator is exactly equal to that on the south, amounting to 23° ∙465. The sun now continues to approach the equator till about the 24th of September, when he again reaches that plane, and a second equinox succeeds. Continuing still to move in the same direction, he declines from the equator southward, till he reaches his former limit about the 22d of December; and so on continually.

The two small circles of the sphere, parallel to the equator, which pass through the two points where the declination is gr eatest, are called the Solstices or the Tropics; that on the northern hemisphere is called the Tropic of Cancer, and the other is called the Tropic of Capricorn.

These two parallels, which mark the extreme limits of the sun’s declination, are, as has just been stated, equally [9:2:771] distant from the equator, with regard to which the variations of declination on either side are perfectly symmetrical and uniform.

The observations of the sun’s right ascensions and meridional altitudes, which have been made daily during so gτeat a number of years, and under so many different meridians, furnish complete proof that the projection of the sun’s orbit is a great circle of the celestial sphere, and that the orbit itself is wholly confined to the same plane.

The great circle which the sun describes in virtue of his proper motion is called the Ecliptic. It has received this name from the circumstance that the moon, during eclipses, is either in the same plane or very near it. These phenomena can, in fact, only happen when the sun, earth, and moon are nearly in the same straight line, and, consequently, when the moon is in the same plane with the earth and the sun. The angle formed by the planes of the ecliptic and equator, which is measured by the arc of a circle of declination intercepted between the equator and tropic, is called the Obliquity of the Ecliptic. The two points in which the equator and ecliptic intersect each other are called the Equinoctial Points; they are also denominated the Nodes of the Equator; and the straight line conceived to join them is the Line of the Equinoxes, or the Line of the Nodes. The node through which the sun passes on coming from the south to the north of the equator is called the Ascending Node, and is usually distinguished by the character β; the opposite node is the Descending Node, and is marked by Ί3. A straight line passing through the centre of the earth, perpendicular to the plane of the ecliptic, is called the Axis of the Ecliptic, and the points in which its prolongation meets the sphere are called its Poles— these denominations being analogous to those of the axis and poles of the equator. The two small circles of the sphere which pass through the poles of the ecliptic, and are parallel to the equator, are called the Polar Circles.

The ecliptic has been divided by astronomers, from time immemorial, into twelve equal parts, called Signs, each of which consequently contains 30 degrees. The names and symbols by which they are characterised are as follows :—
[table]

In each of these signs the ancients formed groups of stars, which they denominated the Zodiacal constellations (ξωδtα, animals), not confined to the ecliptic, but included within an imaginary belt, extending 9° on each side of it, to which they gave the name of Zodiac (ζωδιακός κύκλος, circle or zone of the animals). The term sign is now employed only to denote an arc of 30°, and will probably soon be banished entirely from astronomical tables. It is now seldom used even for tables of the planets. Formerly, to denote that the longitude of a planet is 276° 12', it was usual to write 9* 6° 12'; or even to employ the characteristic symbol, and to write VS 6° 12', meaning that the planet was 12' in the 6th degree of Capricornus, or the tenth sign. The latter inconvenient practice is now laid aside, and the signs, when they are employed, are simply distinguished by the ordinal numbers.

As the greater part of the celestial phenomena connected with the planetary system take place either in the ecliptic or in planes not greatly inclined to it, it is found to be most convenient to refer the positions of the planets, and frequently those of the stars also, to that plane. The first point of Aries, which is the technical expression for the intersection of the ecliptic and equator, or the place of the sun at the vernal equinox, is assumed as the origin from which the degrees of the ecliptic, as well as of the equator, are counted from west to east, or in the direction of the sun’s annual motion. The angular distance of the sun from this point is called his Longitude, and the longitude of a star is the arc intercepted on the ecliptic between the same point and a great circle passing through the star perpendicular to the ecliptic. The arc of this circle intercepted between the star and the ecliptic, or, which is the same thing, the complement of the star’s distance from the pole of the ecliptic, is called the Latitude of the star; so that longitude and latitude bear the same relation to the ecliptic that right ascension and declination bear to the equator.

The sun’s motion along the ecliptic is found not to be strictly uniform, a circumstance into which we shall have to inquire more particularly farther on. In this place, let it suffice to notice that the sun is found to move more quickly in winter than in summer, the rate of motion changing from its maximum nearly in mid-winter to its minimum nearly in midsummer, and thence to its maximum again. But at no time does the motion differ greatly from its mean rate of very nearly 59' in a sidereal day. If we call the mean rate 10,000, then the greatest and least rates of motion are represented by the members 10,336 and 9664 respectively.

The direction in which the sun travels round the ecliptic, and in which longitude is measured, is from west to east, that is, it is contrary to the direction in which the starsphere rotates.

Chapter IV.— The Solar Day—Equation of Time— The Seasons.

Since the sun travels thus around the celestial sphere, it it> manifest that the successive returns of the sun to the meridian cannot recur after the same interval of time as the successive returns of any given star. If on any day the sun’s centre when he is crossing the meridian has a particular position on the star-sphere, then when that point of the star-sphere next returns to the meridian,—that is, one sidereal day later,—the sun has travelled about I “from that point, moving along the ecliptic in a direction opposed to that in which the star-sphere rotates. The star-sphere must, therefore, rotate a little further round before the sun will be on the meridian. As a convenient first approximation to the actual effects, let us make the supposition that the sun moves along the equator instead of the ecliptic, and that he moves exactly l 0 in a sidereal day. In this case he would be exactly l 0 from the meridian when the point he had occupied on the meridian the day before had reached the meridian. That point on the star-sphere would have completed the full circuit of 360° of rotation while the sun had completed only 359°, and his diurnal 359

motion being therefore only = — of the star-sphere’s, it follows that the solar day (or the interval between the sun’s successive returns to the meridian) would be greater than the sidereal day in the ratio of 360: 359. Therefore, the solar day being divided into 24 × 60 minutes, the sidereal day would manifestly be 4 min. shorter.

But as the sun moves in a circle inclined more than 23 β to the equator, and as the sun’s motion is slightly variable, and the mean rate less than l 0 per sidereal day, these relations are not exactly presented.

Let us, as a next approximation, suppose the sun to move uniformly round the equator once in the course of a year of 365⅜ days, and determine the length of a solar day [9:2:772] on this assumption. It is clear that whatever the sun’s daily retardation may be, he loses one complete circuit of the heavens in a year of 365¼ solar days. In other words, while the sun has been carried round 365¼ times by the diurnal rotation, the star-sphere has been carried round 366¼ times. Therefore, on our assumption
[table]

This, in fact, indicates roughly the manner in which the mean solar day is connected with the sidereal day. It is only necessary in the above process to substitute the true length of the year for the value 365¼ days,—meaning by the year, the year of seasons, measured by the successive returns of the sun to the equator as he crosses that circle with northward motion. But it will not be until we consider the actual nature of the motion by which the sun’s annual apparent motion is explained, that λve need inquire into the exact relation between the mean solar day and the' sidereal day.

As the sun moves at a varying rate, it is manifest that the actual solar day measured by the successive returns of the sun to the meridian could not be constant in value, even if the sun moved round the equator. For the excess of a solar day over the sidereal day is caused by the motion of the sun on the star-sphere, and will be therefore greater or less according as the sun’s motion on the star-sphere is greater or less. The actual solar day, therefore, exceeding the constant sidereal day by a variable quantity, must necessarily be itself variable. It is greater than the mean in December and January, when the sun is moving at a rate greater than his mean rate, and less in June and July when he moves at a less rate. And it is clear that if at the end of December the moment of the real sun passing the meridian were taken as the beginning of the mean solar day of twenty-four hours, then the next passage of the meridian by the actual sun would occur after the twenty-four hours of mean solar time had elapsed. Day after day the sun would come to the meridian at a later and later hour of mean solar time, until towards the end of March, when, the sun’s rate having acquired its mean value, the actual sun would not lag any farther behind. From this time he would gain, until towards the end of J une he would come to the meridian at noon of mean solar time. In the remaining half year he would be in advance, that is, he would cross the meridian before noon of mean solar time. Towards the end of September he would have made his greatest advance compared with mean time, and in the remaining quarter of the year be would gradually lose more and more of that gain, until at the end of December he would again cross the meridian at noon of mean solar time.

But besides this cause of variation in the length of the true solar day, there is another depending on the inclination of the sun’s apparent path on the heavens to the celestial equator. To conceive the effect of this cause, it is necessary to have regard to the motion of the sun with reference to the equator. The sun describes every day a small arc of the ecliptic. Through the extremities of this arc suppose two meridians to pass; the arc of the equator, which they intercept, is the sun’s motion for that day referred to the equator, and the time which that arc takes to pass the meridian is equal to the excess of the astronomical day over the sidereal. But it is obvious that at the equinoxes the arc of the equator is smaller than the corresponding arc of the ecliptic, in the proportion of the cosine of the obliquity of the ecliptic; at the solstices, on the contrary, it is greater in the proportion of the secant of the same obliquity. The astronomical day is diminished in the first case, and lengthened in the second.

To have a mean astronomical day independent of these causes of inequality, astronomers have supposed a second sun to move uniformly on the ecliptic, and to pass over the extremities of the axis of the sun’s orbit at the same instant as the real sun. This removes the inequality arising from the inequality of the sun’s motion. To remove the inequality arising from the obliquity of the ecliptic, conceive a third sun to pass through the equin0xe3 at the same instant with the second sun, and to move along the equator in such a manner that the angular distances of the two suns at the vernal equinox shall be always equal. The interval between two consecutive returns of this third sun to the meridian forms the mean astronomical day. Mean time is measured by the number of the returns of this third sun to the meridian; and true time is measured by the number of returns of the real sun to the meridian. The arc of the equator, intercepted between two meridian circles drawn through the centres of the true sun and the imaginary third sun, when reduced to time, is what is called the Equation of Time. This will be rendered plainer by the following diagram.

Let Z ♈2 ♎ (fig. 13) be the star-sphere; Zz its axis; abcde, <i∑c., the equator; ABCDE, Ac., the northern half of the ecliptic from ♈ to ♎, on the side of the globe next the eye; and MN OP, Ac., the southern half on the opposite side from ♎ to ♈. Let the points at A,‘ B, C, D, E, F, &c., mark off equal portions of the ecliptic gone through in equal times by the real sun, and those at a, b, c, d, e, f <tc., equal portions of the equator described in equal times by the fictitious sun; and let Z ♈ z be the meridian.

As the real sun moves obliquely in the ecliptic, and the fictitious sun directly in the equator, any point between ♈ and F on the ecliptic must be nearer the meridian Z ♈ z, than the corresponding point on the equator from ♈ to f , that is to say, than the point whose distance from ♈ is expressed by the same number of degree«; and the more so, as the obliquity is greater; and therefore the true sun comes sooner to the meridian every day whilst he is in the quadrant ♈ F, than the fictitious sun does in the quadrant ♈ f ; for which reason the solar noon precedes noon by the clock, until the real sun comes to F, and the fictitious to f: which two points being equidistant from the meridian, both suns will come to it precisely at noon by the clock.

Whilst the real sun describes the second quadrant of the ecliptic FGHIKL from Cancer to ♎, he comes later to the meridian every day than the fictitious sun moving through the second quadrant of the equator from f to ♎; for the [9:2:773] points at G, H, I, K, L, being farther from the meridian, their corresponding points at g, h, i, k, l, must come to it later; and as both suns come at the same moment to the point ♎, they come to the meridian at the moment of noon by the clock.

In departing from Libra through the third quadrant, the real sun going through MNOPQ towards ♑ at R, and the fictitious sun through mnopq towards r, the former comes to the meridian every day sooner than the latter, until the real sun comes to R, and the fictitious to r, and then they come both to the meridian at the same time.

Lastly, as the real sun moves equably through STUVW, from R towards ♈, and the fictitious sun through stuυw, from r towards ♈, the former comes later every day to the meridian than the latter, until they both arrive at the point ♈, and then they make it noon at the same time with the clock.

It is now easy to conceive the effect of taking into account the variable motion of the sun in his annual circuit of the ecliptic. The effect already explained as arising from this cause, on the supposition that the sun moved in the equator, must simply be added to that just shown to arise from the obliquity of the ecliptic.

Let us combine the two causes, starting from December 31, on the assumption (near enough to the truth for our present purpose), that the sun moves most rapidly when at his greatest southerly declination. The effect due to variation of the sun’s motion may be called A, and that due to the obliquity of the ecliptic may be called B; and each may be considered positive or negative according as, considered alone, it sets the real sun later or earlier than the mean sun.

We find, then, from January 1 to March 31, A and B both positive, A increasing from 0 to its maximum, B passing from 0 through its maximum to 0 again. All this time, then, A + B is positive. At the beginning A + B -= 0. About the middle of February B has its maximum value, and A a value less than its maximum; at March 31, B is zero and A has its maximum value.

From April 1 to June 30, A is positive and B negative, A diminishing from its maximum to zero, B passing from 0 through its maximum negative value to 0 again. At the beginning, then, of this quarter, A + B is positive and equal to the maximum value of A. In the middle of May, B has its maximum negative value, and A has a value less than its maximum positive value. The maxima due to A and B being not far from equality, it follows that A + B is now negative, and therefore some time before this A + B must have passed through the value 0. At the end of the quarter A + B is again 0, because A = 0 and B = 0.

From July .1 to September 30, A is negative and B positive, A increasing from 0 to its maximum negative value, B passing from zero through its maximum positive value to zero again. Hence, at the beginning of the quarter A + B = 0; at the end A + B = the maximum negative value of A. But about the middle of August, B haβ its maximum positive value while A has not its maximum negative value; hence at this time A + B is positive, and therefore between then and September 30, A + B vanishes.

Lastly, from October 1 to December 31, both A and B are negative, A passing from its maximum value to zero, and B from zero to its maximum value, and thence to zero again. Throughout the quarter, then, A + B is negative. About the middle of November A + B is the sum of the maximum value of B and a value of A less than the maximum. At the end of the quarter A + B = 0.

Owing to the fact that the time when the sun moves most rapidly follows by a few days the date (December 21) when the sun is at his greatest distance from the meridian, the dates above given are not strictly correct. The equation of time, or A + B, is zero nearly midway between December 21 and the end of the year, or about Christmas day, and it vanishes again on or about April 1C, June 16, and September 1st. The equation of time has four maxima. On February 11, the real sun is later than the mean sun by a maximum interval of 14 min. 31 sec.; on May 14, the real sun is earlier than the mean sun by a maximum interval of 3 min. 53 sec.; on July 16, the real sun is later than the mean sun by a maximum interval of 6 min. 13 sec.; and lastly, on November 3, the real sun is earlier than the mean sun by a maximum interval of 16 min. 19 sec.

The inclination of the ecliptic to the equator results necessarily, as already mentioned, in a difference of seasons. When on the equator, the sun, like an equatorial star, is above the horizon during one-half of the day, and below the horizon during the other half. When he is north of the equator he is above the horizon for more than half the day, and reaches a higher altitude at noon than when on the equator. When south of the equator he is below the horizon for more than half the day, and does not reach so great an altitude at noon as when he is on the equator. As he is perceptibly the source of light and heat, it follows that when he is north of the equator we receive (in our northern latitudes), more light and heat than when he is on the equator, and so much the more as his northerly declination is greater; while when he is south of the equator we receive less light and heat than when he is on the equator, and so much the less as his southerly declination is greater. These results are equally accounted for whether we regard the earth as fixed, and the sun as really travelling round the heavenly sphere on his inclined path, or whether we suppose the sun to be fixed, and the earth to travel around him on a correspondingly inclined path after the manner illustrated in fig. 14. Here, while the earth goes round the sun in the order of the letters A, B, C', D, its axis preserves its obliquity and always continues parallel to its first direction. At c the north pole inclines towards the sun, and brings all the northern places more into the light than at any other season of the year.. But when the earth is at g, the opposite point of the orbit, the north pole declines from the sun, and a less portion of the [9:2:774] northern hemisphere receives his light and heat. At a and e the axis is perpendicular to the plane of the orbit, so that the poles are situated in the boundaries of the illuminated hemisphere, and, the sun being directly over the equator, the days and nights are equal at all places. In this figure Ae is the terrestrial equator, T the tropic of Cancer, the dotted circle the parallel of London, U the arctic or north polar circle, and P the north pole, where all the meridians or hour-circles meet. The spectator is supposed to be placed at the pole of the ecliptic.

It is also manifest that if the earth circles around S, as in fig. 14, the observed phenomena of apparent solar motion will be precisely the same as though the sun circled around the fixed earth. Let us follow the earth round from the position α, noting how the sun would appear to move on the ecliptic, and also how the length of day would be affected by the varying position of the earth’s axis with respect to the sun. When the earth is at α, the beginning of Libra, about the 20th of March, the sun, as seen from the earth, appears at the beginning of Aries in the opposite part of the heavens, the north pole is just coming into light, and the sun is vertical to the equator, which, with all its parallels, is divided into two equal parts by the circle which forms the boundary between the dark and illuminated hemispheres, and therefore the days and nights are equal all over the earth. As the earth moves in the ecliptic, according to the order of the letters A, B, C, D, &c., the north pole P comes more and more into the light, and the days increase in length at all places north of the equator Ae. When the earth comes to the position between B and C, or the beginning of Capricorn, the sun, as seen from the earth, appears at the beginning of Cancer about the 21st of June; and the north pole of the earth inclines towards the sun, so as to bring into light all the north frigid zone, and more of each of the northern parallels of latitude in proportion as they are farther from the equator. As the earth advances from Capricorn towards Aries, and the sun appears to move from Cancer towards Libra, the north pole recedes from the light, which causes the days to decrease and the nights to increase in length till the earth comes to the beginning of Aries, and then they are equal as before,—the boundary of light and darkness cutting the equator and all its parallels equally. The north pole then goes into the dark, and does not emerge till the earth has completed a semi-revolution of its orbit, or from the 22d of September till the 20th of March. Similar changes occur, mutatis mutandis, in the southern hemisphere.

It may be well to advise the reader not to allow his mind to be led astray by the proportions indicated in such pictures as fig. 14. It is absolutely impossible to illustrate the seasons, either by diagrams or by the use of a globe, without introducing incorrect relative dimensions; but by combining two sets of pictorial illustrations, the mental error apt to arise from the study of such pictures as fig. 14 may be got rid of. Thus, after carefully studying the relations illustrated in that figure, the reader should turn to Plate XXVII., and after noting that the figure of the earth there shown is the same as that in fig. 14 (held so as to have GyF uppermost), he should endeavour to picture to himself such a figure of the earth as is shown in the plate, travelling around the path EE', but so reduced in dimensions that its whole disk would have a diameter less than the hundredth part of that of the small white disk, at the centre of the plate, which represents the sun. It will then be instructive to extend this method to Mars, as figured in Plate XXVII., carrying this planet (after first imagining his disk reduced 5000 times) round his path MM', with constant axial pose. The planets pictured in Plate XXVIII. can be dealt with in like manner. From a careful study of the two plates, with special reference to the indicated scales, the general relations of the entire solar system can be inferred, and to some degree conceived. But for the purpose of actually picturing these relations to his mind, the reader may conveniently use Sir J. Herschel’s illustration, as follows:—Choose any well-levelled field. On it place a globe 2 feet in diameter to represent the sun; Mercury will be represented by a grain of mustard seed, on the circumference of a circle 164 feet in diameter for its orbit; Venus a pea, on a circle 284 feet in diameter; the earth a [somewhat larger] pea, on a circle of 430 feet; Mars a rather large pin’s head, on a circle of 654 feet; the asteroids grains of sand, in orbits of from 1000 to 1200 feet; Jupiter a moderate-sized orange, on a circle of half a mile; Saturn a small orange, on a circle of ⅛ths of a mile; Uranus a full-sized cherry, on a circle more than 1J miles; Neptune an extra-sized cherry, on a circle of 2∣ miles in diameter.

Chapter V.— Apparent Motions of the Moon and Planets—Parallax.

We have seen that while the stars remain fixed, to all appearance, on the celestial concave, the sun circuits around a great circle of the star-sphere, moving always in one direction, and at a rate which, though variable in different parts of the circuit, does not vary largely, and is constant for each part of the ecliptic. Moreover, to ordinary observation, continued for periods of a few years, the sun’s path in the heavens appears to remain always the same, and to bear the same relation to the poles and equator of the rotating star-sphere.

But we have now to consider bodies which neither remain fixed like the stars, nor move in a constant apparent path like the sun.

The moon is the most noteworthy of these bodies, because of her apparent size and brightness, and also because of the remarkable changes of appearance which she presents according to her varying position with reference to the sun. When she is seen near him in the heavens, she appears always like a fine sickle of light, with the horns turned away from him. When she is in the part of the heavens directly opposite to the sun, she appears with a full orb. When she is exactly midway between the point occupied by the sun and that opposite to him, she appears as a semicircle of light, with the convexity towards the sun; and in positions intermediate to these she appears with more or less of her circle illuminated, according as she is nearer to or further from the point directly opposite the sun. All this corresponds with what would happen if the moon were an opaque orb nearer to the earth than the sun, and illuminated by him.

Now, when the moon is watched, even for a few hours only, she is found to be travelling on the star-sphere in the same direction as the sun (and, like him, on a path inclined to the equator), but much more rapidly than the sun travels. It is impossible to watch the moon completely round the heavens, because she is found to pass close to the sun once in each circuit, and when very near to him cannot be seen. But while she is visible, she travels continuously in one direction, and when she· reappears, after having been for a day or two lost in the sunlight, she is seen to have shifted her place as though, during that interval, she had travelled continuously onwards.

The moon’s circuit of the star-sphere is found to be completed in about 27J solar days. But her circuit, considered with reference to the sun, occupies a longer interval. Thus, suppose we observe her when she is opposite to the sun, or “fulL” Then she is in the same (or very nearly the same) place among the stars about 27⅜ days later. But in the meantime the sun has advanced along the ecliptic [9:2:775] about 27°, and the point now directly opposite the sun has, of course, advanced by the same amount. The moon has, therefore, to travel further on before she is again exactly opposite the sun. It is found that this happens rather more than 2 days later ; or, in other words, that the interval between successive full moons amounts to about 29∣ days. This interval is called a lunar month, or lunation; the period during which the moon completes the circuit of the heavens being called a sidereal month. The lunation is also called a synodical month.

The path in which the moon travels is found to be inclined at an angle of about 5° 9' to the ecliptic. But continued observation shows that the path, while retaining this inclination, shifts slowly in position—the points where it intersects the ecliptic gradually retrograding (on the whole) until, in the course of about 18 j years, they have made a complete circuit of the ecliptic. It is also found that the moon moves, like the sun, with variable velocity in her apparent course. The parts of her path, however, where she moves most and least rapidly are not fixed in position like the corresponding parts of the sun’s apparent circuit, but advance, travelling round in 8 , 85 years.

It follows, from the varying position of the moon’s apparent path with respect to the ecliptic, that her range north and south of the equator is variable. When she crosses the ecliptic, at or near the two points where the ecliptic crosses the equator, the inclination of her path to the ecliptic is either added to or subtracted from the inclination of the ecliptic to the equator, so that her range in declination is, in one case, 23° 27' + 5° 9', or 28° 36'; and in the other, 23° 27' — 5° 9', or 18° 18'. When she crosses the ecliptic at or near the two points where the ecliptic is furthest from the equator, the inclination of her path to the equator is nearly the same as that of the ecliptic, the two paths—the ecliptic, or sun’s path, and the apparent lunar path—crossing the equator at different points.

Thus far there is nothing in the observed celestial motions which opposes itself to the belief that the earth is a fixed centre around which the celestial bodies are carried —the star-sphere by the diurnal rotation, the sun circling round the earth in his yearly course on the ecliptic, and the moon in her monthly (lunar) course on a variable path, and both these orbs partaking in the diurnal rotation of the star-sphere, just as bodies in a moving vehicle partake in the motion of the vehicle, even though they may also be in motion among themselves.

One circumstance in the moon’s apparent motions serves, however, to show that the bodies thus far observed lie at different distances, and falls properly to be considered in this place, seeing that the attention of astronomers must first have been directed to it when they were engaged in determining the moon’s motions.

The earth being, as we have seen, a globe, and the sun and moon being apparently carried round this globe by the daily rotation, which is uniform, it would naturally occur to astronomers that, if these motions take place around the centre of the earth, they cannot appear altogether uniform as seen from the eccentric position of an observer placed anywhere on the surface. The stars, indeed, seem to be carried uniformly round, but that has been explained as due to their enormous distance. The sun moving manifestly within the stellar concave, and the moon travelling apparently within the sun’s orbit (as may be inferred from her phases), it might well be that their motions would be found affected by the eccentricity of the observer’s position. Suppose, for example, that the centre of the earth is at P, fig. 15, and the observer is at E, and let EM, represent a line of sight from E to the moon’s centre when she is in the horizon (refraction being neglected). Then a line PM, from the centre of the earth to the moon is inclined to the horizon line EM u ; and if we draw Pm h parallel to EM b , so that either line represents the direction of the moon as observed from E, we see that, if she were observed from P, she would appear raised by the angle included between the lines PM, and Pzn h . From E, then, she is seen lower down than her true geocentric position bv the angle M,P>n h j and similarly it is seen that, if the moon be at M, the direction EM in which she is seen is lower down

—that îs, is less inclined to the horizon line Em h —by the angle EMP, or its equal, MPm; if the moon were at M', the displacement would be equal to the angle EM'P; and only when she is at the zenith Z does her direction EZ agree with her geocentric direction PZ. Her observed path from horizon to horizon, when she rises high in the south, but does not reach the zenith, will be as the path m 1 m i m 6 (fig. 16), where her geocentric path is as M 1 M 0 M w . This will happen if she is near enough to the earth for the angle EM a P (fig. 15), to be appreciable; and all that has here been said of the moon is equally true of the sun, or any other celestial body. But in their case no appreciable displacement occurs (at least none which the earlier modes of observation could indicate). In the case of the moon the displacement is very marked, being found to amount nearly to a degree when the moon is on the horizon. Such displacement is called parallax. Thus, when any celestial body is at M (fig. 15), the angle EMP (or MPm), between the geocentric direction PM, and the apparent direction EM, is called the parallax of the body. When the celestial body is at M h , so that its true direction is horizontal, the parallax EM,P, is manifestly greater than for any other position of the body at the same distance from P. This maximum parallax is called the horizontal parallax, and may be defined as the maximum angle subtended by the earth’s radius, as supposed to be seen from the body.

It may be noticed, in passing, that if the geocentric distance of a celestial body = d, the earth’s radius = r, and the horizontal parallax = p, then βin ∙P = 5 · · · (1 )∙

EP This is manifest from fig. 15, where sin. PM,E = - . Again, in the case of a body at M, using the same symbols, and calling the apparent altitude MEM, a, and the parallax p', we have p' = MPzn

, E P sin. EPto r sin. a sm. p - j 1 p = d

That is, sin. p' = sin. a . sin. p ... (2).

For every celestial body, except the moon, the parallax is [9:2:776] bo small that its arc-measure may be substituted for its sine; hence, for (1) and (2) we may write p≈- . . . . (3); and√=∕>sin. a . . (4),

(X

for all the heavenly bodies except the moon.

From the observed parallactic displacement of the moon it is manifest, apart from the lunar phases, that the moon’s orbit relatively to the earth lies within the sun’s.

We have now, however, to consider bodies which, if they be regarded as moving around the earth, must move in orbits of very singular shape.

While observing the stars, which maintain apparently a constant position on the uniformly rotating star-sphere, the ancients early noted five bodies, which seem to travel among the stars like the sun and moon, but not always in one direction. To these bodies they gave the name of planets, or wanderers (a term which also included the sun and moon, so that there were seven in all). Three could be seen sometimes throughout the night, sometimes in the morning, sometimes in the evening. To these were given the names Saturn, Jupiter, and Mars; and careful observation showed that these bodies, when visible all through the night, always travel among the stars in a direction contrary to that of the sun’s yearly and the moon’s monthly motion, but that this retrograde motion continues only for a certain length of time, being preceded and followed by an advancing motion, which is greater in amount than the retrograde motion, so that, on the whole, these bodies are carried round in the same direction as the sun and moon. The nature of these apparent motions will best be understood by referring to fig. 17, and supposing an observer on the earth to watch Saturn, Jupiter, and Mars respectively traversing the twisted paths there indicated, in the order shown by the dates, the loops being supposed to lie very nearly but not quite in the level of the paper, which represents the plane of the ecliptic. But this peculiarity was noticed, that when any planet was at the outermost parts of the successive loops (as, for instance, when Jupiter was as where the date 1712 is placed on his loops), the planet was lost to view in the sun’s rays, lying nearly in the same part of the sky, whereas, when a planet was at [9:2:777] the innermost parts of the successive loops (as, for instance, when Saturn was as where the date 1710 is placed on his loops), the planet was always opposite the sun. This exact agreement between the times when the planet and sun were in conjunction or in opposition, and the tracing out of the apparent planetary loops, should have suggested, it would seem, a connection between the sun and planets; for we see from fig. 17, that if the earth were the centre of the sun’s motion, and each of the three planets had its looped path wherein to travel around the earth, there could be imagined no reason why the planet’s motion round its loops should synchronise with the sun’s motion on his nearly circular path.

This view should have been confirmed by the apparent motions of two other planets, Venus and Mercury, which were found to remain always within a certain apparent distance from the sun, never being seen on the part of the sky opposite to him. Venus, the brighter, was observed to have the greater range on either side of the sun, moving from about 46° on the east of the sun, when she is seen as the Evening Star, to about the same distance on the west of the sun, when she is seen as the Morning Star; while Mercury’s greatest range on either side of the sun is more variable, being sometimes as great as 27°, and at other times not greater than 18°. So far as the motion of these planets on the star-sphere could be traced (by using such an instrument as in fig. 9 to determine their right ascension and declination), they appeared to follow looped paths, somewhat like the outer planets; but the nearer and farther parts of the successive loops were both lost to view, the two planets being always too near the sun’s place in the heavens to be visible when tracing those parts of their paths.

The five planets were found to travel always within a certain range on either side of the ecliptic, Venus, which has the greatest range, being sometimes as far as 9° north, or 9° south of the equator. A zone, or band, having the ecliptic for its central circle, and bounded by circles 9° north and south of the ecliptic, so as to be 18° wide, came thus to be regarded as a sort of celestial roadway, outside of which the planets were never seen. This zone was called the zodiac, and it was probably in connection with the planetary rather than the solar motions that the zodiacal constellations were originally formed.

Considering the observed relation between the motions of all the five planets and those of the sun, it is remarkable that any of the astronomers of old time should have regarded the earth as the common centre of solar and planetary movement. It is true that, by supposing each planet to travel around a centre which itself travelled round the earth, the looped paths of the planets might be explained; of this no further evidence need be given than fig. 17, where it is manifest that the loops are such as might be traced by bodies moving round small circles, these being carried round the central earth in large circles. Yet the synchronism between all the movements in these small circles and the sun’s supposed motion round the earth, was left wholly unexplained by that theory. If the Ptolemaic system could have been really presented as it is commonly pictured (fig. 18), it would have compared not unfavourably with the simpEcity of the modern system. But the circles depicted in this figure for the paths of Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Venus, and Mercury, represent only the paths of moving centres, round which those bodies were supposed to travel, each in a circle of its own, and all synchronising in these subordinate movements with the sun circling in his special orbit; while the movements of the moon, travelling in a different circle, neither corresponded in any way with those of the sun, nor, like his, seemed to influence any of the planetary motions.

Far more reasonable was the ancient Egyptian system, by some described as identical with, but in any case closely resembling in essentials, the system of Tycho Brahe, shown in fig. 19. Here the earth is the centre of the motions of the sun and moon, but all the planets circle around the sun, Venus and Mercury moving in orbits passing between the earth and sun, while Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn move in orbits passing outside the earth. AU the observed movements, and all the pecuEarities of the observed relations, were fuUy explained by this system. Indeed, a little consideration will show that the geometrical relations are precisely the same for such a system as is depicted in fig. 19, as they would be in the system pictured by removing the circle showing the sun’s orbit in fig. 19, and substituting a circle of equal size around the sun as centre, and passing therefore through the centre of the earth. It is not too much to say that Tycho’s system is not only fully equal to the Copernican in its fitness to explain the observed relations, but that, until the law of gravitation had been established, the arguments for the Tychonic system, modified so as to correspond to Kepler’s discovery of the shapes of the different orbits, were almost equal in weight to those used by the disciples of Copernicus. The slight advantage of the Copernican system in point of simpEcity was counterbalanced by the difficulty of accepting, in those days, the beEef that the stars lie at so inconceivably vast a distance that the motion of the earth in an enormous orbit around the sun (for the sun was known even then to lie many miEione of miles from [9:2:778] us) produces no perceptible change in the appearance and rotation of the star-sphere. That the whole span of the earth’s orbit was as a mere point compared with the distance of the stars, so that the earth on one side of the sun was, in effect, at the centre of the star-sphere, while it was equally at the centre when on the opposite side, or many millions of miles from its former position, was not unreasonably regarded by Tycho Brahe as scarcely credible.

Chapter VI.— Copernican System,—Kepler’s Laws— Gravitation—The Laws of the Solar System.

Leaving the rotation of the star-sphere out of consideration, the apparent motions of the sun, the moon, and the five planets known to the ancients, are most naturally explained by regarding the sun as the centre around which Mercury, Venus, the earth, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn revolve in that order as to distance, while the moon revolves round the earth. For though there are thus two centres of motion, yet only a small body travelling in a relatively small orbit is set revolving round the earth, now presented as a subordinate orb in the system; and the whole family, including the moon, are set revolving around the sun, for the moon accompanies the earth in her circuit. In the Tychonic system the sun, though presented aβ a subordinate orb, because travelling round the earth, was yet set as the centre round which all the planets revolved. Either system was, however, altogether more reasonable than the Ptolemaic, in which all the planète were supposed to move around imaginary centres. Copernicus well indicated the superiority of his system when he said, “We find in this arrangement what can be discerned in no other scheme, an admirable symmetry of the universe, an harmonious disposition of the orbits. For who could assign to the lamp of this beautiful temple a better position than the centre, whence alone it can illuminate all parts at once Î Here the sun, as from a kingly throne, sways the family of orbs that circle around him.”

It is hardly necessary to point out that the arrangement suggested by Copernicus explains the motions of the sun and moon as readily as the system which presents both these bodies as moving around the earth. Peculiarities in the motions of the earth and moon are indeed left unaccounted for by a simple theory of uniform circular motion around the sun and earth as centres; but so they were in the Ptolemaic system until eccentric and epicyclic movements were provided, and these were as admissible in the Copernican theory aβ in the Ptolemaic. It is easy to show also that the general motions of the planets—their progressions, stations, retrogressions, &c.—were explained by the Copernican system. Thus, let S (fig. 20) be the sun, E 1 E 2 E , <tc., the earth’s orbit, P l P 2 P 3 , &c., part of the orbit of a superior planet; and when the earth is at E 1 let the planet be at P 1 , so that the planet is in opposition to the sun when at P 1 . Starting from these positions, suppose that the earth and planet in the same interval of time pass over the arcs E 1 E 3 and P 1 P 2 , E 1 E 2 being greater than P 1 P 2 ∙ Then obviously E 2 P 2 is inclined to E 1 P 1 ; and if these two lines are produced they will meet beyond P r Let them be produced beyond their point of intersection 0 to K 1 , K 2 respectively; then the observer on the earth sees the planet in direction E 1 K 1 when the earth is at E 1 , and in direction E 2 K 2 when the earth is at E a . Hence the planet appears to have moved in direction K 1 K 2 or backwards, though it has really moved in direction P 1 P 2 ∙ Carrying the earth on with her more rapid motion, it is obvious that we come to a part E 3 E 4 of the earth’s orbit, where her motion is so inclined to the line of sight E 3 P 3 or E 4 P 4 to the planet, that the effect of the earth’s more rapid motion is neutralised, and these lines of sight are parallel. At this time, then, the planet neither seems to advance nor retrograde, but appears to be stationary. After this it is manifest that the planet will seem to advance, and with gradually increasing rapidity, until when the earth is at E 5 and the planet at P s (the planet, however, being then in conjunction with the sun, and therefore invisible), the planet lies in direction E 3 P s far in advance of K 1 , K 2 . At this time the unseen planet is advancing most rapidly, because the earth’s motion, as from E 3 to E β , and the planet’s motion, as from P 5 to P 6 , combine to cause the advance of the direction of the line E li P 6 ,—the centre round which for the moment the direction-line to the planet is turning lying at O' between the earth and planet, instead of beyond the planet, as at O in the position first considered. Passing from conjunction to opposition, the planet goes through similar changes in a reverse order. Its progressive motion gradually diminishes, till it becomes stationary; thence the planet retrogrades through opposition to its next station; and so on continually, the total result of its motion in each synodical revolution being a progression from west to east. We see also that the planet is in opposition when in the middle of its retrograde arc, while it is in conjunction when in the middle of its larger arc of progression. All this corresponds precisely with the observed relations.

The same reasoning applies to the case of an inferior planet. In fact, we may employ the same figure for this case as for that of a superior planet. Thus, suppose P 1 P 2 P 3 (fig. 20) the earth’s orbit, and E 1 E 2 E 3 , &c., that of an inferior planet, and let the motions be as in the former case, then the same lines represent the direction-lines, only the observer looks along these lines in the contrary direction. Now we see that the direction-lines P 1 E 1 , P 2 E 2 are carried backwards as viewed from P 1 , P 2 , until they reach the parallel positions P 3 E 3 , P 4 E 4 , at which time the observer on P sees the planet E at a stationary point. After that the direction-lines are carried forward, until, when the earth is at P s and the interior planet at Ε ά , this planet is seen in direction P 5 E 3 , or far in advance of its former direction P 1 E j . And at this time, as is seen by the position of the lines P 5 E 5 and P 6 E 6 , the inferior planet is advancing most rapidly. In fact, all the motions of an inferior planet viewed from a superior one are precisely the same as those of the superior planet viewed from the inferior one, but are traced out on opposite parts of the heavens,—a thesis which needs no other proof than the fact, that the line of sight from the inferior to the superior planet is also the line of sight from the superior to the inferior planet; so that, whatever point the superior planet viewed from the inferior appears to occupy in the starsphere at any moment, the point directly opposite is that occupied by the inferior planet as viewed from the superior.
[9:2:779]

The only difference in the apparent motions of the inferior planet is that resulting from the position of this planet with respect to the sun. When P 1 Î3 viewed from E 1 (fig. 20), it is seen directly opposite the sun; but E 1 viewed from P 1 lies in the same direction as the sun, and is therefore invisible. This corresponds with the observed fact that Venus and Mercury are iu conjunction with the sun, not only in the middle of their advancing arcs, but also in the middle of their arc of retrogradation.

But although the Copernican theory explains the general features of planetary motion, it could not, as originally advanced, explain those features which had rendered necessary the eccentrics and the subordinate epicycles of the Ptolemaic system. It was known to Copernicus that the earth does not move uniformly in a circle around the sun as centre, but on an eccentric path with varying velocity. He might, therefore, reasonably assume that the other planets have paths similarly eccentric, and move with varying velocities. But he thought it necessary to explain the planetary motions by uniform motion in circles, using such contrivances to save appearances as the Ptolemaic system had rendered familiar to astronomers. Suppose, for example, that S (fig. 21) is the sun, A the place of a planet when at its greatest distance from the sun, and A' its place when nearest to the sun, C being the bisection of AA'; draw a circle aba'b' with centre C, and any radius less than CA, and with a as centre draw circle AKK'; then if a point revolve round the circle AKK' in that direction in the same time that the centre of this circle travels round the circle aba'b ’ in that direction, the point will trace out an ellipse, having C as centre. This is easily proved. For let Cα = R, αA = r, and put CA = R+ r = α and CK' = R — r = b = CB. When the moving point is at P, let the centre of the small circle be at p. The angular velocities being equal, pC and y>P are inclined to αC at the same angle; let this be a. Then the co-ordinates of P parallel to CA and Cδ are—

X = (R + r) cos. α = a cos. a y = (R - r) sin. a = b sin. a

Whence b 2 x s + a 2 y 2 = a 2 b 2 , the equation to an ellipse having C as centre, CA and CB as semi-axes. S will not be the focus of this ellipse, unless SB = CA; and even then the velocities will not be those observed of a planet revolving around S in the elliptic orbit ABA'B'—for the time from A to B will be one-fourth of the period, whereas in the case of a planet the time from A to B bears to the period the ratio of the area ASB to the area of the ellipse, a ratio exceeding one-fourth. Nevertheless, observed appearances were to some degree explained by the motion illustrated in fig. 21, seeing that at A, or when farthest from the centre S, the tracing point moves most slowly, having there the difference of the velocities due to the two circular motions; while at A' the point moves most quickly, having there the sum of these velocities. And when Copernicus advanced his theory, observations had not been made with sufficient exactness to prove the insufficiency of such an explanation in any case save that of the moon's motion round the earth.

Tycho Brahe, however, having completed a series of observations of Mars, the nearest planet moving on a manifestly eccentric orbit, Kepler tested the theory of Copernicus in order to ascertain whether any ellipse, described as ABA'B' in fig. 21, could account for the observed positions of the planet. It will be seen that, while the points S, A, and A' in his inquiry were fixed, and therefore C also fixed, the point a might be taken nearer or further from A within certain limits, these limits being determined by the observed fact, that when near B and B' the planet was not nearer to C by a distance Βό exceeding a certain moderate amount, such as the probable error of Tycho Brahe’s observations permitted Kepler to assume.

It was after trying nineteen such arrangements, and rejecting them one after the other as he found them disproved by Tycho Brahe’s observations, that Kepler was led at last to abandon the attempt to explain the motions of Mars by combining circular uniform motions. Passing to the ellipse, as the curve which Mars appeared to follow, and testing various empiric laws of motion in an elliptic orbit, he at length lighted upon the actual relation, presented in his first two laws as true for all the planets, though actually proved only in the case of Mars. The laws are these—

1. Every planet moves in an elliptical orbit, in one focus of which the sun is situated.

2. The line drawn from the sun to a planet, or the radiusvector of the planet, sweeps over equal areas in equal times.

The second law may be thus illustrated. Let ABA'B' (fig. 22) be the elliptic path of a planet about the sun S, in the focus of the ellipse whose axes are ACSA' and BCB ’.

Let P be the period in which the planet performs the complete circuit of its orbit, and let T be the time occupied by the planet in traversing any arc pp' of its orbit. Then joining Sp, Sj>',

T: P:: eectorial area pSp' : area of the ellipse ABA'B'.

It remained new to discover if any law connected the [9:2:780] periods in which the planets pursue their different paths. He did not at first try to connect the periods and the distances by any direct numerical relation, probably because he had recognised in the second law the probable existence of geometrical relations. But after many years of inquiry he arrived at the conclusion, that probably the required law connected the powers of the numbers representing the periods and the distances. It affords a strange evidence of the ponderous nature of Kepler’s movements, that after this idea had occurred to him, ten weeks, instead of some ten minutes, elapsed before he had verified it. The law connecting the periods and distances—Kepler’s third law—is this—

3. The square of the numbers representing the periodic times of the planets vary as the cubes of the numbers representing their mean distances.

Or thus, If D, d be the distances of any two planets, and P, p their respective periods, then

P 2 :p 2 :: D 3 : d 3 . . . . (1).

From this law we can deduce a convenient relation between the velocities in circular orbits (a relation holding approximately for the mean velocities in orbits nearly circular like those of the planets). Let V, v be the velocities in the orbits of planets whose distances are D, d respectively; then, obviously,

V = > and υ = c- > where c is some constant.

It may be well also to notice the following relation between the angular velocities in such orbits. Let these, for the respective planets just dealt with, be Ω and ω. Then,

(It is manifest that — = p ’ because the periods must be inversely proportional to the angular velocities with which they are uniformly described.)

The three laws of Kepler are approximately true for bodies circling around the same centre. They do not apply to bodies circling around different centres. For instance, the moon’s distance and period could not be used for p and d in (1). Nor could the distance and period of any one of the satellites of Jupiter pair, according to Kepler’s third law, with the distance and period either of our moon or of any planet; but the motions of the satellites were found to accord with the law when compared together.

It was probably the recognition of this fact which first put'astronomers on the track of the theory that the law depends on some force residing in the centres round which different bodies move. Newton certainly had given attention to this influence before he dealt with the moon’s attraction earthwards as a case of the action of terrestrial gravity. But, be that as it may, it is certain that so soon as the action of the earth’s attraction on the moon had been demonstrated by him he extended the law of gravitation to all cases of motion around a central orb. It then became clear that the laws of Kepler are consequences of the general law of gravitation—the law, viz., that Every particle of matter in the universe attracts every other particle with a force varying directly as the masses, and inversely as the square of the distances.

The proof of the law of gravitation divides itself into three distinct parts :—

First, The proof that the force acting on the moon is equal to the force of terrestrial gravity, reduced as the inverse squares of the distances of the moon and of a point on the earth’s surface, from the centre of the earth.

Secondly, The proof that a system of bodies circling around a central body like the sun, attracting them with a force inversely proportionate to their respective distances, would obey the laws of Kepler, or some modification of those laws, giving results according with the motions actually observed.

Thirdly, The proof that the mutual attractions of the several members of any system, and the attractions of members of one system on bodies belonging to another system (as, for instance, of the sun upon the moon regarded as a dependent of the earth), would result in such perturbations from the paths due to the attractions of the central body as are observed actually to take place.

Neither the second nor the third of these arguments can be given here, though certain simple relations involved in them, as also certain consequences, will be mentioned.

The first part of the proof is altogether simple.

The moon is, roughly, at a distance from the earth’s centre equal to 60 radii of the earth, and therefore the earth’s moving force is less on her than on a body at the earth’s surface as 1 to 3600. Now, regarding the moon’s orbit as a circle, it is easily shown that, if at any moment the earth’s attraction ceased to act, so that for the next second the moon moved on a tangent to her present course, her distance from the earth’s centre at the end of that second would be rather more than τ ⅛th of an inch greater than at the beginning of the second. It follows that her fall towards the earth in a second on account of the earth’s attraction amounts to rather less than -⅛ of an inch. But the fall of a body near the earth’s surface is about 16 ι ⅛ feet, or nearly 193 inches per second, or nearly 193 × 19 times greater than the fall of the moon towards the earth per second; that is, about 3600 times greater. In other words, the moon is attracted towards the earth precisely as she would be if the force of gravity acting on bodies near her surface ruled her also, the law of variation of the force with distance being that of the inverse squares.

The second part of the proof is simple for cases of circular motion of various bodies around a common centre. The law of the equable description of areas, indeed, is true for a body moving around a centre attracting according to any law, since it simply implies that there is no force perpendicular to the radius vector. It is easily seen that the increase of the area during any exceedingly short interval of time depends solely on the distance attained by the moving body during that interval from the line representing the position of the radius vector at the beginning of the interval, this distance being measured in a perpendicular direction; for the area of a triangle is measured by the base × perpendicular. Accordingly, if, during the short interval of time, there is no force tending to increase or diminish the perpendicular distance of the moving body from the original radius vector, as compared with the distance which would have been attained had no force at all acted, the area described will be the same as though no force had acted. But if no force acted, the body would move uniformly in a straight line, and the radius vector would sweep out equal areas, because triangles having the same vertex and their bases in one straight line have areas [9:2:781] proportional to their bases. Hence, under a force not tending to change at any instant the rate of the moving body’s perpendicular departure from the radius vector, the areas swept over in equal times will be equal· But a central force acts always in the direction of the radius vector, and is therefore a force of the kind supposed. Accordingly, a body travelling round an attracting centre will move so that the radius vector sweeps over equal areas in equal times.

Suppose next two bodies describing circles with uniform motion in periods P, p, at distances D and d from a centre of attraction whose force varies inversely as (distance) 2 . It is required to determine the relation between P, p, D, and d. The velocities of the bodies are c -=r and c - t where ι . . P c is some constant. Represent these velocities by V and V respectively for convenience; also call the forces acting on the bodies respectively F and ∕, which we know to be proportional to^ and ~ · Clearly, if a body moving in any direction receives a very slight impulse in a direction at right angles to its motion, its direction of motion will be changed through an angle proportional directly to the impulse and inversely to the velocity of the body. So that if we regard the attractive force on the planets as acting by a succession of small impulses, the momentary F

variation of direction is proportional to y > and the time, therefore, of completing any given change of direction is

V proportional toy Now, in times P, p respectively, the two planets have their direction changed through four right angles. Hence

V V T) τv d , P : p :: F : f ' ' P * D: p ’ ’

That is, P 2 : p 2 :: D 3 : d 3 , which is Kepler’s third law.

Let us now compare the periods P and p of two bodies, moving at distances D and d, around unequal centres of force, which exert attractions A and a respectively at equal distances, so that instead of the forces F and f actually exerted on the two bodies being proportional to an ^ ^2>

A. Of they are proportional to and ^-respectively.

Then the above proportion becomes

D D 2 d cP ι -> , :: p'r>' 7’

That is, P≈: p≈:: ®-: y , or P 1 κ , corresponding to a law which may be thus expressed: The squares of the periods about different centres of force vary directly as the cubes of the distances, and inversely as the attractions of the centres of force at a unit of distance.

This relation which is true for elliptic orbits, is general for all systems, and gives the means of comparing the masses of different systems. But it is necessary to observe a modification which Kepler’s third law and this extension of it have to undergo to make them strictly true (as regards, at least, the unperturbed motions of the planets). The masses of the planets, though very small, yet bear definite relations to the sun, and instead of considering each planet as swayed by the sun’s mass, we must regard each as swayed by the sum of its own mass and the sun’s, supposed to be gathered at the sun’s centre. Thus we must regard the planets as revolving around centres of different attractive energy; Jupiter round a centre equal in mass to Jupiter and the sun; Saturn round a centre equal in mass to Saturn and the sun, &c. Instead, then, of the ratio being constant for the solar sys tem, we find that this ratio for any given planet is proportional to the sun’s mass added to that planet’s. Extending the law to bodies travelling around different centres, it runs as follows :—

If a body of mass m revolves round a centre of mass M in time P, and at a mean distance D, and another body of mass m ’ revolves round another centre of mass M' in time P', and at a mean distance D', then

D 3 D' 3 P 2 (M-Mr) - P≡(M z +m') ’

This law enables us at once to compare the sums of the masses when we know the mean distances and periods. For it may be written

M+m D 3 P' 2 M'+m' “D' 3 ’ P 2

Also, where m and m' are both small, compared with M and M' respectively, the law becomes simplified into

M _ ι Ff M'” D' 3 ’ P 2 *

These laws suffice to enable us to deduce from the observed periods of the planets their true mean distances, velocities, <fcc., and from the observed period of the satellite of any planet, the ratio of the planet’s mass to the sun’s. The eccentricities of the planetary orbits are partly deduced from observation, and partly from the law of the equable description of areas. The inclinations of the orbits, and, of course, all elements relating to the planets’ own globes, their dimensions, compression, inclination, rotation, and so on, are obtained by telescopic observation and measurement.

The following tables of elements are brought into one place for convenience of reference, and include many items of information referred to in the chapters on the several planets. The illustrative Plates numbered XXVII. and XXVIII. should be studied in combination with the table of planetary elements.

We may conveniently add here to the laws of planetary motion presented above the two following theorems (enunciated by Lagrange, but first established by Laplace).

First, If the mass of each planet be multiplied by the square of the eccentricity, and this product by the square root of the mean distance, the sum of the products thus formed will be invariable.

Secondly, If the mass of each planet be multiplied by the square of the tangent of the orbit’s inclination to a fixed plane, and this product by the square root of the mean distance, the sum of the products thus formed will be invariable.

These laws ensure the stability of the system. It is true that the whole eccentricity, if it could by any possibility fall on any one planet (except Jupiter or Saturn), would cause the planet’s orbit to interfere with the orbits of other planets, or even, in the case of a small planet, to intersect the sun’s globe. Yet the interchange of eccentricities can never lead to this result. In fact, the sum of the products (mass) × (eccentricity') 2 × (mean distance)* for Jupiter and Saturn will always largely exceed the sum of all such products for the remaining planets.

The fixed plane from which the inclination is to be measured, in the second law, is nearly identical with the plane of Jupiter’s orbit. Its inclination to the ecliptic is about l o 35∣', and the longitude of the node (in 1850) was about 104° 21'. Comparing these values with the corresponding elements on next page, we see that the inclina tion of the planetary orbits would have a smaller mean value if estimated from the invariable plane than they had as estimated from the plane of the ecliptic.

Chapter VII.— The Sun—Sun Spots—Rotation of the Sun —His Physical Constitution and Surroundings—Prominences—Corona—Zodiacal Light.

The sun, the central and ruling body of the planetary system, and the source of light and heat to our earth and all the members of that system, is a globe about 852,900 miles in diameter. So far as observation extends, his figure iβ perfectly spherical, no difference having been observed between his polar and spherical diameters. It has been well remarked, indeed, by Sir G. Airy, that if any observer could by ordinary inodes of measurement satisfy himself that a real difference existed between the diameters, that observer would have proved the inexactness of his own work; for the absence of any measurable compression comes out as the result of comparisons between thousands of observations of the sun’s limbs made at Greenwich and other leading observatories. The volume of the sun exceeds the earth’s 1,252,700 times. His mean density is almost exactly one-fourth of the earth’s, and his mass exceeds hers about 316,000 times. Gravity at the surface of the sun exceeds terrestrial gravity about 27 T times, so that a body dropped from rest near the sun’s surface would fall through 436 feet in the first second, and have acquired a velocity of 872 feet per second.

Viewed with the naked eye, the sun appears only as a luminous mass of intense and uniform brightness; but when examined with the telescope, his surface is frequently observed to be mottled over with a number of dark spots, of irregular and ill-defined forms, constantly varying in appearance, situation, and magnitude. These spots are occasionally of immense size, so as to be visible even without the aid of the telescope; and their number is frequently so great that they occupy a considerable portion of the sun’s surface. Sir W. Herschel observed one in 1779, the diameter of which exceeded 50,000 miles, more than six times the diameter of the earth; and Scheiner affirms that he has seen no less than fifty on the sun’s disk at once. Most of them have a deep black nucleus, surrounded by a fainter shade, or umbra, of which the inner part, nearest to the nucleus, is brighter than the exterior portion. The boundary between the nucleus and umbra is in general tolerably well defined; and beyond the umbra a stripe of light appears more vivid than the rest of the sun.

The discovery of the sun’s spots has been attributed to Fabricius, Galileo, and Scheiner, and has been claimed for the English astronomer Harriot. Amidst these conflicting pretensions it is perhaps impossible to arrive at the truth; but the matter is of little importance; the discovery is one which followed inevitably that of the telescope, and an accidental priority of observation can hardly be considered as establishing any claim to merit.

The solar spots furnish an extensive subject of curious speculation. They are, first, interesting on account of their establishing the fact of the rotation of the sun, and affording the means of determining its period. Let M, M', M*, fig. 23, be the successive positions of a spot on the surface of the sun on different days. Then, correction being made for the earth’s advance during these days, M, M', M* will represent the apparent path of the spot on the sun’s disk. This path, as thus corrected, is in general an oval slightly differing from an eclipse; and it is found that all the spots observed at the same time describe similar and parallel curves. They also return to'the same relative positions in the same time, and their period is about 27⅜ days.

The paths described by the spots undergo veιy considerable changes, according to the season of the year at which they are observed. About the end of November and beginning of December they appear simply as straight lines, Mm, M'm , , M"m" (fig. 24), along which the spots move in the direction Mm; that is, they enter on the eastern and disappear on the western edge of the sun’s disk, and the points at which they disappear are more elevated, or nearer the north pole of the ecliptic than those at which they enter. After a certain time the lines Mm, &c., begin to assume a curved appearance. During the winter and spring the [9:2:784] convexity of the ovals is turned towards the north pole of the ecliptic; but their inclination, or rather the inclination of the straight lines joining their extreme points, to the plane of the ecliptic continues to diminish, and about the beginning of March disappears ; so that the points at which they seem to enter and leave the sun’s disk are equally elevated, as in fig. 25. From this time the curvature of the ovals diminishes; they become narrower and narrower till about the end of May or beginning of June, when they again appear under the form of straight lines (fig. 26); but their inclination to the ecliptic is now precisely in a contrary direction to what it had been six months before. After this they begin again to expand, and their convexity is now turned towards the south pole. Their inclinations also vary at the same time, and about the commencement of September they are seen as represented in fig. 27; the points at which they enter and disappear being again equally elevated. After this period the ovals begin to contract and become inclined to the ecliptic, and by the beginning of December they have exactly the same direction and inclination as they had the previous year.

These phenomena are renewed every year in the same order, and the same phases are always exhibited at corresponding seasons. Hence it is evident that they depend on a uniform and regular cause, which is common to all of them, since the orbits described by the various spots are exactly parallel, and subject in all respects to the same variations. The true explanation of the phenomena was early recognised by Galileo, who maintained that the spots belong to the surface of the sun, and that the sun uniformly revolves round an axis inclined to the axis of the ecliptic.

From four different combinations of equations, derived from eleven observations of the same spot, Delambre computed the following table of the elements of rotation :—
[table]

With regard to observations of the sun’s spots, for the purpose of determining the rotation, Delambre remarked that he attached little value to them,—first, because it is impossible to make them well; and secondly, because (as he erroneously supposed) they could only lead to results of little importance. He discussed a hundred different spots, each observed at least three times by Messier, and deduced thirty different determinations of the elements of rotation. The more he multiplied his calculations, the more certain he became of the impossibility of a good solution ; of which, indeed, there is no other chance than in a compensation of errors, little probable on account of their enormous magnitudes. These discrepancies have been accounted for in recent times, chiefly through the labours of Mr Carrington. It had been suspected that the spots, besides partaking of the general motion of the solar globe, have also proper motions occasioned either by displacement or by a change of form. Carrington not only succeeded in proving that both these causes operate, but also in recognising systematic proper motions of the spots at rates depending on their solar latitude. It would not be possible to assign definitely the nature of such proper motions, simply because we do not know the normal rotation rate of the sun; and therefore we are compelled, in describing Carrington’s results, to speak of varying rotation rates, although it can hardly be doubted that the sun’s globe, as a whole, has a definite rate of rotation, and that all the seeming variations from this rate are due to proper motions of the spots. Adopting, however, the only available method of describing Carrington’s results, the following table represents the various rotation rates for different solar latitudes in both hemispheres: —
[table]

It is noteworthy that in each southern latitude the rotation is less than in the corresponding northern latitude, yet the difference is too small to admit of our attaching at present any considerable importance to this indication. Taking the mean between the results for the northern and southern hemispheres, Mr Carrington has deduced the following empiric formula for the rotation rates in different solar latitudes :—

Let ξ be the angle through which a part of the sun in latitude λ rotates in one day; then

£= 14° 25'-165'sinΛλ .

Sporer, who has made similar observations, deduces the law i= 16° ∙8475 - 3 0, 3812 (sin.λ+ 41° 13').

The following elements have been deduced from the results by Carrington and Sporer (for the year 1869) :—
[table]

The general appearance of the sun’s disk, when much [9:2:785] marked with spots, is shown in fig. 28, which presents the aspect of the sun, seen with a small telescope on September 25, 1870, as drawn by Mr Proctor. Three views of spots, as seen with large telescopes, are presented in figs. 29, 30, and 31, which show the same spot in different stages of its history, as observed at the Harvard Observatory, Cam bridge, U.S., in March and April 1870. These views, though showing the spots as they have only been seen with the improved instruments of our day, will serve to illustrate the following account of the history of research into these objects better than pictures resembling the imperfect drawings made by the first observers.

The phenomena of the solar spots, as observed by Scheiner and Hevelius, may be summed up in the following particulars 1. Every spot which has a nucleus, or comparatively dark part, has also an umbra, or fainter shade surrounding it. 2. The boundary between the nucleus and umbra is always distinct and well defined. 3. The increase of a spot is gradual, the breadth of the nucleus and umbra dilating at the same time. 4. In like manner the decrease of a spot is gradual, the breadth of the nucleus and umbra contracting at the same time. 5. The exterior boundary of the umbra never consists of sharp angles, but is always curvilinear, how irregular soever the outline of the nucleus may be. 6. The nucleus of a spot, whilst on the decrease, often changes its figure by the umbra encroaching irregularly upon it, insomuch that in a small space of time new encroachments are discernible, whereby the boundary between the nucleus and umbra is perpetually varying. 7. It often happens, by these encroachments, that the nucleus of a spot is divided into two or more nuclei. 8. The nuclei of the spots vanish sooner than the umbrae. 9. Small umbrae are often seen without nuclei. 10. An umbra of any considerable size is seldom seen without a nucleus in the middle of it. 11. When a spot which consisted of a nucleus and umbra is about to disappear, if it is not succeeded by a facula or spot brighter than the rest of the disk, the place where it was is soon after not distinguishable from the rest.

In the Philosophical Transactions, vol. lxiv. (1774), Dr Alexander Wilson, professor of astronomy at Glasgow, gave a dissertation on the nature of the solar spots, in which he mentioned the following appearances :—1. When the spot is about to disappear on the western edge of the sun’s limb, the eastern part of the umbra first contracts, then vanishes, the nucleus and western part of the umbra remaining; then the nucleus gradually contracts and vanishes, while the western part only of the umbra remains. At last this disappears also; and if the spot remains long enough to become again visible, the eastern part of the umbra first becomes visible, then the nucleus; and when the spot approaches the middle of the disk, the nucleus appears environed by the umbra on all sides, as already mentioned. 2. When two spots lie very near to one another, the umbra is deficient on that side which lies next to the other spot; and this will be the case, though a large spot should be contiguous to one much smaller; the umbra of the large spot will be totally wanting on that side next the small one. If there are little spots on each side of the large one, the umbra does not totally vanish, but appears flattened or pressed in towards the nucleus on each side. When the little spots disappear, the umbra of the large one extends itself as usual. This circumstance, he observes, may sometimes prevent the disappearance of the umbra in the manner above mentioned; so that the western umbra may disappear before the nucleus if a small spot happens to break out on that side.

These observations led Dr Wilson to adopt the opinion, [9:2:786] that ths appearances of the spots are occasioned by real excavations in the solar globe. He supposed the sun to consist of a dark nucleus, covered only to a certain depth by a luminous matter, not fluid, through which openings are occasionally made by volcanic or other energies, permitting the solid nucleus of the sun to be seen; and that the umbra which surrounds the spot is occasioned by a partial admission of the light upon the shelving sides of the boundary opposite to the observer. It is evident that, in proportion as these excavations are seen obliquely, their apparent dimensions will be diminished; one of the edges will disappear as it approaches the sun’s limb, or come more into view as it advances towards the middle of the disk; when the spot is about to leave the disk, the bottom of the excavation, or the nucleus seen through it, will first disappear, but a sort of faint or obscure spot will remain visible as long as the visual ray penetrates the cavity.

Dr Wilson’s theory was keenly combated by Lalande, who adduced several observations of his own, and some by Cassini, that could not be explained by means of it; and urged with reason that an hypothesis, founded on the uniformity of appearances which in reality are exceedingly variable, was entitled to little consideration. Lalande himself supposed the spots to be scoriae which have settled or fixed themselves on the summits of the solar mountains; an opinion which he grounded on the circumstance that some large spots which had disappeared for several years were observed to form themselves again at the identical points at which they had vanished.

Sir William Herschel, with a view to ascertain more accurately the nature of the sun, made frequent observations upon it from the year 1779 to the year 1794. He imagined the dark spots on the sun to be mountains, which, considering the great attraction exerted by the sun upon bodies placed at its surface, and the slow revolution it has upon its axis, he thought might be more than 300 miles high, and yet stand very firmly. He says that in August 1792 he examined the sun with several powers from 90 to 500, when it evidently appeared that the dark spots are the opaque ground or body of the sun, and that the luminous part is an atmosphere, through which, when interrupted or broken, we obtain a view of the sun itself. Hence he concluded that the sun has a very extensive atmosphere, consisting of elastic fluids that are more or less lucid and transparent, and of which the lucid ones furnish us with light. This atmosphere, he thought, cannot be less than 1843 nor more than 2765 miles in height; and he supposed that the density of the luminous solar clouds needs not be much more than that of our aurora borealis, in order to produce the effects with which we are acquainted. The sun, then, if this hypothesis be admitted, “is similar to the other globes of the solar system with regard to its solidity, its atmosphere, its surface diversified with mountains and valleys, its rotation on its axis, and the fall of heavy bodies on its surface; it therefore appears to be a very eminent, large, and lucid planet, the primary one in our system, disseminating its light and heat to all the bodies with which it is connected.”

Herschel supposed that there are two regions or strata of solar clouds; that the inferior stratum is opaque, and probably not unlike our own atmosphere, while the superior is the repository of light, which it darts forth in vast quantities in all directions. The inferior clouds act as a curtain to screen the body of the sun from the intense brilliancy and heat of the superior regions, and, by reflecting back nearly one-half of the rays which they receive from the luminous clouds, contribute also greatly to increase the quantity of light which the latter send forth into space, and thereby perform an important function in the economy of the solar system. The luminous clouds prevent us in general from seeing the solid nucleus of the sun; but in order to account for the spots, he supposes an empyreal elastic gas to be constantly forming at the surface, which, carried upwards by reason of its inferior density, forces its way through the planetary or lower clouds, and mixing itself with the gases which have their residence in the superior stratum, causes decomposition of the luminous matter, and gives rise to those appearances which he describes under the name of corrugations. Through the openings made by this accidental removal of the luminous clouds, the solid body of the sun becomes visible, which, not being lucid, gives the appearance of the dark spots or nuclei seen through the telescope. The length of time during which the spots continue visible renders it evident that the luminous matter of the sun cannot be of a liquid or gaseous nature; for, in either case, the vacuity made up by its accidental removal would instantly be filled up, and the uniformity of appearance invariably maintained.

But, perhaps, the most important of all the discoveries which have been made respecting the sun spots, are those which relate to the variation of these objects in number, and in the amount of solar area which they cover. We owe the initiation of observations on these points to Schwabe of Dessau. They were commenced in the year 1826, and continued without intermission, except in one case, during the astronomer’s illness, for forty-six years. Before many years had elapsed, Schwabe discovered that the spots wax and wane in frequency in a period of about eleven years. At the time of spot-minimum the sun remains often for several days not only clear of spots, but with a singular smoothness of aspect, even the minute mottlings ordinarily seen on his surface either passing away for a time or becoming less conspicuous than usual. From such an epoch there is a gradual return to the spotted condition, and usually in four or five years the maximum of spot-frequency is reached; then there is a more gradual reduction, until, in rather more than eleven years on the average, the minimum is reached. The table on page 787 indicates the facts actually observed by Schwabe between 1826 and 1868, supplemented by observations of a similar kind made at the Kew Observatory to the year 1871.

It will be seen that the law of variation is not uniformly periodic; the intervals between maximum and maximum are not strictly equal, and the maxima are neither equal nor similar.

The researches of Μ. De la Rue and his assistants Stewart and Loewy have indicated further laws of variation, apparently connecting the changes of spot-frequency with the movements of the planets Mercury, Venus, the earth, and Jupiter. According to their views the great eleven-year period would correspond with the periodic revolution of Jupiter. It is, however, noteworthy that Professor Wolf of Zurich estimates the spot period at 1141 years,—a period differing too much from Jupiter’s to accord with De la Rue’s theory. And Carrington notes that, whereas certain epochs of spot-maxima accord with the passage by Jupiter of his perihelion, others accord almost as exactly with Jupiter’s aphelion passage. Yet Wolf accepts the theory of planetary influence. “He finds,” says Sir John Herschel, “that a perceptibly greater apparent activity prevails annually, on the average, in the months of September to January, than in the other months of the year; and, again, by projecting all the results in a continuous curve, he finds a series of small undulations succeeding each other at an average interval of 7'65 months, or 0'637 of a year. Now the periodic time of Venus, reduced to a fraction of a year, is 0'616,—a coincidence certainly[9:2:787] near enough to warrant some considerable suspicion of a physical connection.” A longer period, during which the spot-maxima would seem to vary, has been suspected by Wolf. It was suggested by Mr Proctor in 1865, and Prof. Loomis (of Yale College, U.S.) has since advocated the theory, that this period corresponds to the successive conjunctions of Saturn and Jupiter; but the connection is doubtful.
[table]

One of the most interesting results following Schwabe’s great discovery was the recognition of an association between the sun-spot period and magnetic disturbances on the earth. Lamont of Munich had independently discovered, in 1850, that the mean daily range of the magnetic declination varies in a period of about ten years. Two years later, General Sabine and Professors Wolf and Gautier noted the coincidence of this period and that of the solar spots. Wolf afterwards proved that the true period of magnetic variation amounts to 11’11 years approximately. Some still regard the association between the sun-spot period and auroral phenomena as non-existent; but all doubt on the subject appears to be removed by the evidence adduced in two able papers by Professor Loomis (American Journal of Science and Arts, September 1870 and April 1873). In the same papere Professor Loomis indicates the evidence of association between the number of auroras observed each year, and the two orders of phenomena—solar spots and magnetic variations. He remarks that, “the auroral maximum generally 0ccur3 a little later than the magnetic maximum, the average difference amounting to one year; while the time of auroral minimum either coincides with the magnetic minimum or slightly precedes it, the average difference amounting to about half a year. On the whole,” he proceeds, “there seems to be no room for question that the number of auroras seen in the middle latitudes of Europe and America exhibits a true periodicity, following very closely the magnetic periods, but not exactly copying them. In particular, we notice that during those periods in which the range of the magnetic declination was unusually small auroral exhibitions were extremely few in number and insignificant in respect of brilliancy. If now we inquire as to the probable connection between these three classes of phenomena, we cannot suppose that a small black spot on the sun exerts any direct influence on the earth’s magnetism or electricity; but we must rather conclude that the black spot is a result of a disturbance of the sun’s surface, which is accompanied by an emanation of some influence from the sun, which is almost instantly felt upon the earth, in an unusual disturbance of the earth’s magnetism, and a flow of electricity, developing the auroral light in the upper regions of the earth’s atmosphere. The appearances favour the idea that this emanation consists of a direct flow of electricity from the sun. If we maintain that light and heat are the result of vibrations of a rare ether which fills all space, the analogy between these agents and electricity would lead us to conclude that this agent also is the result of vibrations in the same medium, or at least that it is a force capable of being propagated through the ether with a velocity similar to that of light. While this influence is travelling through the void celestial spaces it develops no light; but as soon as it encounters the earth’s atmosphere, which appears to extend to a height of about 500 miles, it develops light, and its movements are controlled by the earth’s magnetic force, in a manner analogous to the influence of an artificial magnet upon a current of electricity circulating round it.”

Among the most interesting discoveries in solar physics are those which have been effected by means of the spectroscopic analysis, not only as regards the constitution of the sun himself, but as to the nature of the solar spots and faculae, as well as of the various objects which lie outside the sun’s visible surface, and are only rendered discernible during the darkness of total solar eclipses.

The evidence of the spectroscope respecting the sun’s constitution is too intimately associated with the history of spectroscopic analysis to be properly discussed at any length in this place. We propose, therefore, to present results, rather than to describe in detail the processes by which these results have been obtained, or the considerations on -which must be based the interpretation of such results.

It has been shown, then, that the light of the sun comes from an orb glowing with intense white light,—that is, light of all refrangibilities. Hence the sun is either liquid or solid, or if vaporous, then so greatly compressed that, in fact, the condition of its vapours is unlike that of any gases with which we are familiar. But inasmuch as the rainbow-tinted streak constituting the solar spectrum is crossed by a multitude of dark lines, it is seen that the glowing may of the sun is surrounded by a complex vapour-υus envelope at a lower temperature. Nevertheless we are not to suppose that the vapours constituting the solar atmosphere are in any sense cool. In fact, we find from the position of the dark lines of the solar spectrum, that the vapours of magnesium and sodium, of iron, copper, and other métals, exist in the true solar atmosphere, which 1 These lines are from the records of the Kew Observatory.

implies an excessive intensity of heat. We know also, in another manner presently to be described, that the vapours of the solar atmosphere, although less intensely hot than the glowing mass of the sun, are yet so hot as to be brightly luminous.

The evidence respecting the constitution of the sun is based on the following coincidences between dark lines of the solar spectrum and bright lines in the spectra of various elements :—
[table]

It must not be supposed either that no other terrestrial elements exist in the sun, or that no other coincidences are recognisable. The above list simply indicates the results obtained by Angström, and presented in the latest available announcement on the subject. With each improvement in spectroscopic appliances fresh coincidences are determined. Moreover, it is certain that many elements existing in the sun may for ever escape notice, simply because their vapours in the solar atmosphere may be either insufficient in quantity, or too low down to produce any recognisable effect.

Mitscherlich and others have lately shown that where one or two lines of a many-lined spectrum are recognised and others wanting, the evidence for the existence of the corresponding element in the sun may yet be regarded as sufficient, because under certain conditions only one or two lines of a spectrum show themselves.

The evidence given by the spectroscope respecting the solar spots confirms the theory that these are due to the existence of masses of relatively cool vapours at a lower level, and therefore relatively more compressed than the vapours elsewhere existing in the solar atmosphere. For the spectrum of the umbra of a spot differs chiefly from the spectrum of the solar photosphere in the greater strength and breadth of some of the dark lines.

We pass on to the phenomena witnessed during total solar eclipses. These are the red prominences and sierra, the inner corona, and the outer or radiated corona. Some add to these “Baily ’ s beads” and like phenomena, of no real interest or importance whatever.

The red prominences were first seen during the solar eclipse of July 8, 1842. During the eclipse of July 28, 1851, it was shown incontestably that they belong to the sun, since the moon was seen to traverse them, hiding those on the east and revealing those on the west. Some still maintained that the prominences are lunar or terrestrial phenomena, on the ground that observers might have been deceived. But this doubt was finally set at rest by the photographic records which De la Rue and Secchi obtained of the total solar eclipse of June 18, 1860.

It was not, however, until the eclipse of August 1868— sometimes known as the great Indian eclipse—that the real nature of these wonderful objects was ascertained. Spectroscopic analysis was applied successfully to the investigation of the prominences by Colonel Tennant, Captain Herschel, and MM. Janssen and Rayet. The spectrum was found to consist of bright lines, indicating that the coloured prominences are masses of glowing vapour. All the observers agreed that among the bright lines those of hydrogen were present: and one yellow line was mistakenly ascribed to sodium.

But Janssen on the day following the eclipse applied a new method of research, the principle of which had been definitely indicated several months before by Mr Huggins. (See Report of the Council of the Astronomical Society, in the Monthly Notices for February 1868.) This method depends on the fact that prismatic dispersion reduces the brilliancy of a continuous spectrum, but only throws apart the lines of a bright-line spectrum. Accordingly, by using a spectroscope of sufficient dispersive power, and directing it (with suitable telescopic adjuncts) towards a part of the solar limb on which a prominence exists, the light of our atmosphere, which under ordinary conditions obliterates the prominences from view, may be sufficiently dispersed to leave the bright lines of the prominence spectrum discernible (one at a time). By noting the length of a bright line so seen, the extent of the prominence in the particular section viewed could be determined; and by combining such determinations, the shape of the prominence could be ascertained. Hence it was that Janssen, speaking of his observations on the day following the great eclipse, said, “I have enjoyed to-day a continuous eclipse.”

It happened, curiously enough, that Mr Lockyer, in England, had succeeded in applying the method, not indeed so early as Janssen, but before the news of Janssen’s success had reached Europe.

Before long, however, Mr Huggins, the first to enunciate the principle of the new method, showed how it could be improved upon in such sort that the whole of a prominence could be seen at once. Since then many observers have studied the prominences without the aid of an eclipse,— the most successful being Zöllner, Secchi, Lockyer, Respighi, and (above all) Professor Young, of Dartmouth College, New Hampshire.

The following remarks respecting the prominences have been derived from a paper by Respighi :—

“In the circumpolar solar regions great prominences are not formed, but only small and short-lived jets. In the spot zone the great prominences are seen, the equatorial, like the polar zones, being regions of relatively small activity. Where faculae are present prominences are usually seen, but they are not identical with faculae. Over spots the jets are seen, but they are not high. There is a great difference in the duration of prominences. Some develop and disappear in a few minutes; others remain visible for several days. They originate, generally, in rectilinear jets, either vertical or oblique, very bright and well defined. These rise to a great height, often to a height of at least 80,000 miles, and occasionally to more than twice that; then, bending back, fall again upon the sun like the jets of our fountains. Then they spread into figures resembling gigantic trees, more or less rich in branches. In general, the highest parts are the regions of the most remarkable transformations.”

Before passing to the more systematic researches made I by Secchi, a few words must be said about the sierra.

It had been observed, even before the prominences were noticed, that there exists a border of a red colour around the solar disk, which can be recognised on the eastern side just after totality has commenced, and on the western side just before totality ceases. Late observations abundantly confirmed the discovery, and after the eclipse of 1860 it had been definitely admitted by all who had sufficiently examined the evidence, that a continuous red envelope surrounds the sun to a depth of three or four thousand miles. This envelope was commonly called the sierra; but recently the name chromosphere (which purists correct into chromatosphere) has been given to it.

The new method of observation, λs might be expected, shows the sierra spectrum as successfully as that of the prominences, which must be regarded as extensions of the sierra.

Secchi makes the following remarks on the sierra and prominences :—
[9:2:789]

“The sierra presents four aspects: (1), smooth, with a defined outline; (2), smooth, with no definite outline; (3), fringed with filaments; and (4), irregularly fringed with small flames.

“The prominences may be divided into three orders— heaps, jets, and plumes. The heaped prominences need no special description. The jets are those to which alone Respighi’s description is applicable. Their luminosity is intense, insomuch that they can be seen through the light clouds into which the sierra breaks up. Their spectrum indicates the presence of many elements besides hydrogen. When they have reached a certain height they cease to grow, and become transformed into exceedingly bright masses, which eventually separate into fleecy clouds. The jet prominences last but a short time, rarely an hour, frequently but a few minutes, and they are only to be seen in the neighbourhood of the spots. Wherever the jet prominences are seen, there also are faculae. The plume prominences are distinguished from the jets in not being characterised by any signs of an eruptive origin. They often extend to an enormous height, they last longer than the jets, though subject to rapid changes of figure, and lastly, they are distributed indifferently over the sun’s surface. It would seem that in jets a part of the photosphere is lifted up, whereas in the case of plumes only the sierra is disturbed.”

The theoretical inquiries of Zöllner, confirmed by his own and Respighi’s observations, show the probability that the jet prominences are true phenomena of eruption. And more recently, Professor Young has witnessed what must be regarded as in all probability a veritable solar eruption, during which matter was propelled to a height of upwards of 200,000 miles above the sun’s surface. The matter whose motion was actually observed was glowing hydrogen; but it should be noticed that it does not necessarily follow that the matter erupted was hydrogen. The out-rush may have carried along with it portions of hydrogen which had before been quiescent in the solar atmosphere.

The solar corona comes next to be considered.

It had long been known that around the black disc of the moon in total solar eclipses a halo or glory of light is seen, rather bright close by the sun, and fading away at first somewhat quickly, afterwards gradually, into the darkness of the surrounding sky. The records of some total eclipses described also radiations in this coronal glory, extending in many cases to a great distance from the sun.

Various theories were propounded in explanation of the solar corona. According to one view, it was a mere terrestrial phenomenon, due to the passage of the solar rays through our own atmosphere. Others ascribed it to the effects produced by a lunar atmosphere. The theory that it is due to diffraction was also advanced. But the generality of astronomers, especially in recent times, regarded the corona as a true solar appendage.

Space will not permit us to enter at length on the discussion of the various theories just mentioned, or on the description of the various observations which appeared to give support to one theory or another. Nor can we present in full the interesting history of the observations made since 1869, when first the spectroscope was applied to this interesting phenomenon, and real evidence as to its nature and structure began to be obtained. We must be content with the brief statement of the salient points of the recent observations.

During the solar eclipse of August 1869 the American astronomers, Young and Harkness, discovered that the spectrum of the corona is discontinuous (or that at least a portion of its light gives a discontinuous spectrum). Certainly one, and probably three bright lines appeared in the spectrum as they saw it, though the faintness of two of the three lines raised some doubt on the question whether they belonged to the corona. During the eclipse of December 1870, Young renewed his observations successfully, and other observers succeeded in seeing the bright-line spectrum of the corona. Young thus sums up the results of his own and other observations :—“There is,” he said, “surrounding the sun, beyond any further reasonable doubt, a mass of self-luminous gaseou3 matter, whose spectrum is characterised by the green line 1474 Kirchhoff. The precise extent of this it is hardly possible to consider as determined, but it must be many times the thickness of the red hydrogen portion of the chromatosphere, perhaps on an average 8' or 10', with occasional horns of twice that height. It is not at all unlikely that it may even turn out to have no upper limit, but to extend from the sun indefinitely into space.”

It was during this eclipse that for the first time photography gave convincing evidence respecting the corona. Mr Brothers at Sicily, and Mr Willard (an American photographer) in Spain, obtained views which, though differing in extent, accorded so well in those parts which were common to both, as to leave no doubt that the corona is a solar and not a terrestrial phenomenon. A singular V-shaped gap, common to both the photographs, and seen also by several telescopists, attracted particular attention, and was regarded by the late Sir John Herschel as in itself demonstrative of the fact that the corona is a solar appendage.

It was not, however, until the solar eclipse of December 1871 that the evidence on this point became so convincing as to satisfy even those who had most strenuously maintained the theory that the corona is merely a phenomenon of our own atmosphere. The spectroscopic and the photographic evidence were alike important. Janssen, with the spectroscope, succeeded in recognising, besides the bright lines already seen, others less bright, but manifestly belonging to the corona. He also perceived a faint continuous spectrum, crossed by dark lines, and therefore presumably due to reflected solar light, which, since our upper air near the sun’s place, in total eclipse, is demonstrably not illuminated by sunlight, can have come only from matter in the true corona, such as meteoric flights, vapour clouds, or the like, capable of reflecting the light of the sun. The photographers met with equally decisive success. Lord Lindsay’s photographer, Mr Davis, obtained a series of five pictures of the corona at successive stages of the totality, two of which were excellent and the remainder good. All these agreed perfectly in all respects, save only in the extent of the visible corona (depending, of course, on the conditions of illumination). It was demonstrated, therefore, that the features of the corona do not change during the progress of an eclipse at any given station; hence the corona cannot be a phenomenon depending on the passage of light-rays athwart inequalities of the moon’s limb. For whether we regard such rays as illuminating our own atmosphere or matter between the earth and the moon, the illumination would necessarily vary markedly, as the motions of the moon shifted the inequalities of her limb progressively athwart the light-rays. Again, Col. Tennant obtained a series of six photographs (five of which were very good), agreeing perfectly (always excepting differences of extent) with those obtained by Lord Lindsay’s photographer. Now Col. Tennant’s station was at Dodabetta, near the highest peak of the Neilgherries, more than 10,000 feet above the sea level, while Mr Davis was stationed at Baicull, close to the sea-shore, and hundreds of miles from Tennant’s station. The agreement of two series taken under such diverse circumstances, proves to demonstration that the photographers were not dealing with the illumination[9:2:790] of matter in the upper regions of our atmosphere, no matter under what circumstances illuminated. Later, indeed, it was found that photographs taken at Java gave precisely the same features, so that, as Col. Tennant remarks in the latest communication on the subject {Monthly Notices of the Astronomical Society for June 1873), no one now supposes the corona to be other than a solar phenomenon.

The accompanying picture (fig. 32), carefully copied from the first of Col. Tennant’s series of photographs, will afford an idea of the nature of the corona’s structure, though only an inadequate one, since photography can present only a portion of an object like the corona, whose light is for the tnost part extremely delicate.

Another very curious phenomenon connected with the sun is the faint nebulous aurora which accompanies him, known by the name of the Zodiacal Light. This phenomenon was first observed by Kepler, who described its appearance with sufficient accuracy, and supposed it to be the atmosphere of the sun. Dominic Cassini, however, to whom its discover}’ has been generally but erroneously attributed, was the first who observed it attentively, and gave it the name which it now bears. It is visible immediately before sunrise, or after sunset, in the place where the sun is about to appear, or where he has just quitted the horizon. It has a flat lenticular form, and is placed obliquely on the horizon, the apex extending to a great distance in the heavens. Its direction is in general nearly in the plane of the sun’s equator, and for this reason it is scarcely visible in our latitudes, excepting at particular seasons, when that plane is nearly perpendicular to the horizon. When its inclination is great, it is either concealed altogether under the horizon, or it rises so little above it that its splendour is effaced by the atmosphere of the earth. The most favourable time for observing it is about the beginning of March, or towards the vernal equinox. The line of the equinoxes is then situated in the horizon, and the arc of the ecliptic is more elevated than the equator by an angle of 23 J °; so that the solar equator, which is slightly inclined to the ecliptic, approaches nearer to the perpendicular to the horizon, and the pyramid of the zodiacal light is consequently directed to a point nearer the zenith than at any other season of the year.

Numerous opinions have been entertained respecting the nature and cause of this singular phenomenon. Cassini thought it might be occasioned by the confused light of an innumerable multitude of little planets circulating round the sun, in the same manner as the Milky Way owes its appearance to the light of agglomerated myriads of stars. Its resemblance to the tails of comets has been noticed by Cassini and others. Mairan, following Kepler, ascribed it to the atmosphere of the sun. This hypothesis was generally adopted until Laplace showed it to be untenable, because no atmosphere could rotate with the sun if extending beyond the distance where centrifugal force is balanced by gravity, and this distance lies far within the observed range of the zodiacal light.

The general opinion respecting the zodiacal light at the present day is, that it forms the outer part of the solar corona, so that if the light of the sun could be for a time obliterated without rendering his appendages invisible, we should see the corona as shown in the preceding figure, merging gradually into the faint glow of the zodiacal light. It must not be understood, however, that this theory in any sense implies a continuity of substance between the zodiacal light and the corona, any more than what has been discovered respecting the corona implies that the corona is a true solar atmosphere. All that is to be understood is, that (1) the inner corona, (2) the outer radiated corona, and (3) the zodiacal light, form part of the series of appendages surrounding the orb of the sun.

It is to be noted, indeed, that the true atmosphere of the sun appears to underlie even the sierra. It had been noted by Secchi in 1869, that on the very limb of the sun the solar spectrum becomes continuous; and he inferred that there must exist an atmosphere (relatively very shallow), consisting of the vapours which occasion the dark lines of the solar spectrum, and that the brightness of the lines of these vapours corresponding very nearly to the brightness of the ordinary solar spectrum for the parts of the sun very near to the edge, the dark lines of the latter spectrum are as it were cancelled, and so a continuous spectrum is produced. This view was shown during the eclipse of December 1870 to be perfectly correct; for Prof. Young, directing his analysing spectroscope to the part of the sun’s limb which was to disappear last, found that at the instant when totality commenced, the solar spectrum was suddenly replaced by a spectrum consisting of thousands of bright lines, that being precisely the kind of spectrum which Secchi’s theory required. This observation was successfully renewed during the eclipse of December 1871, and again during the annular eclipse of June 1872. On the latter occasion the remarkable circumstance w as noted, that while the bright-line spectrum was only visible for a second or two on the eastern limb (just before the formation of the ring), it was visible for six or seven seconds on the western limb (just after the annulus was broken).

Chapter VIII.— The Inferior Planets Mercury and Venus.

Mercury is a small body, but emits a very bright white light, though he is seldom to be seen, always keeping near the sun.

Mercury is about 3060 English miles in diameter, and his mean distance from the sun about 35 millions of miles. On account of his smallness and brilliancy, it is extremely difficult to find any spot on his disk so distinctly marked as to afford the means of determining his rotation. An attentive observation of the variations of the phases of Mercury led Schröter to infer that the planet revolves about its axis in a period of 24 hours 5 min. 30 sec. Μ. Harding discovered in 1801 an obscure streak on the southern hemisphere of the planet, the observations of [9:2:791] which, together with those of a spot discovered by Schröter, gave the same period of rotation. Schröter states that Mercury’s form is spherical, exhibiting no sensible compression; that his equator is very considerably inclined to his orbit, and the differences of his days and seasons must consequently be very great; and that there are mountains on his surface which cast very long shadows, and of which the height bears a greater proportion to the diameter of the planet than those of the Earth, the Moon, or even of Venus. The height of Chimborazo is - f0 ∖- 7 of the radius of the earth; one of the mountains in the moon has been estimated at τ ∣- r of her radius; the highest in Venus at τ ∣ τ ; and one in Mercury at τ ∣ κ . But recent observations render it exceedingly doubtful how far Schroter ’ s observations can be trusted. There are no observations to prove decisively whether Mercury is surrounded by an atmosphere.

Venus, the most beautiful object in the heavens, is about 7510 English miles in diameter, and is placed at the distance of 66 millions of miles from the sun. Although the oscillations of this planet are considerably greater than those of Mercury, and she is seldom invisible, yet on account of the uniform brilliancy of her disk, it is extremely difficult to ascertain the period of her rotation. Dominic Cassini, after having long fruitlessly attempted to discover any object on her surface so well defined as to enable him to follow its motions, at length, in 1667, perceived a bright spot, distant from the southern horn a little more than a fourth part of the diameter of the disk, and near the eastern edge. By continuing his observations of this spot, Cassini concluded the rotation of Venus to be performed in about 23 hours; but he does not seem to have considered this conclusion as deserving of much confidence. In the year 1726 Bianchini, an Italian astronomer, made a number of similar observations for the same purpose, from which he inferred that the rotation of the planet is performed in 24 days 8 hours. The younger Cassini has shown, however, that the observations of Bianchini, as well as those of his father, could be explained by a rotation of 23 hours and 21 or 22 min. whereas the rotation of 24 days 8 hours cannot be reconciled with the appearances observed by the elder Cassini. The determination of Cassini was regarded by astronomers as the more probable of the two, particularly as Bianchini was not able to make his observations in a connected manner, because a neighbouring building intercepted his view of the planet, and obliged him to transport his telescope to a different situation. The question of the rotation of Venus was again attacked by Schröter, who found it to be performed in 23 hours 21 min. 19 sec. Each of the three observers found the inclination of the axis of rotation to the axis of the ecliptic to be about 75°. Much doubt, however, still exists with respect to the value of this element which De Vico sets at little more than 50°.

Schröter’s observations of this planet were principally directed to a mountain situated near the southern horn. The line which joins the extremities of the horns is always a diameter; and the horns of the crescent of a perfect sphere ought to be sharp and pointed. Schröter remarked that this was not always the case with regard to the horns of Mercury and Venus. The northern horn of the latter always preserved the pointed form, but the southern occasionally appeared rounded or obtuse,—a circumstance which indicated that the shadow of a mountain covered the part; but beyond the horn he remarked a luminous point, which he supposed to be the summit of another mountain, illuminated by the sun after he had ceased to be visible to the rest of that hemisphere. Now, in order that the horn of the crescent may appear obtuse in consequence of the shadow of a mountain falling upon it, and another mountain may present a luminous point, the two mountains must be at the same time both at the edge of the disk and on the line separating the dark from the enlightened part of the planet. But this position cannot be of long continuance. Rotation will cause the bright point to rise into the enlightened part, or sink into the dark hemisphere, and in either case the mountain will cease to be visible. If, however, the rotation is completed in 23 hours 21 min., the mountain will appear 39 min. sooner than it did on the previous day. Hence it is possible to obtain several consecutive observations, from which an approximate value of the period may be found; and this being once obtained, it may be rendered still more exact by observations separated from each other by a longer interval. Thus Schröter found that an interval of 20 days 11 hours 15 min. between two appearances of the mountain being divided by 23 hours 21 min. gave 21'04 revolutions; and that intervals of 121 days 14 hours 25 min., 142 days 1 hour 40 min., 155 days 18 hours 11 min., divided each by 23 hours 21 min., gave 125'01, 146'02, 160Ό9 revolutions respectively. All these comparisons prove that the revolution of 23 hours 21 min. is somewhat too short. They ought to have given 21,125, 146, and 160 revolutions exactly, supposing the observations to have been perfectly accurate. On dividing the intervals by 21, 125, 146, and 160 respectively, the quotients will be each the time of a revolution very nearly; and by taking a mean of the whole, the most probable result at least will be obtained. In this manner Schröter found the period of rotation already stated, namely, 23 hours 21 min. 19 sec.

Since the time of rotation of Mercury and Venus is nearly equal to that of the earth, the compression of these planets at the poles, which results from the centrifugal force, ought also to be nearly in the same proportion. But at the distance of the earth the compression must be imperceptible even in the case of Venus; for, supposing it to amount to - 3 -jj- σ , the difference between the radius of her poles and that of her equator would only amount to a tenth of a second as seen from the earth.

During the transits of Venus over the sun’s disk in 1761 and 1769 a sort of penumbral light was observed round the planet by several astronomers, which was occasioned, without doubt, by the refractive powers of her atmosphere. Wargentin remarked that the limb of Venus which had gone off the sun showed itself with a faint light during almost the whole time of emersion. Bergman, who observed the transit of 1761 at Upsal, says that at the ingress the part which had not come upon the sun was visible, though dark, and was surrounded by a crescent of faint light; but this appearance was much more remarkable at the egress; for as soon as any part of the planet had disengaged itself from the sun’s disk, that part was visible with a like crescent, but brighter. As more of the planet’s disk disengaged itself from that of the sun, the part of the crescent farthest from the sun grew fainter, and vanished, until at last only the horns could be seen. The total immersion and emersion were not instantaneous; but as two drops of water, when about to separate, form a ligament between them, so there was a dark shade stretched out between Venus and the sun; and when this ligament broke, the planet seemed to have got about an eighth part of her diameter from the limb of the sun. The numerous accounts of the two transits which have been published abound with analogous observations, indicating the existence of an atmosphere of considerable height and density. During the transit of 1874 these appearances were so satisfactorily seen, that no doubt can remain as to their reality. Schröter calculated that the horizontal refraction of the atmosphere of Venus must amount to 30' 34*, differing little from that of the terrestrial atmosphere. A twilight which he perceived on the cusps afforded him the data from [9:2:792] which he deduced this conclusion, on which, however, very little reliance can be placed.

The atmosphere of Venus has been analysed with the spectroscope by Vogel, and the existence of aqueous vapour is regarded as demonstrated. On the occasion of the late transit (1874) Tacchini made spectroscopic observations, which seem more satisfactorily to establish the fact that there is water on Venus, than Vogel’s observations.

Cassini and Montaigne imagined that they had observed a satellite accompanying Venus; but this appears to have been an optical illusion arising from the strong light of the planet reflected back from the convex surface of the eye upon the eye-glass of the telescope, and thence reflected a second time back to the eye. During the transits of Venus in 1761 and 1769, and in the late transit of 1874, no trace of a satellite was seen; and there can be now no doubt whatever that Venus is without a satellite.

Chapter IX.— The Earth regarded as a Planet—Figure and Mass of the Earth—Precession of the Equinoxes— The Shape and Position of the Earth's Orbit—Distance from the Sun—Transit Observations.

The earth is the third member of the solar system in order of distance from the sun. From what has been already shown, in determining the relative position of the earth and the celestial bodies seen in our skies, we know that the earth is a globe, rotating on her axis once in a day, and circling around the sun in an orbit of great extent once in a year. In the present chapter we propose to present the results of more exact inquiries into the figure and motions of the earth.

It has been found by numerous and accurate experiments, that the lengths of arcs of l 0 on the same meridian are greater in proportion as we advance nearer the pole. Hence, on account of the similarity of the isosceles triangles of which these arcs form the bases, their sides, or the terrestrial radii, must also be longer, and consequently the convexity of the earth is less towards the poles than at the equator. The surface of the earth is extremely irregular, even independently of the inequalities occasioned by mountains and cavities ; yet it has been discovered that the meridional curves differ almost insensibly from ellipses; whence it is concluded that the figure of the earth is an ellipsoid of revolution about its shortest axis. In comparing the results of the various measurements which have been made with the formulae belonging to the dimensions of such a body, this conclusion has been fully verified; and the lengths of the arcs, the ellipticity, the distance of the pole from the equator, and, in short, all the elements of the spheroid, have been determined.

An arc of the meridian in India was measured by Colonel Lambton in the early part of this century. But its value has been much increased by Colonel Everest’s extension of the arc. The arc of Lambton, extending from Punnae (lat. 8° 9' 35") to Damargida (lat. 18° 3' 15"), was measured after the model of the English trigonometrical survey. From Damargida, where Lambton’s arc terminated, another was measured by Colonel Everest to Kaliana (lat. 29° 30' 48"), a space of 797 miles, covering an arc of ll 0 27' 33", the latest geodetical improvements being introduced. The whole extent of Lambton’s and Colonel Everest’s operations includes a continuous arc of 21° 21' (1477 miles). The work was rivalled in extent by a vast operation executed in Russia and other northern countries of Europe, by which an arc of 25° 20', extending from the banks of the Danube to the shores of the Arctic Sea, near the North Cape, was measured under the general superintendence and direction of W. Struve.

The arcs of India and of Russia include a space from lat. 8° to lat. 71°, with the exception of only about sixteen degrees, and are unquestionably the most important which exist for the determination of the earth’s figure. When to them we add the French arc of 12° 22' in a medium latitude, it will scarcely be necessary to take into account any other, at least for the northern hemisphere.

The following brief details of the Russian arc are taken from Μ. Struve’s report of 1852 :—

The southern extremity of the Russo-Scandinavian arc is Ismail on the Danube (lat. 45° 20'), the northern extremity is Fuglenaes, on the island of Qualoe, in Finnmarken (lat. 70° 40'). The interval from Torneä to Fuglenaes (4° 49') was measured by Swedish and Norwegian engineers; all the remainder by those of Russia, and, in particular, by Μ. Von Tenner, who, with Μ. Struve, from 1816 directed the whole operation.

The calculation of the figure of the earth from the completed Russian arc indicates an ellipticity somewhat greater than that generally received. The results obtained by Colonel Everest, on the other hand, by comparing his arc with those of Europe, give generally small ellipticities, that is, under - 5 ⅜ 75 ∙. The French and Indian arcs, for instance, give - 3 4 τ -. The determinations by means of the pendulum are somewhat larger. The extensive observations of Colonel Sabine and Captain Foster concur in giving an ellipticity of r ⅛- δ -, but the French experiments by Duperrey and Freycinet lead to a result considerably greater. The discrepancy between the geodetical and pendulum results may, of course, be a real one depending on local variations of density. The astronomical determination from the lunar inequalities, which might be expected to concur with the results of the pendulum, gives - 5 ⅜ s - as a mean. Captain A. R, Clark, R.E., combining all the results obtained up to the year I860, arrived at conclusions thus stated by Sir J. Herschel :—“The earth is not exactly an ellipsoid of revolution. The equator itself is slightly elliptic, the longer and shorter diameters being respectively 41,852,864, and 41,843,096 feet. The ellipticity of the equatorial circumference is therefore ¾∙⅞ 1 85 , and the excess of its longer over its shorter diameter about two miles. The vertices of the longer diameter are situated in longitude 14° 23' E. and 194° 23' E. of Greenwich, and of its shorter in 104° 23' E. and 284° 23' E. The polar axis of the earth is 41,707,796 feet in length, and consequently the most elliptic meridian (that of longitude 14° 23' and 194° 23') has for its ellipticity - 2 -⅛.- s ∙, and the least (that of longitude 104° 23' and 284° 23') an ellipticity of 1 ∏⅛.√ ,

General Schubert, using a method which Sir J. Herschel justly regards as less trustworthy, “makes the ellipticity of the equator - 8 - 8 1 8 - g , and places the vertices of the longer axis 26° 41' to the eastward of Captain Clark’s. His polar axis, as deduced from each of the three great meridian arcs, the Russian, Indian, and French respectively, is 41,711,000 feet, 41,712,534 feet, and 41,697,496 feet, the mean of which, giving to each a weight proportional to the length of the arc from which it is deduced, is 41,708,710 feet.”

The figure and volume of the earth being thus determined, we require only to ascertain its mean density in order to know its mass. But this problem has not been solved, probably cannot be solved, with any very near approach to exactness. Various methods have been employed, the mere description of which suffices to show the difficulty and uncertainty of the subject.

The deviation of the plumb-line from the vertical in the neighbourhood of a mountain had been pointed out by Newton^[2. De Mundi Systemate, § 22. Newton, in a very remarkable passage of the Third Book of the Principia (Prop. X.), conjectures that “the quantity of matter in the earth may be five or six times greater than if the whole were composed of water.” ] as a direct method of dealing with the problem of [9:2:793] determining the earth’s density. Bouguer had the merit of pointing out the form in which the experiment might be made, and of making the trial, though in a rude and insufficient manner, in the Peruvian Andes in 1738. Maskelyne proposed to the Royal Society in 1772 to repeat the observation on some British mountain. Skiddaw and the Yorkshire Hills were first thought of, but finally Schihallion in Perthshire was preferred. The distance between the two stations, obtained with Ramsden’s 9-inch theodolite, was 4364 ’ 4 feet, which in the latitude of Schihallion corresponds to 42" - 94 of latitude. The observed difference of latitude by 337 observations with Sisson’s 10-feet zenith sector was 54" ’ 6. The excess, or 11"∙6, is the double attraction of the hill drawing the plumb-line towards itself at the two stations. The sine of this angle, or 17 ⅞ or , represents the actual ratio between the double attraction of the hill and the attraction of the earth. But by the computation of the attraction which the hill ought to exert, from its figure, as determined by Maskelyne’s gauges, were its density the same as that of the globe generally, this ratio should amount to τ ⅛ j , which can only be accounted for by assuming the earth to be denser on the average than the hill of Schihallion in the proportion of 17,804 to 9933. A careful lithological survey of the hill enabled Professor Playfair to deduce the probable mean specific gravity of the globe to be between 4 ’ 56 and 4 ’ 87.

A second method was devised by the Rev. Mr Michell, but first put in practice by Mr Cavendish in 1797-8. It consisted in measuring the force of gravitation between two spheres of such small size that they could be moved by the hand nearer to or farther from one another. To provide a balance so delicate as to measure the almost inappreciable attraction of such small bodies, Michell imagined the balance of torsion. His apparatus came into the hands, first of Wollaston, then of Cavendish, who made the experiment. He used a very light rod of deal, six feet long, suspended by a fine silver or copper wire, forty inches long, within a wooden case to defend it from currents of air. At each end of the lever was hung a ball of lead, two inches in diameter, and by a simple contrivance a pair of leaden spheres, weighing together 348 pounds, could be brought simultaneously into the neighbourhood of the balls (but outside the case), on opposite sides, so that their attractions might concur to swing the suspended lever out of the position of repose which it had previously taken up, under the action of the slight twisting force of the silver wire. A new position of rest was thus established, the small balls being pulled as much one way by the attraction of the spheres as they were urged in the opposite direction by the torsion of the wire. The position of repose being observed from a distance by a telescope (to avoid disturbance from the heat of the observer’s body), the great spheres were then changed in position so as to act upon the opposite sides of the small balls, from what they formerly did. The deflection and new stable position would be as much on the other side of the zero, and the arc described would be an accurate measure of the double deflection. The force •of torsion for one degree of deflection is known by the time of oscillation of the lever and balls when free, and as the forces are exactly as the angles, the force corresponding to any displacement becomes known. Cavendish found the joint attraction of the small balls and large spheres to be about 13 ⅛ g ∙ of a grain, their centres being 8 ’ 85 inches apart, and he thence computed the density of the earth to be 5 ’ 48 times that of water. The experiment has been repeated since by Reich of Freiberg and Baily of London. The former obtained 5'44, the latter 5 ’ 66 for the earth’s specific gravity,—this last result being worthy of much confidence, from the extraordinary care taken to avoid errors and to obtain independent values of the quantities sought.

A third method of determining the earth’s density depends on the fact that a pendulum suspended at a considerable height above the earth would swing more slowly than at the surface, while if it be at the summit of a mountain, though it will still swing more slowly, the attraction of the mountain will slightly accelerate the rate of swing. Carlini and Plana, by observations made on this plan, have deduced 4 ’ 950 for the mean density of the earth. The objection to this method, as well as to the Schihallion experiment, resides in our uncertainty as to the actual mean density of any given mountain mass. If the experiment could be carried out by pendulum observations made at the base and on the summit of a conical or conoidal mass, of some known material and of great height, the true density of the earth could thence be very accurately determined.

A similar objection applies to the converse of the third method described above. If a pendulum be suspended at the bottom of a deep mine, of known figure, and existing in a region whose geological structure is well known, the change of rate gives a means of calculating the density of the earth, since it obviously depends on the calculable difference of attraction due to increased proximity to the earth’s centre (reducing the attraction), and to the absence of counter-attracting matter where the mine is dug out (which in effect increases the attraction). In the Harton colliery, experiments were carried out by Mr Dunkin on this plan in accordance with arrangements devised by the astronomer royal. It was found that gravity was increased by ι - s * a - σ th part at the lower station, 1260 feet below the mouth of the mine, where the upper station was placed. Hence Airy found that, on taking into account the configuration of the mine and the structure of the surrounding region, a density of 6565 resulted. Very little reliance can be placed, however, on results obtained by this method.

It may be fairly assumed that the earth’s mean density amounts to about 5 , 6 times the density of water, combining which with the known dimensions of the earth, we find that the earth’s weight in tons may be roundly expressed by the number 6,000,000,000,000,000,000,000.

We have next to inquire into the rotation of the earth about its axis, and especially into the position of that axis. In Chapter I. we considered the axis as fixed in position; or, seeing that the earth circles around the sun, we regarded the axis as moving always parallel to itself, while the earth traversed her path in the plane of the ecliptic. But we must now take into account variations in its position with reference to the ecliptic. In this inquiry we should naturally take the ecliptic as our plane of reference, if we were assured that the position of the plane of the ecliptic is constant,—in other words, that the sun’s path in the heavens undergoes no change. This is, in fact, so nearly the case that the ecliptic forms a suitable reference circle for the fixed stars—far more suitable for example than the equator itself. The star’s latitude, that is, its distance from the ecliptic measured on the arc of a great circle through the poles of the ecliptic, is veιy nearly constant; while the longitude, or the distance between the point T and the point where the great circle through the star cuts the ecliptic, undergoes, as will presently appear, a variation nearly uniform, and nearly the same for every star; whereas the declination and right ascension of stars are undergoing variations which are neither alike for different stars nor uniform for any star. Yet the place of the ecliptic on the heavens is not absolutely constant. The ecliptic, in fact, is inclined about l⅛ 0 to the invariable plane mentioned at the end of Chapter VI., and this inclination is undergoing a slow process of change, while the nodes of the ecliptic on it are slowly shifting. A [9:2:794] result of this is that the obliquity of the ecliptic is changing, for the mean inclination of the earth’s axis to the invariable plane does not change, so that the mean inclination of this axis to the ecliptic must necessarily change. At present the obliquity of the ecliptic—that is, the inclination of the equator to the ecliptic—is diminishing; and this process, which has been going on for many centuries, will continue for a long time yet to come, after which the obliquity will increase, the total range on either side of the mean value amounting to about 3°. The various observations and traditions by which the progressive diminution of the obliquity is confirmed have been collected by Bailly. The following table contains those which appear to be the best authenticated, as well as the results of some more recent observations, from which the present value of the obliquity and the rate of its diminution may be deduced :—
[table]

Although the comparison of these observations with one another gives very discordant results relatively to the law according to which the obliquity varies, their totality places the fact of its progressive diminution be yond all manner of doubt. It amounts to about 4 5 J" per century at present, and may be regarded as uniform for many centuries to come.

The longitudes of the stars, as has already been mentioned, are measured on the ecliptic from the vernal equinox; and therefore, if the line of the equinoxes, which is the same as the line of the nodes, is invariable, the longitude of any star will always be the same, whatever interval of time may elapse between two observations of that longitude. But on comparing the actual state of the heavens with the observations recorded by ancient astronomers, it is perceived that the longitudes of all the stars are considerably increased. The phenomenon is to be explained by attributing to the equinoctial points a retrograde motion from east to west, in consequence of which the sun, whose motion is direct, ¾rrives at them sooner than if they remained at rest; and therefore the equinoxes, and spring, autumn, and the other seasons, happen before the sun has completed an entire circuit. On this account the motion has been denominated the Precession of the Equinoxes. As this motion is extremely slow, its exact amount can be discovered only by a comparison of observations separated from each other by long intervale of time. The comparison of modern observations with those of Hipparchus gives as its annual amount 50∣". The mean result of the observations of Tycho, compared with those of Lacaille, gives 50⅜' ’. On comparing modern observations with one another, we find 50" Ό6. Delambre, in his solar tables, supposes the annual precession to be equal to 50"∙l. According to this estimate the equinoctial points go backwards at the rate of l 0 in 71 ^6 years nearly, and therefore will make a complete revolution of the heavens in about 25,868 years.

The diminution of the obliquity of the ecliptic arises from the displacement of the ecliptic itself; the precession of the equinoxes is, on the contrary, occasioned by the continual displacement of the plane of the terrestrial equator. This displacement results from the combined action of the sun and moon (for the influence of the planets amounts only to a fraction of a second, and is consequently scarcely sensible) on the mass of protuberant matter accumulated about the earth’s equator, or the matter which forms the excess of the terrestrial spheroid above its inscribed sphere. The attracting force of the sun and moon on this shell of matter may be resolved into two ; one parallel to the plane of the equator, the other perpendicular to it. The tendency of this last force is to diminish the angle which the plane of the equator makes with that of the ecliptic; and if the earth had no motion of rotation, it would soon cause the two planes to coincide. In consequence, however, of the rotatory motion of the earth, the inclination of the two planes remains constant; but the effect produced by the action of the force in question is, that the plane of the equator is constantly shifting its place, in such a manner that the line of the equinoxes advances in the direction of the diurnal motion, or contrary to the order of the signs, its pole having a slow angular motion about the pole of the ecliptic.

If the sun and moon moved in the plane of the equator, there would evidently be no precession; and the effect of their action in producing it varies with their distance from that plane. Twice a year, therefore, the effect of the sun in causing precession is nothing; and twice a year, namely, at the solstices, it is a maximum. On this account the obliquity of the ecliptic is subject to a semi-annual variation; for the sun’s force, which tends to produce a change in the obliquity, is variable, while the diurnal motion of the earth, which prevents the change from taking place, is constant. Hence the plane of the equator is subject to an irregular motion, which is technically called the Solar Nutation. The existence of the solar nutation is, however, only a deduction from theory, for its amount is too small to be perceptible by observation; but a similar effect of the moon’s action is sufficiently appreciable, and was, in fact, discovered by Bradley before theory had indicated its existence. Its period, however, is different, and depends on the time of the revolution of the moon’s nodes, which is performed in 18 years and about 7 months. During this time the intersection of the lunar orbit with the ecliptic has receded through a complete circumference; and the inequality of the moon’s action will consequently, in the same time, have passed through all its different degrees. Bradley observed that the declinations of the stars continued to augment during nine years, that they diminished during the nine years following, and that the greatest change of declination amounted to 18". He remarked further, that this motion was connected with an [9:2:795] irregularity of the precession of the equinoxes, which followed exactly the same period; whence he concluded that the motion of the poles of the equator, occasioned by this vibration of its plane, was not confined to the solstitial colure. A series of observations on stars differently situated proved that all the phenomena could be explained on the hypothesis that the pole of the equator describes in 18 years a small circle of 18" diameter, contrary to the order of the signs; or that the axis of the earth, following the circumference of this circle, describes the surface of a cone, the axis of which forms with its side an angle of 9". This apparent vibratory motion is denominated the Nutation of the Earth's Axis.

Bradley remarked that the effects of the nutation would be represented still more accurately by supposing the curve described by the pole of the equator about its mean place to be, not a circle, but an ellipse, the transverse and conjugate axes being 18" and 16" respectively. This is also confirmed by theory, from which Laplace calculated the semi-axes of the ellipse at 9"∙63 and 7"Ι7. The semitransverse axis of the ellipse described by the pole in virtue of the sun’s action alone does not exceed half a second, and is therefore scarcely appreciable. The sensible part of the nutation follows exactly the period of the revolution of the nodes of the moon. By 603 observations of Polaris, made at Dorpat between 1822 and 1838, Μ. Peters has determined the semi-axis major of the ellipse to be 9" - 2361, and gives, for his definitive result, 9" ’ 2231.

We must draw a distinction then, between the mean and the true or apparent obliquity of the ecliptic. The mean obliquity is the obliquity calculated for any particular date on the supposition that there is no nutation, while the true obliquity is that quantity increased or diminished by the nutation. The progressive diminution of the mean obliquity and the nutation of the earth’s axis are inequalities distinguished from each other, not only by their being derived from different and distinct causes, but still more by the very great difference of time required for their full development.

The path in which the earth at present travels around the sun is indicated in the elements (p. 782). Plate XXVII. also shows the varying rate at which the earth moves owing to the eccentricity of her orbit. It will be seen also from that plate, and more precisely from the table of elements, that the perihelion of the orbit lies near the place of the winter solstice, so that, in fact, about ten days after midwinter of the northern hemisphere the earth is at her nearest to the sun. An important difference thus exists between the seasons of the two hemispheres. In the northern we have the sun farthest from us a few days after midsummer, while at the corresponding season in winter the sun is at his nearest. So far, then, as the sun’s distance is concerned, the seasons are rendered more moderate for the northern hemisphere by the effects of the earth’s eccentricity. Nor is the difference on this account by any means inconsiderable. The sun in aphelion is farther from us than in perihelion in the proportion of about 61 to 59, and the earth receives more heat in the proportion of about 31 to 29, or roughly, about τ⅛ t h more heat in aphelion than in perihelion. There is also a difference due to the varying rate of the earth’s real (that is, of the sun’s apparent) motion. In winter the earth moves more rapidly than in summer, really as 61 to 59, but the apparent change of the sun’s rate of motion along the ecliptic is as 31 to 29, because the increased rate is magnified by the earth’s greater proximity. Hence the interval from the autumnal to the vernal equinox is shorter than the interval from the vernal to the autumnal equinox. This also is shown by Plate XXVII., where the number of divisions marking the earth’s daily journey is seen to be greater in the summer half than in the winter half of the orbit Thus the winter cold is less enduring than the summer heat. In the southern hemisphere all these relations are reversed. The summer heat is rendered more intense by the greater proximity of the sun, the winter cold is intensified by his increased distance. The summer heat is less enduring than the winter cold. We have in the north a relatively short but moderate winter (so far as the sun’s proximity can moderate winter cold), and a long but also moderate summer; in the southern hemisphere they have a short and intensely hot summer, a long but also intense winter. The presence of a great expanse of sea in the southern hemisphere partially tends to moderate the seasonal changes; but we see in the wider extension of the antarctic snows the effect of the long and cold winter and the short summer. We have, however, referred to these considerations less on account of their intrinsic importance, than to show how the eccentricity of the earth when near its maximum value, and when the perihelion was differently situated from its present position, may have caused the condition of the two terrestrial hemispheres to differ from that now existing. The present value of the eccentricity is nearer the minimum than the maximum value, though the perihelion is at present so placed as to produce almost the maximum possible difference between the two hemispheres, with the present degree of eccentricity. It must not be supposed that the eccentricity, in obedience to the law relating to planetary eccentricities (Chapter VI.), oscillates between the absolute maximum and the absolute minimum, the perihelion shifting continuously forwards. On the contrary, the successive maxima and minima are very unequal, and are attained after very unequal intervals; while the perihelion, apart from short periods of regression, and though always progressing on the whole in any considerable period, yet progresses at very unequal rates in different periods. This will be seen from the following table, presenting the eccentricity as calculated for different epochs from 1,100,000 years before our present era till now, chiefly by Mr James Croll, but partly from Leverrier and Stone:—
[table]
[9:2:796]
[table]

While the shape of the earth’s orbit and the position of its centre (whose longitude = long, of perih. + 180°) thus undergo continual alteration, her mean distance from the sun remains appreciably constant. This we know from the length of the year, which certainly has not changed ten seconds in length since the time of the Chaldean determination of that element.

There are various ways of determining the sun’s distance from the earth in terms of the earth’s semidiameter. The distance of a planet from the sun may likewise be obtained if we can find the means of measuring its distance from the earth at any epoch, for the geocentric positions of the sun and the planet being known from the theory of their motions, the radius vector of the orbit, or planet’s distance from the sun at that epoch, may be found by a simple trigonometrical computation. To determine the distance of a planet from the earth, it might seem only necessary to determine its horizontal parallax; but in general the parallaxes of the planets are quantities by far too small to be directly observed. That of Mars, however, becomes very appreciable in particular circumstances, that is to say, when Mars is in opposition with the sun, and at the same time near the perihelion of his orbit. Thus, in the year 1751, on the 6th of October, that planet, being near his opposition, was observed at the same instant of time by Lacaille at the Cape of Good Hope, and by Wargentin at Stockholm; and the horizontal parallax deduced from the two observations, was found to amount to 24" ’ 6, corresponding to a solar parallax of 9" ’ 4.

This method requires that observations should be made from opposite sides of the earth; but Flamsteed long ago pointed out that the distance of Mars might be determined by observing how much the planet’s place is shifted by the diurnal rotation of the earth. Both methods have been employed very successfully in modern times. Stone, of Greenwich, by combining the two methods, discussing observations of Mars at the opposition of 1862,—made (1), at Greenwich, (2), at Greenwich and Cape Town, and (3), at Greenwich and Williamstown,—deduced a solar parallax of 8 ,, ∙943. Winnecke, from the discussion of the same opposition as observed at Poulkowa and Cape Town, deduced the solar parallax 8" 964. Professor Newcomb of Washington, U.S., deduced the value 8'' ’ 855.

A more accurate method of determining the sun’s distance, and thence the dimensions of the planetary orbits, is afforded, though rarely, by the transits of Venus over the sun’s disk. When Venus is at her inferior conjunction, and at the same time very near either node, her body will be projected on the disk of the sun; and through the effect of her proper motion, combined with that of the earth, she will appear as a dark spot passing over the disk, and describing a chord which will be seen under different aspects by spectators placed at different points on the earth, because, by reason of the parallax, they refer the planet to different points on the solar disk. The position of the spectator not only occasions a difference in the apparent path described by the planet, but has also a very sensible influence on the duration of the transit, in consequence of which the parallaxes both of Venus and the sun can be determined with great exactness. In order to illustrate this, let E (fig. 33) represent the earth, V Venus, and S the sun. An observer placed at E, near the north pole of the earth, would see Venus projected on the sun’s disk at V, and she would appear to describe the line lυm. An observer placed at E', near the south pole, would see the planet at v, and she would appear to describe the chord Z'√wι'. This is a necessary result of the difference of the parallaxes of Venus and the sun; and as the chords lv > l'v' differ in length according as they are more or less remote from the centre of the disk, the duration of the transit will be longer or shorter according to the situation of the observer and the geocentric latitude of the planet. If by reason of the relative parallax the time of a transit is longer than the true time in one hemisphere, it will be shorter in the other; and hence the difference of the times (which may be observed with great accuracy) at places having very different latitudes may serve to determine the relative parallax, or the difference between the parallax of Venus and that of the sun. But the parallaxes are reciprocally proportional to the distances; and the ratio of the distances being known, therefore the ratio of the parallaxes is also known; and having thus the ratio and the difference of the two parallaxes, it is easy to compute the separate amount of each.

This particular application of the transits of Venus to the determination of the sun’s distance was first pointed out by Dr Halley, when he announced the transit of 1761. The transit of Venus in 1769 was observed in many different parts of the world. The result of the whole of the observations led to the conclusion, that the parallax of the sun is included within the limits 8" , 5 and 8" ’ 7. The mean 8" - 6 was adopted by Delambre and Lalande; and later the value 8" - 5776 was deduced by Encke from a careful re-examination of all the observations made in 1761 and 1769. But several methods have been since applied to the determination of the solar parallax, with results which appear to agree in indicating a larger value for the parallax, or in other words, a smaller value for the sun’s distance, than had been deduced from the transits of 1761 and 1769.

One of these depends on the moon’s motions, and was first indicated by Laplace towards the close of the last century. Since the moon’s distance from the earth, though small compared with the sun’s, bears yet a measurable ratio thereto, it follows that there is not a perfect symmetry between the perturbations produced by the sun when the moon is passing from third to first quarter, and from first to third. The effect of this circumstance is recognisable in the lunar motions, which are affected by a minute variation arising from this cause, and called the Parallactic Inequality. It amounts at the maximum to about 2'; and as it depends on the proportion of the sun’s distance to the moon’s known distance, its amount supplies a means of determining the solar parallax. In 1854 Hansen announced, in a letter addressed to the astronomer royal, that this method, applied to his new tables of the lunar motions, gives a parallax of 8" ’ 9159.
[9:2:797]

A second method depends on the fact, that the earth in reality revolves, in the course of a lunar month, around the common centre of gravity of her own globe and the moon’s. The diameter of the orbit thus circuited by the earth (in the same sense, at least, as the moon may be said to circuit in her monthly orbit) amounts to about 6000 miles, and by the radius of this small orbit the earth is sometimes in advance of and sometimes behind her mean position in heliocentric longitude. The sun’s geocentric longitude is affected to precisely the same degree as the earth’s heliocentric longitude; and by determining the actual amount of the sun’s displacement, we can ascertain what angle the mean diameter of the earth’s monthly orbit subtends at the sun. Lcverricr, by the careful study of a great number of observations of the sun made at the principal observatories in Europe, came to the conclusion that the solar parallax is 8" - 95. But recently Mr Stone of Greenwich detected a numerical error in Leverrier’s computations, and when this is corrected, the value 8" ’ 91 results. Prof. Newcomb of Washington has by the same method deduced the value 8" ’ 84.

Another method, depending on terrestrial measurements of the velocity of light, need not be here described, as the principles involved are mainly optical, and belong to the subject of Light. Of course the comparison between the velocity of light measured without reference to extraterrestrial bodies, and the velocity inferred from the time of the passage of light over given celestial distances, supplies at once the means of testing the accepted measures of thèse distances. Fizeau, by a measurement of the velocity of light depending on the rapid rotation of toothed wheels, has deduced a solar parallax falling even somewhat short of that obtained by Delambre from the transit of 1769. But Fizcau’s method is not susceptible of great exactness. Foucault, by a much more effective method (the principle of which is due to Wheatstone), depending on the use of revolving mirrors, deduced the value 8" - 942.

We have seen that observations of Mars have given the values 8" - 943 in Stone’s hands, 8" - 964 in Winnecke’s, and 8" ’ 855 in Newcomb’s. By combining, according to their various importance, the values indicated above, the astronomer royal and Leverrier deduced the probable mean value 8" ’ 94. Unfortunately, Leverrier’s own estimate had not been corrected when this value w as adopted, and 8" , 92 may be considered as in all probability nearer the truth. But for the present 8" - 94 may be adopted for convenience, as it has been used in the recalculation of the dimensions of the solar system by nearly all writers on astronomy in Europe and America. It is the value which has been used in the table of Elements at p. 782. Mr Stone, after discussing the observations made in 1769, with special reference to the effects of the peculiarity at the internal contacts of Venus, described in Chapter VIII., supra, has arrived at the conclusion, that the value 8" ’ 9 more correctly represents the observations of 1769 than De-lambre’s 8" ’ 6, or Encke’s 8" ’ 5776. But little value can be attached to this result, seeing that the correction for the interval of time between real contact and apparent contact comes out from the equations themselves which are made use of to determine the parallax, and this correction 17* is constant, whereas the observed time difference in 1769 was not only far from constant, but in every instance far exceeded 17*. One or two English astronomers still attach weight to Mr Stone’s investigation, but Continental and American astronomers are unanimous in discarding it.

Much interest attaches to the lato transit of 1874, now known to have been successfully observed at a sufficient number of stations to ensure success. At most of the stations the whole transit was observed by Halley’s method. At the English stations in the northern hemisphere another method called Delisle’s was employed. This method depends on the observation and eventual comparison of the absolute times of ingress or egress, where these phenomena are considerably accelerated or retarded by the effects of parallax. Photography has also been applied, as well as direct micrometrical measurement, to determine the planet’s distance from the sun’s centre at different epochs.

Owing to certain mistakes made with reference to the relative values of the two methods of observation, for the transits of 1874 and 1882, it was long thought that Delisle’s only could be applied; and it was stated positively that Halley’s method fails totally in 1874. But fortunately the mistake was discovered in good time, and in the summer of 1873, the leading astronomers of England urged the desirability of applying Halley’s method. At the time of writing (April, 1875), the reports from the principal stations, though promising excellent results, afford no means of determining what changes will have to be made in our estimate of the sun’s distance. The first rough analysis of some of the observations gives 8* ’ 88 for the solar parallax. Another transit of Venus will occur on December 6, 1882; after which Venus will not again transit the sun until Juno 8, 2004, and June 6, 2012. The beginning of the transit of 1882, the whole transit of 2004, and the end of the transit of 2012, will be visible in England.

Cπλpter X.— The Moon—Iler Phases, Parallax, Magnitude, Motions, and Probable Physical Conditions.

The different appearances or phases of the moon were probably the first celestial phenomena observed with any degree of attention. They have been described in general terms in Chapter IV., but must now be more particularly considered. The following definitions may conveniently bo given in this place. When the moon passes the meridian at the same time with the sun, she is said to be in Conjunction. The two points of her orbit in which she is situated when in opposition and conjunction are called the Syzygies; those which are 90° distant from the sun are called the Quadratures; and the intermediate points between the syzygies and quadratures are called the Octants.

A slight attention to the lunar phases during a single revolution will be sufficient to prove that they are occasioned by the reflection of the sun’s light from the opaque spherical surface of the moon. This fact, which was recognised in the earliest ages, will be made obvious by the help of a diagram. If the moon is an opaque body, we can only see that portion of her enlightened side which is towards the earth. Therefore, when she arrives at that point of her orbit M 1 (fig. 34) where she is in conjunction with the sun S, her dark half is towards the earth, and she disappears, as at 1, fig. 35, there being no light on that half to render it visible. When she comes to her first octant, at Μ., or has gone an eighth part of her orbit from her conjunction, a quarter of her enlightened side is towards the earth, and she appears horned, as at 2. When she has gone a quarter of her orbit from her conjunction, to Μ , she shows us one-half of her enlightened side, as at 3, and we say she is a quarter old. At M 4 , she is in her second octant, and by showing us more of her enlightened side she appears gibbous, as at 4. At M 5 , her whole enlightened side is towards·the earth, and therefore she appears round, as at 5, when we say it is full moon. In her third octant, at M c , part of her dark side being towards the earth, she again appears gibbous, and is on the decrease, as at 6. At Μ., we just see one-half of her enlightened side, and she appears as a semicircle, as at 7. At M g , when she is in her fourth octant, we only see a quarter of her enlightened side, and she appears horned, as at 8. And at [9:2:798] Mi, having completed her course from the sun to the sun aσain. she disappears, and we say it is new moon.

is very considerable. On comparing her parallaxes observed at different times, they are found to differ considerably in value. These differences in the value of the the same instant of time, on account of the spheroidal figure of the earth. Hence it is necessary, in speaking of the horizontal parallax, to specify the place of the observation.

Since the parallax of the moon is subject to incessant variation, it is necessary to assume a certain mean value, about which the true and apparent values may be conceived to oscillate. This is called the constant of parallax. If we abstract all the inequalities of the lunar orbit, and suppose the moon to be at her mean distance and mean place, the constant of parallax will be the angle under which a given semidiameter of the earth is seen by a spectator at the moon in such circumstances. But, for convenience, the constant of parallax is understood t0 be = X⅞¾ which > see Chapter IV., is in reality = sine of the mean horizontal parallax.

The best modern observations assign 57' 2"∙7 as the value of the lunar mean equatorial horizontal parallax, corresponding to a distance of 238,818 miles. The mean equatorial parallax being 57' 2""7, its double is l 0 54' 5" , 4, which expresses the angle subtended by the diameter of the earth at the distance of the moon. The angle subtended by the moon at the same distance is 3Γ 5" ’ 1; whence the diameter of the moon ds to that of the earth as 31' 5"'1 is to l 0 54' 5" ’ 4, or as 3 to 11 nearly. The accurate expression of the above ratio is 1: 0 , 27251; hence the true diameter of the moon is 0 , 2725 diameters of the terrestrial equator. The surface of the moon is consequently (0O2725) 2 = ΟΌ742 = 1 ^4ττ of that of the earth, and its volume (0 ’ 2725) 3 = 0Ό202 = τπ .γ ττ or, in round numbers, - 5 ⅛ths of the volume of the earth. For other elements, see table of Lunar Elements, p. 782.

The Ascending Node of the lunar orbit is that point of the ecliptic through which the moon passes when she rises above the ecliptic towards the north pole; it is distinguished by the character Ω. The Descending Node, t3, is the opposite point of the ecliptic, through which she passes when she descends below that plane towards the south. The position of the nodes is not fixed in the heavens. They move in a retrograde direction, or contrary to the order of the signs; and their motion is so rapid that its effects become very apparent after one or two revolutions.

The mean retrograde motion of the nodes is found, by

The moon’s absolute distance from the earth is obtained by means of her parallax, which on account of her proximity parallax arise from the variations of the moon’s distance from the earth. But it is also observed to differ sensibly at different points of the earth’s surface, even at the comparison of observations made at distant epochs, to amount to 19° 21' 18"*3 in a mean solar year, and the time in which they make a tropical revolution is consequently 6793 , 391 mean solar days. The inclination of the lunar orbit is observed to vary between 5° 3' and 5° 13'. The mean inclination may be taken at 5° 8'.

The inclination of the lunar orbit to the plane of the terrestrial equator occasions considerable differences in the intervals between the moon’s rising or setting on successive days, and gives rise to the phenomenon of the Harvest Moon. As the daily motion of the moon is about 13° from west to east, it follows that if she moved in a plane parallel to the equator, she would rise 50 minutes later every successive evening. For the sake of explanation, we may here suppose the moon to move in the plane of the ecliptic. Now, the time in which a given arc of the ecliptic rises above the horizon depends on its inclination to the horizon. In our latitudes the inclination of the ecliptic at different points to the horizon varies so much, that at the first point of Aries an arc of 13° becomes visible in the short space of 17 minutes, while at the 23d of Leo the same arc will only rise above the horizon in 1 hour and 17 minutes. Hence, when the moon is near the first point of Aries, the difference of the times of her rising on two successive evenings will be only about 17 minutes; and as this happens in the course of every revolution, she will rise for two or three nights every month at nearly the same hour. But the rising of the moon is a phenomenon which attracts no attention, excepting about the time when she is full, that is, when she rises at sunset. In this case she is in opposition to the sun, and consequently, if she is in Aries, the sun must be in Libra, which happens during the autumnal months. At this season of the year, therefore, the moon, when near the full, rises for some evenings at nearly the same hour. This circumstance affords important advantages to the husbandman, on which account the phenomenon attracts particular attention.

It is obvious that, as this phenomenon is occasioned by the oblique position of the lunar orbit with regard to the equator, the effect will be greater than what has just been described if the plane of that orbit makes a greater angle with the equator than the plane of the ecliptic does. But we have seen that the plane of the moon’s orbit is inclined to the ecliptic in an angle exceeding 5’; consequently, [9:2:799] when her ascending node is in Aries, the angle which her orbit makes with the horizon will be 5° less than that which the ecliptic makes with the horizon, and the difference of time between her risings on two successive evenings will be less than 17 minutes, which would have been the time had her orbit coincided with the ecliptic. On the contrary, when the descending node comes to Aries, the angle which her orbit makes with the horizon will be greater by 5°, and consequently the difference of the times of her successive risings will be greater than if she moved in the plane of the ecliptic. If when the full moon is in Pisces or Aries the ascending node of her orbit is also in one of those signs, the difference of the times of her rising will not exceed 1 hour and 40 minutes during a whole week; but when her nodes are differently situated, the difference in the time of her rising in the same signs may amount to 3∣ hours in the space of a week. In the former case the harvest moons are the most beneficial, in the latter the least beneficial to the husbandman. All the variations in the intervals between the consecutive risings or settings take place within the period in which the line of the nodes makes a complete revolution.

The moon’s orbit at any moment is an ellipse, having the earth at one of the foci; but this orbit is continually changing in form and position, the eccentricity alternately increasing and decreasing between the limits 0Ό66 and 0Ό44, and the perihelion sometimes advancing and sometimes retrograding, but on the whole advancing at an average rate of 40 J o per annum, so as to complete a sidereal revolution in 3232 , 575 mean solar days. See also table of Lunar Elements. These changes, like those which affect the inclination of the orbit and the position of the nodes, are due to the perturbing influence of the sun on the moon’s motions relatively to the earth. The consideration of these perturbations, whether as affecting the figure and position of the moon’s orbit, or her motions in that orbit, constitutes what is called the Lunar Theory. The following are the chief peculiarities of the lunar movements :—

In the first place, the moon’s motion differs from uniform motion around the earth as centre, because the moon’s orbit is elliptic, so that an equation of the centre corresponding to that already described in dealing with the sun’s motion, but greater in amount, has to be applied to the mean motion.

Secondly, the sun lying constantly far outside the moon’s orbit relatively to the earth, his influence on the whole must tend to diminish the earth’s influence. It is true that when the moon is in quadrature the sun’s attraction tends to draw her towards the earth; but it is manifest that this influence is small compared with the action of the 6un in drawing the moon from the earth when she is in conjunction with him, and in drawing the earth from the moon when she is in opposition. The balance of effects during a single lunation must correspond to a diminution of the earth’s influence, or in other words, to an increase in the moon’s period. Now, if the earth and moon, or their common centre of gravity, were always at the same distance from the sun, this action of his would be uniform all the year round. But as he is nearer in perihelion than in aphelion, he exerts a greater influence in the former than in the latter position; in other words, the lunar month in winter (when the sun is near perihelion) is lengthened to a greater degree by the sun’s perturbing action than in summer (when the sun is in aphelion). Accordingly, on the whole, the moon’s motion in longitude is less in winter than in summer. She lags behind her mean place more and more throughout the whole time that the sun is at a distance exceeding his mean distance; she is therefore at her maximum displacement, behind her mean place, near the time that the sun is at his mean distance after perihelion passage; while she is at her maximum displacement, in advance of her mean place, when the sun is at his mean distance after aphelion passage. The greatest amount by which, so far as this cause is considered, she gets in advance of or behind her mean place, is about 1Γ 12*; and this displacement, because of its period, is called the Annual Equation.

Since the sun acts to diminish the earth’s influence when the moon is in syzygies, and to increase that influence when the moon is in quadratures, the motion of the moon is retarded in the former case and accelerated in the latter, and at the octants there is neither acceleration nor retardation. Hence arises an inequality called the Variation. It was discovered by Tycho Brahe, who found that the moon’s place, calculated from her mean motion, the equation of the centre, and the evection, does not always agree with her true place, and that the variations are greatest in the octants, or when the line of the apsides makes an angle υf 45° with that of the syzygies and quadratures. Having observed the moon at different points of her orbit, he found that this correction has no dependence on the position of the apsides, but only on the moon’s elongation from the sun. It3 maximum value is additive in the octants which come immediately after the syzygies, and subtractive in the octants which precede the syzygies. It vanishes altogether in the syzygies and quadratures, and on this account was not perceived by the ancient astronomers, who only observed the sun in those positions. Its maximum value is 35' 42".

The next inequality to be mentioned is the largest of all, except, of course, the equation of the centre. It is called the evection, and was discovered by Hipparchus, but Ptolemy first recognised the law of its effects. These are to diminish the equation of the centre when the line of the apsides lies in syzygy, and to augment it when the same line lies in quadratures. Thus, supposing the apsides to lie in syzygy, and that it is sought to compute the moon’s true longitude about seven days after she has left the perigee, by adding the equation of the centre to the mean anomaly, the resulting longitude will be found to be above 80' less than that which is given by observation. But if the line of the apsides lies in quadratures, the place of the moon at about the same distance, that is, 90° from the perigee, computed in the same manner, will be found to be before the observed place by above 80'; that is, the computed will be greater than the observed longitude by more than 80'. The maximum value of the evection is l 0 20' 29" - 9. It is occasioned by the sun’s action in modifying the form of the lunar orbit, and so causing the equation of the centre to vary in amount.

The lunar inequalities which we have as yet considered are all of a periodic nature. But there are others of a different kind, the periods of which are so long that, with reference to the duration of human life, they may be considered as permanently affecting the elements of the lunar orbit. These are the Secular Inequalities, the most remarkable of which is the acceleration of the moon's mean motion.

On comparing the lunar observations made within the last two centuries with one another, there results a mean secular motion greater than that which is given by comparing them with those made by Ibn-Junis, near Cairo, towards the end of the 10th century, and greater still than that which is given by comparing them with observations of eclipses made at Babylon in the years 719, 720, and 721 before our era, and preserved by Ptolemy in the Almagest. This acceleration of the moon’s mean motion was first remarked by Dr Halley, and was fully confirmed by Dun-thorne, who was led, by the discussion of a great number of ancient observations of eclipses, to suppose that it proceeded uniformly at the rate of 10* in 100 years. This [9:2:800] was the first attempt to estimate the value of the secular equation, which had hitherto been confounded with the mean secular motion. Mayer was led to the value 7", which he advanced to 9" in his last tables published in 1770. Lalande found it to amount to 9"∙886. In 1786 Laplace demonstrated that the acceleration is one of the effects of the attraction of the sun, and connected with the variations of the eccentricity of the earth’s orbit, in such a manner that the moon will continue to be accelerated while the eccentricity diminishes, but cease to be accelerated when the eccentricity has reached its maximum value; and when that element begins to increase, the mean motion of the moon will be retarded. Professor Adams, however, has recently shown that though a portion of the acceleration is undoubtedly due to the cause assigned by Laplace, in reality one-half or thereabouts remains unexplained by that cause. The researches of Delaunay confirm this view. The theory is entertained that the unexplained part of the acceleration is only apparent, the real cause in operation being a retardation of the earth’s motion of rotation.

The same cause which gives rise to the acceleration of the mean motion, namely, the diminution of the eccentricity of the earth’s orbit, also occasions secular inequalities in the motion of the perigee and nodes of the orbit of the moon. These two inequalities are, however, affected with opposite signs to that of the former, that is, while the mean motion’ of the moon is accelerated, the motion of her perigee and that of her nodes are retarded. By pushing the approximations to a great length MAI. Plana and Carlini, and Μ. Damoiseau, in Memoirs which obtained the prize of the Academy of Sciences for 1820, found different numbers; those of Damoiseau are 1, 4'702, and 0'612.

The three secular inequalities which have been pointed out will obviously occasion others, for all quantities depending on the mean motion, the motion of the perigee, or of the nodes, must be in some degree modified by them. They can only be developed by the complete integration of the differential equations of motion. What is most essential is to select, among the multitude of terms, such as may possibly acquire considerable co-efficients by integration.

Understanding by the term month the time which the moon employs to make an entire revolution relatively to any given point, movable or fixed, we have as many different species of months as there are different motions with which that of the moon can be compared. For example, if we estimate her revolution relatively to the sun, the month will be the time which elapses between two consecutive conjunctions or oppositions. This is called the synodic month, lunar month, or lunation. If we consider her revolution as completed when she has gone through 360° of longitude counted from the movable equinox, we shall have the tropical or periodic month. The interval between two successive conjunctions with the same fixed star is the sidereal month. A revolution with regard to the apsides of her orbit, that is to say, the time in which she returns to her perigee or apogee, gives the anomalistic month. And, finally, the revolution with regard to the nodes is the nodical month.

It is clear that, taking the sidereal lunar month as a standard of reference, any other month will be greater or less according as the point which defines it moves in the same direction around the star-sphere as the moon or in the reverse direction, and that the excess or defect will be greater or less as such motion is more or less rapid. Thus, as the sun advances with considerable rapidity, the synodical month will much exceed the sidereal month; as the point T retrogrades very slowly, the tropical month is very slightly less than the sidereal month; as the apsides advance, on the whole completing a revolution in 8'85 years, the anomalistic month will exceed the sidereal, but only by about ⅜-°-⅜ths the excess of the synodical month; while, as the nodes retrograde, on the whole, completing a revolution in about 18*6 years, the nodical month will fall short of the sidereal by a defect equal to about - 3 ⅛⅞ths of the excess of the synodical month. This is illustrated in the following table presenting the values of the different lunar months. (See further the table of Lunar Elements, p. 782):—
[table]

The moon at all times presents very nearly the same face to the earth. If this were rigorously the case, it would follow that the moon revolves about an axis perpendicular to the plane of her orbit in the same time in which she completes a sidereal revolution about the earth, and that the angular velocities of the two motions are exactly equal. It is, however, proved by observation, that there are some variations in the apparent position of the spots on the lunar disk. Those which are situated very near the border of the disk alternately disappear and become visible, making stated periodical oscillations, which indicate a sort of vibratory motion of the lunar globe (apparent only), which is known by the appellation of the Libration.

The rotation of the moon is sensibly uniform, while the motion of revolution is variable. The apparent rotation occasioned by the revolution of the moon round the earth is, consequently, not exactly counterbalanced by the real rotation, which remains constantly the same. Hence the different points of the lunar globe must appear to turn about her centre, sometimes in one direction, and sometimes in the contrary, and the same appearances be produced as would result from a small oscillation of the moon, in the plane of her orbit, about the radius vector drawn from her centre to the earth. The spots near the eastern or western edge of her disk disappear according as her motion in her orbit is more or less rapid than her mean motion. This is called the Libration in Longitude. Its maximum value corresponds to a rotation through 7° 45'.

Further, the axis of rotation of the moon is not exactly perpendicular to the plane of her orbit; hence the two poles of rotation, and those parts of her surface which are near these poles, are alternately visible from the earth. This is the Libration in Latitude. Its maximum value amounts to 6° 44'.

Again, the observer is not placed at the centre of the earth, but at its surface. Thus in the course of a day the moon appears to oscillate about her radius vector because of the earth’s rotation. This phenomenon constitutes what is called the Diurnal Libration, and is evidently the effect of the lunar parallax, and corresponds to it in amount, measured in minutes of arc. It therefore never exceeds l 0 Γ 28"∙8.

The libration in latitude and the diurnal libration were discovered by Galileo soon after the invention of the telescope. It was Hevelius who discovered and first explained the libration in longitude. Regarding libration in general, it remains to be stated that, instead of one-half of the moon remaining invisible, about 4111 parts out of 10,000 are absolutely and at all times unseen. If diurnal libration be neglected, about 4198 parts out of 10,000 may be regarded as altogether unseen.

The nodes of the lunar equator coincide with those of the moon’s orbit. The mean inclination of the lunar [9:2:801] equator to the ecliptic is l 0 28' 42'. Mr Baily makes it 1° 30' 11"∙3. Since the descending node of the equator coincides with the ascending node of the orbit, it is evident that its plane lies on one side of a plane parallel to the plane of the ecliptic, while the plane of the orbit lies on the other. Thus the plane of the equator makes an angle of about l o 30' with the first, and of 6° 39' with the second, on the average. But these angles are slightly variable.

The coincidence of the nodes of the lunar equator and orbit ranks among the most curious discoveries of modern astronomy. ∖, It was shown by Lagrange to be a necessary consequence of the attraction which the earth exercises on the lunar spheroid.

The various features of the moon’s surface have been observed with great interest since the discovery of the telescope, and astronomers have been at much pains to determine their selenographic positions. On account of their number, it has been found necessary to distinguish them by particular names. Riccioli designated the most conspicuous of them by the names of astronomers and other eminent men. Hevelius gave them the names belonging to countries, islands, seas, and regions on the earth, without reference to situation or figure. The nomenclature of Riccioli is now universally followed. Delineations of the lunar disk have been given by Hevelius, in his Selenographia t by Cassini, Russell, Schröter, Löhrmann, and others. The subjoined engraving (fig. 36) gives a pretty accurate view of the appearance of the moon in her mean libration.

That there are great inequalities on the surface of the moon is proved by looking at her through a telescope at any other time than when she is full; for then there is no regular line bounding the dark and illuminated parts, but the confines of these parts appear as it were toothed and cut with innumerable notches and breaks; and even in the dark part, near the borders of the enlightened surface, there are seen some small spaces illuminated by the sun’s beams. It is impossible that this should be the case, unless these shining points were higher than the rest of the surface, so that the rays of the sun may illumine their summits before they reach their basis. Portions of considerable extent are also perceived on the lunar surface, which are never brilliant like the other parts, but remain constantly obscure. These are thought by some to be old sea-bottoms; they were formerly supposed to be seas, but this idea has been abandoned. Some of these cavities are upwards of four English miles in depth, and forty in circumference at the orifice. An insulated mountain is frequently observed to rise in the centre of these enormous pits or caverns, and they are surrounded by high annular ridges, the masses of which would fill the enclosed cavities.
[9:2:802]

Herschel imagined that h? even observed volcanoes in activity; but it is now known that he mistook for volcanic light the effects of earth-light reflected from those parts of the moon’s surface which have the highest reflective capacity. It has been urged that, as the brightness of the moon is sensibly equal at all times, she cannot be surrounded by an atmosphere similar to that of our earth. Moreover, if a lunar atmosphere existed, its influence would be perceptible in the occultations of the planets, or fixed stars, by the moon. The effects of refraction as exerted by an atmosphere resembling the earth’s would cause a star to remain visible for a considerable time after it had really passed behind the moon’s globe. In fact, it is easily shown that an atmosphere like our earth’s would prevent any star from being concealed at all. It would render visible a star really placed directly behind the moon’s centre; for the actual refractive effect required for this purpose would correspond to a deviation of the rays of light by about 16', or 8' in entering, and 8' in passing out of the lunar atmosphere. Now the earth’s atmosphere produces a refractive effect of 34' on an orb in the horizon, or more than four times as much as would be required in a lunar atmosphere in order to render visible a star directly beyond the moon’s centre. In point of fact, stars are occulted by the moon the instant they reach her edge; or if at any time there is apparent delay, this is such only as may be fairly attributed to the effect of irradiation.

In recent years the surface of the moon has been studied with increased care.

Löhrmann, a land surveyor of Dresden, planned the construction of a lunar chart on a large scale in twenty-five sections, and in 1824 the first four sections were .published. He was unable, however, to complete this arduous task, as failing sight compelled him to desist. He published in 1838 a good general chart of the moon, 15J inches in diameter.

Amongst contributions to this department of astronomical research must be mentioned the well-executed map by Messrs Beer & Mädler (see their work Der Mond). It is the result of several years’ careful study and micrometrical measurement of the surface of the moon, and every point discovered by the telescope has been laid down with great precision. In Der Mond these astronomers give the measurements of 919 spots, and 1095 determinations of the height of lunar mountains.

∖ Schmidt of Athens has completed the most important contribution yet made to selenographic research. Passing over his earlier and, in his own estimation, unsatisfactory processes of charting, commenced in 1839, we may note that, according to his present plan, the complete chart has a diameter of 6 feet. It is constructed, however, in 25 sections (after Lohrmann’s plan), and these are now completed. But the work still awaits publication, as the expenses of engraving must be very great, and are beyond Schmidt’s means.

Photography has been applied successfully to the work of picturing our satellite, though it will probably be long before photographic charts can be produced comparable with the work of Schmidt, or even of Beer and Mädler, so far as details are concerned.

The moon was first photographed by Dr J. W. Draper of New York, in 1840. Bond photographed ,the moon successfully in 1850, using the telescope of the Cambridge (U.S.) Observatory. Between the years 1850 and 1857, the moon was photographed by Secchi in Rome, Bertch and Arnauld in France, Phillips, Crookes, Hartnup, De la Rue, Fry, Huggins, Dancer, Baxehdell, and others in England. Later, De la Rue produced lunar photographs of remarkable accuracy and beauty. But the very best pictures of the moon yet obtained are by Rutherfurd of New York, using a refractor of 111 inches aperture, and 13 feet focal length, corrected for the chemical rays.

A series of interesting researches has been made into the light-réflecting capacity, or, in point of fact, the whiteness of our satellite, by Zöllner of Leipsic. Bouguer had assigned to cne moon a brightness equal to ^∏⅛ 7rσ th part of the sun’s. Wollaston made the proportion much smaller, determining it at ¾ π - 1 1 0 - γ 0 th only. Zöllner employed two different methods of research. In one he determined the moon’s illumination by tests of her surface brightness; in the other he obtained point-like images of the sun and moon for comparison with corresponding images of candle-flames. The results, lying between those obtained by Bouguer and Wollaston, are also in close agreement inter se. According to the former method, the light of the full moon is ⅞ ι⅞ 1 ⅛⅛ 0 th part of the sun’s light; according to the other, the proportion is as one to 61^,000.

But the most interesting results obtained by Zöllner are those relating to the varying brightness of the moon at her different phases. He found that the defect of light when the moon is not full is much greater than it would be if the moon were a smooth but unpolished globe. From the agreement between the observed results and an empiric formula, intended to correspond for phases within 70° of the full moon with the case of an orb grooved meridionally so that the slopes of the grooves’ sides are inclined 52° to the surface, Zöllner infers that the average slope of the lunar elevations amounts to about 52°. The following table indicates the degree of approximation :—

Chapter XI.— Eclipses of the Sun and Moon.

Strictly speaking, the term eclipse extends to all cases in which one celestial body is wholly or partially obscured by another, either by direct intervention or by the interception of light illuminating the former, so that the term includes transits of inferior planets, the concealment of stars by the moon or by a planet, or the concealment of a satellite by its primary. But the term eclipse is for convenience limited to the three following orders of phenomena :—(1.) The total or partial concealment of the sun by the moon, called a solar eclipse. (2.) The obscuration of the moon by the shadow of the earth, called a lunar eclipse. (3.) The concealment of a satellite of a planet by the shadow of the primary, called eclipses of satellites, and distinguished from occultations in which the disk of the primary hides the satellite from view.
[9:2:803]

Solar and lunar eclipses can be considered together, so far as the general law of their sequence is concerned. From what has been already shown, it follows that, if the motions of the sun and moon could be watched continuously from the centre of the earth, the moon would be seen to pass round the star-sphere once in each sidereal month on a path inclined about 5° 8' to the ecliptic, while the sun would complete the circuit of the ecliptic once in a sidereal year; and the moon would pass the sun’s place once in each synodical month. The place of conjunction of the sun and moon would clearly pass round the star-sphere, advancingly, making the complete circuit of the heavens once in each year on the average; and the same would happen with the place of conjunction of the moon and the point directly opposite the sun. Moreover, as the moon at these conjunctions would, of course, be on her own apparent orbit, and that orbit is inclined to the sun’s, it is clear that, supposing the moon’s orbit fixed, the conjunctions of sun and moon during one-half of the year would occur with the moon in the northern half of her apparent orbit, and those in the other half would occur with the moon in the southern half of her orbit. The same would be true of the conjunctions of the moon with the point opposite the sun, only, of course, the halves of the lunar orbit would be interchanged. At or near the time when the place of either conjunction was crossing from the northern to the southern side of the moon’s orbit, or vice versa, the conjunction would occur with the moon so near to the ecliptic, that if the conjunction was one of sun and moon, she would hide the sun’s disk wholly or partially, while, if the conjunction was one of the moon with that point opposite the sun towards which the earth’s shadow is thrown, she would enter that shadow wholly or partially. In other words, at two seasons separated by six months there would be eclipses of the sun or moon, or both, whereas during the intervening months no eclipses would occur.

The number of eclipses which could occur in either eclipse-season would depend on the rate at which the points of successive conjunction approached and left the ecliptic, on the proximity necessary for the occurrence of an eclipse of either sort, and also on the manner in which the lunar node happened to be passed. For example, suppose that a conjunction of the sun and moon occurred when the moon was exactly at a node, so that a central eclipse of the sun occurred; then, half a synodical month before and half a synodical month after that conjunction, there would be a conjunction of the moon with the point opposite the sun, and the moon being only half a month’s journey from her node, would be at a point of her orbit not far from ths ecliptic. But the extent of the earth’s shadow is such, that the moon would only be partially in the penumbra, and penumbral lunar eclipses are not considered by astronomers. There would therefore be only one eclipse in such an eclipse-season, viz., a central solar eclipse. Next, suppose that when the moon was at her node, she was exactly opposite the sun, then there would be a total lunar eclipse. Half a lunation later and earlier she would be in conjunction with the sun, and she would be at a point of her orbit not far from the ecliptic. In this case, although during half a month from nodal passage the moon supposed to be viewed from the earth’s centre gets to a distance from the ecliptic exceeding the sum of her own and the sun’s semidiameters, and therefore so viewed would pass clear of the sun, yet for the earth, regarded as a whole, she would not pass quite clear of the sun. In other words, for those parts of the earth where the effect of parallax would shift the moon most towards the sun, there would be a slight partial solar eclipse at the conjunction following or preceding the total lunar eclipse. In this case, then, there would be three eclipses, one lunar and total, the other two solar and partial. These results would be approximated to if the conjunction of sun and moon in the first case, or of moon and sun-shadow in the second case, occurred with the moon very near a node. But otherwise there would be an eclipse either solar or lunar a few days before her nodal passage, and another either lunar or solar a few days after her nodal passage, and no other eclipse of either sort in that eclipse-season.

All this corresponds to the actual conditions except in one respect. The lunar nodes retrograde, so as to meet the advancing conjunction-points of either kind; and thus, instead of a year being occupied in the complete circuit of the conjunctions, the actual interval has for its mean value the mean interval between the successive conjunctions of the sun with the rising node of the moon’s orbit, or 346‘607 days. Accordingly, the average interval between successive eclipse-seasons is 173*3 days instead of half a sidereal year.

Eclipses of both sorts are illustrated in fig. 37. Here E is the earth, and the moon is shown in two places—at M, directly between the earth and sun, and at the point opposite M, in the heart of the earth’s shadow-cone. The true geometrical shadows of the earth and moon are shown black, the true geometrical penumbrae are shaded (of course the vertical dimensions in the figure have been enormously exaggerated). The distance EC is variable, being as great as 870,300 miles when the earth is in aphelion, and as small as 843,300 miles when the earth is in perihelion.

The earth’s shadow thus extends about 3⅜ times as far from the earth as the moon’s orbit. In figs. 38 and 39 the extremity of the moon’s shadow is shown on a larger scale, in one case falling short of the earth, in the other extending beyond the earth. For the moon’s conical shadow has a length which varies in the same proportion as the earth’s shadow, that is, as 8703 to 8433; and the absolute length thus varies from 229,780 miles (fig. 38) to 237,140 miles (fig. 39). Since the moon’s greatest mean and least distances are respectively 252,984 miles, 238,818 miles, and 221.593 miles, it follows that for solar eclipses we have—
[9:2:804]
[table]

These numbers correspond to the fact that the limits between which the apparent diameter of the sun varies are 32' 36"∙4 and 3Γ 31"'8, while the lunar disk varies in diameter from 33' 31 z, l to 29' 21"∙9, so that in a central solar eclipse, where the sun is in perigee and the moon in apogee, the sun’s disk extends beyond the moon’s by i (32' 36" ’ 4 - 29' 21*'9), or by 1' 37"∙2; while the sun is in apogee and the moon in perigee, the moon’s disk extends beyond the sun’s by

⅛ (33' 31"∙1 - 31' 31"∙8) or by 59"*6.

In the former case, or any case in which the sun’s disk exceeds the moon’s so that in central eclipse a ring of sunlight is seen, the eclipse is called an annular solar eclipse; while, if the moon’s disk exceeds the sun’s, and the whole of the sun is thus eclipsed, when the centres of the disks coincide, the eclipse is called a total solar eclipse. When only a part of the sun is hidden, and no annulus is formed, the eclipse is called a partial solar eclipse. It is clear that an eclipse which is total or annular for certain parts of the earth will be partial elsewhere; and in cases (which occur very seldom, however) where the point C falls between E and a, fig. 38, the eclipse will be total along a certain part of the central track, and annular along the rest of that track. In a total eclipse the greatest possible breadth of the total shadow uu' (fig. 39) is about 173 miles. This is the minor axis of the shadow-ellipse.

The following table, combined with the fact that the moon’s greatest apparent diameter is 33' 31" ’ 8, will be sufficient to illustrate the general conditions of lunar eclipses and the limits for totality :—·
[table]

It may be added that an eclipse of the sun can only occur when the moon at the time of mean conjunction with the sun is within 19⅜ o of her node, and will certainly occur if she is within 13⅜ o . A lunar eclipse can only happen when she is within 13⅜ 0 of her node, at the time of mean opposition to the sun, and will certainly occur if she is within 7°; but the limits are somewhat wider than those for solar eclipses, if penumbral lunar eclipses be counted. It is convenient to notice that in every period of 21,600 lunations there are, on the average, 4072 solar eclipses and 2614 lunar eclipses, besides 1617 penumbral lunar eclipses— that is, 4231 lunar eclipses including penumbral ones.

Noting that eclipse-seasons last on the average about 33 days, and that three eclipse-seasons each having three eclipses cannot occur in succession, it is easy to determine the greatest and least number of eclipses which may occur in any single year. The average interval between successive eclipse-seasons is 173 - 3 days. Two such intervals amount together to 346 6 days, or fall short of a year by about 19 days. Hence there cannot be three eclipse-seasons in a year; for each eclipse-season lasts on the average 33 days. Suppose an eclipse-season to begin with the beginning of a year of 366 days. The middle of the season occurs at about midday on January 17; the middle of the next eclipse-season 173 ’ 3 days later, or on the evening of July 8; and the middle of the third occurs yet 173'3 days later, or on December 29, early in the forenoon; so that nearly the whole of the remaining half belongs to the following year. This is clearly a favourable case for the occurrence of as many eclipses as possible during the year. If all three seasons could be of the class containing three eclipses, there would be eight eclipses in the year, because the second eclipse of the third season would occur in the middle of that season. This, however, can never happen. But there may be two seasons, each containing three eclipses, followed by a season containing two eclipses, only one of which can occur in the portion of the eclipse-season falling within the same year. In this case there would be seven eclipses in the year. So also there would be seven if in the first season there were three, in the second two, and in the third three, for then the portion of the third falling within the year, being rather more than one-half, would comprise two eclipses. So also if the three successive seasons comprise severally two, three, and three eclipses. The same would clearly happen if the year closed with the close of an eclipse-season.

There may then be as many as seven eclipses in a year, in which case at least four eclipses will be solar, and at least three of these partial, while of the lunar eclipses two at least will be total.

As regards the least possible number of eclipses, it is obvious that, as there must be two eclipse-seasons in the year, and at least one eclipse in each, we cannot have less than two eclipses in the course of a year. When there are only two, each eclipse is solar and central.

As regards intermediate cases, we need make no special inquiry. Many combinations are possible. The most common case is that in which there are four eclipses—two solar and two lunar. Further, it may be noticed that, whatever the number of eclipses, from two to seven inclusive, there must always be two solar eclipses at least in each year.

Chapter XII.— The Planet Λfars.

After Venus, Mars is the planet whose orbit is nearest to the earth. His diameter is about 4400 miles, and his volume about one-sixth of the earth’s; his mass, however, is little more than one-ninth of hers, his density being estimated at only 1 ⅞ths of the earth’s. His mean distance from the sun is about 139 millions of miles; but the eccentricity of his orbit amounting to 0Ό93262, his greatest and least distances differ considerably from this mean value, amounting to 152,304,000 and 126,318,000 miles respectively. It follows that his distance from the earth when in opposition varies largely—in opposition near his perihelion his distance is about 33,800,000 miles, whereas, when he is near aphelion, his opposition-distance amounts to 61,800,000 miles. As he is also more brightly illuminated by the sun when in perihelion, it follows that he appears much brighter when in opposition at that part of his orbit. In fact, the brightness of Mars at opposition near perihelion bears to his brightness at opposition near aphelion, the ratio

(61,800,000) 2 × (152,304,000) 2 : (33,800,000)

× (126,318,000) 2 , or about 34: 7.

In other words, the planet is nearly five times as bright at one of the favourable oppositions as at one of the unfavourable[9:2:805]. The planet’s synodical period being 779·936 days, or two years and about 49½ days, it follows that the place of opposition performs a complete circuit of the ecliptic in an average period of rather more than 7 times the synodical period (for 7 × 49½ days = 346½ days, so that the change in the place of opposition nearly corresponds to the earth’s yearly motion). The correspondence is nearer if two circuits of the ecliptic be taken; for 15 synodical revolutions are equal to 11,699’040 days, and 32 sidereal years are equal to 11,688’2048 days, or not quite 11 days less. But a much nearer agreement still is effected in 79 years, which differ by little more than two days from 42 sidereal revolutions of Mars. So that if at any time Mars in opposition has been very favourably placed for observation, the same condition of things, or very nearly so, will be brought about after 79 years. For instance, in the opposition of 1719, Mars was within 2½ o of perihelion, and shone so brightly as to be mistaken for a new star. He was similarly situated at the opposition of 1798, and will again be so situated when in opposition in 1877.

It is said that Fontana first noted the spots of Mars, and suspected the planet’s rotation. But Fontana’s credit is shaken by his alleged discovery of seven Jovian satellites. Cassini observed the spots at Bologna in 1666, and having continued his observations for a month, determined the planet’s rotation-period as 24 h. 40 m. Observers at Rome, mistaking two opposite faces of the planet for the same face, deduced the period 13 h. Cassini in 1670 again observed the planet, obtaining the same rotation-period as before. Maraldi in 1704 noted changes in the shape of the spots; but from some which underwent little change, he deduced the rotation-period 24 h. 39 m. In 1719, when (as already mentioned) Mars was exceedingly well placed for observation, Maraldi again carefully observed the planet, deducing from the observations of 37 days a rotation-period identical with Cassini’s.

Besides the dark spots, which have a somewhat greenish colour, the rest of the disk being mostly ruddy, astronomers had noticed a portion of the disk around the south pole which was brightly white. Maraldi states that this spot had been observed for 60 years before his later observations were made. One part seemed fainter than the rest, and this portion was subject to considerable changes, occasionally disappearing, while the brighter part was constantly seen.

Sir W. Herschel examined a similar bright region around the north pole, which had not before his time been well seen, because the northern regions of the planet are only bjwed towards us when the planet κ-traversing the parts of its orbit near aphelion. Herschel’s powerful telescopes, however, enabled him to examine the planet during oppositions occurring in any part of the ecliptic. The magnifying powers he used were sometimes as high as 932, and with this the south polar spot was found to be 41" in diameter. From these observations Herschel concluded that the diurnal rotation of Mars is accomplished in 24 h. 39 m. 21⅔ s., that his equator is inclined to his orbit at an angle of 28° 42', and his axis of rotation to the axis of the ecliptic at an angle of 30° 18'.

The bright appearance so remarkable about the poles of Mars was ascribed by Herschel to the reflection of light from mountains of ice and snow accumulated in those regions.
“The analogy between Mars and the earth,” he says, “is perhaps by far the greatest in the whole solar system. Their diurnal motion is nearly the same, the obliquity of their respective ecliptics not very different; of all the superior planets, the distance of Mars from the sun is by far the nearest alike to that of the earth; nor will the length of the Martial year appear very different from what we enjoy, when compared to the surprising duration of the years of Jupiter, Saturn, and the Georgium Sidus. If we then find that the globe we inhabit has its polar regions frozen and covered with mountains of ice and snow, that only partly melt when alternately exposed to the sun, I may well be permitted to surmise that the same causes may probably have the same effect on the globe of Mars; that the bright polar spots are owing to the vivid reflection of light from frozen regions; and that the reduction of those spots is to be ascribed to their being exposed to the sun.”

According to Herschel, the ratio of his equatorial and polar axes is 103 to 98. Schröter estimates the same ratio to be that of 81 to 80, but later observers have found no perceptible compression.

Observations of Mars in recent times have added largely to our know4edge of the planet.

From drawings by Beer and Mädler (1830-1857), Dawes (1856-1866), De la Rue, Secchi, and others, Proctor has constructed the above chart of the planet (fig. 40).

But the latest drawings, taken during the opposition of [9:2:806] 1873, while showing excellent agreement with the chart as respects the southern parts of Mars, present some features in the northern hemisphere (more favourably seen in 1871 and 1873 than for many previous years) which are wanting in the above chart. This will be manifest from the views here given (figs. 41, 42, 43, and 44), obtained by Mr Knobel, F.R.A.S., with an 8-inch reflector of the Browning-With construction.

The shape of the planet has been repeatedly measured, but the results are not accordant. A set of measures made at Greenwich with a double-image micrometer in 1845 gave ∙⅛ for the ellipticity, and another set in 1852 gave 7 ⅛. Arago contends for an ellipticity of ⅛ the result of the Paris measures. But some observers can detect no difference between the polar and equatorial diameters; some even find the polar diameter longer than the equatorial. Adhuc sub judice lis est.

The planet’s rotation has been determined more accurately than was possible in Herschel’s time. Beer and Mädler, from their observations in 1830-1837, deduced the rotationperiod 24 h. 37 m. 23*8 s., and showed how Herschel had omitted to count one complete rotation when he deduced the period above mentioned. Kaiser of Leyden, by comparing his own observations in 1862 with those of Beer and Mädler, Sir W. Herschel, and finally (carrying back the research) with an observation made by Huyghens in 1672, deduced the period 24 h. 37 m. 22*62 s.

Proctor, by a similar process, extending from observations made in 1869 backwards to an observation by Hooke in 1666 (N.S.), deduced the period 24 h. 37 m. 22 , 735 s. Kaiser contended for the accuracy of his result, asserting that Hooke’s pictures were less trustworthy than Huyghens’s. But recently, in 1873, Proctor has detected three errors in Kaiser’s computation, who has reckoned the years 1700 and 1800 as leap years instead of common years, and made a further error of a day in correcting Hooke’s date from old style into new. When account is taken of these corrections, Hooke’s observations and Huyghens’s are easily reconciled. Due weight being given to each, the period 24 h. 37 m. 22*72 s. results, a value probably lying within 0Ό1 s. of the true sidereal rotationperiod of the planet.

It remains only to be added, that the spectroscopic observations of Mr Huggins show that the vapour of water is present in the atmosphere of Mars, a discovery of great interest and importance. A volume, however, instead of the limited space which is here available, would be required to discuss fully all that has been discovered respecting the planet Mars.

Chapter XIII.— Asteroids, or Minor Planets.

On the first day of ∙.ue present century a new planet was discovered, which, although in one sense seeming to fill up a gap in the solar system, was yet unlike any hitherto known member of the planetary family. Kepler and Titius, followed in later times by. Bode, had adopted the view that a planet was wanting to complete the symmetry of the solar system, as indicated by a certain law of progression in the planetary distances. This law is presented in the following table, which includes Uranus (known to Bode, but not to his predecessors in the recognition of this law) :—
[table]

Here the series 7, 10, 16, Ac., is obtained by adding tc 4 successively the numbers 3, 6, 12, 24, Ac., forming a geometrical series; and the distances of Venus, the earth, Mars, Jupiter, Ac., which are indicated in the lowest row, are found to correspond with the members thus obtained very closely indeed. Mercury is included in the above table, though the proper number to add to the constant 4 would be 1⅜, not zero, and thus the distance of Mercury is really less than τ 8 τ ths of the proper distance according to the law of progression. And in passing it may be noticed that the distance of Neptune on the outside of the system differs as markedly from that indicated by the above law as the distance of the innermost known planet; for the law gives the distance of the next planet beyond Uranus as 388 on the scale above used, whereas the real distance of Neptune is 300 on that scale. However, towards the close of the last century, when Uranus had but lately been discovered and found to obey the law of distances, it was natural that the attention of astronomers should be directed to the strange gap in the series between Mars and Jupiter. So great was the confidence with which many now regarded the law, that the theory was advanced that a planet invisible to the naked eye was travelling within the seemingly vacant space; and through the exertions of Baron de Zach, an association of 24 astronomers was formed to search the zodiac for the unseen planet. Yet the discovery was not made by any member of this society. Wollaston had laid down a star in his catalogue where no star could be seen. Piazzi carefully examined the neighbourhood, to determine whether some star really existing there had been misplaced by Wollaston. On January 1, 1801, he noted a small star in Taurus, which on January 3 had changed its place. He wrote to Oriani and Bode; but the planet, which was at its stationary point, following opposition, on January 12, had become invisible owing to its approach to the sun, before the letter reached them, and Piazzi himself fell ill soon after. But Gauss the eminent mathematician undertook to compute the new planet’s orbit and motions from the observations made by Piazzi, and at length, after long searching, De Zach rediscovered the planet on December 3, 1801, Olberβ independently discovering it on the following evening. The planet was found to correspond well with the theory which had suggested the search for it, since its distance is 2*767 where the earth’s distance is represented by unity, or 27*67 on the scale used in the above table. Piazzi gave to the new* planet the name Ceres. Besides differing from the other known planets in being so small as apparently to belong to a different order, Ceres was found to have an inclination (of more than 10⅜ o ) exceeding largely even that of Mercury. But these anomalous relations were soon found to be but the first indications of a discovery altogether more remarkable.

During his long and arduous search for Ceres, Dr Olbers of Bremen had had occasion to examine with peculiar care the stars near her path. On March 28, 1802, he observed a star near Bode’s stars 20 and 191 Virginis, where he felt sure that no star had existed during his former observations. After two hours it had moved very much as Ceres had done when he had first seen her almost in the same spot. Subsequent observations showed that this was a small planet (to which the name Pallas was given) travelling in an orbit having a mean distance of about 2*770 (earth’s as 1), slightly exceeding, therefore, that of Ceres, but with an eccentricity of *248, considerably exceeding that of any known planet, and an inclination of 34° 39', exceeding the sum of the inclinations of all the other planets together. The effect of this great inclination on the geocentric position of the planet is even more remarkable than the heliocentric range [9:2:807] of more than 69° in latitude. For when Pallas is at her greatest heliocentric latitude, and near opposition, her geocentric latitude exceeds 42°. This is very different from Venus’s range of less than 9° in geocentric latitude, which had been regarded as the maximum, and had led astronomers to assign to the zodiac a breadth of 18°. A zodiac to include the asteroids should be 90° in breadth, and would cover - 1 ⅞ths of the whole heavens.

Even more remarkable, however, was the discovery of two planets having nearly the same mean distance from the sun. The supposition that yet others might be found was naturally suggested; indeed, Olbers was led to conjecture that Ceres and Pallas are but fragments of a larger planet formerly circulating at the same distance, and shattered by some tremendous internal convulsion; and he proposed that search should be made where the paths of these planets nearly intersect. For if his theory were true, this must be the region where the explosion took place, and the fragments must continue topass through that region.

While Harding of Lilienthal was charting the stars near the paths of Ceres and Pallas in the region thus indicated, he determined, on September 2,1804, the position of a small star in Pisces, near 93 and 98 of Bode’s catalogue. On September 4 the star was no longer in the same position. It was found to be a planet (to which the name Juno was given) travelling at a mean distance of 2 , 67 (considerably less than that deduced for Ceres and Pallas), in an orbit having eccentricity 0 - 257, and inclination 13° 1'. The effect of this great eccentricity is remarkable, as may be thus indicated :—supposing the apsides of the orbit to correspond to the planet’s solstices, then the summer of one hemisphere is only half as long as the winter of that hemisphere, or as the summer of the other.

Next Olbers, pursuing the same method, discovered Vesta, moving in an orbit having mean distance 2’373 (far less even than Juno’s), eccentricity 0Ό898, and inclination 7° 7Γ.

A long interval then elapsed without the discovery of any new members of this remarkable family. It was not until December 8, 1845, that the fifth was recognised. On that night Μ. Hencke, an amateur astronomer of Driessen, discovered the body since named Astraea. He communicated his discovery to Encke and Schumacher, who confirmed it by observations made with more powerful telescopes. Μ. Hencke also discovered the sixth planet, on July 1, 1847. Since that time not a year has passed without the discovery of one or more minor planets; and in some years as many as ten or twelve have been added, At present (April 1875), the total number known amounts to 143, as shown in the following table, which gives also the names of the discoverers, as well as the date and place of discovery. It is to be observed that Melete, numbered 56, was mistaken for 41 till January 1859.

It haβ been shown by Leverrier, from the observed secular motion of the perihelion of Mars, that the combined mass of all the asteroids cannot exceed one-fourth of the earth’s mass, even if the whole perturbation were ascribed to asteroids, and no account taken of the error in the estimated mass of the earth compared with the sun’s. But as the recent new estimate of the sun’s distance assigns a relatively increased mass to the earth, almost sufficient of itself to account for the observed motion of the perihelion of Mars, it appears to follow that the combined mass of the asteroids must be exceedingly small. Prof. Newcomb, of Washington, after carefully analysing the motions of the asteroids, comes to the conclusion, that, “though there are some peculiarities in the mutual relations between the orbits of these bodies which might favour Olbers’s hypothesis, a much greater number of peculiarities negative the assumption.”

Prof. Kirkwood, of Bloomington, Indiana, has shown that, when the mean distances of the minor planets are arranged in order of magnitude, certain gaps are recognised, that is, there are no asteroids having mean distances nearly equal to certain definite values. These values correspond to distancée at which asteroids would revolve in periods associated with Jupiter’s period by certain simple laws of commensurability. He infers, therefore, that the asteroids had an origin resembling that assigned to them by the nebular hypothesis. He compares the observed peculiarity to the existence of at least one great gap in the Saturnian ring system, showing that “a satellite revolving within that gap would have a period associated with the periods of Saturn’s inner satellites, by similar simple laws of commensurability.”

Chapter XIV.— The Planet Jupiter.

Jupiter is the largest planet of the solar system. Indeed he surpasses the rest so greatly, that the combined mass of all of them together would barely exceed two-fifιT t '. of his. This superiority is deserving of more consideration than it has commonly received. If we are justified in regarding our moon or the asteroids as belonging to a différent order of bodies from the earth, Venus, Mars, and Mercury, because so much less than them in mass, we may not unreasonably regard Jupiter as belonging to a different order, because so much exceeding in mass the planets which travel within the zone of asteroids. The earth exceeds the moon only 81 times in mass, but Jupiter exceeds the earth in mass more than 300 times.

Jupiter travels at a distance from the sun exceeding the earth’s 5⅜ times, or at a mean distance of 475,692,000 miles. The eccentricity of his orbit is considerable, amounting to 0Ό48239, so that his greatest and least distances amount respectively to 498,639,000 miles and 452,745,000 miles. When in opposition, and at his mean distance, his distance from the earth amounts to about 361,000,000 miles. His orbit is inclined about l o 18' 40'' ’ 3 to the ecliptic. His sidereal revolution is completed in 4332’5848 days, or 11 years 314’92 days; whence it is easily calculated that his synodical period, or the interval separating his mean returns to opposition, has a mean value of 398’867 days. His mean diameter is nearly 85,000 miles in length, according to the best modern measurements, though strict accuracy cannot be claimed for this estimate, as the various determinations, even by the most skilful observers, differ considerably inter se. Until recently, the compression of his globe had been estimated at ⅛ from the observations of W. Struve; but later measurements give τ 1 τ as the compression. His volume exceeds the earth’s 1233’205 times, but his density is only about one-fourth of hers, and his mass does not exceed hers more than 301 times.

Although the actual order of discovery would lead us to speak of the satellites of Jupiter before considering the features of his globe, it will be for several reasons more convenient to describe these features first. Cassini was the first to discover that Jupiter’s globe is surrounded by belts apparently belonging to his surface. The features of these belts as described by Cassini are those which still continue to be recognised. Their number is variable; sometimes only one can be readily discerned, while at others the whole surface is covered by them. They are generally parallel to one another, as in fig. 45, but not always so. Their breadth is likewise variable, one belt having been observed to grow narrow, while another in its neighbourhood has increased in breadth, as if one had partially flowed into the other; and in this case a part of an oblique belt is commonly recognised between them, as if forming the channel of communication. Some of these peculiarities are illustrated in figs. 46, 47, and 48. Sometimes the belts remain unchanged for months; at others, new belts have formed in an hour or two. Although his surface appears thus variable, yet at times spots have been visible for several weeks, whose motions have served to indicate the law of the planet’s rotation.

In 1665 Cassini observed a spot near the large central belt of Jupiter. It moved more quickly when near the middle of the disk than when near the edge, and also appeared narrower when at the edge, showing that it belonged to the surface (that is, to what appears as the surface) of the planet. This principal or ancient spot, as [9:2:809] it is called, is the largest and most permanent of any yet discovered. It appeared and vanished eight times between the years 1665 and 1708, then continuing invisible till 1713. The spot has been frequently observed since, sometimes remaining visible for two or three years in succession, at others being unseen for as long or longer. It would be rash, how*ever, to assume that the same spot has been seen, especially as there is reason to believe that a dark spot on J upiter, instead of being a permanent feature of his surface (and only concealed from time to time by clouds), resembles rather a large spot upon the sun, an opening formed either by cyclonic disturbance in a deep atmosphere, or by some process of disturbance acting from beneath such an atmosphere. From various sets of observations made upon spots seen for long periods, the following rotation-periods have been deduced :—
[table]

Mädler’s rotation-period is commonly regarded as the most reliable. It was based on observations commenced on November 3, 1834, and continued on every clear night until April 1835, a period including 400 revolutions. Two dark spots were visible when these observations were made. It need hardly be said, however, that very little reliance can be placed on the seconds in Mädler’s, Airy’s, or Schröter’s determinations. In fact, there is clear evidence that spots on Jupiter are subject to a proper motion, like that which affects the spots on the sun. Schmidt, in No. 1973 of the Astronomische Nachrichten, gives a number of cases of such proper movements of spots, ranging in velocity from about 7 miles to about 200 miles an hour. It may be noted, also, that from a series of observations of one spot made between March 13 and April 14,1873, with the great Rosse reflector, a period of 9 h. 55 m. 4 s. was deduced, while observations of another spot in the same interval gave a rotation-period of 9 h. 54 m. 55'4 s.

The equator of Jupiter is inclined only 3° 5' 30" to the planet’s orbit, so that there can be no appreciable seasonal changes. We should expect, therefore, a great calm to reign in the atmosphere of this planet, the more so that the sun’s heat poured upon each square mile of it is (on the average) less than the 27th part of that received by each square mile of the earth’s surface. Moreover, the seasons of Jupiter last nearly twelve times as long as ours, so that we should expect all changes in his atmosphere produced by solar action to take place with exceeding slowness. When, instead, we find signs of verv rapid changes in the aspect of the belts, implying remarkable changes in the condition of the Jovian atmosphere, we seem compelled to recognise the operation of causes much more active than the heat poured by the sun on the distant orb of Jupiter. It seems natural to suppose that Jupiter’s mass is itself intensely heated, and that such inherent heat produces these changes in the condition of his atmosphere. We find also in this theory an explanation of several remarkable circumstances, the significance of which has been somewhat strangely overlooked.

So soon as we institute a comparison between Jupiter and the earth, on the supposition that Jupiter is surrounded by an atmosphere bearing the same relation to his mass that the atmosphere of the earth bears to her mass, we find that a state of things would prevail in no sort resembling what we are acquainted with on earth. For the mass of Jupiter exceeds the earth’s more than three hundredfold, while his surface exceeds hers little more than a hundredfold; so that the quantity of atmosphere above each square mile of surface would be three times greater on Jupiter than on the earth, and, owing to the greater force of gravity, the atmospheric pressure would still more largely exceed that on the earth. In fact, the density of the Jovian atmosphere at the surface would be more than six times as great as the density of our air at the sea level. Yet the extension of the atmosphere would be very much less in the case of Jupiter; for in our air the density is halved for each vertical ascent of 3⅜ miles, whereas in the case of a Jovian atmosphere similarly constituted, the density would be halved for each vertical ascent of 1∣ miles. At a height, therefore, of 10⅜ (7 times 1∣) miles from the surface of Jupiter the pressure would only exceed-^ (= τ ∣ ι th) that at his surface, or say 5 ⅛th that at the surface of our earth; whereas, at a height of 10∣ (3 times 3^) miles from our sea level the atmospheric pressure is still equal to

( = £th) that at the sea level, or 2J times as dense as the Jovian atmosphere at the same height under the supposed conditions.

We see that, in the case of Jupiter, under any assumption of resemblance in atmospheric constitution and condition, we should infer great density at the surface of the planet, but an exceedingly shallow atmosphere, the density diminishing much more rapidly with vertical height than in the case of our atmosphere; and if aqueous clouds formed in such an atmosphere, as in ours, they would occupy much shallower layers. Yet everything in the telescopic aspect of Jupiter implies that the cloud-layers are of great depth. In fact, their appearance shows that they are far deeper than the terrestrial cloud-layers. The disappearance of dark spots at a considerable distance from the limb of the planet, as observed by Mädler (who found that the two great spots by which he timed the planet’s rotation became invisible at from 56° to 57° from the centre of the disk), would indeed imply that the darker inner region lay at an enormous distance below the upper light-reflecting layer. Yet even a depth of thirty or forty miles below the upper cloud-layer would not be consistent with any hypothesis of resemblance between the condition of Jupiter and the earth. Assuming a depth of only thirty miles, the atmospheric pressure would be increased 2 20 times, or more than a millionfold, and the density in the same degree, if the atmosphere could retain the properties of a perfect gas at that enormous pressure. But such a density would exceed some fiftyfold the density of platinum, and of course no gas could exist as such at a thousandth part of this pressure.

Even when we place on one side the difficulty of reconciling observed appearances with the behaviour of gases under conditions with which we are familiar, a difficulty remains which cannot be removed without regarding Jupiter as utterly unlike our earth. If Jupiter had a shallow atmosphere, so that his solid globe were apparently of the same dimensions as the orb we measure, the mean density of such a globe would far surpass the earth’s mean density, if the materials of the two globes were similar; for the pressure within the globe of Jupiter would be enormously greater. Yet we know that, instead of the density of Jupiter being greater than that of the earth, it is not one-fourth of hers. The theory that Jupiter’s globe is hollow is inadmissible, because no shell of Jupiter’s mass could resist the pressure generated by its own gravity. The alternative theory suggested by Brewster, that the substance of Jupiter and his fellow-giants of the outer planetary family may be porous, like pumice stone, is equally untenable for a like reason.

We seem forced, then, to the conclusion, that no [9:2:810] resemblance exists between the condition of Jupiter and that of our earth. This being so, the theory to which we have been already led, that the condition and rapid changes of condition of the deep Jovian atmosphere are due to the planet’s intense heat, suggests at one** a solution of the difficulties just mentioned. These difficulties arose while we were dealing with Jupiter as a planet like our earth. But at the outset we noted, in his great volume and mass, the suggestion of a wide difference between his condition and that of our earth. Regarding him as belonging to a different class on account of his enormous size, and being led also to consider him as intensely heated, we may fairly compare him with a body known to be intensely heated, and of size enormously surpassing the earth, viz., with the sun. And though our difficulties are not in this way removed, yet we find that a much more complete analogy can be established between Jupiter and the sun than between the earth and Jupiter. Thus the density of the sun, like that of Jupiter, is small compared with the earth’s; in fact, the mean density of the sun is almost exactly the same as that of Jupiter. The belts of Jupiter may be much more aptly compared with the spot-zones of the sun than with the trade-zones of the earth, which would certainly not present, as viewed from Mercury or Venus, any resemblance to the belts of Jupiter. The spots on Jupiter are not constant, and in this respect resemble the sun spots. They are like these also in having a proper motion. They change less rapidly, but this is intelligible when we consider how much less intensely heated Jupiter is than the sun.

It remains to be mentioned, in support of this theory of the inherent heat of Jupiter, that the light received from him is far greater than he would reflect if his surface were like that of the moon or of Mars. As the reasoning we have given has not been intended to relate solely to Jupiter, but to Saturn certainly, and probably to Uranus and Neptune, we may suitably present here a table which exhibits the relation between the light received from the various members of the solar system, and appears as markedly to distinguish the giant planets from the inner family, as the relations of size, mass, orbital scale, rapid rotation, and complexity of system, which have been longer known. From the observations of Zöllner, Grundzüge einer allgemeinen Photometrie des Himmels, Berlin, 1861, it appears that the light of the five planets at their mean opposition bears the following proportion to the light of the sun:—
[table]

To which add two estimates of the moon’s light, by comparing surfaces, and by comparing point-like images, of the sun and moon :—
[table]

Whence the average reflecting powers of the surfaces of the six orbs compared would be (on the assumption that the outer planets have no inherent light),—
[table]

These results seem strongly to suggest that the four members of the outer family of planets shine partly by inherent lustre. The spectroscopic analysis of the light of Tupiter and Saturn, though not altogether satisfactory, indicates clearly the existence oi a very deep vapour-laden atmosphere around each planet.

Soon after the invention of the telescope, Galileo discovered that four small orbs or satellites circle around Jupiter. Galileo soon found that their orbits are nearly circular, and their motions nearly uniform. They revolve in planes inclined little to the plane of the ecliptic, so that as viewed from the earth they appear to traverse very narrow ellipses. Even when these ellipses are most open, they all, save the outermost, have minor axes less than Jupiter’s apparent diameter, so that any one of the three interior satellites is necessarily occulted when in superior conjunction with Jupiter as viewed from the earth, and eclipsed in his shadow when in superior heliocentric conjunction; while when in inferior geocentric conjunction, it is in transit across the planet’s disk; and when in inferior heliocentric conjunction, its shadow is in transit. The same is true of the fourth satellite during about two-thirds of Jupiter’s year, viz., for about one-sixth of his year before and after the two equinoxes (four-sixths in all), the plane of the satellite’s orbit being nearly coincident with the planet’s equator. The elements of the satellites are given in the tables on p. 783, and the orbits are pictured to scale in Plate XXVIII. To the elements tabulated may be added these (the densities usually given in the books being altogether incorrect) :—
[table]

Thus all the satellites (except the first) have a density exceeding Jupiter’s. Probably their real densities are greater, as irradiation increases their apparent size.

The motions of Jupiter’s satellites have been very carefully studied. They had not been long observed before a peculiarity was recognised, which Roemer was the first to interpret. Their various phenomena were found to occur earlier when Jupiter was in opposition, and later when he was near conjunction, than the predicted time. (In conjunction, of course, he cannot be seen.) Roemer suggested that the time-difference is due to Jupiter’s variations of distance from the earth,—light, which brings to our earth information of the phenomena, taking a longer time in reaching us when Jupiter is farther away. Ridiculed at first, this theory was before long established by repeated observation, and eventually placed beyond all question by Bradley’s discovery of aberration. (See Aberration, vol. i. p. 48.)

A singular relation exists between the motions of Jupiter’s three inner satellites. It will be observed from the table of elements that the period of the second is almost exactly double the period of the first, that of the third almost exactly double that of the second; in other words, the sidereal motions of I. II. and III. are almost exactly as the numbers 4, 2, and 1. This will be more clearly shown by the following table :—
[table]

The coincidence is not exact; but the following relation holds exactly :— The sidereal motion of I. added to twico the sidereal motion of III. is equal to three times the sidereal motion of II. Thus—

(8"∙478706) + 2(2"O96,567) = 12"∙671840

= 3(4" ’ 223947).

A result of this relation, combined with the fact that when [9:2:811] L and III. are in conjunction II. is in opposition to both, is that the three satellites are never in conjunction together. Thus, starting from a conjunction of I. and III., with II. in opposition, we have, after almost exactly one revolution of I., II. and I. in conjunction, and IIL in quadrature to both; after another, II. and III. are in conjunction, and I. in opposition to both; after another, II. and I. are in conjunction, and III. in quadrature to both; and after a fourth, the same arrangement is resumed as at first, I. and III. being in conjunction, and II. in opposition to both, but the line on which all four satellites now lie holding a slightly different position from that occupied when these circuits began. Thus the satellites can never be all occulted together, or all in transit together.

Chapter XV.— The Planet Saturn.

Saturn is the largest planet but one of the solar system, being surpassed in mass by Jupiter alone. His mass exceeds the combined mass of all the other planets (Jupiter excepted) nearly threefold. He is the sixth planet in order of distance from the sun, and was the remotest planet known to the ancients. He travels at a mean distance of 872,137,000 miles from the sun, his greatest distance being 920,973,000 miles, his least distance 823,301,000 miles. The eccentricity of his orbit is 0Ό55996, and the inclination 2° 29' 28" to the plane of the ecliptic. Saturn’s mean sidereal period of revolution in his orbit is 29 years 167 days (see the Elements, p. 782); his mean synodical revolution, or the mean interval between his successive returns to opposition, is 378 ’ 090 days. The planet’s mean diameter is about 70,000 miles, his polar diameter about 3500 miles less, his equatorial diameter about 3500 miles greater. In volume he exceeds the earth nearly 700 times, but in mass only about 90 times, his density being less than the earth’s in the proportion of about 13 to 100. He rotates on his axis in about 10⅜ hours, the plane of his equator being inclined nearly 27° to the plane of his orbit.

This planet, in consequence of a luminous ring with which he is surrounded, is one of the most interesting objects in the heavens. This singular appendage was first noticed by Galileo, to whom the planet presented a triple appearance, as if a large orb were situated between two small bodies or ατw<ε. He observed that sometimes the ansae were so enlarged as to present the appearance of a continuous ring; at other times they entirely disappeared, and Saturn appeared round like the rest of the planets. After a certain time they again became visible, and gradually increased in magnitude. These curious appearances were shown by Huyghens to be occasioned by an opaque, thin, circular ring surrounding the equator of Saturn, and at a considerable distance from the planet. Saturn moving in the plane of his orbit, carries the ring along with him, which, presenting itself to the earth under different inclinations, occasions all the phenomena which have been described. The ring being only luminous in consequence of its reflecting the solar light, it is evident that it can be visible only when the sun and the earth are both on the same side of it; if they are on opposite sides, it will be invisible. It will likewise be invisible in two other cases, namely, ls(’, when its plane produced passes through the centre of the earth, for then none of the light reflected from it can reach us; and 2cf, when its plane passes through the sun, because only its edge is then enlightened, and being very thin, the whole quantity of reflected light will scarcely be sufficient to render it visible. It is, however, evident that in these two cases the effect will be modified in some degree by the power of the telescope. In ordinary telescopes the ring disappears sometimes before its plane comes into either of the situations mentioned; but Herschel never lost sight of it, either when its plane passed through the earth or the sun. In the last case the edge of the ring appeared as a luminous line on the round disk of the planet, measuring scarcely a second in breadth , but at the distance of Saturn a second corresponds to 4000 miles, which is equal to the semidiameter of the terrestrial globe. The reason of the ring’s disappearance will be easily understood by referring to fig. 49, where the circle abed represents the orbit of

Fια. 49.—Diagram illustrating Different Appearances of Saturn’s Rings.

the earth, A B C D that of Saturn 9⅜ times more distant from the sun. When Saturn is at A, the earth and sun are both in the plane of the ring; its edge is consequently turned towards us, and it will be invisible unless telescopes of very high power are used. See Plate XXIX. fig. 1. As Saturn advances from A to B, the ring gradually opens, see Plate XXIX. fig. 2, and it attains its greatest breadth at C, where a straight line perpendicular to its plane makes a more acute angle with the visual ray than in any other situation, see Plate XXIX. fig. 3. As the planet advances towards D, the plane of the ring becomes more oblique to the visual ray; the breadth of the ring consequently contracts, and it again disappears at E. From E to F, G, and A, the same phenomena will be repeated, only in this case it is the southern side of the ring which is visible to the earth, whereas, while Saturn was in the other half of his orbit, it was the northern side. These changes take place in a period whose full length is Saturn’s year, or about 29∣ of our years. Thus the interval between successive disappearances is about 15 years.

The brothers W. and J. Ball discovered a division separating the ring into two concentric rings, the inner being the wider. Cassini confirmed this discovery. Sir W. Herschel concluded that the matter of the ring is no less solid than that of Saturn, as it casts a strong shadow upon the planet. The light of the ring is generally brighter than that of the planet; for it appears sufficiently luminous when the telescope affords scarcely light enough for Saturn. The outer ring is much less brilliant than the inner.

In observing the ring with very powerful telescopes, s∩mf> nstrnnnmers have remarked, not one onlv. but several dark concentric lines on its surface, which divide it into as many distinct circumferences. In common telescopes these are not perceptible; for the irradiation, by enlarging the space occupied by each ring, causes the intervals between them to disappear, and the whole seems blended together in one belt of uniform appearance. (See fig. 50.)

By means of some spots observed on the surface of the [9:2:812] ring, Herschel found that it revolves in its own plane in 10 hours 32 min. 15 - 4 sec.; and Laplace arrived at the same result from theory. It is worthy of remark, that this is the period in which a satellite, having for its orbit the mean circumference of the ring, would complete its revolution according to the third law of Kepler.

Amongst the most remarkable discoveries of recent times with regard to the ringe of Saturn is that of the inner dusky or semi-transparent ring, sufficiently obvious to any observer capable of using well a moderately good telescope, but which, previously to the year 1850, was only once mentioned by any astronomer. Dr Galle of Berlin saw this ring with the Berlin refractor in 1838, but the attention of the scientific world was not generally drawn to it. The account of Galle’s observations is accompanied by drawings exhibiting the trace of the dusky ring where it crosses the body of the planet. In the year 1850 the ring was recognised almost simultaneously by two observers, namely, by Prof. Bond of the Cambridge Observatory, U.S., and by Mr Dawes. Since that time there has been no difficulty in seeing this appendage, though it requires a practised eye and a good telescope.

At the time of the discovery of the dusky ring, Mr Dawes also satisfactorily established the fact of the division of the exterior ring near its outer extremity; and subsequently he observed a series of discontinuous gradations of colour or intensity of brightness in a portion of the inner bright ring. He observes that “the exterior portion of the inner bright ring to about one-fourth of its whole breadth was very bright, but, interior to this, the shading-off did not appear, as under ordinary circumstances, to become deeper towards the inner edge without .any distinct or sudden gradations of shade; on the contrary, it was clearly seen to be arranged in a series of narrow concentric bands, each of which was darker than the next exterior one. Four such were distinctly made out: they looked like steps leading down to the black chasm between the ring and the ball. The impression I received was, that they were separate rings, but too close together for the divisions to be seen in black lines.” This curious phenomenon was confirmed afterwards by Professor Bond.

Captain Jacobs, at the Madras Observatory, discovered that the dusky ring is semi-transparent, the body of the planet being visible through it. Μ. Otto Struve shows with tolerable certainty that the inner or dusky ring is not a modern appendage to the planet, but that, at the beginning of the 18th century, the dark line thrown by it across the planet was known by the name of the equatorial belt. He also finds reason to believe, from a comparison of the measures of Huyghens, Cassini, Bradley, Herschel, W. Struve, Encke. Galle, and himself, that the inner edge of the interior bπgn', ring is gradually approaching wt body of the planet, while at the same time the total breadth of the two bright rings is constantly increasing.

The opinion now generally entertained respecting the Saturnian ring-system is, that it is composed of multitudes of minute satellites, probably intermixed with vapour, travelling independently around the planet. On no other supposition, indeed, can the permanence of the ring-system be explained.

From observations of some obscure belts, and a very conspicuous spot on the surface of Saturn, Sir W. Herschel concluded that his rotation is performed in 10 hours 16 min., on an axis perpendicular to the belts and to the plane of the ring; so that the planes of the planet’s equator and ring coincide. According to the same astronomer, the ratio of the equatorial and polar diameters of Saturn is 2281 to 2061, or nearly 11 to 10. He also observed that the globe of Saturn appeared to be flattened at the equator as well as at the poles. The compression he thought to extend to a great distance over the surface of the planet, and the greatest diameter to be that of the parallel of 43° of latitude, where, consequently, the curvature of the meridians is also the greatest. The disk of Saturn, therefore, resembled a square of which the four corners have been rounded off. According to recent measures the shape of the planet has been found to be that of an exact spheroid of revolution; but it does not follow that this is always the case. Applying to Saturn reasoning similar to that already employed in the case of Jupiter, we see that the atmospheric envelope may be so deep that the cloud-layers which the astronomer really measures may lie at different levels, under the varying conditions to which the planet is subject.

Saturn is surrounded by a system of eight satellites— the most extended as well as most numerous subordinate system within the sun’s domain. The span of the orbit of the outermost satellite amounts to nearly 4 millions of miles. This satellite is probably larger than our moon, while Titan, the 6th satellite, is nearly as large as the planet Mercury. The elements of the satellites and the names of their discoverers are indicated in the table at p. 783. Their motions are less interesting to observers than those of Jupiter’s satellites, because, owing to their considerable inclination to the plane of Saturn’s orbit, they are seldom occulted by the planet, or transit across his disk.

Chapter XVI.— The Planets Uranus and Neptune.

Uranus is the seventh primary planet in order of distance from the sun, and, with the exception of Neptune, the remotest. His mean distance from the sun exceeds the earth’s more than 19 times, and amounts to 1,753,869,000 miles. But the eccentricity of the orbit is considerable, amounting to 0Ό466; consequently, the variation of the planet’s distance is also great, his greatest distance amounting to 1,835,561,000 miles, his least to 1,672,177,000 miles. Subtracting roughly from his greatest, mean, and least distance the earth’s distance, we obtain the opposition distances 1,744,000,000 miles, 1,662,500,000 miles, and 1,581,000,000 miles respectively; and, therefore, it is manifest that the planet is seen under much more favourable conditions in some oppositions than in others, especially if it is remembered that when at one of his nearer oppositions, Uranus, being also nearer to the sαn, is more strongly illuminated, a point of great importance in the case of a planet so far from the sun. The sidereal revolution of Uranus is performed in 30,686'8208 days, or 84 years 6J days. His mean diameter is about 33,000 miles, and, as seen from the earth, Uranus in opposition subtends an angle of less than 4". The apparent diameter of the sun seen from Uranus is less than 1 ⅛th of the dial. 3 ter of the sun as we see him, or is but about 1⅜'; and the apparent surface of the sun is but about the 367th part of the apparent surface of the sun we see. Accordingly, the light and heat received by Uranus are less in the same proportion. This refers, of course, only to the light and heat received per unit of surface. The whole globe of Uranus receives about ∙ 2 ⅛th part of the heat which is received by the whole globe of the earth. It has been asserted that Uranus turns upon an axis in about 9J hours, but the evidence on which this statement rests is slight and insufficient.

Uranus was discovered by Sir W. Herschel on March 13, 1781, while he was examining the small stars in the neighbourhood of g Geminorum. Being struck with the enormous magnitude of a star in this region, he suspected it to be a comet. He examined it with higher power, and found the disk enlarged, which would not be the case with a star. He therefore announced the discovery of a comet.
[9:2:813]

But it was found to be moving in a nearly circular path, and was presently recognised as one of the principal planets of the solar system. Herschel gave it the name of Georgium Sidus, and foreign astronomers called it Herschel; but the name Uranus, suggested by Bode, of Berlin, is now universally adopted. In 1787 Herschel discovered that it was attended by two satellites, and he subsequently supposed that he had discovered four others; but there is great reason to believe that he had mistaken small stars near the planet for satellites. Two other satellites inferior to the rest have been discovered by Mr W. Lassell, completing the series of four satellites whose elements are given at p. 783. Recently Prof. Holden of Washington, U.S., after careful study of the motions of all four satellites, has found reason for believing that one of those discovered by Sir W. Herschel (subsequently to satellites 3 and 4) is identical with satellite 2, while another seems not improbably identical with the innermost satellite. The satellites of Uranus are distinguished from all others in the solar system by the great inclination of their orbits to the ecliptic, amounting to nearly 80°, and by their retrograde motion. Hind gives 79° 26' as the inclination of the orbits of Titania and Oberon (3 and 4), and for the longitudes of their rising nodes 165° 25' and 165° 28' respectively.

Little of interest has rewarded the telescopic study of Uranus; nor has the spectroscope given any trustworthy evidence, though Secchi, Huggins, and Vogel recognise peculiarities distinguishing the spectrum of Uranus from that due to reflected sun-light.

The discovery of the planet Neptune ranks amongst the most brilliant of the scientific feats of the present century.

For many years the orbit of Uranus had been the occasion of great embarrassment to astronomers, from the impossibility of adequately reconciling the ancient and modern observations by any one set of elements, and from the rapid increase of the error from year to year. Bouvard early suggested that some planet exterior to Uranus caused these apparent irregularities. Amongst the astronomers who entered seriously upon the task of determining the position of such a disturbing planet two arrived at a successful solution of the problem, namely, Mr Adams and Μ. Leverrier.

Adams had, ever since the year 1841, determined on attempting the solution of the problem relating to the unknown disturbances of Uranus, and in 1843 he began his investigations. In September 1845 he communicated to Professor Challis the values of the elements of the orbit of the supposed disturbing planet, and in the following month he communicated to the astronomer royal the same results slightly corrected. These communications did not lead, however, to any steps being taken to secure by observation the discovery of the planet till the summer of 1846, after the publication of Leverrier’s second memoir, in which the same position, within one degree, was assigned to the disturbing planet as that given in Adams’ paper.

Leverrier undertook the task of revising the theory of Uranus at the instance of Μ. Arago. His first memoir on the subject was read before the French Academy in November 1845, and his second memoir in June 1846. A third memoir, entitled “Sur la planète qui qrroduit les anomalies observées dans le mouvement d'Uranus—Determination de sa masse, de son orbite, et de sa position actuelle," was read on August 31, 1846. A fourth memoir, containing the remaining part of Μ. Leverrier’s investigations, was read after the discovery of Neptune on October 5, 1846.

The discovery of the disturbing planet followed almost immediately after the publication of the third memoir of Leverrier. He wrote to his friend Dr Galle, of Berlin, requesting him to search for the planet with the large refracting telescope of the Berlin Observatory, at the position which he indicated to him. This letter reached Berlin on September 23, and on the same evening Galle observed all the stars in the neighbourhood of the place indicated, and compared their places with those given in Bremiker’s Berlin Star-Map. This map had not yet reached England, and on this circumstance probably depended the priority of discovery at Berlin. Galle very quickly found a star of about the eighth magnitude, nearly in the place pointed out, which did not exist in the map. Little doubt was entertained at the time that this was the planet, and the observations of the next two days confirmed the discovery.

After Leverrier had announced the results of his labours, agreeing, as we have seen, with Adams’s results, the resources of the Cambridge Observatory were brought into use for the discovery of the planet, and a systematic search was begun by Professor Challis with the great Northumberland telescope. The sweeps of the portion of the heavens in which it was supposed the planet would be found were begun on July 29, and the planet was actually observed on August 4, but without recognition. After the discovery of the planet at Berlin, it was found that the planet had also been observed on August 12. If, therefore, Bremiker’s map had been in the hands of Professor Challis, or if he had found leisure for the mapping of his observations from night to night, Neptune would have been infallibly detected within a very few days of the commencement of the search, and the whole glory of the discovery would have belonged to the English geometer.

An ancient observation in Lalande’s catalogue was discovered almost simultaneously by Mr Walker, of the Washington Observatory, and by Dr Peters at Altona. Two observations, the one in October 1845, and another in September 1846, were also detected by Mr Hind in Lamont’s Zones; and these (especially the former) contributed greatly to the construction of an accurate orbit. An excellent orbit was computed by the joint labours of the American astronomers Peirce and Walker.

Almost immediately after the discovery of Neptune, it was found to be attended by one satellite. This discovery was made by Mr Lassell in October 1846. The orbit of the satellite is inclined to the ecliptic at an angle of about 29°. By observations of this satellite at Cambridge (in America), and at Poulkowa, two separate values of the mass, namely, ι 0 ⅛ rσ and 14 ] 6τ have been deduced; but the object is so difficult to observe, that a considerable time must elapse before any very accurate determination can be obtained. The satellite is supposed to travel in a retrograde direction, like the satellites of Uranus; but this has not yet been demonstrated.

Chapter XVII.— Comets.

The comets form a class of bodies belonging to the solar system, distinguished from the planets by their physical appearance and the great eccentricities of their orbits.

While the orbits of all the planets are confined within a narrow zone, or to planes not greatly inclined to the ecliptic, those of the comets are inclined in all possible angles. The figures of the orbits, instead of being nearly circular, like those of the planets, often have the appearance of being almost rectilinear. Hevelius seems to have been the first who discovered, by means of a geometrical construction, that the orbits might be represented by parabolas; and Halley first calculated their elements on this hypothesis. After it was known, however, that certain comets return to the sun in the same orbits, it became necessary to adopt the opinion tha^, in conformity with the laws of Kepler, the cometary orbits are ellipses having the sun in [9:2:814] one of the foci. As the ellipses are in general extremely-elongated, and the comets are only visible while they describe a small portion of tlιeir orbits on either side of their perihelia, their paths during the time of their appearance differ very little from parabolas; whence it is usual, on account of the facility of computation, to assume that they really move in parabolic curves. Newton employed the hypothesis of an elliptic motion to compute the orbit of the famous comet of 1680. They have received the name of comets (coma, hair) from the ⅛earded appearance which they frequently exhibit.

One of the most remarkable periodic comets with which we are acquainted is that known to astronomers as Halley’s. Having perceived that the elements of the comet of 1682 were nearly the same as those of two comets which had respectively appeared in 1531 and 1607, he concluded that all the three orbits belonged to the same comet, of which the periodic time was about 76 years. After a rough estimate of the perturbations it must sustain from the attraction of the planets, Halley predicted its return for 1757,—a bold prediction at that time, but justified by the event, for the comet again made its appearance as was expected, though it did not pass through its perihelion till the month of March 1759, the attraction of Jupiter and Saturn having caused, as was computed by Clairaut previously to its return, a retardation of 618 days. This comet had been observed in 1066, and the accounts which have been preserved represent it as having then appeared to be four times the size of Venus, and to have shone with a light equal to a fourth of that of the moon. History is silent respecting it from that time till the year 1456, when it passed very near to th⅛ earth: its tail then extended over 60° of the heavens, and had the form of a sabre. It returned to its perihelion in 1835, and the splendour of its appearance rendered it once more an object of universal interest; it was well observed in almost every observatory.

The orbit of the comet of 1770 was calculated by Lexell, and subsequently by Burckhardt, and both these astronomers found that the observations could only be represented by an ellipse in which the time of revolution was five years and a half; yet the comet has never been seen since, or at least has not been seen moving in the same orbit. Hence it is concluded with certainty that the attraction of Jupiter, near which planet it had passed, was so great as to compel it to move in a totally different ellipse.

Another famous comet, whose periodic returns have been verified by observation, received the name of Encke the astronomer, who first recognised it as having been observed in previous revolutions. It returns to its perihelion in 1208 days. Encke’s comet, although its identity was not discovered till 1818, had been frequently observed, as in 1789, 1795, and 1805; and on these occasions it exhibited very different appearances, having been seenwith and without a nucleus, and with and without a tail,— circumstances which account for its having so long escaped being recognised as a regular attendant on the sun. In its returns to its perihelion in 1808, 1812, and 1815, it escaped detection; but it reappeared in 1818, and it was from the observations of that year that Encke computed the elliptic elements of its orbit. On its next return, in 1822, it was invisible in Europe; but it was observed at Paramatta, in New South Wales, during the whole month of J une, and the time of its perihelion passage was found to differ only by about three hours from that previously computed by Encke. During most of its returns since then it has been well observed.

Other periodical comets will be mentioned further on.

The appearances exhibited by comets are diversified, and sometimes remarkable. That which appeared in the year 134 b.c., at the birth of Mithridates, is said to have had a disk equal in magnitude to that of the sun. Ten years before this, one was seen which, according to Justin, occupied a fourth part of the sky (that is, extended over 45°), and surpassed the sun in splendour. Another, equally remarkable, appeared in the year 117 of our era; and in 479 there was one, of which the disk, according to Freret, was of such magnitude, that it might have occasioned the extraordinary eclipse of the sun which took place about that time. In 400 one was observed, which is said to have resembled a sword, and to have extended from the zenith to the horizon. That of 531 was of greater magnitude still, and its appearance more terrific. Those which appeared in 1066 and 1505 exhibited disks larger than that of the moon. It is, however, probable that these accounts were exaggerated; for since comets have been observed by astronomers, no instances have occurred in which their magnitudes and appearances have been so extraordinary. The most remarkable among those of which we possess accurate accounts appeared in the years 1456,1618, 1680, 1744, 1759, 1769, 1807, 1811, 1841, 1858, 1861, and 1874.

The nucleus, which is the densest and most luminous part, may be said to form the true body of the comet. It is far, however, from having the dense and solid appearance of the planets, and astronomers consider it to be diaphanous, and believe that they have observed stars through it. But it is extremely difficult to distinguish the nucleus from the surrounding nebulosity. If the nucleus were an opaque globular body, it would exhibit phases like Venus or Mars, according to its different positions with relation to the sun and the earth; and such were supposed to have been observed in the case of the comet of 1682, by Hevelius, Picard, and Lahire. But the nebulosity renders the phases obscure, and prevents the true body of the comet from being seen. The real nucleus has probably never been observed by any astronomer.

It is known certainly that comets are of small density, from the circumstance that they produce no appreciable effect on the motions of the planets. The comet of 1770 traversed the system of Jupiter’s satellites without causing any sensible perturbation of these small bodies. This comet also passed very near the earth; and Laplace calculated that, if its mass had been equal in density to that of the earth, the effect of its attraction would have increased the length of the sidereal year by 2 hours 28 min. But since its influence was altogether insensible, it is certain that its mass was not equal to the five-thousandth part of that of the earth, and was probably much less than even this quantity.

If the real nuclei of comets were solid, the matter of which they are composed must be extremely fixed, in order to enable them to resist the intense heat they necessarily experience in their approaches to the sun. According to the computation of Newton, the great comet of 1680, at its perihelion, was only distant from the sun by the 163d part of the semidiameter of the earth’s orbit, where it would be exposed to a heat above 2000 times greater than that of red-hot iron,—a temperature of which we can form no conception, and which would instantly dissipate any substance with which we are acquainted.

The most interesting features of recent research into the subject of comets are (1) the spectroscopic examination of those comets which have appeared since the importance of spectroscopic analysis has been recognised, and (2) the association which has been recognised between meteorsystems and comets.

Before proceeding, however, to discuss these matters, we give the following tables indicating the progress which has been made in the determination of the orbits of periodic comets :—

The fine comet of 1858-59, called Donati’s, was subjected to a rough spectroscopic analysis by Donati, and the spectrum shown to be discontinuous, consisting of a few broad bands. Comet I., 1866 (called Tempel’s), examined by Huggins in 1866, showed three bands in the spectrum of the nucleus. Brorsen’s comet, examined in 1868, showed similar appearances. But it was not until the examination of Winnecke’s comet in 1868 that any successful attempt was made to compare the band spectrum of a comet’s nucleus with the spectrum of a known terrestrial element. The result was somewhat remarkable. It was found that the spectrum is that obtained from carbon when the electric spark is taken through olefiant gas. The same result has been obtained, both by Huggins and by Professors Harkness and Young of America, from the spectroscopic analysis of Encke’s comet in 1872. Professor Harkness sums up the result of his own series of researches into the condition of this comet as follows :—(1.) Encke’s comet gives a carbon spectrum. (2.) From November 18 to December 2, the wave length of the brightest part of the comet’s spectrum was continually increasing. (3.) No polarisation was detected in the light of the comet. (4.) The mass of Encke’s comet is certainly not less than that of an asteroid. (5.) There is some probability that the electric currents which give rise to auroras are propagated in a medium which pervades all space, and that the aurora is in reality the spectrum of the medium. 6. It is not improbable that the tails of all large comets will be found to give spectra similar to that of the aurora, though additional lines may be present.

It is only of late years that the study of meteors or falling stars has come to be regarded as belonging to astronomy. Even now the discovery of the connection of meteors and comets is so recent, and the aspect under which the new department of astronomy presents itself varies so continually as fresh relations are recognised, that it seems desirable to limit our remarks to the statement of a few broad facts.

It has been shown, then, that meteors travel in systems round the sun, and that displays of falling stars occur when the earth passes through a meteor-system.

There are already recognised more than one hundred meteor-systems, known by the direction in which the corresponding falling stars encounter the earth.

The best-known meteor-systems are those which produce a shower on November 13-14 in certain years, and those which usually produce a display on August 10-11. The former have been called the Leonides, because the part of the stellar sphere whence the meteors appear to radiate is in the constellation Leo. The latter, for a like reason, appearing to radiate from Perseus, have been called the Perseides.

It has been found that these two meteor-systems accord, so far as their orbital motions are concerned, with two comets, viz., respectively Tempel’s comet, I., 1866, and the comet known as III., 1862. The association is indicated in the following table :—
[table]

Other comets have been associated, though not quite so distinctly, with meteoric systems. But perhaps the most remarkable evidence in this matter is that afforded by Biela’s comet. At the return in 1866, and again in 1872, this comet was not seen; and as it had become divided into two distinct comets in 1846, the inference was, that it had further subdivided since it was last seen in 1852. Now the orbit of this comet nearly intersects that of the earth, at about the place occupied by the earth on November 27. Accordingly, after the fruitless telescopic search for the comet in 1872, Professor Alexander Herschel pointed out that, during the last week in November, meteors following in the train of this comet might be expected to make their appearance. On the night of November 27, 1872, a remarkable shower of meteors was observed, the meteors radiating from a region of the heavens indicating that they were travelling in the track of Biela’s comet.

The telescopic study of some of the remarkable comets of the last quarter of a century has been rewarded by results of interest. This has been the case in particular with Donati’s comet of the year 1858. During the comet’s passage past its perihelion, several envelopes formed around the head, continually passing outwards, and disappearing after a certain distance from the nucleus had been reached, while new envelopes appeared within. Besides the principal tail, which was curved like an aigrette plume, another thin straight tail was visible for a while; and for a short time yet another was seen. A striation of the chief tail could also be recognised, which, according to the researches of Bond and Norton in America, corresponded to the action of a repulsive force exerted by the sun, and sweeping matter away from the main tail with a velocity exceeding that with which this tail itself was formed, but not exceeding the velocity indicated by the straightness of the subsidiary tails.

The great comet of 1874 is shown in fig. 51, as pictured by Mr Huggins. It exhibits well a peculiarity which has characterised many comets, the well-defined dark [9:2:816] streak behind the nucleus (which, however, is in this case somewhat eccentrically situated). This phenomenon is not easily explained. It is common, indeed, to find it accounted for as due to the absence of illuminated matter behind the nucleus. But as a comet’s tail is not a flat object, spread out on the dome of the heavens, but a conical, or rather conoidal, appendage, which viewed from all sides would present, no doubt, much the same appearance, the line of sight directed towards the axis must pass through the illuminated envelope. Huggins’s spectroscopic examination of this comet yielded results resembling those he had already obtained from small comets. But this was the first comet whose tail he had analysed. The spectroscopic analysis of the various parts of the comet gave the following results :—

“When the slit of the spectroscope was placed across the nucleus and coma, there was seen in the instrument a broad spectrum, consisting of the same three bright bands exhibited by Comet IL, 1868, crossed by a linear continuous spectrum from the light of the nucleus. On the continuous spectrum of the nucleus,” he proceeds, “I was not able to distinguish with certainty any dark lines of absorption, or any bright lines, other than the three bright bands. Besides these spectra, there was also present a faint broad continuous spectrum between and beyond the bright bands. When the slit was moved on to different parts of the coma, the bright bands and the faint continuous spectrum were found to vary in relative intensity. When the slit was brought past the nucleus on to the comméncement of the tail, the gaseous spectrum became rapidly fainter, until, at a short distance from the nucleus, the continuous spectrum predominated so strongly that the middle band only, wlιich is the brightest, could be detected on it. We have presented to us, therefore, by the light of the comet, three spectra: (1.) The spectrum of bright bands; (2.) The continuous spectrum of the nucleus; (3.) Tne continuous spectrum which accompanies the gaseous spectrum in the coma, and which represents almost entirely the light of the tail.”

Chapter XVIIL— The Fixed Stars and Nebulae.

The great multitude of stars visible even to the naked eye renders it impossible to distinguish each by a particular name; astronomers, accordingly, for the sake of reference, have formed them into groups, known as Constellations or Asterisms. To these the early astronomers gave the names of men and animals, and other objects, from fancied resemblances or analogies, for the most part not easily traced. These denominations are preserved in modern catalogues; and the practice of delineating the object itself on celestial globes and charts has been only recently, if it has yet been altogether, abandoned. The ancients distinguished some of the brightest stars in the different constellations by particular names; but to include others less conspicuous, it became necessary to adopt a different mode of proceeding. According to the usual method, first introduced by Bayer in his Uranometria, each of the stars in every constellation is marked by a letter of the Greek alphabet, commencing with the most brilliant, which is designated by a; the next most conspicuous is called β, the third γ, and so on. When the Greek letters are exhausted, recourse is had to the Roman or Italic. The order of the letters was intended to indicate only the relative brilliancy of the stars in the same constellation, without any reference to those in other parts of the heavens. Thus α Aquarii is a star of the same order of brightness as γ Virginis. Moreover, whether owing to carelessness in the original lettering or to changes in the brightness of the stars, the order of the letters does not always correspond to the brightness, even in the same constellation. Thus, ∈, ζ, and η Ursae Majoris are far brighter than δ of that constellation. The stars of the first order of brightness are likewise denominated stars of the first magnitude; those of a degree inferior in brightness are said to be of the second magnitude, and so on with the third, fourth, <fcc. Below the sixth the same denominations are continued; but the stars of the seventh and inferior magnitudes are no longer visible to the naked eye. and are therefore called telescopic stars.

The number of constellations given by Ptolemy is 48, viz. :—

The constellations added by Hevelius are the following (those marked * being now little used) :—

The constellations added by Halley in the southern hemisphere are,—

In considering the fixed stars, the first point to which our attention is naturally directed is the determination of their real dimensions, and a necessary, though not sufficient, preliminary is the determination of their distances from us. An obvious consequence of the annual motion of the earth is the existence of an annual parallax of the stars; but on account of the enormous distances of these bodies, thiβ effect of the earth’s motion is so small, that it cannot be easily measured; and there are even now very few cases in which, with the utmost refinements of methods and instruments, a measurable parallax has been detected. We find that, compared with the distances of the fixed stars, the diameter of the earth’s orbit is merely a point ; for in most cases, the most careful observation of the same star, at intervals of six months, indicates no variation whatever in the star’s position, after the proper corrections have been made for the small effects produced by different known causes. The limits of the errors of modern observations cannot well be supposed to exceed 1". It follows, therefore, that, seen from the distance of the fixed stars, the diameter of the ecliptic, which exceeds 180 millions of miles, subtends an angle of less than 1". Had the annual parallax exceeded this small quantity, it could scarcely have escaped the multiplied efforts that have been made to detect it; yet the distance of a star having a parallax of 1* is × radius of earth’s orbit, that is, about 19 billions of miles.

The first star actually shown to have an annual parallax was the star 61 Cygni, a binary system of two sixth-magnitude stars, having a large proper motion. The parallax was detected and measured by Bessel, using the Königsberg heliometer. He compared the position of the point midway between the pair with that of two very small and presumably more distant stars. From the observations made between October 1837 and March 1840, Bessel deduced as the parallax 0"∙3483, corresponding to a distance of about 600,000 radii of the earth’s orbit. This result was confirmed shortly after by Peters at Poulkowa, who, from observations of the zenith distances, deduced the parallax 0" ’ 349. It will presently be seen that more recent measures do not accord well with these results. In the meantime, though the result was published later, Mr Henderson, at the Cape Town Observatory, had been observing a Centauri, one of the brightest of the southern stars, with the object of determining if it has a sensible parallax. Notwithstanding the inferiority of the instrument he employed (a mural circle imperfectly graduated), Mr Henderson succeeded in recognising a parallax, which he estimated at T'∙16. Maclear, who was his successor as astronomer royal at the Cape, determined the parallax to be 0" ’ 9128, and subsequent observations assign to the parallax the value 0'∙9187. Doubtless 0" ’ 9 fairly represents the most probable value. It is less than a tenth of the solar parallax; in other words, the orbit of the earth as seen from a Centauri subtends less than a tenth of the arc which the earth’s disk subtends as seen from the sun. The distance corresponding to this parallax is in round numbers about 20 billions of miles, a distance which light traverses in about 3{ years.

Other stars have since so far yielded to the attacks made upon them by astronomers as to show signs of having measurable parallax. But it must be admitted that many of the results hitherto obtained are open to considerable doubt, as the following table serves sufficiently to indicate :—
[table]

If we consider that, with the exception of a Centauri, no star has been observed with accordant results, we may question whether the instruments employed by astronomers are as yet competent to measure accurately small parts of a second of arc. As for the parallax assigned to the five last stars of the above list, it would be absurd to place any reliance on the estimated value, save as indicating that those stars lie at so enormous a distance that their parallax cannot be measured.

As the most powerful telescope does not show the real disk of a star, it is not possible to determine by actual measurement the size of even the largest or the nearest. The amount of light received from a star whose distance is known can, however, be compared with that which our sun would give if removed to the star’s distance; and if we then assume equal intrinsic surface-lustre, we may infer (though not very safely) the surface, and therefore the size, of the star. Thus the distance of a Centauri exceeds the sun’s 230,000 times, so that the sun, removed to the star’s distance, would shine with only the 52,900,000,000th part of his observed lustre. But a Centauri shines with about the 16,950,000,000th part of the sun’s brightness. Hence the star emits three times as much light as the sun, or (on our assumption) has a surface three times, a diameter J^3 times, and a volume 3 J 3 times (or more than 5 times) as great as his. Sirius dealt with in like manner would appear to have a volume exceeding the sun’s about 2700 times. But it is probable that the larger stars shine also with a greater intrinsic lustre, mile for mile of surface, and therefore are not so much larger as we should infer from the above method of reasoning.

That the stars resemble the sun iu general constitution and condition has been proved by spectroscopic analysis, the spectra of stars beiug in general respects like the spectrum of the sun. Nevertheless, characteristic differences [9:2:818] exist, insomuch that the stars have been divided into four orders, distinguished by their spectra. These are thus presented by Secchi, after examination of the spectra of more than 500 stars :—

The first type is represented by α Lyrae, Sirius, <tc., and includes most of the stars shining with a white light, as Altair, Regulus, Rigel, the stars β, γ, ε, ζ, and η of Ursa Major, &c. These give a spectrum showing all the seven colours, and crossed usually by multitudes of dark lines, but always by the four lines of hydrogen, very dark and strong. The breadth of these lines indicates a very deep absorptive stratum at a high temperature and at great pressure. Nearly, half the observed stars showed this spectrum.

The second includes most of the yellow stars, as Capella, Pollux, Arcturus, Aldebaran, α Ursae Majoris, Procyon, &c. The Fraunhofer lines are well seen in the red and blue, but not so well in the yellow. The resemblance of this spectrum to the sun’s suggests that stars of this type resemble the sun closely in physical constitution and condition. About one-third of the observed stars showed this spectrum.

The third type includes Antares, a Orionis, α Herculis, β Pegasi, Mira, and most of the stars shining with a red light. The spectra show bands of lines (Secchi’s instrument showed shaded bands, but with superior spectroscopes multitudes of fine lines appear). The spectra resemble somewhat the spectrum of a sun spot, and Secchi infers that these stars are covered in great part by spots like those of the sun. About 100 of the observed stars belong to this type.

The fourth type differs only from the last in the arrangement and appearance of the bands, and includes only faint stars. A few stars, as γ Cassiopeiae, η Argus, β Lyrae, <fcc., show the lines of hydrogen bright instead of dark, as though surrounded by hydrogen glowing with a heat more intense than that of the central orb itself.

The exact spectroscopic observation of many stars by Huggins and Miller has shown (what Secchi’s comparatively rough observations could not effect) that many elements known to us exist in these stars. Thus, in the spectrum of Aldebaran are lines coinciding with the lines of the elements hydrogen, sodium, magnesium, iron, tellurium, antimony, calcium, bismuth, and mercury. In the spectrum of Betelgeuse these physicists recognised in like manner the lines of sodium, magnesium, iron, bismuth, and calcium, but found the lines of hydrogen wanting. Sirius, Pollux, Castor, the stars of Ursa Major, and many others, were examined with similar results.

Many stars are coloured. Thus Antares, Aldebaran, and Betelgeuse are ruddy; Arcturus, Procyon,and Pollux yellow; Vega and Altair slightly bluish; while Capella, Sirius, and many other stars are brilliantly white. Among telescopic stars, some are of a deep, almost blood, red, while others are ruddy, orange, yellow, garnet-coloured, and so on. Few single stars show a well-marked blue colour. But among the binary and multiple star-systems, blue, green, indigo, violet, and lilac stars are common, especially as smaller companion stars; such colours as olive, russet, grey, ash-colour, fawn, and so on, are also observed, though this is probably due to the combined lustre of several very small stars closely set. Complementary colours are not uncommon among double stars, the brighter of a pair (in such cases) usually having a red, orange, or yellow colour, and the smaller showing the respective complementary, green, blue, or purple. Nor are these instances to be explained as due to contrast (though contrast doubtless strengthens the apparent hue of the smaller star); for when the brighter is concealed from view, the fainter is still found to shine with its colour unchanged. Spectroscopic analysis shows that usually the colour of a star is due to the presence of absorptive vapours in the star’s atmosphere cutting off certain portions of the light. Thus the orange component of the double star Albireo has a spectrum crossed by several bands in the blue and violet portion, while the blue component has a spectrum showing many strong lines in the red and orange portion,—hence the former star looks orange because of the deficiency of blue and violet in its light, and the latter looks blue because its light is deficient in red and orange.

On examining the stars with telescopes of considerable power, many of them are found to be composed of two or more stars placed contiguous to each other, or at distances subtending a very minute angle. This appearance is probably in many cases owing solely to the optical effect of their position relatively to the spectator; for it is evident that two stars will appear contiguous if they are placed nearly in the same line of vision, although their real distance may be immeasurably great. There are, however, many instances in which the angle of position of the two stars varies in such a manner as to indicate a motion of revolution about a common centre; and in this case the two stars form a binary system, performing to each other the office of sun and planet, and connected together by gravity or some equivalent principle. The observations of Herschel, Dawes, South, and Struve have placed this fact beyond doubt. Motions have been detected which are so rapid as to be measurable within very short periods of time; and in certain cases the smaller star has been observed to disappear, either on passing behind or before its primary, or by approaching so near to it that its light has been absorbed by that of the other. The most remarkable instance of a regular revolution of this sort is that of the double star ξ Ursae Majoris, in which the angular velocity is 6 0, 4 annually, so that the two stars complete a revolution about one another in the space of 60 years, and about a circuit and a half have been already described since its discovery in 1781. The double star 70 Ophiuchi presents a similar phenomenon, a revolution being completed in a period of about 80 years, α Castoris, γ Virginis, ζ Cancri, ξ Bootis, δ Serpentis, and that remarkable double star 61 Cygni, together with several others, exhibit similar variations in their respective angles of position. Sir W. Herschel observed in all 2400 double stars. The catalogue of Struve of Dorpat contains 3063 of the most remarkable. The object of these catalogues is not merely to fix the place of the star within such limits as will enable it to be easily discovered at any future time, but also to record a description of the appearance, position, and mutual distances of the individual stars composing the system, in order that subsequent observers may have the means of detecting their connected motions, or any changes by which they may be affected. There are many triple, quadruple, and quintuple stars. Every region of the heavens furnishes examples of these curious phenomena; but it is remarked that some parts of the heavens contain very few, while others present them in great abundance.

Aggregations of stars more and more complex appear as we extend our survey, and wider and wider regions of the heavens are occupied by groups of associated stars. The most complex and extensive of all such gatherings is the galaxy or milky-way, a zone-shaped region surrounding the whole sphere of the heavens, in which stars innumerable so combine their lustre as to present a milky luminosity. We speak of a zone-shaped region, be it noticed, not of a zone, for the milky-way does not form a complete zone, but simply occupies a zone within which appear streams, and nodules, and irregular clusterings of stars. Along part of the region there is but one well-marked stream; elsewhere two streams are seen, and in other places several·
[9:2:819]

But parts of the circuit are incomplete, while in some cases dark regions in the very midst of a bright stream attest the irregular conformation of this strange star region.

Some of the fixed stars are subject to periodical variations of brilliancy. Several, formerly distinguished by their splendour, have entirely disappeared; others are now conspicuous which do not seem to have been visible to the ancient observers; and some alternately appear and disappear, or at least undergo great periodic variations in brightness. Some seem to become gradually more obscure, as δ Ursae Majoris; others, like β in the Whale, to be increasing in brüliancy. Some stars have all at once blazed forth with great splendour, and, after a gradual diminution of their light, have again become extinct. The most remarkable instance of this sort is that of the star which appeared in 1572, in the time of Tycho. It suddenly shone forth in the constellation Cassiopeia with a splendour exceeding that of stars of the first magnitude, or even Jupiter and Venus at their least distances from the earth, and could be seen with the naked eye on the meridian in full day. Its brilliancy gradually diminished from the time of its first appearance, and at the end of sixteen months it entirely disappeared, and has never been seen since. During the whole time of its apparition, its place in the heavens remained unaltered, and it had no annual parallax; its distance was consequently of the same order as that of the fixed stars. Its colour, however, underwent considerable variations. Tycho describes it as having been at first of a bright white; afterwards of a reddish yellow, like Mars or Aldebaran; and lastly, of a leaden white, like Saturn. Another instance of the same kind was observed in 1604, when a star of the first magnitude suddenly appeared in the right foot of Ophiuchus. It presented phenomena analogous to the former, and disappeared in like manner after some months.

Many stars have been observed whose light seems to undergo a regular periodic increase and diminution, and these are properly called variable stars. The star o Ceti (called also Mira) has a period of 334 days, and is remarkable for the magnitude of its variations. From being a star of the second magnitude, it becomes so dim as to be seen with difficulty through powerful telescopes. But its maxima and minima of brightness are variable. Thus between October 1672 and December 1676 Mira was never visible to the naked eye, while on October 5, 1839, it was half a magnitude brighter than its usual maximum,

Some are remarkable for the shortness of the period of their variation.

Algol (∕3 Persei) shines ordinarily as a second magnitude star, but during about 7 hours in each successive period of 69 hours undergoes the following changes :— It decreases gradually to the fourth magnitude, remaining so for 20 minutes, and then increases as gradually to the second magnitude. Thus it remains a second magnitude star for about 62 houra iu each period of 69 hours. The star β Lyrse in successive periods of 12 days 22 hours undergoes a double change, each occupying 6 days 11 hours (formerly assigned as the star’s true period). In each period the star has a maximum brightness of about the 3 ’ 5 magnitude, but the minima of brightness are appreciably unequal, the star’s magnitude in one being 4 ’ 3, in the other 4 ’ 5. The star δ Cephei varies in a period of 5 days 8 hours 48 min. from the fifth to the 3 ’ 5 magnitude, occupying 1 day 14 hours in passing from minimum to maximum, but 3 days 19 hours in passing from maximum to mininum. Two or three hundred stars are now recognised as variable. The most probable explanation of the variation in long periods is that stars so affected have periodical maxima and minima of disturbance, resembling that which causes the sun spots, only more marked. Some of the variables of short period are probably covered unequally in different parts of their surface by spots. But the variation of such stars as Algol, which shine with a constant lustre for the greater part of each period, and are reduced in lustre for a short interval, cannot be thus explained, and we must suppose that a large opaque orb circling around them transits the central luminary at regular intervals. Most of the stars which have appeared suddenly, and shone for a short time, probably resemble in character the only star of this kind hitherto examined—the star T in Corona Borealis, which, blazing out suddenly as a second magnitude star (usually of the tenth magnitude only), was found by Huggins and Miller to have a spectrum crossed by fine black lines, on which was superposed the spectrum of glowing hydrogen. As the star waned, the hydrogen spectrum faded, and finally disappeared. Presumably there had been an outburst of glowing hydrogen, or a conflagration in which hydrogen was the principal agent. The maximum brightness of the star exceeded the normal lustre almost 800-fold. The star η Argus can hardly as yet be classed either among periodically variable stars or among stars undergoing irregular changes. In 1677 Halley catalogued it as of the fourth magnitude; Lacaille, in 1751, observed it as of the second magnitude. Between 1811 and 1815 it was of the fourth magnitude; from 1822 to 1826 of the second; in 1827 of the first magnitude; thereafter, till 1837, of the second; in 1838 of the first; in 1843 the star was brighter than any except Sirius. At present it is barely visible to the naked eye.

Passing over the speculations of Bruno, Hooke, and others, we find that Halley was the first to suspect from observation the proper motion of the stars. From comparisons between the observed places of Arcturus, Aldebaran, and Sirius, and the places assigned to these stars by the Alexandrian astronomers, he was led to the opinion that all three are moving towards the south. (Phil. Trans., 1718.) The elder Cassini adopted the same view respecting Arcturus, proving, in fact, that even since the time of Tycho Brahe this star had shifted 5' in latitude; for he showed that η Bootis, which should have shared in the change if the ecliptic itself had shifted in position, had not changed appreciably in position. Bradley and Wright theorised respecting the causes of stellar motion, and suggested that the sun and his fellow-suns, the stars, are moving in space. Tobias Mayer, in 1771, comparing Roemer’s observations in 1706 w ith his own and Lacaille’s in 1750-56, was led to the opinion that the stellar motions afford no sufficient evidence of the translation of the solar system through space. But in 1783 Sir W. Herschel, from the proper motions of seven principal stars, as determined by Maskelyne, deduced as the point towards which the sun is moving (or, as it is now commonly termed, “the apex of the solar way”) a point in Hercules in right ascension 257°. After carefully examining Mayer’s list of proper motions, he indicated a point close to the star λ Herculis (¾f 1 , fig. 52). In 1805 Sir W. Herschel published a paper based on Maskelyne’s catalogue of the proper motions of 36 stars published in 1790, and presenting a result considerably different from that which he had before announced. He now set the apex in R.A. 245° 52' 30" and north declination 49° 38' (⅛f 2 in fig. 52). Bessel in 1818 (Fundamenta Astronomiae) expressed the opinion that Mayer had been right in denying the existence of sufficient evidence for determining the proper motion of the solar system. Later, however, the subject has been dealt with by Mädler, Argelander, and O. Struve, whose various determinations of the solar apex are shown in fig. 52, marked M, Ar., and S o respectively. Sir G. Airy re-examined the subject by a new method, assigning to the sun (by an application of the method ©f least squares) such a direction [9:2:820] and rate of motion as accounts for the greatest proportion of the observed stellar motions. The plan was carried out according to two different hypotheses respecting errors of observation, and was first applied to about 300 stars, afterwards to about 1500, by Mr Dunkin. The results of the first pair of solutions are indicated by the points A 1 and A 2 in fig. 52, the results of the others by the point A j and A 4 . A, lies in R.A. 2Gl o 14' and N.P D. 57° 5Γ; A 4 in R.A. 263° 44' and N.P.D. G5°. Lastly, Mr Galloway, by considering the motion of southern stars, has deduced the result indicated at G. Giving to these various results their due weight, we find for the probable position of the apex that shown in fig. 52.

The analysis of the proper motions of the stars by Mr Proctor has led to the recognition of local star-drifts. This is illustrated in fig. 53. Here arrows are drawn from the several stars, indicating their direction and rate of motion, the rate being such that 36,000 years would be required to carry any star from its present position to the position marked by the extremity of the arrow-point. It will be seen that the stars β, γ , δ, e, and ζ Ursae Majoris, with the companions of ζ, are travelling in the same direc tion and at the same apparent rate. Similar drifting motions can be recognised in other parts of the heavens.

Spectroscopic analysis affords a means of determining the motions of stars in the direction of the line of sight. For if a star is receding, the wave length of any definite portion of its light must be apparently lengthened; while if the star is approaching, such wave-length must be shortened. Thus, if the position of some known line in a star’s spectrum can be compared with the position of the same line in the spectrum of a terrestrial element, any shift of position indicates whether the star is receding or approaching. In this way several of the brighter stars have been dealt with by Mr Huggins, and motions of recession and approach, amounting in some cases to 30 or 40 miles per second, have been recognised. This method has afforded an interesting confirmation of Mr Proctor’s views about stardrift, seeing that Mr Huggins assigns to the five stars β, γ, δ, e, and ζ Ursae Majoris, equal motions of recession (about 17 miles per second). He also finds that their spectra are alike, indicating a resemblance in constitution and structure, such as we should expect to find in the members of a drifting system.

The Nelndce are celestial objects which present a cloudy appearance. When examined with a telescope of moderate power, the greater part of the nebulae are distinctly perceived to be composed of clusters of little stars, imperceptible to the naked eye, because, on account of their apparent proximity, the rays of light proceeding from each are blended together, through the effects of irradiation, in such a manner as to produce only a confused luminous appearance. In others, however, no individual stars can be perceived, even through the best telescopes, and the nebula exhibits only the appearance of a self-luminous or phosphorescent patch of matter in a highly dilated or gaseous state. In some instances the nebula presents the appearance of a faint luminous atmosphere, of a circular form and of large extent, surrounding a star of considerable brilliancy. One of the most remarkable nebulae is that which is situated in the sword-handle of Orion. It was discovered by Huyghens in 1656, and described and figured by him in his Systema Saturnium. Since that time it has been examined and described by various observers, particularly Fouchy, Mairan, Le Gentil, and Messier, who have given engravings of it; and if any trust can be placed in their descriptions of so indistinct and difficult an object, it must have undergone great changes in its form and physical appearance. Unfortunately, however, no satisfactory inference can be drawn from the comparison of the different descriptions; for it is found that the same nebula, viewed on the same night with different telescopes, presents appearances so different as to be scarcely recognisable as the same object. The effects of atmospherical variations also cause great differences in its appearance, even when it is viewed through the same telescope at different times, so that it is scarcely possible that any two observers will be found to agree in their delineation of its outline. Sir J. Herschel, in the second volume of the Memoirs of the Astronomical Society, has given a detailed description of this nebula as it appeared in his twenty-feet reflector in 1824, together with a drawing, which, on account of the superiority of his telescope, is probably a much more correct representation of the object than any which previously existed. Plate XXX. is copied from that drawing. Of that portion of the nebula which he calls the Huyghenian region Sir J. Herschel gives the following account: “I know not how to describe it better than by comparing it to a curdling liquid, or a surface strewed over with flocks of wool, or to the breaking up of a “mackerel” sky when the clouds of which it consists begin to assume a cirrous appearance. It is not very unlike the mottling of the sun’s disk, only (if [9:2:821] I may so express myself) the grain is much coarser, and the intervals darker; and the flocculi, instead of being generally round, are drawn into little wisps. They present, however, no appearance of being composed of small stars, and their aspect is altogether different from resolvable nebulae. In the latter we fancy that we see stars, or that could we strain our sight a little more, we should see them; but the former suggest no idea of stars, but rather of something quite distinct from them.”

Another very remarkable nebula is that in the girdle of Andromeda, which, being visible to the naked eye, was known in the earliest ages of astronomy. It was rediscovered in 1612 by Simon Marius, who describes it as having the appearance of a candle seen through horn, that is, a diluted light, increasing in density towards a centre. Le Gentil mentions that its figure had appeared to him for many years round, but that in 1757 it had become oval. He also remarks that its light was perfectly uniform in all parts,—a fact which is quite at variance with its present appearance, and which, if true, argues that the nebulous matter is in a rapid state of condensation. “At present,” says Sir J. Herschel in the volume above referred to, “it has not, indeed, a star or any well-defined disk in its centre; but the brightness, which increases by regular gradations from the circumference, suddenly acquires a great accession, so as to offer the appearance of a nipple, as it were, in the middle, of very small diameter (10" or 12"), but totally devoid of any distinct outline, so that it is impossible to say precisely where the nucleus ends and the nebula begins. Its nebulosity is of the most perfect milky, absolutely irresolvable kind, without the slightest tendency to that separation into flocculi above described in the nebula of Orion; nor is there any sort of appearance of the smallest star in the centre of the nipple.” This nebula has, however, been resolved into stars, at least partially, by the Harvard reflector.

Messier formed a list of 103 nebulae. But Sir W. Herschel, by means of his large telescopes, discovered no less than 2500; and Sir John Herschel added 500 northern and 1700 southern nebulae (staying seven years at the Cape to catalogue these last). In all, about 3700 nebulae are known. They have been thus classified :—

(1.) Clusters of stars (globular or irregular) in which the stars are clearly distinguishable.

(2.) Resolvable nebulae, and such as, from their appearance, probably require only increased power to be resolved into separate stars.

(3.) Nebulae properly so called, showiug no appearance of stars.

(4.) Planetary nebulae.

(5.) Stellar nebulae.

(6.) Nebulous stars.

Among the varieties of form may be noted spiral, elliptic, and ring nebulae, double nebulae, and irregular nebulae.

Sir W. Herschel classified the nebulae according to his conception of the probable stage of their development from purely nebulous matter into stars, single or multiple, as follows :—

(1.) Widely-spread nebulosity.

(2.) Irregular nebulae.

(3.) Planetary nebulae.

(4.) Nebulous stars.

(5.) Diffused clusters.

(6.) Stellar nebulae.

(7.) Rich star-clusters.

Examined with the spectroscope by Mr Huggins, the stellar and resolvable nebulae are found to give a spectrum resembling the stellar spectrum in general characteristics. But the irregular nebulae, planetary nebulae, and a considerable proportion of the irresolvable nebulae, give a spectrum of three bright lines, indicating that they consist of glowing gas. One of these lines is the F line of the hydrogen spectrum, another is a line of nitrogen, and the third is undetermined. A few of the gaseous nebulae show a fourth line.

Some nebulae are variable. A large irregular nebula surrounding the singular variable star η Argus appears to undergo extensive variations; and we have seen that the great nebula in Orion is strongly suspected of variability. Some nebulae have vanished; others have appeared where formerly no nebulosity had been recognised.

As there are double and variable Debulae as well as double and variable stars, so also are there groupings and aggregations of nebulae as of stars. It is noteworthy that the zone region occupied by the milky-way shows very few nebulae, and those mostly of the resolvable order. The regions farthest from the milky-way, that is, the regions around the poles of the galactic circle, are those richest in nebulae, speaking generally; but the distribution of the nebulae is in reality too irregular to be sufficiently described in such terms. Streams and branches and clustering aggregations of nebulae are found in both of the two hemispheres into which the galaxy divides the heavens. Most remarkable among these aggregations are the Nubeculae or Magellanic Clouds, in the southern heavens. These resemble the milky-way in aspect, but on telescopic examination are found to consist, not of stars alone, like the milky-way, but of stars mixed with nebulae. Within the Nubecula Major, Sir J. Herschel counted 278 nebulae, besides more than 50 outlying nebulae. The Nubecula Minor is not so rich in nebulae, but still deserves to be regarded as an aggregation of these objects.

Space will not permit us to consider fully here the various theories of the constitution of the sidereal heavens advanced by Wright, Kant, Lambert, the Herschels, Struve, Mädler, Herbert Spencer, Proctor, and others. But so far as discussion of this subject depends on observation, it may be thus presented :—The zone of the milky-way being rich in stars, we must either infer great extension of the sidereal system in the direction of that zone, or a real aggregation of stars within a ring-shaped or spirally-shaped region around the earth. If we adopt the former view, we shall naturally be led to regard the nebulae, except only those known to be gaseous, as other sidereal systems outside our own, and so distant as to appear like small cloudlets of stars. But if we adopt the latter view, we may regard many of the nebulae, if not all, as clustering aggregations of stars belonging to the same system. Sir W. Herschel adopted the former hypothesis at the beginning of his career as an observer; but later (though nearly all writers on astronomy overlook the fact), his opinion turned towards the latter. It was while he still supposed the stars spread with tolerable uniformity throughout the sidereal system that he trusted to a method of stargauging depending on the number of stars seen in equal telescopic fields in different directions. It is manifest that, if the telescope reaches to the limits of a system of stars scattered uniformly, the greater the distance at which the limit lies in any direction the greater will be the number of stars in that direction. Gauging the sidereal system on this principle, Sir W. Herschel deduced the inference that it is shaped like a cloven flat disk. But later, perceiving that the rich regions are often seemingly circular in shape, he inferred that such groups are really globular in form. It was natural to extend this principle, and, seeing that parts of the milky-way are stream-shaped, to infer that this appearance indicates the existence of real streams of stars. Also, since the clustering aggregations are various in size and constitution, it might be assumed that the nebulae themselves are only clustering aggregations [9:2:822] more remote than the rest, and belong, therefore, to the sidereal system. The fact that nebulae are rich in regions remote from the milky-way would confirm this supposition, if not of itself sufficient (as Herbert Spencer thinks) to establish it beyond question. If the nature of the Magellanic clouds had been known to Sir W. Herschel, this inference would have appeared to him irresistible. However, the results towards which his later views seemed tending were not definitely indicated or adopted by him, probably because he had already attained an extreme old age when he first enunciated his later and juster views of the sidereal universe. Sir J. Herschel does not appear to have recognised his father’s change of views, though conscious of serious difficulties in the older theory, and even definitely indicating the fact that the constitution of the Nubeculae cannot possibly be reconciled with that theory. The elder Struve, probably the only astronomer of his time who had thoroughly studied Sir W. Herschel’s remarkable papers, recognised clearly the change in Herschel’s opinions. Following a suggestion thrown out by Piazzi, Struve compared the number of stars down to the eighth magnitude in different directions round the equator, and justly regarded the greater richness of such stars on and near the galaxy as a disproof of Herschel’s earlier theory of generally uniform distribution. Strangely enough, however, while thus recognising a variation in the richness of stellar distribution in one direction, i.e., in approaching the medial plane of the galaxy, Struve was unable to divest himself of a belief in uniformity of distribution in directions parallel to that plane. In an investigation claiming to be free from all hypothesis, but in reality (as Encke, Forbes, Proctor, and others have shown) based on several hypotheses* some of which are not even probable, Struve advanced the theory that the sidereal system is infinite in extension along the direction of the medial plane of the galaxy.

But in reality the evidence we possess indicates laws of stellar aggregation which by their very nature preclude the possibility of applying such methods of gauging as either Sir W. Herschel or W. Struve endeavoured to use. The gathering of stars of the leading orders of apparent magnitude in the galactic zone shows that stars of many orders of real size and brightness are there gathered together. The analysis of a rich star-region with higher and higher powers is shown to be, not necessarily, as was supposed, the penetrating farther and farther into space, but the more and more searching scrutiny of one and the same region of space. The two processes, indeed, may be combined, an increase of telescopic power bringing into view at the same time smaller stars in a particular region and remoter stars lying towards the same direction. In fact, it would be as great a mistake to assume, without definite evidence, that new stars so revealed are smaller in real magnitude, as to assume that they are more remote. The only kind of evidence available to discriminate between the two explanations, or to show to what extent either may operate, is that derived from statistical enumeration; but so complex are the relations involved, that such enumeration can only be interpreted when graphically illustrated. In other words, the secrets of the stellar universe can only be revealed by presenting in well-devised maps the results of widely extended scrutiny of the star depths. This process has already been applied by Mr Proctor to stars down to the eleventh order of magnitude (in the northern heavens), the resulting view of the stellar universe differing widely from that which would have been presented if any of the theories heretofore advanced had been just. It is probable that an extension of the system of uniform star-gauging and charting to the remoter star-depths will still further illustrate the complexity and diversity of structure existing within the universe. Already these general conclusione may be regarded as established:—“The sidereal system is altogether more complicated and more varied in structure than has hitherto been supposed: in the same region of the stellar depths co-exist stars of many orders of real magnitude; all the nebulae, gaseous or stellar, planetary, ring-formed, elliptical, and spiral, exist within the limits of the sidereal system; and lastly, the whole system is alive with movements, the laws of which may one day be recognised, though at present they are too complex to be understood.”

Amongst the proceedings, journals, &c., to be particularly examined are the following In Britain— the Memoirs and Monthly Notices of the Astronomical Society, the Transactions and Proceedings of the Royal Societies of London, Edinburgh, and Dublin, and the Reports of the British Association; in France—the Comptes Rendus of the Paris Academy of Sciences; in Germany—the Abhandlungen and Monatsbericht of the Berlin Academy of Sciences, the Sitzungsberichte of the Imperial Academy of Vienna, the Vierteljahrsschrift of the Astronomischen Gesellschajt (Leipsic), and the Astronomische Nachrichten (Kiel); in Russia— the Bulletins of the Imperial Academy of Sciences; the proceedings published by learned bodies in Italy, Belgium, Portugal, and Denmark; in America—the Reports and Proceedings of the Smithsonian Institution (Washington), the Journal of the Franklin Institute, Silliman , s Journal, and the Proceedings of the American Association, &c.; besides transactions published by various societies in Australia, Canada, and other colonies. The following are among the principal treatises on theoretical and physical astronomy :—The Principia of Newton, Laplace’s Exposition du Système du Monde and Traité de Mécanique Celeste, Delambre’s Astronomie Théo· retique, Brunnow’s Spherical Astronomy, and the fine American works by Watson (of Ann Arbor), Chauvenet, and Loomis. The best works on practical astronomy are Pearson’s Introduction to Practical Astronomy, the second volume of Chauvenet’s work just mentioned (entitled Spherical and Practical Astronomy), and Loomis’s Practical Astronomy. But, with the improvements continually being made in instruments and methods, the best work on practical astronomy soon becomes obsolete unless supplemented by the careful examination of the journals and proceedings mentioned above. For this reason a section on Practical Astronomy has not been added here, as in former editions of this work. Among popular treatises on general astronomy the most trustworthy are Airy’ä Ipswich Lectures, Arago’s Astronomie Populaire (and the English version by Grant and Smyth), Herschel’s Outlines of Astronomy 9 Chambers’s Descriptive Astronomy, and Guillemin ’ β The Heavens (later editions). Among works in special departments of astronomy may be mentioned Nasmyth’s treatise On the Moon, Secchi’s Le Soleil, Herschel’s Southern Observations, Pingré’s Cométographie, Coulvier-Gravier’s Recherches sur les Etoiles Filantes, and W. Struve’s Etudes d Astronomie Stellaire. The principal star atlasee are Harding’s Atlas Novus Coelestis, Heis’s Atlas and accompanying Catalogue, Bode’s Uranographia, Argelander’s Uranometria, and Lubbock’s six maps on the Gnomonic Projection, published for the S.D.U.K. For many departments of stellar research, however, celestial atlases are insufficient, and star catalogues have to be employed. Among the most important catalogues of isolated stars are Flamsteed’s, Bradley’s, Piazzi’s, Lalande’s, Groombridge’s Circumpolar Stars, the Catalogue of the British Association, Argelander’s Bonn series (containing 320,000 stars), Bessel’s, Weisse’s, Main’s, &c. Among catalogues of double stars may be mentioned Sir W. Herschel’s in the Phil. Transactions, those by Sir J. Herschel and South, and by Sir J. Herschel alone, the lists in the Monthly Notices of the Astr. Society, and the catalogues of Dembouski, Burnham, P. Secchi, Brothers, and others. Schellen’s Spectral Analyse, or Roscoe’s work on Spectroscopic Analysis, will be sufficient introduction to the subject of astronomical spectroscopy. In all the departments, however, there are many works besides those named which the student who desires to deal thoroughly with astronomy will do well to examine.
