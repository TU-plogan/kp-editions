ANTITYPE (αvτtτυ7r0ς) denotes a type or figure corresponding to some other type. It is in this sense of copy or likeness that the word occurs in the New Testament (Heb. ix. 24; 1 Peter iii. 21). By theological writers antitype is employed to denote the reality of which a type is the prophetic symbol. Thus, Christ is the antitype of many of the types of. the Jewish ritual. By the fathers of the Greek Church antitype is employed as a designation of the bread and wine in the sacrament of the Lord’s supper.
