ANDELYS (Les), a town in the department of Eure, France, formed by the union of Le Grand and Le Petit Andely, which are situated, the latter on the eastern bank of the Seine, and the former nearly half a mile from the river, at a distance of about 20 miles north-east of Evreux. Grand Andely, the older of the two, dates from the 6th century, and contains a collegiate church, whose stained-glass windows are remarkably beautiful. Petit Andely sprang up around the ch√¢teau Gaillard, which was built by Richard Coeur de Lion in 1195, and was formerly one of the strongest fortresses in France. The chief manufactures at Les Andelys are cloth, thread, and leather, and there is a considerable trade in grain and wool. Population (1872), 5379.
