ARCHELAUS, natural son of Perdiccas, king of Macedonia, seized the throne in 413 B.C., after having murdered his uncle, his cousin, and his half brother, the legitimate heir. His reign was remarkable for the many improvements he introduced. He fortified cities, constructed roads, and thoroughly organised the army. He endeavoured to spread among his people the refinements of Greek civilisation, and invited to his court many celebrated men of the timeâ€”as Zeuxis, Timotheus, Euripides, and Agathon. In 399 b.c. he was killed by one of his courtiers, Craterus; according to some, designedly, according to others, accidentally while engaged in hunting.
