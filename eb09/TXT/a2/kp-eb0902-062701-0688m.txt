ARNOTT, Neil, M.D., F.R.S., a distinguished physician and physicist, was born at Arbroath, 15th May 1788. His parents, who were Roman Catholics, removed to Blairs, near Aberdeen, when Arnott was eight years old, and three years afterwards took up their abode in Aberdeen, which enabled him to attend the grammar school there. In 1801 he entered Marischal college, where he took special interest in the natural philosophy subjects, taught at that time by Professor Copland, a skilful experimenter. There his natural bent to physical science was greatly strengthened. He studied medicine first at Aberdeen, and subsequently under Sir Everard Home, through whom he obtained, while yet in his nineteenth year, the appointment of full surgeon to an East Indiaman. After making two voyages to China he settled in 1811 to practise in London, and speedily acquired high reputation in his profession. Within a few years he was made physician to the French and Spanish embassies. In 1836 he was appointed a member of the Senate of the new university of London, and became a fellow of the Royal and Geological Societies. In 1837 he was made a physician extraordinary to the Queen. From his earliest youth Arnott had an intense love of natural philosophy, constantly using illustrations and applications of its principles. To this liking was added an inventiveness which served him in good stead in his profession, and to which we owe the “Arnott water-bed,” the “Arnott ventilator,” the “Arnott stove,” &c., all of which, with characteristic philanthropy, he refrained from patenting. He was the author of several works bearing on physical science or its applications. The most important of these is his Elements of Physics, published in 1827, the most successful attempt that had ever been made to popularise a scientific subject. It went through six editions in his lifetime. In 1838 ho published a treatise on Warming and Ventilating, and, in 1855, one on the Smokeless Fireplace. He took a lead in sanitary improvements generally. The chief characteristic of his writings and inventions is their high practical utility. He was a strong advocate of scientific, as opposed to purely classical, education; and he manifested his interest in natural philosophy by the munificent gift of .£2000 to each of the four universities of Scotland and to the university of London, to promote its study in the experimental and practical form. He died in London, 2d March 1874.
