ARABGIR, or Arabkir, a town of Turkey in Asia, in the vilayet of Sivas, situated in a deep ravine near a small tributary of the Euphrates, 150 miles S.S.W. of Trebizond. The inhabitants are enterprising and prosperous, many of them leaving their native city to push their fortunes elsewhere, while of those that remain the greater part are employed in the manufacture of silk and cotton goods, or in the production of fruit. The present town was built at a comparatively recent date, but about 2 miles to the northeast is the old town, now called Eski Shehr, containing the ruins of a castle and of other buildings. Arabgir contains about 6000 houses. About three-fourths of the population are Turks, and the remainder Armenians.
