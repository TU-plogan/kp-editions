ARROWSMITH, the name of a family of geographers. The first of them, Aaron Arrowsmith, was born in 1750 at Winston in Durham. When about twenty years of age he came to London, and was employed by Cary, the engraver. In 1790 he made himself famous by his large chart of the world on Mercatorâ€™s projection. Four years later he published another large map of the world on the globular projection, with a companion volume of explanation. The maps of North America and Scotland are the most celebrated of his many later productions. He died in 1823, leaving two sons, Aaron and Samuel, the elder of whom was the compiler of the Eton Comparative Atlas, of a Biblical atlas, and of various manuals of geography. John Arrowsmith, nephew of the elder Aaron, was born at Winston in 1790, and in 1810 joined his uncle in London. In 1834 he published his London Atlas, the best set of maps then in existence. He followed up the atlas with a long series of elaborate and carefully-executed maps, those of Australia, America, Africa, and India being especially valuable. In 1862 he received the gold medal of the Royal Geographical Society, of which body he was one of the founders. He died 2d May 1873.
