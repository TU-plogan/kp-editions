APENNINES, an extensive range of mountains traversing the entire extent of the Italian peninsula, and forming, as it were, the backbone of that country. The name Apennines is probably of Celtic origin, and derived from pen, properly signifying a head, or mountain height. By the Greek and Latin writers the name is generally used in the singular, as Apenninus Mons, b Απcwιvoς, to Aπervιvov όρος. The name may have been originally applied only to a particular mountain, and afterwards extended to include the whole chain.

The Apennines may be considered as a southern branch of the great Alpine system of Europe. Both the mountain systems have a general resemblance as regards the age and lithological character of the rocks and strata which compose them. Geographers have differed as to the point [9:2:170] where the Apennines are to be distinguished from the Alps. Some have placed it at the pass of Bocchetta; others at the Col di Tenda; and others at the low pass which runs from Savona to Cairo. Strabo, who gives a very accurate account of the general features and direction of this chain, considers it as beginning in the vicinity of Genoa. From Col di Tenda the Apennines run in a semicircle round the Gulf of Genoa, in a general direction from west to east; they afterwards turn to the south, and traverse the whole of the Italian peninsula to the Strait of Messina. The entire length of the chain is about 600 miles measured in a direct line, and about 800 miles if measured along the windings. The chain lies between 38° and 44° 30' N. lat., and 7° 40' and 18° 20' E. long. The mountains are divided into the Northern, Central, and Southern Apennines.

The Northern Apennines include what are usually designated the Ligurian and Tuscan Apennines. The Ligurian Apennines extend from the Maritime Alps past Monte Gisa to the borders of Tuscany. The principal passes here, between Piedmont and the duchy of Genoa, are through the valleys of the Tanaro, the Bormida, and the Lemma. The pass of Pontremo leads up the Magra Valley from Spezzia to Parma. The Tuscan Apennines extend from Monte Pellegrino to Monte Cornaro, in 12° 3' E. The Alpi Appuani form an outlying mass of mountains between the valley of the Magra and the Secchio. The chief passes are those of Bratello, Fiumalbo, Monte Carelli or Pietra-Mala, and that proceeding from the valley of the Sieve, over Borgo di San Lorenzo, through the valley of the Lamone, and on towards Faenza.

The Central or Roman Apennines comprehend that part of the chain between Monte Cornaro, in which the Tiber rises, and Monte Velino, north of Lake Fucino. Its general direction is from N.N.W. to S.S.E. or nearly parallel to the Tiber. The descent towards the Adriatic is continuous and direct, but towards the Mediterranean it forms two distinct inclined planes. The principal passes from the north are at the village of Scheggia, where the Cantiano rises; at Serra valle, south-east of Monte Pennino, at the head of the valley of the Chienti; at Castellucio, between Norcia and Arquata; and the chief pass of all between Rieti and the valley of the Pescara.

The Southern Apennines include the remaining portion of this chain. From Monte Velino they proceed in a southeasterly direction to the valley of the Ofanto, which cuts through the range. South of that limit, one short branch extends eastward towards Altamura, another runs westward to the neighbourhood of Salerno, while the main chain is prolonged nearly due south to the heights of Aspromonte overlooking the Strait of Messina. In the upper part of the Southern Apennines a number of sharp pyramidical points raise themselves above the mountain chain. Among these are Monte Forcone at the source of the Sangro, Monte Sant’ Angelo, above the sources of the Volturno and Trigno, and Monte Calvello north-east of Salerno. The principal pass over this part of the Apennines is that of Sulmona, near the sources of the Volturno, so called from the town of Sulmona, where the roads from Rome, Pescara, and Aquila unite. The passes above Castel Franco and Ariano are the highest points of the roads over the ridge, from Benevento to Troja, and from Avellino to Foggia.

The geology and palaeontology of the Apennines have been fully investigated by Savi, Meneghini, Pareto, Lavini, Orsini, Bianconi, Mortillet, and others. As a general rule, the same formations occur here as in the Alps, and the system usually consists of a central ridge having secondary and lower ridges running parallel with the main range, the intervening country being formed of but slightly disturbed newer Tertiary deposits. Thus, in that portion of the Apennines which borders on and extends into Tuscany and Bologna, the system consists of two parts. The one which is most distant from the Mediterranean forms the Apennines proper; here the Eocene beds prevail, and are covered, especially on the north flank, by Miocene and Pliocene beds; the axes of elevation are numerous and parallel to each other, following strikes which run from W.N.W. to E.S.E., and from N.W. to S.E. The other part is nearer the Mediterranean, and is remarkable for its richness in metalliferous ores; the rocks prevalent in it belong to the Palaeozoic and Oolitic periods, and have a N.N.W. to S.S.E. strike. Between Spezzia and Cività Vecchia it is represented by numerous outliers of verrucano (probably of Carboniferous age), and trias surrounded by Oolitic rocks. The district of Carrara abounds in marbles belonging to the Liassic and Oolitic periods. Nearly all the mountains between Carrara and Monte Sagra have beds of marble, which sometimes acquire considerable thickness, as for instance in the vertical escarpments of Monte Corchio. The mountains between the meridians of Genoa and Parma form but one chain, composed of parallel ridges striking W.N.W. to E.N.E. The strata consist of Eocene formations flanked by Miocene and Pliocene beds, pierced by numerous ophiolitic masses. Towards Genoa the mountains conform to the S.S.W. and N.N.E. directions of the Western Alps; the rocks are of Eocene age, but are much metamorphosed by the serpentines of Pegli, Voltri, and Varagine. In the Central Apennines there is a large development of secondary beds from the trias to the upper chalk, and of the Tertiaιy formation, which is represented by strata of the Eocene, Miocene, Pliocene, and Post-Pliocene periods. The main axis of the chain is chiefly formed of the Secondary rocks, while the minor ranges are formed of Tertiary beds. The mountains, as a whole, rise from N. to S., culminating in Monte Corno, 9593 feethigh, beyond which their height again decreases. Mount Amaro is 8960 feet, and Mount Velino 7910 feet high. The oldest rock seen in this part is a dolomite; it is unfossiliferous, and acquires its greatest massiveness in the mountains of Cesi, Spoleto, and Ventosa. Above it follows a limestone, which is in places many hundred yards thick. Fossils are rare in it as a whole, though locally abundant in a few places. The strata which next succeed are ferruginous limestones and marls, abounding in Middle Liassic fossils; then red limestones, yielding ammonites and other shells of the Upper Lias; then a vast series of limestones, marls, and siliceous beds, which compose a large part of the flanks and summits of the Apennines, and which represent the Oolitic period. The hippuritic chalk is largely developed, and in places it forms the mass of the Apennines, as in the Rossa Chain, and the loftj ranges of the Abruzzi. Fossils are abundant in this limestone. The Upper Cretaceous beds are represented by massive limestones with comparatively few fossils. Above these follow a nummulitic limestone, marly schists, arenaceous macigno, &c. The Miocene beds are varied in their lithological nature and rich in fossils. The more recent strata seldom occur at any great height above the sea.
