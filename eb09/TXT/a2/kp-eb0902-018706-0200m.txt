APOLLONIUS of Perga (Pergaeus), next to Archimedes the most illustrious of the ancient Greek geometricians, was born probably about 250 b.c., and died during the reign of Ptolemy Philopator (222-205 b.c. ), flourishing thus about forty years later than Archimedes. He studied at Alexandria under the successors of Euclid, and is one of the brightest ornaments of that famous mathematical school.

But few of the mathematical works of Apollonius have escaped the ravages of time. Of the greater part we have merely the names and general description given by Pappus in his preface to book vii. of the Mathematical Collections. His treatise on the Conic Sections gained him the title of The Great Geometer, and is that by which his fame has been transmitted to modem times. It is not, indeed, to be for a moment supposed that Apollonius discovered all, or even the greater part, of the demonstrations which he gives, any more than that Euclid devised the propositions that go by his name. Pappus mentions several treatises on conics known to have existed previously—in particular the five books of Aristaeus “The Ancient” (350 b.c.) on Solid Loci; and there can be little doubt that Apollonius availed himself of these, as well as of the discoveries of Conon, Euclid, Eudoxus, Menechmus, Nicoteles, Thrasidaeus, and others, who had explored the way before him. At this distance of time we cannot distinguish the original from the borrowed propositions; but, though it is certain that he both added to and improved upon the existing theory of conics, the mere embodying in a complete and logical treatise of a number of miscellaneous theorems was in itself a work of great mathematical genius. Eutocius informs us that Apollonius was the first to show that all the three sections may be cut from the same cone, by varying the position of the intersecting plane; for previous authors had supposed the plane of section always perpendicular to the slant side of the cone,—an hypothesis which requires that the three sections be cut from cones of different species, namely, the parabola from a right-angled cone, the ellipse from one with an obtuse, and the hyperbola from one with an acute vertical angle. But Archimedes, as Ubaldus shows in his commentary on the Aequipon- derantes, had been acquainted with this fact. Pappus ascribes to Apollonius the names by which the three sections are now distinguished; the term Parabola, however, occurs in the writings of Archimedes. Of the Conicorum Libri Octo of Apollonius, unfortunately only four have reached us directly through the original Greek. Three more have been preserved in an Arabic version, but the eighth has never been found. Though many attempts had been made to discover the last four books, they continued to be regarded as lost till 1658, when Borelli, the celebrated author of the treatise De motu Animalium, discovered in the Medici library at Florence an Arabic manuscript, entitled Apollonii Pergcei Conicorum Libri Octo. With the assistance of Abraham Ecchellensis he translated and published in 1661 the fifth, sixth, and seventh books; but the eighth, notwithstanding the title, was wanting. Some years previously Golius, Oriental professor at Leyden, had returned from the East with an Arabic version of the whole seven books, and had projected the publication of a translation; but it never appeared. A note appended to the MS. of Golius stated that the eighth book had never been translated into Arabic. It was long a favourite problem with geometers to attempt to restore the lost books of Apollonius, that is, to infer from the general nature of their contents, as described by Pappus, the propositions they had contained. Maurolycus, a Sicilian geometer of the 16th century, Viviani, the last favourite pupil of Galileo, Fermat, Halley, Simson, and a number of others, all attempted this with more or less success. Halley, guided by the descriptions of Pappus, and the assertion that his preliminary lemmas to the seventh book really belonged tc the eighth, as well as by the statement of Apollonius himself that the eighth was a continuation of the seventh book, restored this book for the edition issued by the Oxford Press in 1710, the only edition of the Greek text that has as yet appeared. The last four books of the conics of Apollonius formed the chief part of the higher geometry of the ancients; and they present some elegant geometrical solutions of problems, which offer considerable difficulty even to the modern analytical method. For example, the fifth book treats of the greatest and least lines that can be [9:2:188] drawn from given points to the peripheries of conics, and contains the chief properties of normals and radii of curvature.

The other treatises of Apollonius mentioned by Pappus are—lsi, The Section of Ratio, or Proportional Sections; 2<∕, the Section of Space; 3<7, the Determinate Section · 4dh, the Tangencies; 5th, the Inclinations ; 6th, the Plane Loci. Each of these was divided into two books, and, with the Data of Euclid and the Porisms, they formed the eight treatises which, according to Pappus, constituted the body of the ancient analysis.

Isi, De Dationis Sectione had for its subject the resolution of the following problem: Given two straight lines and a point in each to draw through a third given point a straight line cutting the two fixed lines, so that the parts intercepted between the given points in them and the points of intersection of this third line, may have a given ratio.

2d, De Spatii Sectione discussed the similar problem, which requires that the space contained by the three lines shall be equal to a given rectangle.

Dr Halley published in 1706 a restoration of these two treatises, founded on the indications of their contents given by Pappus. An Arabic version of the first had previously been found in the Bodleian library at Oxford by Dr Edward Bernard, who began a translation of it, but broke off on account of the extreme inaccuracy of the MS.

3d, De Sectione Determinata resolved the problem: In a given straight line to find a point, the rectangles or squares of whose distances from given points in the given straight line shall have a given ratio. Several restorations of the solution have been attempted, one by Snellius, another by Alex. Anderson of Aberdeen, in the supplement to his Apollonius Redivivus (Paris, 1612), but by far the most complete and elegant by Dr Simson of Glasgow.

Ath, De Tactionibus embraced the following general problem: Given three things (points, straight lines, or circles) in position, to describe a circle passing through the given points, and touching the given straight lines or circles. The most difficult case, and the most interesting from its historical associations, is when the three given things are circles. This problem, though now regarded as elementary, was proposed by Vieta in the 16th century to Adrianus Romanus, who gave a very clumsy solution. Vieta thereupon proposed a simpler construction, and restored the whole treatise of Apollonius in a small work, which he entitled Apollonius Gallus (Paris, 1660.) Both Descartes and Newton have discussed this problem, though they failed to give it that simplicity of character which it has since been shown to possess. A very full and interesting historical account of the problem is given in the preface to a small work of Camerer, entitled Apollonii Pergoei que supersunt, ac maxime Lemmata Pappi in hos Libros, cum Observationibus, &c. (Gothae, 1795, 8vo).

5 th, De Inclinationibus had for its object to insert a given straight line, tending towards a given point, between two given (straight or circular) lines. Restorations have been given by Marinus Ghetaldus, by Hugo de Omerique (Geometrical Analysis, Cadiz, 1698), and elegantly by Dr Horsley (1770).

3th, De Locis Plants is merely a collection of properties of the straight line and circle, and corresponds to the construction of equations of the first and second degrees. It has been successfully restored by Dr Simson.

The great estimation in which Apollonius was held by the ancients, and the great value attached to his productions, are manifest from the number and celebrity of the commentators who undertook to explain them. Among these we find the names of Pappus, the learned and unfortunate Hypatia, Serenus, Eutocius, Borelli, Halley, Barrow, and others. Various discoveries in other departments of mathematical science were also ascribed to him by the ancients. Pappus says that he made improvements on the modes of representing and multiplying large arithmetical numbers. The invention of the method of projections has been attributed to him; and he has the honour of being the first to found astronomical observations on the principles of geometry.
