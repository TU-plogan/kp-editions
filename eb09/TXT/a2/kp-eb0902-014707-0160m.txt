APAMEA, in Ancient Geography, the name of several Asiatic cities :—1. A large city of Syria, in the valley of the Orontes, so named by Seleucus Nicator, after Aparna, his wife. It continued to be a place of importance down to the time of the Crusades, when it was known as Fâmieh, and is supposed to be represented by the extensive ruins at Kulat-el-Mudyk. 2. A large commercial city in Phrygia, which owed its existence to Antiochus Soter, and its name to his mother, Apama. It is identified with the modern Denair, where there are still a number of ancient ruins. 3. A city mentioned by Stephanus and Pliny as situated near the Tigris, the identification of which is still uncertain. 4. Now Rum-Kala, on the left of the Euphrates, opposite Zeugma. 5. The name given to Myrlea of Bithynia, by Prusias I., who rebuilt it. The ruins lie near Medania. 6. A Greek city in Parthia, near Rhagae.
