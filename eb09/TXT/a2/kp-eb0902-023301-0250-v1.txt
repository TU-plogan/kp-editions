AQUITANIA. This was, in the time of Julius Caesar, the name given to that part of Gallia which lay between the Garumna and the Pyrenees, and was inhabited by a race distinct from the Celtae. According to Bial and Bello-guet, Aquitani is probably a form of Auscetani, a Hispanic lengthening of Ausces (Ausks, Wasks, Basques), and Aquitania would thus be radically identical with Gascony (Wasconia), a word of much later introduction into geographical nomenclature. Though the greater proportion of the Aquitanian tribes made submission to Caesar, it was not till 28 B.c. that the region was fairly brought under the Boman yoke by Μ. Valerius Messala. In keeping with the imperial policy of denationalisation, the term Aquitania was extended, in the division of Gallia under Augustus, to the whole stretch of country south and east of the continuous course of the Loire and the Allier, and thus ceased to be of ethnographical import. In the 3d century after Christ this extended Aquitania was divided into three parts. Aquitania Prima consisted of the eastern portion of the district between the Loire and the Garonne; Aquitania Secunda, of the western part of the same district; and Aquitania Tertia or N^ovempopulania, of the region between the Pyrenees and the Garonne, or the original Aquitania. Like the rest of Gau], Aquitania absorbed a large measure of Roman civilisation which continued to distinguish the district down to a late period. In the 5th century the Visigoths established themselves in Aquitania Secunda, and in some cantons of Narbonensis Prima and Novempopulania. As their power also included Spain, it was usual to speak of their Gallic possessions as Spain likewise. The Merovingian kings extended their authority nominally to the Pyrenees; but as Guizot has remarked {Essais, No. ii.) “the conquest of Aquitania by Clovis left it almost as alien to the people and king of the Franks as it had formerly been ’ For a time indeed, about 630, the Aquitanians rallied round Haribert (Charibert), the brother of Dagobert, in hope of national independence, even under a Frankish ruler; but the usual story that their ducal family was descended from him rests on a forgery (z>. Henri Martin, Hist, de France, vol ii. p. 137). About the end of the 7th century, an adventurer named Eudes or Eudon had made himself master of the region. Attacked by the Saracens, he inflicted on them a crushing defeat but, on their reappearance, was obliged to call in the aid of Charles Martel, who, as the price of his assistance, claimed the homage of his ally. He was succeeded by his son Hunald, who, after carrying on a war against the aggressions of Pepin the Short, retired to a convent, and left the conflict and the kingdom to Guaifer (Waifer). For nine years he strenuously maintained the hopeless strife, till his assassination in 768. With him perished for a time the national independence, but not the national individuality, of the Aquitanians. The kingdom of Aquitania was bestowed by Charlemagne on the infant Louis in 781; and from him it was transmitted to his son Pepin, on whose death the Aquitanians loyally chose Pepin the younger, but were opposed by Louis, who gave the crown to Charles the Bald. Hence ensued a long period of confusion and conflict, which resulted in the comparative success of Charles, who granted the Aquitanians a nominal separation from Neus-tria, and gave them his son Charles, eight years old, to be their nominal king (855)—nominal, not only because he was a child, but because his kingdom was in a state of anarchy through domestic faction and foreign invasion. On his death (866), Louis the Stammerer succeeded to the titular sovereignty. About 886 Guilhem (William) the Pious, count of Auvergne, the founder of the abbey of Cluny, obtained the title of Duke of Aquitania, and transmitted it (918) to Guilhem II. He was followed in succession by Raimond Pons, count of Toulouse (d. 950), Guilhem Tête d'Etoupes, count of Poitiers (d. 963), Guilhem Fier-à-Bras, whose sister was married by Hugh Capet (970), and Guilhem the Great (977-1030), who had hard work to maintain his ground, but at last changed his title into an effective lordship. His duchy almost reached the limits of the I. and II. Aquitania of the Romans, but did not extend south of the Garonne, that district having been ever since the 6th century in the possession of the Gascons. Guilhem refused the empire offered him by the Italians, and died at Maillezais. Meanwhile civilisation and refinement were gradually increasing. The names of Guilhem VI. (d. 1038), Guilhem VII., who joined Gascony and Bordeaux to his duchy, and married his daughter to Henry the Black, and Guilhem VIII. bring us down to Guilhem IX., who succeeded in 1086, and made himself famous as crusader and troubadour. Guilhem X. (d. 1137) married his daughter to Louis VII. of France, and Aquitania went as her dowry. On her divorce from Louis and marriage with Henry II. of England (1152), her possession passed to her new husband, and from that time continued to follow the fortunes of the English territories in France. The name Guienne, the modern corruption of Aquitania, seems to have come into use about the 10th century. An interesting literary relic of the struggle between the Franks and the Gallo-Roman inhabitants of Aquitania exists under the title of Walther d'Aquitaine (see Fauriel·s Poésie Provençale'), but the historical value of this work has been questioned.
