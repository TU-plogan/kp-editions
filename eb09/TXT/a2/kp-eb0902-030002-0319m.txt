ARAFAT, or Orphat, a mountain near Mecca, a visit to which constitutes a necessary part of the great Mahometan pilgrimage. (See Mecca.) It consists of a granite rock about 200 feet high, which is ascended by staircases partly cut in the rock, and partly composed of solid masonry. On this hill Adam is said to have met his wife Eve after being separated from her for 120 years, and it is thence called Arafat, i.e., Gratitude. On the summit is a chapel, which the Mahometans believe to have been built by Adam. The interior was destroyed in 1807.
