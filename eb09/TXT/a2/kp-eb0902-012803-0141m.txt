ANTILEGOMENA (clrrιλcy0∕z,∈vα, contradicted or disputed), an epithet applied by the early Christian writers to denote those books of the New Testament which, although sometimes publicly read in the churches, were not for a considerable time admitted to be genuine, or received into the canon of Scripture. These books are so denominated in contradistinction to the IIomologoumena, or universally acknowledged writings. The following is a catalogue of the Antileg omena:—the Epistle to the Hebrews, the Epistle of St James, the Second Epistle of St Peter, the Second and Third Epistles of St John, the Epistle of St Jude, the Apocalypse, or Revelation of St John. The earliest notice which we have of this distinction is contained in the Ecclesiastical History of Eusebius (iii. 25), who flourished a.d. 270-340; but the meaning of the passage is by no means clear, and it has accordingly given rise to considerable controversy.
