ANSBACH, or Anspach, originally Onolzbach, a town of Bavaria, capital of the circle of Middle Franconia, and formerly of the margraviate of Ansbach, situated on the Rezat, 25 miles S.W. of Nuremberg, and 90 N. of Munich. It is a pleasantly-built place, containing a castle, once the residence of the margraves, and still noted for the gardens that surround it; several churches, the finest of which are those dedicated to St John and St Gunibert; a gymnasium; and a picture gallery. The chief manufactures of Ansbach are woollen, cotton, and half-silk stuffs, earthenware, tobacco, cutlery, and playing cards. There is a considerable trade in grain, wool, and flax. In 1791 the last margrave of Ansbach sold his principality to Frederick William IL, king of Prussia; it was transferred by Napoleon to Bavaria in 1806, Ã n act which was confirmed by the Congress of Vienna in 1815. Population of the town, 12,635.
