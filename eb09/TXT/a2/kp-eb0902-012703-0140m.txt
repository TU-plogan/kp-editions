ANTICYRA, in Ancient Geography, the name of three cities of Greece. (1.) In Phocis, on the Bay of Anticyra, in the Corinthian Gulf. Its modern name is Aspra Spitia, where some remains are still visible. It was a town of considerable importance in ancient times; was destroyed by Philip of Macedon; recovered its prosperity; and was captured by Flaminius in 198 b.c. (2.) In Thessaly, on the right bank of the River Süerchius, near its mouth. (3.) In Locris, on the left side of the entrance to the Corinthian Gulf, and not far from Naupactus. All three places are said to have been known for their hellebore; but the first was the source of the chief supply. The city was resorted to by those suffering from mental derangement, that they might the more easily obtain the curative herb; and this circumstance gave rise to a number of proverbial expressions, like Avτικippας <τe δ∈7, or naviget Anticyram, and to frequent allusions in the Greek and Latin writers (Suetonius, Cal. 29; Persius, Sat. iv. 16; Juv. Sat. xiii. 97). Hellebore was likewise considered beneficial in cases'of gout and epilepsy
