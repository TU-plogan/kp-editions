ANTONINUS, Titus AureliusFulvus Boronius Arrius, surnamed Pius, was the son of Aurelius Fulvus, a Roman consul, whose family had originally belonged to Nemausus (Nismes). He was born near Lanuvium, 86 a.d., and, having lost his father, was brought up under the care of Arrius Antoninus, his maternal grandfather, a man of integrity and culture, and on terms of friendship with the younger Pliny. Having filled with more than usual success the offices of quaestor and praetor, he obtained the consulship in 120 a.d.; was next chosen one of the four consulars for Italy; greatly increased his reputation by his conduct as proconsul of Asia; acquired much influence with the emperor Hadrian, by whom he was at length adopted as his son and successor in February 138 A.D.; and a few months afterwards, on Hadrian's death, was enthusiastically welcomed to the throne by the Roman people, who, for once, were not disappointed in their anticipation of a happy reign. For Antoninus came to his new office with simple tastes, kindly disposition, extensive experience, a well-trained intelligence, and the sincerest desire for the welfare of his subjects. Instead of plundering the provinces to support his prodigality, he emptied his private treasury to assist the provinces. Instead of exaggerating into treason whatever was susceptible of unfavourable interpretation, he turned the very conspiracies that were formed against him into opportunities of signalising his clemency. Instead of stirring up the persecution of the Christians, and gloating over the sufferings of their martyrs, he extended to them the strong hand of his protection through all the empire. Rather than give occasion to that oppression which he regarded as inseparable from an emperor’s progress through his dominions, he was content to spend all the years of his reign in Rome, or its neighbourhood. Under his patronage the science of jurisprudence was cultivated by men of high ability, and a number of enactments were passed in his name that are equally characteristic of his humanity and his justice. Of the public transactions of this period we have but scant information, but, to judge by what we possess, those twenty-two years were not remarkably eventful. No conquests of importance were attempted, and there were no very dangerous attacks to repel, though all round the frontiers a kind of simmering hostility produced a succession of minor invasions and revolts. The one military result which is of interest to us now is the building of the wall of Antoninus from the Forth to the Clyde. In his domestic relations Antoninus was not so fortunate. His wife, Faustina, has almost become a by-word for her lack of womanly virtue; though, either through his ignorance of her conduct, or in spite of his being aware of it, she seems to have kept her hold on his affections to the last. On her death he did honour to her memory in many ways; but in none more remarkable than by the foundation of a charity for orphan girls, who bore the title of Alimentariae Faustiniance. He had by her two sons and two daughters; but they all died before his elevation to the throne, except Annia Faustina, who became the wife of his successor, Marcus Aurelius, and deepened the infamy of the name she inherited from her mother. Antoninus died of fever on the 7th of March 161, giving, as we are told, the keynote to his life in the last word that he uttered when the tribune of the night-watch came to ask the password— Aequanimitas. The only account of his life handed down to us is that of Julius Capitolinus.
