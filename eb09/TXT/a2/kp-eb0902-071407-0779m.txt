ASPASIUS, a Peripatetic philosopher, and one of the most prolific commentators on Aristotle, flourished probably towards the close of the 1st century a.d., or perhaps during the reign of Antoninus Pius. His commentaries on the Categories, De Interpretatione, De Sensu, and other works of Aristotle, are frequently referred to by later writers, but have not come down to us. Certain commentaries on Plato, mentioned by Porphyry in his life of Plotinus, have also been lost. Commentaries on the 2d, 4th, 7th, and 8th books of the Nicomachean Ethics, which pass under his name, were printed along with those of Eustratius and others by Manutius at Venice in 1536. They were translated into Latin by Felicianus in 1541, and have been frequently republished. The authenticity of part, and even of the whole, of these ethical commentaries has been disputed; and recently some fragments of another commentary by Aspasius on the Ethics have been printed. See Classic. Jour., vols, xxviii,, xxix.
