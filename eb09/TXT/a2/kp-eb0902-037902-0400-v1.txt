ARCHIL, or Orchil (Orseille, Fr.), a purple dye yielded by various species of lichens. The name is supposed to originate from the Portuguese rocha, a rock, in allusion to the source from which the raw material is derived. Archil can be extracted from many species of the genera Roccella, Lecanora, Umbilicaria, Parmelia, and others, but in practice two species of Roccella,—R. tinctoria and R. fuciformis, are almost exclusively used. These, under the name of “Orchella Weed,” are imported from the Portuguese colony of Angola, on the west coast of Africa, where the most valuable kinds are gathered; from Cape de Verde Islands; from Lima, on the west coast of South America; and from the Malabar coast of India. They grow on maritime rocks and on trees along sea-coasts, and it will be seen that the species are very widely distributed. The colouring properties of the lichens do not exist in them ready formed, but are developed by the treatment they receive at the hands of manufacturers. Small proportions of a colourless, crystalline principle, termed orcine, is found in some, and in all a series of acid substances, which on treatment split up into orcine and other products. Orcine in presence of oxygen and ammonia takes up nitrogen and becomes changed into orceine, which is essentially the basis of all lichen dyes. Archil is prepared for the dyer’s use in the form of a “liquor” and a “paste,” and the latter when dried and finely powdered forms the “cudbear” of commerce, a dye formerly manufactured in Scotland from a native lichen, Lecanora tartarea. The manufacturing process consists in washing the weeds, which are then ground up with water to a thick paste. If archil paste is to be made this paste is mixed with a strong ammoniacal solution, and agitated in an iron cylinder heated by steam to about 140 Fahr, till the desired shade is developed—a process which occupies several days. In the preparation of archil liquor the principles which yield the dye are separated from the ligneous tissue of the lichens, agitated with a hot ammoniacal solution, and exposed to the action of air.

When carbonate of potassium or sodium is added, a blue dye known as litmus, much used in chemical testing, is produced. French purple or lime lake is a lichen dye prepared by a modification of the archil process, and is a more brilliant and durable colour than the other. The dyeing of worsted and home-spun cloth with lichen dyes was formerly a very common domestic employment in Scotland; and to this day, in some of the outer islands, worsted continues to be dyed with “crottle,” the name given to the lichens employed. Stale urine is the form of ammoniacal liquor used in these localities, and that in early days was the recognised source of ammonia in the manufacture.
