ASSESSOR, among the Romans, was a term generally applied to a trained lawyer who sat beside a governor of a province or other magistrate, to instruct him in the administration of the laws. The system is still exemplified in Scotland, where it is usual in the larger towns for municipal magistrates, in the administration of their civil jurisdiction, to have the aid of professional assessors. In municipal corporations in England, officers with the same name are appointed to assist at the election of councillors and ascertain the result. By the recent English Judicature Act, provision [9:2:729] is made for trial of matters of fact by the judge with assessors instead of by jury, when parties so desire.
