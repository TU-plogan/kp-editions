ARETAeUS, a Greek physician of Cappadocia, who lived, according to some, in the reign of Augustus; according to others, under Trajan or Hadrian. He was one of the class of Pneumatic physicians, who made the heart the seat of life and of the soul. He wrote, in the Ionic dialect, several treatises on acute diseases and other medical subjects, some of which are still extant. The best editions of his works are—that of Boerhaave, in Greek and Latin, with notes, 1731; that printed at Oxford in 1723, in folio; and that by C. G. Kühn, Leipsic, 1828.
