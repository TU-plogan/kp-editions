ARBELA (τα *Ap∕fyλα), now Arbil or Erbil, a small town in the province of Shehrezur, situated to the west of the Tigris, in the plain between the Greater Zab {Lycus) and the Lesser Zab {Caprus), and on the route between Mosul {Nineveh) and Baghdad, about 40 miles from the former. The greater part of the town, which seems at one time to have been very large, is built on an artificial hill about 150 feet high. Arbela has given its name to a battle fought (331 b.c. ) between Alexander the Great and Darius Codomannus,—though, in fact, the scene of the conflict was Gangumela, and it was only in the subsequent pursuit that the conquerer arrived at Arbela, where Darius had left his baggage and treasure. It became the seat of the Eyubide Sultan Saladdin, in 1184, was bequeathed in 1233 to the caliphs of Baghdad, was plundered by the Mongols in 1236 and in 1393 by Timour, and was taken in 1732 by the Persians under Nadir Shah. The population, which varies from 2000 to 6000, is chiefly composed of Koords.
