ARGENSOLA, the name of two Spanish poets, brothers, who are sometimes called the “Spanish Horaces.” The elder, Lupercio Leonardo y Argensola, was born in 1565 and died in 1613. He was educated at the universities of Huesca and Saragossa, and became secretary first to his patron, the duke of VElahermosa, and afterwards to the ex-Empress Maria of Austria. In 1599 he was made historiographer of Aragon, and a few years later historiographer royal. In 1610 he accepted the office of secretary to the Count of Lemos, then viceroy of Naples, at which place [9:2:487] ho died. His works consist of three tragedies, highly praised by Cervantes, and lyric poems, published along with those of his brother. Some historical writings of his have not been published. The younger brother, Bartolomeo Leonardo, was born in 1566 and died in 1631. He entered the church, and in 1588 received the rectory of Villahermosa. He afterwards acted as chaplain to the Empress Maria. Sometime after the death of his brother he succeeded to the office of historiographer. His principal worke are—a history of the Conquest of the Molucca Islands (Conquista de las Islas Mol·ucas, 1609), which has been translated into English, a continuation of Zurita’s Annals of Aragon, and a translation from the English, called Regia de Perfeccion. His fame rests chiefly on his poems, which are highly esteemed by competent critics.
