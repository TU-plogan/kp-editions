ANNONAY, a town of France, in the department of Ardèche, irregularly but picturesquely built on several small hills at the confluence of the rivers Canse and Deôme, 37 miles south of Lyons. It contains few buildings that are worthy of notice, although an obelisk in honour of the celebrated brothers Montgolfier, inventors of the balloon, who were natives of the place, and the Gothic church of Trachi, built in the 14th century, deserve to be mentioned. The manufactures of Annonay are among the most important in the department, the chief being those of paper, long considered to be the best in France, and glove leather, while cotton, woollen, and silk goods are also produced. Population, 18,445.
