ATHENAeUM, a name originally applied to buildings dedicated to Athena (Minerva), was specially used as the designation of a temple in Athens, where poets and men of learning were accustomed to meet and read their productions. The academy for the promotion of learning which the Emperor Hadrian built at Rome, near the Forum, was also called the Athenaeum. Poets and orators still met and discussed there, but regular courses of instruction were given by a staff of professors in rhetoric, jurisprudence, grammar, and philosophy. This species of university continued in high repute till the 5th century. The same name was afterwards applied to similar institutions in Lyons and Marseilles; and it has become a very general designation for literary clubs or academies. It has also been used as the title of literary periodicals, particularly of the journal of art criticism edited by the brothers Schlegel, and the two well-known modern papers published in London and Paris.
