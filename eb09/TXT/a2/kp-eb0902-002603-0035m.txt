ANGARA, Upper and Lower, two rivers of Asiatic Russia, in the government of Irkutsk. The former rises in the mountains to the east of Lake Baikal, and falls into the head of the lake after a course of nearly 300 miles. The latter, which is sometimes called the Upper Tungonska, flows out of Lake Baikal, near its southern extremity, and passing the town of Irkutsk, falls into the Yenisei, after a course of about 1100 miles. The current of the river is very strong, forming several rapids in its progress. The scenery on its banks is frequently extremely beautiful.
