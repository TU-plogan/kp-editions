ASP (Vipera aspis), a species of venomous snake, closely allied to the common adder of this country, which it represents throughout the southern parts of Europe, being specially abundant in the region of the Alps. The term “Asp” (άσπί$) seems to have been employed by Greek and Roman writers, and by writers generally down to comparatively recent times, to designate more than one species of serpent; thus the asp, by means of which Cleopatra is said to have ended her life, and so avoided the disgrace of entering Rome a captive, is now generally supposed to have been the cerastes, or horned viper (Vipera IIassel-quistii), of Northern Africa, a snake about fifteen inches long, exceedingly venomous, and provided with curious horn-like protuberances over each eye, which give it a decidedly sinister appearance. The species, however, to which the word “asp” has been most commonly applied, is undoubtedly the L·aje (Naja haje) of Egypt, a poisonous snake, from three to four feet long, with the skin of its neck loose, so as to render it dilatable at the will of the animal, as in the cobra di capello of India, a species from which it differs only in the absence of the spectacle-like mark on the back of the neck. Like the cobra, also, the haje haβ its fangs extracted by the jugglers of the country, who afterwards train it to perform various tricks. The asp (Pethen, is mentioned in various parts of the Old Testament. This name is twice translated “adder,” but as nothing is told of it beyond its poisonous character and the intractability of its disposition, it is impossible accurately to determine the species which the sacred writers had in view.
