ASSELYN, Hans, a celebrated Dutch painter, was born at Antwerp in 1610, and died at Amsterdam in 1660. He received instruction from Esaias Vandervelde, and distinguished himself particularly in landscape and animal painting, though his historical works and battle-pieces are also admired. He travelled much in France and Italy, and modelled his style greatly after Bamboccio (Peter Laer). He was one of the first Dutch painters who introduced a fresh and clear manner of painting landscapes in the style of Claude Lorraine, and his example was speedily followed by other artists. Asselynâ€™s pictures were in high estimation at Amsterdam, and several of them are in the museums of that city. Twenty-four pieces of landscapes and ruins, which he painted in Italy, have been engraved by Perelle.
