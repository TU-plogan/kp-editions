ARKLOW, a sea-port and market town in the county of Wicklow, Ireland, 50 miles from Dublin, the inhabitants of which are principally engaged in the fisheries and in copper-mines. There are oyster-beds on the coast, but the produce requires to be freed from a peculiar flavour by the purer waters of the Welsh and English coast before it is fit for food. The ruins of the ancient castle of the Ormonds, demolished in 1649 by Cromwell, still exist, but there are no traces of the monastery founded by Fitzwalter. In 1789 the Irish insurgents were defeated by the royal troops near Arklow Bridge. Population (1871), 5178.
