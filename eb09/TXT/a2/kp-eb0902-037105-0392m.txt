ARCHELAUS, son of Apollonius, a sculptor of Priene, is celebrated by his bas-relief representing the apotheosis of Homer. From the style of the work, and from its having been found in the palace of the Emperor Claudius at Bovillae, it may be concluded that it belongs to the 1st century of the Christian era. For some time the bas-relief was in the possession of the Colonna family, but in 1819 it was purchased for Â£1000, and placed in the British Museum.
