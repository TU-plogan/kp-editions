ARPINO, a town on the River Garigliano (Liris), in the province of Caserta, in Italy, with a population of 10,000, engaged in the manufacture of woollen cloth, parchment, paper, &c. The first of these industries seems to have existed from a very early date, to judge by inscriptions and the dedication to Mercurius Lanarius of the temple which is replaced by the church of S. Maria di Civita. Originally a Volscian town, Ärpinum passed into the hands of the Samnites, and from them under the dominion of Rome. Its inhabitants became “Roman citizens” in302 b.c., and received the right of voting in 188 b.c., being enrolled in the Cornelian tribe. The town is chiefly celebrated as the birth-place of Marius and Cicero. The hereditary villa of the orator is supposed to have been situated in the Isola S. Paola, at the mouth of the Fibrenus, where there now stands the monastery of S. Dominico Abbate, in which Hildebrand was once a monk.
