ANTEMNAe, a small Latian town, of great antiquity, built on the top of a hill that rose above the alluvial plain at the meeting of the Anio and Tiber. Hersilia, the wife of Romulus, was a native of Antemnae; and the city was one of those that endeavoured to avenge the rape of the Sabine women. In purely historic times it is of the smallest importance. The Samnites were pursued thither by Crassus, after the battle of the Collino Gate (82 b,c.), and surrendered there to Sulla. In 409 a.d. Alaric encamped on the hill, which now retains no trace of the ancient city.
