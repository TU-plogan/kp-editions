ANTONOMASIA(αντονομασία) is, in rhetoric, the substitution of any epithet or phrase for a proper name; as “Pelides,” or “the son of Peleus,” for Achilles; “the Stagyrite·” for Aristotle; “the author of Paradise Lost ” for Milton; “the little corporal” for Napoleon the First; “Macedonia’s madman” for Alexander the Great, <fcc. <⅛c. Besides gratifying tho taste for variety, it affords the opportunity of bringing indirectly into view facts or feelings that it is not considered desirable or expedient to express distinctly by themselves. The opposite substitution of a proper name for some generic term is also sometimes called [9:2:142] antonomasia; as, a “Cicero” for an orator. In both cases the figure is akin to metonymy.
