ANAXILAUS of Larissa, a physician and Pythagorean philosopher, was banished from Rome by Augustus, b.c. 28, on the charge of practising the magic art. This accusation appears to have originated in his superior skill in natural philosophy, by which he produced effects that the ignorant attributed to magic. (Euseb., Chron, ad Olymp, clxxxviii.; St Iren. i. 13; Plin. xix. 4, xxv. 95, xxviii. 49, xxxii. 52, XXXV. 50.)
