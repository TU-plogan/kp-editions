ARDELAN, a province of Persia, forming the eastern division of Kurdistan, and lying south of Azerbijan. Its capital Senna, in long. 40° E., and lat. 35° 12' N., is built in a deep valley, which is well tilled and rich in orchards. The north part presents a succession of great table-lands, inhabited in the summer by wandering shepherds, who migrate in winter to the vicinity of Baghdad. The soil in the valleys is good, and abundance of wheat, barley, and the oil-plant (Sesamum orientale) is grown, besides a little tobacco. The oak forests of the mountains to the west yield fine timber, which is floated down the Tab into the Tigris, and gall-nuts, which are sent to India. The inhabitants, mostly Kurds, are greatly given to war and robbery, and many of the tribes are subjects of Persia only nominally.
