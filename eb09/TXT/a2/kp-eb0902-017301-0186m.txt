APICIUS. There were three Romans of this name, all celebrated as epicures. The second, Îœ. Gabius Apicius, who lived under Tiberius, is the most famous. He invented various cakes and sauces which bore his name, and rival schools of cookery claimed their descent from him. A treatise, De Re Culinaria, sive de Obsoniis, &c., bearing the assumed name of Caelius Apicius, was compiled at a later period.
