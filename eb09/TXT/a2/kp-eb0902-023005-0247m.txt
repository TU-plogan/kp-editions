AQUILEIA, an ancient city, at the head of the Adriatic, founded or at least colonised by the Romans about 181 b.c., which, on account of its commanding the north-eastern entrance into Italy, soon rose into importance as a commercial centre and as a military post. Connected by the Aemilian way with the capital and the south, it was also the starting-place of the roads to Rhaetia, Pannonia, Istria, and Dalmatia. The surrounding territory was highly fertile, and yielded abundance of wine; while gold was found in considerable quantities in the neighbourhood. Aquileia was chosen by Julius Caesar as headquarters for his forces in Cisalpine Gaul, and was frequently the point d'appui of imperial campaigns. It was strongly fortified by Marcus Aurelius in 160, and was able in 238 to frustrate the long-continued siege of Maximin. About this time it was one of the most important and flourishing cities of all Italy. It was recognised as the capital of Venetia, and allowed to have the altogether exceptional privilege of a mint. In 361 the city was captured byJovinus; and in 381 it was the seat of a council, in which St Ambrose obtained the excommunication of Falladius. In 388 it surrendered to Theodosius the Great his antagonist Maximus; and in 425 Joannes, the rebel against Theodosius II., was led in derision through its streets on an ass, and then beheaded in its circus. In 425 it was taken and destroyed by Attila, and though restored by Narses in 552, it never recovered its former prosperity. At the council of 556 its bishop—whose predecessors can be [9:2:231] traced back to the 3d century—separated from the Church of Rome, and took the title of Patriarch, which was recognised by Pope Sergius I. at the council of 698, when the schism was brought to a close. By 924, under the rule of its patriarchs, it was strong enough to extend its authority over Friuli; and it continued to enjoy considerable prosperity, until it was at length deprived of most of its possessions by Venice in 1420. Its patriarchs had indeed already removed their residence to the castle of Udine, and the Venetian conquest only hastened the decay that had previously begun. The patriarchate was abolished in 1758, and the territory divided into the two bishoprics of Udine and Gorizia. It is now a small fishing village of 1956 inhabitants, containing a number of interesting remains of its ancient splendour, and often rewarding the researches of the antiquary with relics of value.
