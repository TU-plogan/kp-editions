ARU ISLANDS, a group of about thirty islands, nominally under the Dutch government of the Moluccas, which lie south of New Guinea, between lat. 5° 20' and 6 q 55' S., long. 134° 10' and 134° 45' E. Tana-busar, the largest island, is 80 miles from north to south, and is crossed by three river-like creeks tunning east and west, called Watelai, Vorkai, and Maykor. No part exceeds 100 feet in elevation, but it is only on the coast that the ground is swampy. The principal formation is coralline limestone; the eastern coast is defended by coral reefs, and the neighbouring sea is shallow, and abounds in coral in full growth. The other islands of importance are Wamma, Pulo Bali, Oujia, and Wassia. A large part of the surface is covered with virgin forest, consisting of screw-pines, palm-trees, tree ferns, canariums, &c. Kangaroos, and a number of other marsupials, wild pigs, brushturkeys, cassowaries, parroquets, cockatoos, birds of paradise, butterflies, ants, scorpions, sandflies, and mosquitoes are the predominant animals, the fauna being altogether Papuan. The aborigines belong to the Papuan race, but have received intermixture of foreign blood. They are a simple, emotional people, with dark-brown skins and frizzled hair. They wear little clothing, practise polygamy, purchase their wives, and are very lazy, and remarkably talkative. A few villages are nominally Christian, but elsewhere there seems to be no religion or even fetishism of any kind. In Wamma there is a town, Dobbo, to which Dutch, Malay, and Chinese traders resort once a year to traffic with the natives, obtaining trepang, pearl shell, birds of paradise, &c., and giving in exchange cloths, cutlery, muskets, gongs, tobacco, arrack, and elephants’ teeth. The islands are thickly peopled, the inhabitants numbering about 60,000. The Italian naturalist Beccari spent some time among the islands in 1874: and Di Lennâ, an Italian major, has executed a partial survey. (See Wallace’s Malay Archipelago; Ocean Highways, 1873 and 1874; and G. Cora’s Cosmos, 1873.)
