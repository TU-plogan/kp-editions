ANJÁR, a fortified town of Hindustan, and the capital of a district of the same name in the native state of Cutch, lies in 23° 6' N. lat., 70° 3' E. long. The country is dry and sandy, and entirely depends on well irrigation for its water supply. The town is situated nearly 10 miles from the Gulf of Cutch. It suffered severely from an earthquake in 1819, which destroyed a large number of houses, and occasioned the loss of several lives. In 1820 the population was estimated at 10,000. The town and district of Anjar were both ceded to the British in 1816, but in 1822 they were again transferred to the Cutch Government in consideration of an annual money payment. Subsequently it was discovered that this obligation pressed heavily upon the resources of the native state, and in 1832 the pecuniary equivalent for Anjâr, both prospectively and inclusive of the arrears which had accrued to that date, were wholly remitted by the British Government.
