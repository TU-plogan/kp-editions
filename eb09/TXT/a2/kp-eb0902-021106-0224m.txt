APPLE. The apple (Pomme, Fr.; Apfel, Ger.) is the fruit of Pyrus Malus, belonging to the Sub-order Pomaceoe, of the Natural Order Rosaceae. It is one of the most widely cultivated, and best known and appreciated of fruits belonging to temperate climates. In its wild state it is known as the crab-apple, and is found generally distributed throughout Europe and Western Asia, growing in as high a latitude as Drontheim in Norway. The crabs of Siberia belong to a different species, and are named Pyrus baccata and P. prunifolia. The apple-tree as cultivated is a moderate sized tree with spreading branches, ovate, acutely serrated or crenated leaves, and flowers in corymbs. The fruit is too well known to need any description of its external [9:2:212] characteristics. The apple is successfully cultivated in higher latitudes than any other fruit tree, growing up to 65° N., but notwithstanding this, its blossoms are more susceptible of injury from frost than the flowers of the peach or apricot. It comes into flower much later than these trees, and so avoids the night frost which would be fatal to its fruit bearing. The apples which are grown in northern regions are, however, small, hard, and crabbed, the best fruit being produced in hot summer climates, such as Canada and the United States. Besides in Europe and America, the fruit is now cultivated at the Cape of Good Hope, in Northern India and China, andin Australia and New Zealand.

Apples have been cultivated in Great Britain probably since the period of the Roman occupation, but the names of many varieties indicate a French or Dutch origin of much later date. In 1688 Ray enumerated 78 varieties in cultivation in the neighbourhood of London, and now it is calculated that about 2000 kinds can be distinguished. According to the purposes for which they are suitable, they can be classed as—1st, dessert; 2d, culinary; and 3d, cider apples. The principal dessert apples are the Pippins (pépins, seedlings), of which there are numerous varieties. The most estéemed of all apples is the American Newtown Pippin, a globular, juicy, sweet, and highly aromatic fruit; other American varieties of note are Williams’s Favourite, Astrakhan, and Gravenstein, and for winter use the Baldwin, Spitzenberg, and Roxbury Russet. As culinary apples, besides Rennets and other dessert kinds, Codlins, and Biffins are cultivated. In England, Herefordshire and Devonshire are famous for the cultivation of apples, and in these counties the manufacture of cider is an important industry. Cider is also extensively prepared in Normandy and in Holland. Verjuice is the fermented juice of crab apples.

Apples for table use should have a sweet juicy pulp and rich aromatic flavour, while those suitable for cooking should possess the property of forming a uniform soft pulpy mass when boiled or baked. In their uncooked state they are not very digestible, but when cooked they form a very safe and useful food, exercising a gentle laxative influence. According to Fresenius their composition is as follows :—

A large trade in the importation of apples is carried •on in Britain, the amount of which is not, however, separately stated in the Board of Trade returns. Our imports come chiefly from French, Belgian, and Dutch growers, and from the United States and British North America. Dried and pressed apples are imported from France for stewing, under the name of Normandy Pippins, and similarly prepared fruits come also from America.

Many exotic fruits, having nothing in common with the apple, are known by that name, e.g., the Balsam apple, Momordica balsamina ; the Custard apple, Anona reticulata; the Egg apple, Solanum esculentum ; the Rose apple, various species of Eugenia; the Pine apple, Anan-assa sativa ; the Star apple, Chrysophyllum Cainito; and the apples of Sodom, Solanum sodomeum.
