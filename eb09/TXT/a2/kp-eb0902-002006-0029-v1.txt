ANDREW, St, the apostle, born at Bethsaida in Galilee, brother to Simon Peter. He had been a disciple of John the Baptist, and followed Jesus upon the testimony given of Him by the Baptist (John i. 35, 40, Ac.) Andrew introduced his brother Simon, and they passed a day with Jesus, after which they went to the marriage in Cana (ibid. ii.), and then returned to their ordinary occupation. Some months after, Jesus meeting them while they were both fishing together, called them to him, and promised tα make them fishers of men. Immediately they left their nets and followed him (Matt. iv. 19). Tradition assigns Scythia, Greece, and Thrace, as the scenes of St Andrew’s ministry: he is said to have suffered crucifixion at Patra⅛ in Achaia, on a cross of the form called Crux decussata ( × ), and commonly known as “St Andrew’s cross.” His relics, it is said, were afterwards removed from Patrae tσ Constantinople. An apocryphal book, bearing the title of The Acts of Andrew, is mentioned by Eusebius, Epiphanius, and others. It is now completely lost, and seems never to have been received except by some heretical sects, as the Encratites, Origenians, &c. This book, as well as a Gospel of St Andrew, was declared apocryphal by a decree of Pope Gelasius (Jones On the Canon, vol. i. p. 179, et seg.)
