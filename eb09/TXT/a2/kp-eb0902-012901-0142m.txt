ANTIMACHUS, the Colophonian, a Greek poet who was honoured by the Alexandrine grammarians with the second place in their epic canon. Of his works nothing remains to us but the merest fragments; and of his life, we know little more than that he was born at Claros; was beaten by a rival in a poetical competition at Samos; met, either then or in equally discouraging circumstances, with Plato; fell in love with a lady called Lyde; lost her by death; bewailed her in an elegy of extreme erudition, if not of extraordinary pathos; and celebrated in his epic the seven heroes of Thebes. Schellenberg collected his fragmentary remains at Halle in 1786; and Roll at Dillenberg, in 1845. H. G. Stoll published at Göttingen in 1841 Animadversiones in Antimachi Fragmenta; and the remains of the Thebais are to be found in Düntzer, Fragm, des Episch. Poes, der Gτiech.
