ARGYRO-CASTRO{Ergir Castm), a town in the valley of the Drino, in the province of the Avlona, in Albania {Epirus). It has been variously identified with Hadrianopolis and Antigonea, and is supposed to preserve the name of the ancient Argyrini. It is the focus of the Mussulman aristocracy of Epirus, and contains the ruins of an imposing castellated fort. There is a considerable manufacture of a fine kind of snuff, called Full. Hobhouse and Holland estimated the inhabitants at 20,000; out in 1814 the town was almost depopulated by a plague, and the number has sunk to 6000.
