APION, a Greek grammarian and commentator upon Homer, son of Posidonius, was born at Oasis in Libya, but called himself a native of Alexandria, where he studied. He taught rhetoric at Rome about 30 a.d. With extensive knowledge and great oratorical power he combined an unbounded vanity, as the epithet cymbalum mundi applied to him by Tiberius seems to imply. Mere fragments of his works remain; the stories of Androclus and the lion and of the dolphin at Puteoli—the largest of these fragments—are preserved in Gellius. Apion headed the embassy sent by the Alexandrians to Caligula complaining against the Jews, 38 a.d. Josephus refutes his misrepresentations of the Jews in the second of his two books “Against Apion.”
