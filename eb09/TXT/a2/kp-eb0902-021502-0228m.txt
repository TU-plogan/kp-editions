APSHERON, a peninsula of Asia, in Georgia, extending from the eastern extremity of the Caucasus range for about 40 miles into the Caspian Sea, and terminating in Cape Apsheron. It produces naphtha, salt, and saffron in great abundance; and has long been celebrated among the fire-worshippers of Asia for the sacred fires that issue from its soil. On its southern coast is the port of Baku.
