AOSTA, a town of the kingdom of Italy, the capital of a circle of the same name in the province of Turin, situated on the Dora Baltea, at the point where the roads over Great and Little St Bernard meet, 49 miles N. of Turin. It is a tolerably well-built place, containing a cathedral, and a fine town hall, as well as a triumphal arch, an amphitheatre, and other Roman remains. The inhabitants, who number 7669, carry on a considerable trade in wine, cheese, leather, and hemp. Aosta, the ancient Augusta Proetoria, celebrated as the birth-place of Anselm, archbishop of Canterbury, was formerly the capital of a duchy of the same name in Piedmont, which eventually became a province of Sardinia, and was merged in the Italian province of Turin in 1861. The Val dâ€™Aosta, which formed the greater part of Aosta province, produces large quantities of grain, fruit, and cattle, while the mountains abound in iron and other minerals. Cretinism prevails extensively among the inhabitants.
