ANCILLON, Charles, son of David Ancillon, and one of a distinguished family of French Protestants, was born 28th July 1659, at Metz, and died, 5th July 1715, at Berlin. He studied law at Marburg, Geneva, and Paris, where he was called to the bar. At the request of the Huguenots of Ids native place, he pleaded its cause at the court of Louis XIV., urging that it should be excepted in the revocation of the Edict of Nantes; but his efforts were so unsuccessful that he quitted the country and joined his father, who was already in Berlin. Through the influence of his father with the elector of Brandenburg, he was appointed at first judge and director of French refugees, and ultimately embassy counsel, historian to the king, and superintendent of the French school. He is known chiefly by his writings, several of which relate to the revocation of the Edict of Nantes, and other events of his time. He also wrote Miscellaneous Literary Criticisms, a Life of Soliman I I., and a Treatise on Eunuchs, the last of which he published under the name of Ollincan, an anagram of Ancillon.
