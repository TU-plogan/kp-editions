ASPASIA, a beautiful lietoera of Athens, celebrated in history by her connection with Pericles, was a native of Miletus, and settled in Athens, following the example of her countrywoman, Thargelia, who had become very famous during the time of the Persian wars. Her beauty, but still more her remarkable accomplishments, gained for her an extraordinary reputation, which was increased after her association with Pericles, who, having divorced his wife, united himself to Aspasia as closely as was possible under Athenian law, according to which marriage with a barbarian was illegal and impossible. Much of the administration of Pericles has been ascribed to her eloquent instruction and political sagacity, and her enemies did not scruple to lay to her charge the Samian and Peloponnesian wars. Although this exaggerates her power, yet her talents must have been extraordinary, for she drew to her house the most noble and learned in Athens, who were willing to learn from her. Even Socrates was not exempt from her influence. The political supremacy of Pericles, which exposed him to many assaults, attracted enmity to Aspasia. She was accused of impiety and other base crimes, and would probably have been condemned, had not the judges been swayed by the tears and entreaties of Γericles himself. After the death of that statesman’s two sons by his lawful wife, he procured the passing of a law, by which the children of irregular marriages might be rendered legitimate. His son by Aspasia was thus allowed to assume his father’s name. After the death of Pericles, Aspasia is said to have formed a similar connection with one Lysicles, wealthy, but of ignoble birth, whom she raised by her instructions to a prominent place in the state. This episode is somewhat obscure, especially as Lysicles seems to have fallen in battle in 428, the year after the death of Pericles. Nothing further is known of the history of Aspasia.
