ANNA, Baldasarre d, , a painter of some repute, who flourished during part of the 16th and 17th centuries. He was born at Venice, probably about 1560, and is said to have been of Flemish descent. The date of his death is uncertain, but he seems to have been alive in 1639. For a number of years he studied under Leonardo Corona, and on the death of that painter completed several works left unfinished by him. In the opinion of many judges he surpassed his master in richness and mellowness of colour, though he was inferior to him in design. His own activity seems to have been confined to the production of pieces for several of the churches and a few of the private houses in Venice; and though there exists no accurate list of his works, the old guide-books and descriptions of the city notice a considerable number of paintings by him. Scarcely any of these, however, have survived to the present time.
