APOPHTHEGM (α7r0<∕>0cγ∕ια, from φθέγγομαι, to speak), a short, sententious, instructive utterance, as “Knowledge is power,” “True greatness always wills.” Of such sayings Plutarch made a famous collection in his Apo-phthegmata Laconica, and the biblical book of Proverbs abounds with examples. Every apophthegm is a possible proverb; to pass into a proverb it requires age and currency.
