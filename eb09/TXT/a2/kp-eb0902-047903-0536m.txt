ARDÈCHE, a department in the south of France, bounded on the N.W. by the department of Loire, on the E. by Isère and Drôme, on the S. by Gard, and on the W. by Lozère and Haute Loire. It extends 72 miles from N. to S., and 45 from E. to W., at the widest points; and its area is 2134 square miles. The surface of Ardèche is almost entirely covered by the Cevennes Mountains; the main line forming the western boundary of the department, and sending out the Boutières, Coiron, Tanargue, and other branches, for the most part in an easterly direction. Several of the summits, of which the highest, Mount Mezenc, is 5972 feet above the sea, are evidently extinct volcanoes. The Rhone bounds Ardèche on the east, and receives most of its rivers, including the Cance, the Ay, the Doux, the Erieux, and the Ardèche. A few rivers, however, belong to the Atlantic side of the water-shed, the chief being the Loire, which rises on the western borders of the department, and the Allier, which for a short distance separates it from Lozère. The climate in the valley of the Rhone is warm, and sometimes very hot; but westward, as the elevation increases, the cold becomes more intense and the winters longer. Some districts, especially in summer, are liable to sudden alterations in the temperature. Grain and pulse are produced, but.not in quantities sufficient for the population, a large part of the fare of the peasants consisting of potatoes and chestnuts. The latter, besides, form one of the main articles of export, another being oil extracted from nuts. Wine is produced in considerable quantities along the valley of the Rhone. The rearing of the silkworm, however, is of all the industries the most important and remunerative. Goats and sheep are kept in large numbers, Ardèche being one of the chief sources of the supply-of skins for glove-making. The number of horses is small, asses and mules being the beasts of burden mainly employed. Iron, coal, lignite, marble, limestone, and porcelain clay are among the mineral products. Hot springs are numerous, and some of them, as St Laurent, Celles, and Neyτac, are largely resorted to. Natural curiosities are the Pont d’Arc over the Ardèche, and the Chaussée des Géants, near Vais. The country people adhere to their provincial habits and dialect, go barefoot, and wear tall hats and long blouses. Among the celebrated men of the department may be named Cardinal Tournon and the brothers Montgolfier. The chief town is Privas; the arrondissements are Privas, Largentière (which derives its name from its ancient silver mines), and Tournon. Population, 380,277.
