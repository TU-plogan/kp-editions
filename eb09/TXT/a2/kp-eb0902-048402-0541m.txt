ARES [Mars], in Greek Mythology, the god of war, not, however, of war in its wide sense, including campaigns, the disposition and command of forces, but in its more primitive meaning of a fierce encounter between bodies of men. Neither the causes nor the ultimate effects of war were ascribed to him. He was simply a personification of the wild impetuous spirit with which battles were fought, and as such he was conceived as the model of a hero, splendidly armed with cuirass, helmet, shield, and spear, swift, of great size (π∈λωpιoς), raging (μαχνόρενος), murderous (βροτολοίγός), unsatiable of war (droς 7roλepoιo). Enyo, the furious war goddess, Eris (Strife), Deimos and Phobos (Dread and Alarm), were usually by his side. Even his mother Hera denounces him (Iliad, v. 761) as senseless, and knowing no bounds. It was doubtless only as an illustration of the habitual strife between Hera and Zeus that Ares was accounted their son. When wounded by Diomedes assisted by Athena (Iliad, v. 853, ffj), he fell with a noise like that of nine or ten thousand men in battle; and again (Iliad, xxi. 400, ffj), when Athena wounded him with a stone, he fell, and covered with his fall seven acres of ground. On this latter expression it is to be observed, that, while it conveys a picture of broad-strewn carnage consistent with the usual character of Ares, it suggests also, from the measurement given, thoughts of the destruction of cultivated land in war, the more so when taken in connection with the story of Otus and Ephialtes, which reads in the Iliad (v. 385) like a reminiscence from an earlier time, when war was the dread of the husbandman. These two giants, sons of Aloeus, the planter, born very small, but grown by being fed on grain to immense size, and occupied, as their names imply, with husbandry (Otus = ωθεω, and Ephialtes = ∈7τι0λλop,αι), had seized Ares and confined him in a large brazen jar for thirteen months, so that for one year there was entire peace over the fields. If, as is not improbable, the first conception of a war god originated in connection with invasion from non-Hellenic tribes, it would be natural to regard him perhaps more as a ruthless destroyer of fields than of human life, and equally natural that this view of his character should die out when war became, so to speak, a trade, as it had become by the time of the Iliad. Even then he was still recognised as a god whose home was among the warlike Thracians (Iliad, xiii. 298; Odyssey, viii. 361). This, it is true, may have been nothing more than another instance of the Greek tendency to assign a northern or Hyperborean home to deities in whose character something analogous to the stormy elements of nature was found. On the other hand, it appears that the Thracians and Scythians in historical times (Herodotus, i. 59) worshipped chiefly a war god, and that certain Thracian settlements, formed in Greece in prehistoric times, left behind them traces of the worship of a god whom the Greeks called Ares. At Thebes, for instance, had been such a settlement, and there, above all the rest of [9:2:485] Greece, were afterwards found the oldest traditions of the worship of Ares, and that not altogether in the character of a war god. The fountain of Ares guarded by a dragon, and the legend of the Spartae, who sprang from a field sown with dragon’s teeth, seem rather to symbolise some destructive influence in nature, such as that of the sun in summer scorching the fields. That influence of this kind was ascribed to the Thracian god follows from the identification of him with the Sabine and Roman Mars, to the latter of whom the Arvai brethren in Rome made annual sacrifice of a red dog to avert the calamity of the ripe grain taking fire. Apollo is the god who in Greek mythology, as we know it, discharged such functions. But it is argued that in this matter he may have superseded Ares, who on assuming the Thracian character of war god may have gradually resigned his original office. In one of the Homeric hymns Ares is described as a sun god who makes courage and valour stream into the hearts of men, and again, Aeetes, king of Colchis, though a son of Helios, was yet the guardian of the grove of Ares, where was the golden fleece. Meleager, whose valour was displayed against the Calydonian boar, a pest to the fields of Aetolia, was a son of Ares and the fostering nymph Althaea. Oenomaus was a son of Ares and a daughter of the river god Asopus. The dog, which had originally referred to the dog star, remained his symbol, but could only be accounted for by the constant presence of that animal on battle-fields. From the destruction of crops by summer heat to similar destruction by war-like invasion seems a natural step. The next step was to take the point of view of the invader, and to magnify the exploits of war. By the time of Homer this had been done effectually, though traces of an older form of belief remain both in the Iliad and Odyssey. Besides those already mentioned, there is the remarkable incident in the Odyssey (viii. 266, ff.} where Hephaestos, informed by Helios of the infidelity of his wife Aphrodite with Ares, captures them together in a net, and there holds them for the ridicule of the gods. In what appears to be a very early development of her character, Aphrodite was a war goddess, and was styled Areia. But it is scarcely possible that a phase of character shared also, for example, by Athena, could have suggested such a relation between Ares and Aphrodite, though Hesiod’s statement (fΓheogony, 934) that Deimos and Phobos were their offspring points in that direction. Again, though Ares and Aphrodite were worshipped together at Thebes, it is not known that they were worshipped there as deities of war. Harmonia, the wife of Cadmus, the founder of that town, was regarded as their daughter. Possibly the connection originated in some other approximation between Ares and Aphrodite in an earlier form of their worship. Women were excluded from the festivals of Ares except at Tegea, in Arcadia, where he was called ywatKoôoAaç. But that exception appears to have been based only on an instance in which that town was successfully defended by its women. While honoured here and there with festivals and sacrifice, as at Sparta, where young dogs, and apparently once men, were offered to him under his title of Enyalios and Theritas, there were yet wanting in his case those local beliefs and traditions which gave vitality to the worship of a god. Next to Thebes, already mentioned, it was at Athens that this vitality obtained most, through the legend attaching to the Areopagus (*Apeιoς 7rαγos). The nymph Agraulos had born him a daughter Alcippe, whom Halirrhotius, a son of Neptune, had seized with violence, and for this was slain by Ares, who was tried by a council of the gods sitting on the Areopagus and acquitted. At the foot of the Areopagus was a temple of Arcs, with a statue of the god from the hands of Alcamenes. To judge now of the fluctuation in the conception of Ares from works of art, it is found that previous to the 5th century b.c., he was figured bearded, grim, and heavily armed. From that time, apparently under the influence of Athenian sculptors, who had to render his form in some harmony with their local war goddess Athena, he was conceived as the ideal of a youthful warrior, and for a time associated with Aphrodite and Eros, as in the group of the villa Borghese at Rome, where Eros plays with his weapons, and in many other groups of Ares and Aphrodite in marble and on engraved gems of Roman times. But before this grouping had recommended itself to the Romans, with their legend of Mars and Rhea Silvia, the Greek Ares had again become under Macedonian influence a bearded, armed, and powerful god. The Romans, however, though they readily adopted the Greek Mars and Venus, yet retained the former deity in his native character as a god representing the influence of the sun on cultivated fields, resembling the Mamers of the Mamertines in Sicily, with a wolf as his symbol (Conze, Heroen und Gotter Gestalten, p. 22, Vienna, 1874; Preller, Griechische Mythologie, i. pp. 251-259; Weicker, Griechische Gotteτlehre, ί pp. 413-424).

A RESON, Jon (or Hans), a poet, and the last Roman Catholic bishop in Iceland, was born in 1484. He endured many privations in his youth, and at the age of twenty took holy orders, and was attached as priest to the parish of Helgastad. Here he was taken under the protection of Gottskalk, bishop of Holum, who twice sent him on missions to Norway. He acquitted himself so well that in 1522 he was appointed successor to Gottskalk. To many his election was displeasing, chiefly on account of his ignorance of Latin; and Ogmund, bishop of Skalholt, the other diocese, drove Areson with violence from his bishopric. He was reinstated in 1524, and spent some rather stormy years till 1540, when Frederic III., king of Denmark, wrote to the bishops of Iceland desiring them to take measures for the introduction of Lutheranism. This Areson declined to do, and he even denied the king’s power as head of the church. The greater part of the island, however, became Protestant. In 1548 the Lutheran bishop of Skalholt died, and Areson made an armed excursion into his successor’s territory. For this he was in 1549 declared an outlaw. He again sent an expedition against Skalholt, and captured the bishop, whom he treated with indignity. In 1550 his forces were defeated; he was taken, and executed along with two of his sons. Areson is celebrated as a poet, and as having been the first to introduce printing into Iceland. Several of his poems are collected by Harboe in his History of the Reformation in Iceland.
