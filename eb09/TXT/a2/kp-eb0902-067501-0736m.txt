AS, an ancient weight, consisting of 12 ounces, identical with libra, the Roman pound. The word is common in the old Italic dialects, and may perhaps be connected with the Greek a*ç, which, in the Doric dialect, is used for ∈Γs, one, i.e., an entire thing; according to others it is derived from oes, because made of the mixed metal known under that name.

It was also the name of a Roman coin, which was of different weight and value at different periods. The first introduction of coined money is ascribed to Servius Tullius, who probably borrowed from the neighbouring Etruscans the general form and scale of value. The old as was composed of the mixed metal oes, an alloy of copper and tin, and was called as libralis, or librarius, because actually weighing a pound or 12 ounces. The asses were cast in a mould, and their original shape seems to have been an irregular oblong, which was stamped with the figure of a sheep, ox, or sow. After the round shape was introduced, the one side w as always inscribed with the figure of a ship’s prow, and the other with the double head of Janus. The subdivisions of the as had also the ship’s prow on one side, and on the other the head of some deity. The first Punic war having exhausted the treasury, the as was reduced to two ounces. In the second Punic war, it was again reduced to half its weight, viz., to one ounce. And lastly, by the Papirian law it was further reduced to the diminutive weight of half an ounce. It appears to have been still more reduced under Octavianus, Lepidus, and Antony, when its value was ⅜ of an ounce. It probably continued at this value till the time of the Emperor Severus, when it was again lowered to about of an ounce. During the commonwealth and empire oes grave was used to denote the old as in contradistinction to the existing depreciated coin; while oes rude was applied to the original oblong coinage of primitive times.

As also denoted any integer or whole; whence the English word ace. Thus as signified the whole inheritance; whence hoeres ex asse, the heir to the whole estate.
