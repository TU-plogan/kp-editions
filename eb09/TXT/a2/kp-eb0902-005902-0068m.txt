ANKLAM, or Anclam, a town of Prussia, in the province of Pomerania, situated on the Peene, 6 miles from its mouth in the Kleine Haff, and 47 N.W. of Stettin, with which it is connected by railway. The fortifications of Anklam were dismantled in 1762, and have not since been restored, although the old walls are still standing; formerly, however, it was a town of considerable military importance, which suffered severely during the Thirty Years’ and the Seven Years’ Wars; and this fact, together with the repeated ravages of fire and of the plague, has made its history more eventful than is usually the case with towns of the same size. It does not possess any remarkable buildings, although it contains several, private as well as public, that are of a quaint and picturesque style of architecture. The Peene is navigable up to the town, which has a considerable trade in its own manufactures, as well as in the produce of the surrounding country, while some shipbuilding is carried on in wharves on the river. The chief manufactures are linen and woollen goods, leather, beer, and soap. Anklam formerly bore the names Wendenburg and Tanglim. Population in 1871, 10,739.
