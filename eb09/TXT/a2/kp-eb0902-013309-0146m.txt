ANTIOPE (2), an Amazon who bore to Theseus a son, Hippolytus. As to how Theseus became possessed of her there are various reports. Either she gave herself up to him out of love, when with Hercules he captured Themiscyra, the seat of the Amazons, or she fell to his lot then as a captive. Or again, Theseus himself invaded the dominion of the Amazons and carried her off, the consequence of which was a counter-invasion of Attica by the Amazons. After four months of war peace was made, and Antiope left with Theseus as a peace-offering. In another account she had joined the Amazons against him because he had been untrue to her in desiring to marry Phaedra. Antiope is said to have been killed by another Amazon, Molpadia, a rival in her affection for Theseus. Elsewhere it was believed that he had himself killed her, and fulfilled an oracle to that effect.
