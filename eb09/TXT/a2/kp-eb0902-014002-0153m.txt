ANTONIUS, Marcus, the Roman orator, was born 143 b.c. After having filled the office of quaestor (113), he was appointed praetor in 104, and propraetor in the following year, the province of Cilicia being assigned to him. Here he was so successful in the war against the pirates, that a naval triumph was awarded him in 102. He w as consul along with A. Postumius Albinus in 99, when he successfully opposed the agrarian law of the tribune Titius. He was censor 97, and held a command in the Marsi c waι in 90. Belonging as he did to the party of Sulla, he was put to death by order of Marius and Cinna when they obtained possession of Rome (87 b.c. ) Antony’s reputation for eloquence rests on the authority of Cicero, none oi his orations being extant.
