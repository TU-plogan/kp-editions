ARCOS DE LA FRONTERA, a Spanish town in the province of Cadiz, on the river Guadalete, which flows past Santa Maria into the bay of Cadiz. It is built upon a high and precipitous rock, and commands magnificent views. The special designation “of the frontier” is due to its position as a border town after its capture from the Moors by Alphonso the Wise. Its horses, reared in the plains below, are famous in the ancient ballads of Spain. It contains two parish churches, a number of convents, and 15,378 inhabitants.
