ASPER, Hans, a Swiss painter, was born in 1499 at Zürich, where he died on the 21st March 1571. He wrought in a great variety of styles, but excelled chiefly in flower and fruit pieces, and in portrait painting. Many of his pictures have perished, but his style may be judged from the illustrations to Gessner’s Historia Animalium, for which he is said to have furnished the designs, and from portraits of Zwingle and his daughter Regula Gwalter, which are preserved in the public library of Zürich. It has been usual to class Asper among the pupils and imitators of Holbein, but an inspection of his works is sufficient to show that this is a mistake. Though Asper was held in high reputation by his fellow-citizens, who elected him a member of the Great Council, and had a medal struck in his honour, he seems to have been frequently in embarrassed circumstances, and there is reason to believe that he died a pauper.
