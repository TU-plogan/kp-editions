ASCENSION, a solitary island in the Atlantic Ocean, in lat. 7° 56' S. and long. 14° 24' W., about 7⅜ miles in length and 6 in breadth, with an area of 34 square miles, and within the immediate influence of the south-east tradewind. It is one of the peaks of a submarine ridge which separates the northern and southern basins of the Atlantic. The whole character of the island is volcanic, and its surface is broken into mountains, hills, and ravines. Towards the south-east, the Green Mountain, the highest in the island, rises 2870 feet above the level of the sea, whilo the plains or table-lands surrounding it vary in height from 1200 to 2000 feet. On the north side they sweep gradually down towards the shore; but, on the south, they terminate in bold and lofty precipices. Steep and rugged ravines intersect the plains, opening into small bays or coves on the shore, fenced with masses of compact and cellular lava; and all over the island are found the usual products of volcanic action. The chief productions of the island are green vegetables. Ascension has long been noted for the abundance of turtle and turtle eggs found on its shores, the season lasting from December to May or June. The coasts abound with a variety of fish of excellent quality, of which the most important are the rock-cod, the cavalha, the conger-eel, and the “soldier.” The wild animals are guinea-fowl, goats, cats, rats, and land-crabs; but the goats have been almost exterminated to make way for sheep and cattle. The air is clear and light, and the climate remarkably healthy. The island was discovered by the Portuguese navigator, Juan de Nova, on Ascension day 1501; but remained uninhabited till after the arrival of Napoleon at St Helena (1815), when it was taken possession of by the British Government. The garrison, with their retainers, resided in George Town, on the north-west coast, which is. abundantly supplied with fresh water from a magnificent cistern capable of containing 1700 tons of water, supplied by means of iron pipes from springs in the Green Mountain, G miles distant, which were reached by boring in 1830. Ascension is found useful as a station and rendezvous for the vessels employed on the coasts of Africa and Brazil; and letters were formerly often left by passing ships in a crevice in one of the rocks. Population, about 500. (See Darwin’s Observations on Volcanic Islands and A Naturalist’s Voyage.')
