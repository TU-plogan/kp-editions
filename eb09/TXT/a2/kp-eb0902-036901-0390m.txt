ARCHBISHOP, the title of a church dignitary of the first class. Archbishops were not known in the church before the 4th century after Christ, when the term u Archbishop ’’ was introduced in the East as a title of dignity, which did not necessarily imply any superiority of jurisdiction over a bishop. Athanasius, bishop of Alexandria, appears to have been the first who made use of the term in applying it as a mark of personal honour to Alexander, his predecessor in the see of Alexandria, and Gregory Nazianzen applied the term in like manner to Athanasius. In the following century the title of archbishop seems to have been applied to the bishops of the more important sees, as the names of several archbishops are recorded in the list of church dignitaries, who were assembled in the Council of Chalcedon in 451 a.d. In the Latin Church the title was hardly known before the 7th century after Christ. Isidore of Seville (Hispalensis) is the first writer who speaks of archbishops, distinguishing them as a class from patriarchs, metropolitans, and bishops. Archbishops in the present day are for the most part either patriarchs or metropolitans; but an archbishop is not necessarily a patriarch or a metropolitan, and there are metropolitans who have only the title of bishops. The ecclesiastical government of the Church of England is divided between two archbishops,—the archbishop of Canterbury, who is primate of all England and metropolitan of the province of Canterbury, and the archbishop of York, who is primate of England, and metropolitan of the province of York. The jurisdiction of the archbishop of Canterbury as primate of all England extends in certain matters into the province of York. He exercised the jurisdiction of legatus natus of the Pope throughout all England before the Reformation, and since that event he has been empowered, by 25 H. VIII. c. 21, to exercise certain powers of dispensation in cases formerly sued for in the court of Rome. Under this statute the archbishop continues to grant special licences to marry, which are valid in both provinces; he appoints notaries public, who may practise in both provinces; and he grants dispensations to clerks to hold more than one benefice, subject to certain restrictions which have been imposed by recent statutes. The archbishop also continues to grant degrees in the faculties of theology and law, which are known as Lambeth Degrees. His pewer to grant degrees in medicine, qualifying the recipients to practise, has been practically restrained by 21 and 22 Vict. c. 90. The province of Canterbury consists of twenty-one dioceses—St Asaph, Bangor, Bath and Wells, Canterbury, Chichester, St David’s, Ely, Exeter, Gloucester and Bristol, Hereford, Lichfield, Lincoln, Llandaff, London, Norwich, Oxford, Peterborough, Rochester, Salisbury, Winchester, and Worcester. The bishops of the above-mentioned dioceses constitute the Upper House of Convocation of the prelates and clergy of the province of Canterbury. The archbishop is president ex officio of this Convocation, which is summoned by him pursuant to a royal writ whenever the Parliament is called together (see Convocation), and it is prorogued and dissolved whenever the Parliament is prorogued or dissolved.

Tne archbishop of Canterbury exercises the twofold jurisdiction of a metropolitan and of a diocesan bishop. As metropolitan he is the guardian of the spiritualities of every vacant see within the province, and he presents to all benefices which fall vacant during the vacancy of the see, and through his special commissary exercises the ordinary jurisdiction of a bishop within the vacant diocese. He exercises also an appellate jurisdiction over each bishop, which in cases of licensed curates he exercises personally under 1 and 2 Vict. c. 106; but his ordinary appellate jurisdiction is exercised by the judge of the provincial court of appeal, which from the circumstance of its having been held in former days in the church of St Mary of the Arches (Bow Church), which was a peculiar of the archbishop, has come to be called the Arches Court of Canterbury. The judge of this court, who is appointed by the archbishop, is properly styled the Official Principal of the Arches Court, but he is commonly called the Dean of the Arches, from a peculiar jurisdiction, now abolished, which he formerly exercised in the name of the archbishop over fifteen churches in the diocese of London. The archbishop had formerly exclusive jurisdiction in all causes of wills and intestacies, where parties died having personal property in more than one diocese of the province of Canterbury, and he had concurrent jurisdiction in other cases. This jurisdiction, which he exercised through the judge of the Prerogative Court, has been transferred to the Crown by 20 and 21 Vict. c. 77. The Arches Court was also the court of appeal from the consistory courts of the bishops of the province in all testamentary and matrimonial causes. The matrimonial jurisdiction has been transferred to the Crown by 20 and 21 Vict. c. 78. The Court of Audience, in which the archbishop presided personally, attended by his vicargeneral, and sometimes by episcopal assessors, has fallen into desuetude. The vicar-general, however, exercises jurisdiction in matters of ordinary marriage licences and of institutions to benefices. The Master of the Faculties regulates the appointment of notaries public, and all dispensations which fall under 25 H. VIII. c. 21.

The first archbishop of Canterbury was Augustine the monk, whose preaching converted King Ethelbert. Augustine was consecrated a bishop for England in 597 a.d., and received the pallium, which is the distinguishing mark of the metropolitan’s office, from Gregory the Great in the following year. He was subsequently constituted legatus natus of the apostolic see, and his successors enjoyed various jura regalia by grant from the Crown. They had also precedence over all subjects of the Crown not of royal blood, and the archbishop still retains such precedence over every Peer of Parliament. It is also his privilege to crown the kings and queens of England. He is entitled to consecrate all the bishops within his province, and was formerly entitled, upon consecrating a bishop, to select a benefice within his diocese as his option for one of his chaplains, [9:2:370] but this practice has been indirectly abolished by 3 and 4 Vict. c. Ill, § 42. He is entitled to nominate eight chaplains, who had formerly certain statutory privileges, which are now abolished. He is ex officio an ecclesiastical commissioner for England, and has by statute the right of nominating one of the salaried ecclesiastical commissioners.

The archbishop exercises the ordinary jurisdiction of a bishop over his diocese through his Consistory Court at Canterbury, the judge of which court is styled the Commissary-General of the city and diocese of Canterbury. The archbishop holds a visitation of his diocese personally every three years, and he is the only diocesan who has kept up the triennial visitation of the dean and chapter of his cathedral.^[1. The Court of Peculiars is no longer held, inasmuch as the peculiars have been placed by Acts of Parliament under the ordinary jurisdiction of the bishops of the respective dioceses in which they are eituated. ]

The province of York consists of six dioceses in England, Carlisle, Chester, Durham, Manchester, Ripon, and York, to which may be added the diocese of Man, which was annexed under that title by 33 Henry VIII. c. 31, to the province of York. The latter diocese has been entitled in recent Acts of Parliament the diocese of Sodor and Man, and it is now generally so designated. The bishops of the above seven dioceses constitute the Upper House of Convocation of the prelates and clergy of the province of York, of which the archbishop is ex officio president, and which is convened, prorogued, and dissolved under the same conditions as the Convocation of the province of Canterbury.

The archbishop of York has immediate spiritual jurisdiction as metropolitan in the case of all vacant sees within the province of York, analogous to that which is exercised by the archbishop of Canterbury within the province of Canterbury. He has also an appellate jurisdiction of an analogous character, which he exercises through his provincial court, whilst his diocesan jurisdiction is exercised through his consistorial court, the judges of both courts being nominated by the archbishop. His grace’s ancient testamentary and matrimonial jurisdiction has been transferred to the Crown by the same statuteswhich have divested the see of Canterbury of its jurisdiction in similar matters.

The first archbishop of York was Paulinus, to whom Pope Honorius I. sent the pallium, in 634 a.d. in fulfilment of the intention of Pope Gregory the Great. The successors of Paulinus exercised metropolitan jurisdiction over the bishops of Scotland until the latter part of the 15th century, when Pope Sixtus IV. raised the bishopric of St Andrews into an archbishopric, and constituted the archbishop of St Andrews primate of all Scotland, and legatus natus of the apostolic see in Scotland. The archbishop of York takes precedence over all subjects of the Crown not of royal blood, next to the lord high chancellor of England, who is preceded by the archbishop of Canterbury. He is ex officio an ecclesiastical commissioner for England.

The first archbishop of St Andrews was Patrick Graham, who successfully disputed the superiority of the see of York, and was constituted metropolitan over all the diocesan bishops of Scotland in 1474 a.d. His successors continued to exercise metropolitan jurisdiction throughout Scotland until 1491 a.d., when Pope Innocent VIII. sent the pallium to the bishop of Glasgow, and constituted him metropolitan over the dioceses of Argyle, Dunblane, Dunkeld, Galloway, and Glasgow, whilst the archbishop of St Andrews continued to exercise metropolitan jurisdiction over the dioceses of Aberdeen, Brechin, Caithness, Edinburgh, Moray, Orkney, Ross, and St Andrews, until the Episcopal form of church government ceased to have any legal authority in Scotland.

The Church of Ireland was united, by the fifth article of the Act for the Union of Ireland with Great Britain, into one Protestant Episcopal church with the Church of England, and it had at that time four archbishops, who took their titles from Armagh, Dublin, Cashel, and Tuam. The archbishop of Armagh was primate of all Ireland and metropolitan of the province of Armagh, and the other archbishops were primates of Ireland and metropolitans of their respective provinces. By 3 and 4 Will. IV. c. 37, and 4 and 5 Will. IV. c. 90, the metropolitans of Cashel and of Tuam were reduced to the status of diocesan bishops, and, with the then existing eighteen bishops, were reduced in number to ten bishops by the consolidation of their dioceses, so that each of the two archbishops had five diocesans subject to his metropolitan jurisdiction. By 32 and 33 Viet, c. 42, the union between the Churches of England and of Ireland was dissolved, and the Church of Ireland has ceased to be established by law. (τ. τ.)
