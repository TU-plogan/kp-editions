ARCIS-SUR-AUBE, the chief town of the arrondissement of the same name, in the department of Aube, in France, is situated, in long. 4° 9' E., lat. 48° 3Γ N., about 17 miles (28 kilometres) N. of Troyes, on the left bank of the river, just at the point where it becomes navigable.

An old castle, where Brune-haut and afterwards Diaua of Poitiers resided, looks down on it from a height, the only other building· of interest being the church, which dates from the 16th century. A battle was fought here on the 20th and 21st of March 1814 between Napoleon and the Austro-Russian army under Schwarzenberg, which led the former to retire upon Vitry, leaving the way open to Paris. There are important hosier)' manufactures in the town, and it carries on a large trade in grain and coal, besides being an emporium for the wooden wares of the Vosges.
