ASSIGNMENT, Assignation, Assignee, are terms which, as derivatives of the verb assign, are of frequent technical use in the law of the different parts of the United Kingdom. To assign is to make over, and the term is generally used to express a transference by writing, in conti adistinction to a transference by actual delivery. In England the usual expression is assignment, in Scotland it is assignation. The person making over is called the assignor or cedent; the recipient, the assign or assignee.
