APPENZELL (for derivation see below), one of the twenty-two cantons of the Swiss Confederation, is an alpine region, with an area of about 152 square miles, entirely surrounded by the canton of St Gall. The mountains in the south attain a considerable elevation, the highest, Mount Sentis, being 8215 feet in height, and reaching the region of perpetual snow; but towards the north the surface is composed of’mere hills and hollows, some of the hills being rather remarkable for their conical shape. The canton is watered by a tributary of the Thur, the Sitter, which takes its rise from a glacier on Mount Sentis, its affluent the Urnäsch, and a number of mountain streams. It was at one time almost covered with forests of fir and pine; but in consequence of the extension of the population, these have been greatly diminished. Peat and wood for fuel are abundant. The climate is cold and variable, but not unhealthy. Subject like the rest of Switzerland to the Franks in the 8th century, Appenzell gradually passed into the hands of the abbots of St Gall; in 1401 it rebelled against what had become an ecclesiastical tyranny; and in 1513 it was admitted into the Swiss Confederation. The violent struggles which followed the Reformation led to its division, in 1597, into two parts—the Inner Rhodes (a word of military origin, like the German Rotte), in the [9:2:211] south, being appropriated to the Roman Catholics, and the Outer Rhodes, in the north, to the Protestants. This distinction has continued to the present day; the census of 1870 giving the number of Protestants in the Catholic district as only 188, and of Catholics in the Protestant, 2358. Until 1848, indeed, no Protestants, or even Catholic aliens, were allowed to settle in Inner Rhodes. The chief town of that division is Appenzell, and of the other, Trogen. Each district has its own democratical constitution, consisting of a Landesgemeinde, or General .Assembly, where every freeman above 18 years is bound to appear, and a Great Council, chosen by the people, the members of which must submit their acts to the general approval for their ratification. Outer Rhodes sends two members to the Nationalrath, or House of Representatives of the Confederation, and Inner Rhodes one, besides the two members which the canton sends to the Standerath, or Senate. Appenzell has taken the civil code of Zurich for its model, and has instituted a court of appeal. The value of real and other property in Outer Rhodes is estimated at £59,028, and in Inner Rhodes at £9600; the revenue of Outer Rhodes at £12,699, and its expenditure, £12,800 (1868); and the revenue of Inner Rhodes at £6031, and its expenditure at £6011. In 1837 the population of the canton was 50,876; in 1860, 60,624, of whom 48,604 belonged to the Protestant division; and in 1870, 60,635, of whom 48,726 belonged to Outer Rhodes. This division, therefore, is far more populous and wealthy than the other part of the canton. Its inhabitants are industrious, and carry on large manufactures of cotton and linen goods and embroidery, while the inhabitants of Inner Rhodes are chiefly engaged in the rearing of cattle and the making of cheese. Since railway communication has made the district more accessible, a great number of strangers come to take advantage of the whey-cure establishments at Gais, Weissbad, Gonten, Umäsch, <sc. A peculiar dialect— differing from the ordinary Swiss German—is spoken throughout the canton. Red is the prevailing colour in the national dress; and athletic sports and rifle-shooting are the favourite amusements.

Appenzell, the chief town of Inner Rhodes, in the canton of Appenzell, derives its name (Abbatis Celia, Abtenzelle), like Bischofszell and St Peterzell in the same region, from its ancient ecclesiastical connection. It is situated in the beautiful valley of the Sitter, and has a church with an old Gothic choir, two convents, and a councilhouse. The Landesgemeinde holds its meetings in the open square. In the Archiv are preserved a number of ancient banners, and among them one captured from the Tyrolese, with the grotesque inscription, Hundert Tausend Teufel. The inhabitants, who are almost entirely Roman Catholics, are largely employed in the production of embroidery, and number about 3700.
