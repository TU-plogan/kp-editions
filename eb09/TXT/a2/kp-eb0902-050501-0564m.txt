ARISTIDES, Aelius, surnamed Theodorus, a distinguished Greek rhetorician or sophist, was the son of Eudae-mon, a priest of Zeus, and was born at Adriani, in Mysia. The date of his birth is given by some as 129 a.d., by others, with more probability, as 117. He studied with great assiduity, and early manifested an uncommon aptitude for all that pertained to the art of rhetoric. He travelled extensively through Greece, Italy, Egypt, and Asia, and acquired such renown for eloquence that monuments were erected to him in several of the towns through which he passed. A record of his journeys has been preserved by himself, and his vanity appears to have been increased to an inordinate extent by his success. Shortly after his return to Italy, he was seized with a peculiar illness, which lasted for 13 years, and the nature of which has been the subject of some speculation. It is described very fully in his six Sacred Discourses, along with a mass of details regarding visions, dreams, and wonderful cures. His account of these cures has excited considerable attention, from the similarity between them and the effects produced by Mesmerism or Hypnotism, i.e., nervous sleep. Aristides meanwhile had settled at Smyrna, whither he had gone for the sake of his health. In 178, when the city was partially destroyed by an earthquake, he wrote an eloquent account of the misfortune to the Emperor Aurelius, with whom he was a great favourite, and prevailed on him to give assistance to the citizens. The Smyrnaeans, out of gratitude for [9:2:506] this service, called Aristides the founder of their city, and erected a brazen statue to him. He declined the other honours which they would have heaped upon him, and would only accept the office of priest of Aesculapius, which he held till his death, about 189 a.d.

The extant works of Aristides consist of two small and unimportant treatises on rhetoric, and of fifty-five orations or declamations. In several of these he selects the same subjects as had been treated by Demosthenes and Isocrates, and puts himself in direct competition with them. His contemporaries ventured to compare him with Demosthenes, but modern criticism does not confirm this judgment The style of Aristides is good, sometimes terse and elegant, but occasionally laboured, and there is a total want of the vigorous energy of thought and practical skill that give so much power to the orations of Demosthenes. No doubt this is in great measure due to the fact that the subjects selected by Aristides were to him fictitious, and that, consequently, his whole attention must have been concentrated on the diction and manner of treatment; in the cause itself he could have had no living interest. A complete edition of his works was published by Dindorf, Aristidis Opera, 3 vols*., Leipsic, 1829.
