ATELLA, an ancient city of Campania, about 9 miles from Naples. In the second Punic war it sided with Hannibal, and, in consequence, its inhabitants were dispersed by the Romans and their place supplied by the people of Nuceria. In the time of Cicero it was a flourishing town, and under Augustus it received a military colony. In the early Christian centuries it was an episcopal see; but in 1030 A.D. its inhabitants were removed to Aversa, the newly founded city of Count Rainulph, and since then it has sunk into ruins. The Fabuloe Atellanae (named after this city) was a species of satirical comedy exhibited at Rome after the subjugation of Campania. The principal characters were Maccus, a fool with ass’s ears; Bucco, a loquacious glutton; Pappus, an old simpleton; and Dossenus, a sharper. The comedy was originally in high repute, but was eventually suppressed by order of the senate for indecencies introduced into it.
