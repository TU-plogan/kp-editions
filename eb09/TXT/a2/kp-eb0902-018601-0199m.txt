APOLLO BELVIDERE, a marble statue of Apollo, found towards the end of the 15th century near Antium {Capo d â€™ Amo), a favourite resort of Roman emperors. Julius II., while yet a cardinal, purchased it; and on becoming Pope allowed it to be placed, through Michael Angelo, in the Belvidere of the Vatican, whence it was taken by the French in 1797, but restored in 1815. The marble some believe to be Greek, though perhaps the best authorities call it Carrara. In any case the statue is not an original work, but a copy apparently from a very fine Greek statue of about the beginning of the 3rd century b.c., of which another copy has been identified in a bronze statuette now in St Petersburg, known as the Stroganoff Apollo. Lately also a marble head has been found at Rome, corresponding closely in measurement and in style, confirming what is suggested by the statu?, viz., that the original was of bronze. From the bronze statuette it is found that the Apollo Belvidere held forward in his left hand, not a bow as was thought, but the oegis, in the attitude of spreading consternation among an enemy, as he did among the Trojans, and it is usual to adopt as the occasion for the production of this statue the invasion of the Gauls, whom, in 278 b.c., the god drove in alarm from his sanctuary at Delphi. The extraordinary praise bestowed on it by Winckelmann secured for this statue a fame from which the discovery of true Greek sculptures since then has gradually detracted, to this extent, that even its original cannot now be placed in the best period of Greek art.
