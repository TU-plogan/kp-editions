APELLAS, a Greek sculptor, mentioned by Pausanias (vi. 1, 6) as the author of a group at Olympia, representing a quadriga, with the statues of a charioteer and of Cynisca, the sister of Archelaus. This group having been executed to commemorate the chariot victory gained by Cynisca at the Olympic games, 420 E.C., the date of the artist is obtained. A bronze sculptor of the same name, and probably the same person, occurs in Pliny (Nat. Hist., xxxiv. 86).
