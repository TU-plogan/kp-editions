ASGILL, John, an eccentric writer who flourished during part of the 17th and 18th centuries. The exact date of his birth is uncertain. He was bred to the law, and gained considerable reputation, not only by his skill in his profession, but from his first published writings. These consisted of two pamphlets—the first advocating the establishment of some currency other than the usual gold and silver, the second on the registry for titles of lands. His affairs, however, became embarrassed; and in 1699, when a commission was appointed to settle disputed claims in Ireland, he set out for that country, attracted by the hopes of practice. Before leaving London he put in the hands of the printer a tract, entitled An Argument proving that, according to the Covenant of Eternal Life revealed in the Scripture, Alan may be translated from hence into that Eternal Life without passing through Death. The fame of this extraordinary pamphlet, in which Asgill spoke of dying as an unnecessary and foolish custom, preceded the author, and was of material service in securing his professional success. He amassed money, and purchased an estate, which unfortunately involved him in a lengthy litigation. In 1703 he took his seat in the Irish Parliament, but was dismissed after four days on account of his so-called blasphemous pamphlet. In 1705 he sat in the English Parliament for Bramber; but in 1707 he was expelled, nominally on account of his unlucky pamphlet, but really, perhaps, because of his debts. The remainder of his life he spent in the Fleet and King’s Bench prisons, in one of which he died in 1738. He wrote a number of pamphlets on the Pretender and on the Hanoverian succession. Several of his tracts were collected, and published in London, 1715.
