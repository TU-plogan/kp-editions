ARTEMIDORUS, a native of Ephesus, flourished during the reign of Marcus Aurelius. He called himself The Daldian, from Daldia, or Daldis, a small town in Lydia, the birth-place of his mother, in order to distinguish himself from Artemidorus, the geographer, who was likewise a native of Ephesus. The work by which he is known, ’Ονειροκριτικά, the Interpretation of Dreams, is said to have been written by command of Apollo Mystes, who had granted to the author the power of divination. The treatise, which contains some valuable notices on ancient customs and modes of thought, is divided into five books: the first and second, addressed to Cassius Maximus, treat generally of divination by dreams; the third and fourth, addressed to his son, discuss some minor parts of the theory; and the fifth consists of a collection of prophetic dreams which had been realised. Artemidorus boasts of the trouble expended on this work; he read all the authors on the subject, travelled widely, and corresponded or conversed with all who had made dreams their study. He is also [9:2:643] said to have written on Auguries and Chiromancy, but these treatises are not extant. The best editions of his work are those of Reiff, with notes, 2 vols. Leip. 1805, and of Hercher, Leip. 1861. There are several English translations of it.
