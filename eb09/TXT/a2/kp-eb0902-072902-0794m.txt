ASSIDEANS, in Greek Άσιδαίοι, is a transcription of the Hebrew chasîdîm, pious ones, a word frequent in the Psalms (xxxvii. 28, lxxix. 2, <fcc,,—E.V. generally saints'). In the first book of Maccabees the name of Assideans appears as the designation of a society of men zealous for the law (1 Mac. ii. 42, according to the correct text as given by Fritzsche), and closely connected with the scribes (1 Mac. vii. 12,13). It is plain from these passages that this society of “pious ones,” who held fast to the law under the guidance of the scribes in opposition to tho “godless” Hellenising party, was properly a religious, not a political organisation. For a time they joined the revolt against the Seleucids. But the direct identification of the Assideans with the Maccabee party in 2 Mac. xiv. 6 is one of the many false statements of that book, and directly contradictory to the trustworthy narrative of 1 Mac. vii., which shows that they were strictly a religious party, who scrupled to oppose the legitimate high priest even when he was on the Greek side, and who withdrew from the war of freedom as soon as the attempt to interfere with the exercise of the Jewish religion was given up. Under the Asmonean rule the Assideans developed into the better known party of the Pharisees, and assumed new relations to the ruling dynasty. It appears, however, from the Psalter of Solomon that the party continued to affect the title of “pious ones.” Most recent inquirers hold that the Essenes as well as the Pharisees sprung from the Assideans (Ewald’s Geschichte, vol. iv.; Wellhausen, Die Pharisäer und die Sadducder, 1874).
