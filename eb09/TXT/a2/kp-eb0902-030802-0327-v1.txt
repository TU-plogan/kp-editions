ARANDA, Pedro Pablo Abarca y Bolea, Count of, a descendant of a noble family in Aragon, was bom at Saragossa, 21st Sept. 1718. He served for several years in the army, and, after retiring with the rank of lieutenantcolonel, spent some time in travelling through France, Italy, and Prussia. He seems to have fallen under the displeasure of Ferdinand VI., but on the accession of Charles III. in 1759, he was appointed ambassador to the court of Poland, an office which he held for several years. On his return he took the command of the army sent against the Portuguese, and gained some successes. He was then appointed captain-general of Valencia, from which place, two years later, in 1765, he was summoned to Madrid to assist in quelling an insurrection. His success was rewarded by the appointment to the Presidency of the Court of Castile. "While holding this office he induced the king to give his consent to an order for the banishment from Spain of all the Jesuits. His further intention of abolishing the Inquisition was prematurely disclosed, and great indignation was excited against him. He was dismissed from the presidency of the council, and sent as ambassador to Paris. Here he was instrumental in bringing about peace between Spain and Bri tain. The presidency from which Aranda had been dismissed was held for a short time by his political adversary, Grimaldi, who was succeeded by the count of Florida Blanca. On the dismissal of the latter in 1792, Aranda was recalled to his former position, but from it he was again quickly driven by the influence of Godoy, the queen’s favourite. Soon after he obtained permission to retire to his own estates, where he died in 1799.
