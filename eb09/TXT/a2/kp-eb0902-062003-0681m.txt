ARNAULD, Angélique (called Angélique de Saint-Jean), niece of the first or great Angélique, was born in 1624. She was educated at Port-Royal, and took the veil in her twentieth year. In 1653 she was made sub-prioress. During the persecution of the Jansenists, from 1661 to 1664, she was the chief support of the nuns in their resolute refusal to sign the Formulary of Alexander VII. Along with some others she was put into confinement, and, even after permission had been given to return to Port-Royal, they continued to be under the close surveillance of soldiers, who were not withdrawn till 1669, after the “peace” edict of Clement IX. In 1678 Angélique was elected abbess, which office she continued to hold till her death in 1684. She has left several works, in particular the Mémoires pour servir à Vhistoire de Port-Royal, dec. , 3 vols., 1742, which throw much light on the life of her great aunt. See Arnauld, Jacqueline Marie.
