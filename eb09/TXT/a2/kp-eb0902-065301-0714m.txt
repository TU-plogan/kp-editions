ARTICHOKE. The common artichoke, Cynara Scoly-mus, is a plant belonging to the Natural Order Composite, having some resemblance to a large thistle. It has long been esteemed as a culinary vegetable; the parts chiefly employed being the immature receptacle or floret disk, with the lower part of the surrounding leaf-scales, which are known as “artichoke bottoms.” In Italy the receptacles, dried, are largely used in soups; those of the cultivated plant as Carciofo domestico, and of the wild variety as Carciofo spinoso. The Jerusalem artichoke, Helianthus tuberosus, is a distinct plant belonging to the same order, cultivated for its root-tubers, which somewhat resemble potatoes, for which they have been proposed as a substitute. It closely resembles the sunflower, and its popular name is a corruption of the Italian Girasole Articocco, the sunflower artichoke.
