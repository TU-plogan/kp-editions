ARENDAL, a sea-port town of Norway on the Skagerrack, 35 miles north-east of Christiansand. It is built at the mouth of tho river Nidelf, on a number of small islands and rocks, the houses in many places being erected on piles. From its situation, and the number of canals by which it is traversed, it has acquired the name of Little Venice. There is a considerable shipping trade, particularly in iron and timber; and ship-building, distillation, and iron-mining are carried on. The neighbourhood is remarkable for the number of beautiful and rare minerals found there; one of these, a variety of epidote, was formerly called Arendalite. Louis Philippe lived here a long time during his exile. Population in 1855, 4456; in 1865, 5800.
