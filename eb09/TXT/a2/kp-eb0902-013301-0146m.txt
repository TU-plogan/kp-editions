ANTIOCH in Pisidia, another of the many cities founded by Seleucus Nicator, was situated on the south side of the range of mountains between Phrygia and Pisidia. Its remains, which were identified by Arundel in 1833, are close to the modern Yalobatch, in lat. 38 a 18'N., and long. 31° 23' E., and include the ruins of several temples, a theatre, and a magnificent aqueduct. It was against the Jewish inhabitants of this Antioch that Paul and Barnabas “shook off the dust of their feet” (Acts xiii 51).
