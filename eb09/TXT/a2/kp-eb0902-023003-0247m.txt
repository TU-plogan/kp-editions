AQUILA, Caspar, the Latin name of Kaspar Adler, a celebrated German theologian who espoused the cause of the Reformation. He was born at Augsburg in 1488; and after studying there as well as at Berne and Leipsic, and for several years in Italy, he was appointed pastor of Jenga, a village near Augsburg. Here he embraced the doctrines of Luther; but his boldness and zeal in the cause of the reformed faith led the bishop of Augsburg to order his arrest. Aquila passed the winter of 1519-1520 in the prison of Dillingen, and was only liberated through the influence of Isabella of Denmark, sister of the emperor Charles V. From Dillingen he w ent to Wittenberg, where he became personally acquainted with Luther; and thence he went as tutor to the family of Franz von Sickingen, in the castle of Ebernburg. After a short stay at Eisenach, Aquila was appointed professor of Hebrew at Wittenberg, where he rendered valuable assistance to his colleague Luther in his translation of the Old Testament. In 1527 he became pastor, and the following year Protestant bishop at Saalfeld; but his vehement opposition to the Interim of Charles V. in 1548, obliged him to flee from the place, and accept the offer from the countess of Schwarzburg of a temporary asylum in her castle of Rudolfstadt. He was appointed to the deanery of Schmalkalden in 1550, and restored two years after to his office at Saalfeld, where, without further molestation, he continued to discharge his duties till his death, 12th November 1560. The writings he has left are chiefly sermons and controversial works.
