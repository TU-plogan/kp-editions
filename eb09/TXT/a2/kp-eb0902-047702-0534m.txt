ARCIS-SUR-AUBE, the chief town of the arrondissement of the same name, in the department of Aube, in France, is situated, in long. 4° 9' E., lat. 48° 3Γ N., about 17 miles (28 kilometres) N. of Troyes, on the left bank of the river, just at the point where it becomes navigable. It is mentioned in the Itinerary of Antoninus; but successive fires (171.9, 1727, and 1814) have destroyed the ancient buildings, and it is now a town built in modern style, with wide and regular streets. An old castle, where Brune-haut and afterwards Diaua of Poitiers resided, looks down on it from a height, the only other building· of interest being the church, which dates from the 16th century. A battle was fought here on the 20th and 21st of March 1814 between Napoleon and the Austro-Russian army under Schwarzenberg, which led the former to retire upon Vitry, leaving the way open to Paris. There are important hosier)' manufactures in the town, and it carries on a large trade in grain and coal, besides being an emporium for the wooden wares of the Vosges. Arcis-sur-Aube is on the highway between Troyes and Chalons-sur-Marne, and by means of the Aube it has intercourse with Paris. It is a subprefecture, and in 1872 had a population of 2845. i F
