ANGORNO, or Ngornu, a town of Bornu, in Central Africa, near the south-west shore of Lake Chad, from which it is separated by a level plain that is often under water. It is said to have a population of 30,000, which is much increased during the markets, when a large traffic is carried on in cotton, amber, metals, corals, and slaves.
