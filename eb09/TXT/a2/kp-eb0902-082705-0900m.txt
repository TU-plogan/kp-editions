ATH, or Aeth, a city of Belgium, in the province of Hainaut, situated on the river Dender, a navigable confluent of the Schelde, rather more than 30 miles by rail from Brussels. It is well built, and possesses a parish church (St Julianâ€™s), dating originally from 1393, and remarkable for the height of its spire; a college, founded in 1416; a town-house, erected about 1600; an orphan asylum, a theatre, <fcc. The oldest building in the city is the Tour du Barbant, which dates from 1150. The population, numbering about 8300, is variously employed in the manufacture of linen, lace, cotton, soap, sugar, salt, beer, gin, dyes, trinkets, <kc. Ath was a place of importance in the 13th and 14th centuries, and was afterwards fortified by the Spaniards. It was besieged and captured by Louis XIV. in 1666, restored to the Spaniards in 1679, recaptured by the French under Catinat in 1697, and fortified by Vauban, but again given up by the treaty of Ryswick in the same year. In 1706 it fell into the hands of the allies, but was restored to the empire in 1716. It was captured by the French under Banderon in 1745, and dismantled and restored by Maria Theresa in 1748. Its fortifications were again destroyed in 1781, rebuilt in 1815, and finally demolished in 1830.
