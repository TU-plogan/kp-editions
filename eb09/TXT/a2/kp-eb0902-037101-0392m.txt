ARCHELAUS, a Greek philosopher, was a native most probably of Athens, though some say he was born at Miletus. Nothing is known of his life, but as he was a pupil of Anaxagoras, he must have lived about 450 B.c. By several writers he is said to have been the teacher of Socrates, but this report has no support from Plato, Aristotle, or Xenophon, and probably has no foundation save the wish to connect Socrates closely with preceding philosophy. So far as the opinions of Archelaus are known, he seems to have followed with some deviations his master, Anaxagoras. With him he admitted a primitive matter, consisting of infinite particles similar in nature to the bodies formed from them. He further admitted a ruling mind; but he attempted to overcome the dualism of Anaxagoras, and in so doing, more nearly approached the older Ionic physical philosophers. He thought that matter was mingled with mind, and identified the primitive matter with air. His first principle was thus air endowed with mind. Out of this air, by the processes of thickening and thinning, arose cold and warm, or water and fire, the one passive, the other active. From the action of fire on water are formed the atmosphere and the mud, out of which the earth and the heavenly bodies are developed. Living, organised beings, at first of a low type, spring out of this mud, and gradually the races of animals are formed. Man is superior to other beings by his moral and artistic powers. To Archelaus are attributed some ethical doctrines, such as, that right and wrong are not by nature but by custom. This is a well-known proposition of his contemporaries, the Sophists, and in all probability it is attributed to Archelaus erroneously. Ethical teaching was no doubt ascribed to him merely to explain the completely ethical character of the philosophy of his supposed pupfl Socrates. No fragments of â€˜ Archelaus remain; his doctrines have to be extracted from Diogenes Laertius, Simplicius, Plutarch, and Hippolytus.
