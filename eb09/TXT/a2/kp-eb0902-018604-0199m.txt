APOLLODORUS (60-130 a.d.), an architect, born at Damascus, a favourite of Trajan, for whom he constructed the stone bridge over the Danube(104 a.d.), which was esteemed the most magnificent of all the works of that emperor. He also planned a gymnasium, a college, public baths, the Odeum, and the Forum Trajanum, within the city of Rome; and the triumphal arches at Beneventum and Ancona-The Trajan column in the centre of the Forum is celebrated as being the first triumphal monument of the kind, and the model of many others in different cities, as Paris, London, St Petersburg, <tc. On the elevation of Hadrian to the throne, Apollodorus was banished from Rome, and shortly afterwards, being charged with imaginary crimes, was put to death (Dion Cassius, lxix.)
