ARTE VELDE, Jacob van, a celebrated Fleι∆ish popular leader in the 14th century, was a brewer in Ghent. His enormous wealth, great eloquence, and general talent for administration, easily made him the most prominent and powerful man on the side of the citizens in their struggle against the encroachments of Count Louis of Flanders. The people of Ghent gave him the command of their forces, and he banished from the town all the nobles and adherents of the count. In 1335 he made a commercial treaty with Edward III. of England, and with the aid of some English troops expelled Louis from Flanders. Ten years later, in 1345, after having persuaded Edward to assume the title of king of France, and induced the Flemings to [9:2:647] support the claim, he thought to cement the alliance by making the Black Prince count of Flanders. This proposal was badly received by a large body of the people of Ghent, who were dissatisfied with their leader’s somewhat arbitrary government. A popular tumult broke out with its usual impulsiveness, and Artevelde was slain.
