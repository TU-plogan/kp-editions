ARGYLL, Earls and Dukes of. The rise of this family of Scottish peers, originally the Campbells of Lochow, first ennobled as Barons Campbell, and still retaining the family name Campbell, is referred to in the article Argyllshire (g , .v.)

Archibald, the eighth earl and first marquis, was born in the year 1598, and educated in the principles of the Reformation, of which his ancestors had been zealous promoters. His father, however, renounced Protestantism, whereupon the young earl was put in possession of his patrimonial estates by order of Government, and quickly promoted to places of trust and power. From the commencement of his political career he espoused the cause of the Presbyterian party, and defended the Covenanters when summoned to London to give his opinion of their proceedings before the king. In 1638 he remained with the General Assembly after it had been dissolved by the king’s commissioner, and with other nobility and gentry signed the Solemn League and Covenant. Having thus openly committed himself to the Presbyterian cause, he became its recognised leader both in political negotiations and in the field. He was created a marquis during the king’s visit to Scotland in 1641. This mark of favour, intended probably to conciliate a powerful subject, did not prevent Argyll from leading an army against the royal troops in 1644. The campaign ended in his signal defeat by Montrose at Inverlochy on the 1st February 1645. In 1651 he placed the crown on the head of King Charles II. at Scone, having, like the rest of his party, been alienated from the republicans of England by the execution of Charles I. Having gone to London at the Restoration in 1660, he was arrested and thrown into prison. In the following year he was tried at Edinburgh for high treason, and, principally on ground of alleged treasonable correspondence with Monk, he was condemned to death, and executed on the 25 th of May, dying with great firmness and calmness. He was the author of Instructions to a Son, and Maxims of State (1661).

Archibald, the ninth earl, son of the preceding, from his youth distinguished himself by his loyalty and attachment to the royal family. Though his father headed the Covenanters, he attached himself to the king’s party. On the establishment of the Commonwealth he was committed to prison, and was jealously watched till the Restoration, when the king remitted his father’s forfeiture, and created him earl of Argyll. He continued in high favour with the king and court till the passing of the Test Act in 1681, when, by opposing the exemption of princes of the blood from the oath, he drew down on himself the indignation of the duke of York. When called to take the test, Argyll refused, except with an explanation, which he believed to have been approved by the duke, to the effect that he took it only so far as it was consistent with itself and with the Protestant religion. The duke accepted the qualification, and Argyll was admitted to sit in council; but a few days afterwards he was committed to prison, and indicted for high treason. On being tried, three judges did not scruple to convict him of treason; a jury of fifteen noblemen gave a verdict against him; and the king ordered sentence to be pronounced, but the execution of it suspended till further orders. Argyll, however, seeing no reason to trust to the justice or mercy of his enemies, made his escape from prison, and concealed himself for some time in London, afterwards escaping to Holland, where he remained during the remaining part of the reign of Charles II. On the accession of James II. he took part in the rising of the duke of Monmouth, and returned to Scotland to command the forces raised there; but after a few unsuccessful skirmishes he was taken prisoner and carried to Edinburgh, where he was beheaded on his former sentence, June 30, 1685, submitting to death with heroic firmness.

Archibald, the first duke, son of the preceding, was an active promoter of the Revolution. He came over with the Prince of Orange, and was admitted into the Convention as earl of Argyll, though his father’s attainder had not been reversed. Having been deputed, along with Sir James Montgomery and Sir John Dalrymple, to present the crown in name of the Scottish Convention to the Prince of Orange, and to tender to him the coronation oath, he was admitted a member of the Privy Council, and, in 1690, made one of the lords of the Treasury. In 1701 he was created duke of Argyll. He died in 1703.

John, the second duke (also duke of Greenwich), son of the preceding, was born on the 10th October 1678. He entered the army in 1694, and in 1701 was promoted to the command of a regiment. On the death of his father in 1703, he was appointed a member of the Privy Council, and at the same time captain of the Scotch horse guards, and one of the extraordinary lords of Session. In return for his services in promoting the Union, he was created a peer of England, by the titles of baron of Chatham and earl of Greenwich, and in 1710 was made a knight of the Garter. He first distinguished himself in a military capacity at the battle of Oudenarde, where he commanded as brigadier-general; and was afterwards present under the duke of Marlborough at the sieges of Lisle, Ghent, Bruges, and Tournay, and did good service at the battle of Mal-plaquet in 1709. Soon after this action he was sent to take the command in Spain; but being seized with a violent fever at Barcelona, and disappointed of supplies from home, he returned to England. Having a seat in the House of Lords, he censured the measures of the ministry with such freedom that all his places were disposed of to other noblemen; but at the accession of George I. he recovered his influence. On the breaking out of the Rebellion in 1715 he was appointed commander-iι «chief of the forces in North Britain, and was principally instrumental in effecting the total extinction of the rebellion in Scotland without much bloodshed. He arrived in London early in March 1716, and at first stood high in the favour of the king, but in a few months was stripped of his offices. This disgrace, however, did not deter him from the discharge of his parliamentary duties; he supported the bill for the impeachment of Bishop Atterbury, and lent his aid to his countrymen by opposing the bill for punishing the city of Edinburgh for the Porteous riot. In the beginning of the year 1719 he was again admitted into favour, appointed lord-steward of the household, and, in April following, created duke of Greenwich. He continued in the administration during the remaining part of that reign, and, after the accession of George II., till April 1740, when a violent speech against the Government led again to his dismissal from office. He was soon restored, however, on a change of the ministry, but disapproving of the measures of the new administration, he finally resigned all his posts, and spent the rest of his life in privacy and retirement. He died on the 3d September 1743. A monument, executed by [9:2:499] Roubiliac, has been erected to his memory in Westminster Abbey.

Archibald, the third duke, brother of the preceding, was born at Ham House in Surrey, in June 1682. On his father being created a duke, he joined the army, and served for a short time under the duke of Marlborough. In 1705 he was appointed treasurer of Scotland, and in the following year was one of the commissioners for treating of the Union; on the consummation of which, having been raised to the peerage of Scotland as earl of Islay, he was chosen one of the sixteen peers for Scotland in the first parliament of Great Britain. In 1711 he was called to the Privy Council, and commanded the royal army at the battle of 'Sheriffmuir in 1715. He was appointed keeper of the privy seal in 1725, and was afterwards intrusted with the principal management of Scottish affairs. In 1734 he was made keeper of the great seal, an office which he held till his death. He succeeded to the dukedom in 1743. The duke was eminent not only for his political abilities, but foi his literary accomplishments, and had collected one of the most valuable private libraries in Great Britain. He died suddenly on the 15th of April 1761.
