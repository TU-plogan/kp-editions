ANGRA, a city on the south coast of Terceira, one of the Azores, the capital of the island and of one of the three civil districts into which the Azores are divided, as well as the residence of the military governor of the whole group, and of the Roman Catholic bishops. It is a well-built, strongly fortified town, containing an arsenal for the Portuguese royal navy, a cathedral, and several churches, monasteries, and nunneries. The harbour is sheltered on the west and south-west by the promontory of Mount Brazil, and if this natural protection were supplemented by a breakwater on the south-east, the town would possess a secure and commodious anchorage; as it is, vessels during certain seasons are safer in the open sea. The chief exports are wine and grain; but foreign trade is not large. Population, 11,281.
