ARTICULATA, the name given by Cuvier to his third great division of the animal kingdom. Arthropoda is the designation now generally adopted, which includes the Crustacea, Arachnida, Myriapoda, and Insecta, but excludes the Annelida, which Cuvier classed with these among the Articulata. See Arthropoda.
