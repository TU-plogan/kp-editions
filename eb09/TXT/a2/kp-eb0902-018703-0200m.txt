APOLLONIUS, a Greek epic poet, surnamed Rhodius, from his long residence in Rhodes, though he is supposed to have been a native of Alexandria. He is known to us as the author of the Argonautica, a poem which he began while in youth, studying under the poet Callimachus. His master is supposed to have slighted the production of the youthful Apollonius, and their connection ended in the most violent enmity, though we are ignorant of the particulars of their quarrel. The disappointed youth retired to Rhodes, where he is conjectured to have polished and completed his work, supporting himself by the profession of rhetoric, and receiving from the Rhodians the freedom of their city. He was at length recalled to Alexandria to succeed Eratosthenes in the care of the great library about 194 b.c., in the reign of Ptolemy Euergetes, who had been educated by Aristarchus, and rivalled his predecessors in the munificent encouragement he gave to learning. The only extant work of Apollonius is his poem above mentioned, in four books, on the Argonautic expedition. Both Longinus and Quintilian have assigned to this work the mortifying character of mediocrity. It was first printed at Florence in 1496, with the ancient Greek Scholia, in a 4to volume, now exceedingly rare. An excellent edition was published by Brunck in 1780, and another by Beck, in 1797; but the best is that of Professor Schafer (Leipsic, 2 vols. 8vo, 1810-13). The poem was translated into English verse by Fawkes and Green in 1780; another translation in English verse, with critical notes, was published by W. Preston in 1803.
