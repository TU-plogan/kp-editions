ANTONINUS, Wall of, called Graham’s Dyke by the natives of the district through which it passed, is the name given by historians to that series of defensive posts, connected by a rampart and a wall, which at one time extended across the island from the Frith of Clyde on the west to the Frith of Forth on the east. The former of these appellations it has received from the Roman emperor in whose reign it was erected; the origin of the latter is more doubtful, a probable opinion being that which regards it as a corruption of the Celtic greim, a place of strength, and diog, a trench or rampart.

We are informed by Tacitus that Agricola, during his fourth summer in Britain (81 a.d.), occupied himself in consolidating his previous conquests, and that for this purpose he caused a series of detached forts to be built on the isthmus that joins the two friths as a barrier against the still unconquered Caledonians of the north. It was along, or almost along, the same line, that one of his successors in the command of the Roman troops in Britain raised the more permanent military work known as Antonine’s wall.

The writer of the life of the emperor Antoninus Pius in the Historice Augustee Scriptores Sex, usually supposed to have been Julius Capitolinus, expressly states that Lollius Urbicus, a legate of that emperor, erected, after several victories over the Britons, “another rampart of turf” to check their inroads. No locality is specified, but a fragment of a stone, now in the museum of the university of Glasgow, has an inscription in which the name of this Lollius seems to occur. This fragment, and the numerous monumental records bearing the name of Antonine that have been discovered along its course, identify beyond all reasonable doubt the wall between the Forth and Clyde as that spoken of by the annalist, and furnish satisfactory proof of the correctness of its best-known name. And if a small pillar figured by Gordon, and at one time in the library of the university of Edinburgh, was found, as is probable, near the wall, it fixes the year 140 a.d. as the [9:2:140] exact date at which the portion of the work connected with the pillar was executed.

In addition to the annalist just mentioned, several other ancient historians are supposed to allude to Antonine’s wall; but their brief statements are so vague that further reference to what they say is unnecessary. Of mediaeval writers Bede is almost the only one who notices it, but he erroneously ascribes its erection to the natives of the south acting according to advice given them by the Romans. Timothy Pont, who early in the 16th century personally surveyed a large portion of Scotland while gathering materials for his projected Scottish Atlas, drew the attention of antiquaries to this memorial of Roman times, though to him, as well as to his successors in antiquarian research for nearly a century, it was known as “Agricola’s vallum, or Graham’s Dike.” It is to Gordon that the merit must be awarded of having been the first to give to the world a satisfactory account of the “wall of Antoninus Pius.” A chapter of the Itinerarium, Septentrionale is devoted to it, and plans are given of the principal forts, as well as engravings of the legionary tablets and other objects of interest that had, up to the author’s day, been dug out of its ruins. Gordon was followed by Horsley and Roy, the latter of whom made in 1755 a new survey of it, which enabled him to correct Gordon in some particulars. Lastly, in the Caledonia Romana of Stuart, we have a complete and, on the whole, accurate description of the wall, with figures of all the sculptured stones found near its course up to the date at which he wrote.

The nature and appearance of the wall when perfect have been described by all these writers in very similar terms, though they differ somewhat as to the. measurement of its several parts. “It consisted,” says Stuart, “in the first place, of an immense fosse or ditch—averaging about 40 feet in width, by some 20 in depth — which extended over hill and plain in one unbroken line from sea to sea. Behind this ditch on its southern side, and within a few feet of its edge, was raised a rampart of intermingled stone and earth, strengthened by sods of turf, which measured, it is supposed, about 20 feet in height, and 24 in thickness at the base. This rampart was surmounted by a parapet, behind which ran a level platform for the accommodation of its defenders. To the southward of the whole was situated the military way—a regular causewayed road about 20 feet wide—which kept by the course of the wall at irregular distances, approaching in some places to within a few yards, and in others receding to a considerable extent.” Along the entire line there were at least eighteen principal stations or forts, with smaller watchtowers in the intervening spaces. The rampart seems to have consisted for the most part of earth or turf, as stated by the annalist; but stone was, no doubt, employed in the building of the forts and watchtowers as well as in certain portions of the rampart itself.

Although in many parts of its course all traces of Antonine’s wall have long been obliterated, the line along which it stretched has been mapped out by Gordon and others with sufficient accuracy. Commencing in the west on a height called Chapel Hill, near the village of Old Kilpatrick in Dumbartonshire, and now distant from the River Clyde about 150 yards, it ran eastwards, passing in succession Kirkintilloch, Croy, Castlecary, and Falkirk, and terminated at Bridgeness, a rocky promontory that projects into the Frith of Forth south of Borrowstounness in Linlithgowshire. Its eastern termination was long supposed to have been near the kirk of Carriden. In 1869, however, a sculptured legionary tablet, since deposited in the museum of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland, was found at Bridgeness, in such a position that it is impossible to avoid the conclusion that the wall actually terminated there. Its entire length may be set down at about 36 English miles.

Of the sculptures found near or on the site of this wall a considerable number are records of the different portions of the work executed by the legionaries employed on it, and who mainly belonged to the second, sixth, and twentieth legions. Some of these tablets are in the museum of the university of Glasgow, and are of much interest, but the finest of them all is the Bridgeness one already referred to. From the number of Roman paces mentioned on the inscriptions, Horsley and others have attempted to determine the exact length of the work. Unfortunately for their purpose, the paces on the stones already discovered considerably exceed its w hole length, and as we cannot suppose that all the monuments of this kind that were erected by the legionaries have been preserved and brought to light, we must conclude with Stuart that they had raised more than one memorial of the same piece of work.

How many years Antonine’s wall continued to be the boundary of the Roman territories in Britain it is impossible to say, but there is every reason for believing that it was so for only a brief period.
