ARCHILOCHUS, one of the first Greek lyric poets, was born at Paros, one of the Cyclades. The date of his birth is uncertain, but he flourished between 720 and 680 b.c. His father, Telesicles, was of noble family, and had been selected to consult the Delphic oracle relative to sending out a colony from Paros. His mother, Enipo, was a slave. While still young, Archilochus gained a prize for a hymn to Demeter; he soon after left Paros and proceeded to Thasos, according to some authorities, as leader of a colony. But his chief reasons for leaving his native place seem to have been personal disappointment and disgust. Lycambes had promised him his daughter Neobule in marriage, and had afterwards withdrawn his consent. Archilochus, taking advantage of the licence allowed at the feasts of Ceres, poured out his wounded feelings in verses of unmerciful satire. Lycambes he accused of perjury, and his daughters of leading the most abandoned lives. Such was the effect produced by his verses, that Lycambes and his daughters are said to have hanged themselves. The satire was written in iambics, a measure introduced for tho first time, and from its structure admirably adapted for light sarcastic poetry. At Thasos the poet passed some unhappy years, and incurred the great dishonour of throwing away his shield and fleeing from the field of battle. He does not seem to have felt the disgrace very keenly, for, like Alcaeus and Horace, he commemorates the event in his verses. After leaving Thasos he is said to have visited Sparta, but to have been at once banished from that city on account of his cowardice. His works, owing to their licentious character, were also prohibited by the Spartans. He next visited Siris, in lower Italy, a city of which he speaks very favourably. He then returned to his native place, and was slain in a battle against the Naxians by one Calondas or Corax, who was cursed by the oracle for having slain a servant of the Muses.

The writings of Archilochus consisted of elegies, hymns, —one of which used to be sung by the victors in tho Olympic games,—and of poems in the iambic and trochaic measures. To him certainly we owe the invention of iambic poetry and its application to the purposes of satire. The only previous measures in Greek poetry had been the epic hexameter, and its offshoot the elegiac metre; but the slow measured structure of hexameter verse was utterly unsuited to express the quick, light motions of satire. Archilochus made use of the iambus and the trochee, and organised them into the two forms of metre known as the iambic trimeter and the trochaic tetrameter. The trochaic metre he generally used for subjects of a serious nature; the iambic for satires. He was also the first to make use of the arrangement of verses called the epode. Horace in his metres to a great extent follows Archüochus. All ancient authorities unite in praising the poems of Archilochus, in terms which appear to be somewhat exaggerated. His verses seem certainly to have possessed strength, flexibility, nervous vigour, and, beyond everything else, impetuous vehemence and energy. Horace speaks of the “rage” of Archilochus, and Hadrian calls his verses “raging iambics.” By his countrymen[9:2:380] he was reverenced as the equal of Homer, and statues of these two poets were dedicated on the same day. The fragments of Archilochus are to be found in the collections of smaller Greek poets by Jacobs, Bergk, and Gaisford, and have been published separately by Liebel, Archilochi Reliquioe, Leipsic, 1812, 1818.
