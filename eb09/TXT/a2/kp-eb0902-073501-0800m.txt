AST, George Anthony Frederick, a German philosopher and philologist of considerable distinction, was born at Gotha in 1778. He was educated at the gymnasium of that town, and afterwards at the university of Jena. He distinguished himself as a student, and in 1802 he became a privat-docent in his alma mater. Three years later he was appointed professor of classical literature in the university of Landshut, where he remained until 1826. when that institution was transferred to Munich. In this latter city he spent the rest of his life. In recognition of his services as a teacher and author he was made an aulic councillor, and a member of the Bavarian Academy of Sciences. He died on the 30th of December 1841. Ast was an independent although not an original thinker. He was more of a scholar and critic than a philosopher. He belonged to the school of Schelling, but was ready to welcome truths from the most diverse quarters. His writings on aesthetics,— System der Kunstlehre (1805) and Grundriss der Aesthetik (1807),—although containing no distinctively new thoughts, had the merit not only of combining and elaborating the principles of Schelling on beauty and art, but of supplementing them to some extent by the views of Winckelmann, Lessing, Kant, Herder, Schiller, Jean Paul, and others, on these subjects. His Grundlinien der Philosophie, published in 1807, was republished in 1809, but soon after sank into oblivion. His Grundriss einer Geschichte der Philosophie, also published in 1807, was longer lived, and deservedly. It was the best book of the kind which the Schelling school could show, at least until the publication of Rixner’s Manual, fifteen years later. It is among the earliest of the works pervaded by the thought, so familiar now but so fresh then, that the history of philosophy is not a history of opinions, but the history of reason, the several philosophies being only stages in the development of the one true philosophy, the gradually self-revealing absolute reason. It is also among the earliest attempts to “construe” the history of philosophy and to formulate its law of movement. The author published a second edition of it in 1825, and Hauptmomente der Geschichte der Philosophie in 1829. In two works, both published in 1808, he sought to determine and expound the principles of the chief divisions of the study in which he was strongest. They are his Grundlinien der Philologie and Grundlinien der Grammatik, Hermeneutik, und Kritik. Both have been commended by competent judges. His reputation as a philologist, however, rests mainly on the vast and toilsome labours on Plato, which occupied the last twenty-five years of his life. His Platon’s Leben und Schriften, published in 1816, is the earliest of those elaborate critical inquiries regarding the life of Plato, the authenticity of the works which have come down to us under his name, the order of their composition, their purpose, plan, &c., which may be regarded as having had their proximate cause in the celebrated Introductions of Schleiermacher, and their primary cause in the historical scepticism of Niebuhr and Wolf. He allows scarcely any weight to the ancient biographies and traditions; but, taking a few of the finest dialogues as standards, he draws from them the criteria in virtue of which he accepts or rejects the others. He pronounces spurious not only those compositions which are generally admitted to be so,—the Epinomis, Minos, Theages, Erastae, Clitopho, Hipparchus, Eryxias, the Letters and Definitions, but also the Meno, Euthydemus, Charmides, Lysis, Laches, the First and Second Alcibiades, Hippias Major and Minor, the Ion, Euthyphron, Apology, Crito, and even, in defiance of the explicit testimony of Aristotle, the Laws. He arranges the dialogues, which he admits to be genuine, into three series; the group which he regards as the earliest in date of composition, and which he describes as characterised by the predominance of the poetical and dramatical element, consists of the Protagoras, Phoedrus, Gorgias, and Phoedo ; the second, distinguished by the marked prominence of dialectic keenness and subtility, comprises the Theaetetus, Sophist, Statesman, Parmenides, and Cratylus; while the third, displaying the dialectical and poetical qualities of Plato’s mind in interpenetration and harmony, includes the Philebus, Banquet, liepublic, Timaeus, and Critias. This book was followed by a complete edition of Plato’s works (1819-32) in 11 vols., with a Latin translation, and a learned commentary, which occupies the last two volumes. Professor Ast crowned these laboura by his Lexicon Platonicum (1834-9), in 3 vols., one of the most comprehensive and valuable of special dictionaries. He wrote various other works of less importance than those which have been mentioned. (r. f.)
