He was some time a student of Lincoln College, Oxford, and removed from thence to the Inner Temple, where he applied himself diligently to the study of the law, and became a barrister. In 1582 he was made lord chief-justice·of the common pleas, and in the year following was knighted. He was one of the commissioners appointed to try Queen Mary of Scotland in 1586. His works are—1. Reports of many principal Cases argued and adjudged in the time of Queen Elizabeth in the Common Bench, Lond. 1644, fol.; 2.
