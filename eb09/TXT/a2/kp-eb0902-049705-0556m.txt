ARGUIN, an island, perhaps Hanno’s Cerne, off the west coast of Africa, in lat. 20° 25' N., long. 16° 37' W. It produces gum-arabic, and is the seat of a turtle [9:2:498] fishery. There are two fairs held every year. Off the island, which was discovered by the Portuguese in 1452, are extensive and very dangerous reefs. There is a town of the same name on the neighbouring coast.
