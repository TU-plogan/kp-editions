APPIA VIA, the most celebrated of the ancient Roman roads, connecting the capital with Brundusium. It was commenced by Appius Claudius Caecus (312 B.C.), who carried it from the Porta Capena to Capua (Livy, ix. 29). Its extension to Beneventum, and ultimately to Brundusium, making its total length about 350 miles, was completed before 30 b.c. The pavement, which rested upon several prepared substrata, was formed by large blocks of hard stone (silex) fitted to each other with great exactness. Its breadth was from 14 to 18 feet, excluding the footpaths. The course of the Appian Way is described by Horace, and Statius calls it the Queen of Roads (Regina Viarum). From a statement in Procopinus, it appears that the road was in perfect repair in his time (500-565).
