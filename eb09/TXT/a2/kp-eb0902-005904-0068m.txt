ANNA, Ana, or Anah, a town of Turkey in Asia, situated on the right bank of the Euphrates, about 160 miles N.W. of Baghdad. It is an open, defenceless place, consisting chiefly of a single street, which extends for several miles along a narrow strip of land that lies between the river and a ridge of rocky hills. The houses are separated from each other by beautiful and fertile gardens filled with fruit trees, and in the river, facing the town, is a succession of equally productive islands. The most easterly of these islands contains the ruins of the old castle, while the remains of the ancient Anatho extend from this island for about two miles down the left bank of the Euphrates. Coarse cloth is almost the only manufacture at Anna.
