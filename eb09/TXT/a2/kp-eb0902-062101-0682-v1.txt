ARNAULD, Jacqueline Marie (better known by her religious name, Marie Angélique de Ste Magdeleine), born. 8th September 1591, was the second daughter of Antoine Arnauld, the celebrated advocate. She was early destined for the church, and assumed the dress of a novice in 1599. By concealing her age from the Pope, her father obtained a bull nominating her abbess of Port-Royal when she was little more than eleven years old. For some time after entering on office she spent a purely secular life, performing the needful religious exercises, but taking little or no [9:2:622] interest in them, and gradually acquiring an intense dislike to the profession she had adopted. At last, in 1608, a sermon preached in the convent chapel produced a great change in her mind. She now saw that her true duty and happiness lay in the work of the convent; she inflicted on herself severe penances, persuaded the nuns to adhere rigorously to their vow of poverty, and excluded even her own relatives from the cloister precincts. The fame of the reformation wrought by her earnestness spread abroad, and when Mme. d’Estrées, abbess of Maubuisson, was, on account of her gross misconduct, removed and sent into confinement among the Filles Pénitentes at Paris, Angélique was appointed to take charge of the convent. From this she was forcibly ejected by Mme. d’Estrées, and had to be reinstated by a body of the royal archers. For five years she laboured in Maubuisson, and wrought a considerable change in the state of the convent. In 1623 she returned to Port-Royal, and three years later, as their accommodation became too limited for their numbers, the community removed to the house known as Port-Royal de Paris. Here Angélique accomplished what she had long desired; she was allowed to resign her dignity as abbess, the office was made triennial, and the occupants of it were elected by the nuns. From 1633 to 1636 she acted as superior of a religious community newly instituted in Paris, and then returned, as prioress, to Port-Royal, where her sister Agnes had been elected abbess. In 1648 she, with a few companions, went back to Port-Royal des Champs, and there had opportunities for showing much kindness to the poor, who were oppressed by the disastrous civil wars. Angélique died in 1661, just before the great storm of persecution broke over Port-Royal. Materials for her life are to be found in the general histories of Port-Royal, and in the works of the younger Angélique. A very full memoir of her is given in Miss Frances Martin’s work, Angelique Arnauld, Macmillan, 1873.
