ASTER, a genus of composite plants (Compositae), found largely in North America, and scattered sparingly over Asia, Europe, and South America. They are usually perennial, and their flowers are arranged in numerous heads (capitula). Asters receive the name of Michaelmas and Christmas daisies, because they have heads like daisies, and, when the weather is mild, they flower up to these periods of the year. They are, consequently, valuable plants in a garden. The only British species is Aster Tripolium, found abundantly in saline marshes near the sea. One of the species (Aster alpinus) grows at a considerable height on the mountains of Europe. Some [9:2:736] of them, such as Aster spectabilis of North America, are very showy. The plant called the Cape Aster is Agathaea amelloides, while the China aster is Callistephus chinensis. Both these plants belong also to the Natural Order Compositae. A variety of the Chinese aster, having beautifully coloured florets of rose, violet, and white, is called Reine Marguerite by gardeners.
