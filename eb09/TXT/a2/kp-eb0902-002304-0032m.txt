ANDRONICUS of Rhodes, the eleventh scholarch of the Peripatetics, lived about b.c. 7Ö. His chief work was the arrangement of the writings of Aristotle, the materials for which had been supplied to him by Tyrannion. Besides arranging the works, he seems to have written paraphrases and commentaries, none of which have come down to us. Two writings under the name Andronicus are sometimes erroneously attributed to him, one on the Emotions, the other a commentary on Aristotle’s Ethics.
