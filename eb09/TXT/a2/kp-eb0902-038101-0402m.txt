ARCHIMEDES, Screw of, a machine for raising water, said to have been invented by Archimedes, for the purpose of removing water from the hold of a large ship that had been built by King Hiero. It consists of a watertight cylinder, enclosing a chamber walled off by spiral divisions running from end to end, inclined to the horizon, with its lower open end placed in the water to be raised. A section of it is shown in the accompanying woodcut. The water, while occupying the lowest portion in each successive division of the spiral chamber, is lifted mechanically by the turning of the machine. Another form of the screw has the spiral revolving free in a fixed cylinder, but neither of the machines is now much used.
