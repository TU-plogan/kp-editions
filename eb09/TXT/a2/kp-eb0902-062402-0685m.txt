ARNIM, or Arnheim, Johan Georg Baron von, one of the most distinguished men during the period of the Thirty Years’ War, both as a general and as a diplomatist, was born in 1586, at Boitzenburg, in the province of Brandenburg. He entered the Swedish army, and served under Gustavus Adolphus. In 1626 he, though a Protestant, was induced by Wallenstein to join the imperial army. He gained great distinction by his military and diplomatic talents, and became the close friend and faithful ally of Wallenstein. After the dismissal of the latter from his command in 1630, Arnim went over to the elector of Saxony, and, at the battle of Leipsic, led the left wing of the united Saxon and Swedish armies. But he disliked the Swedes, who distrusted him; and it was mainly by his influence that the elector detached his forces from Gustavus Adolphus, and that at the peace of Prague the Saxons seceded from their alliance with Sweden. In 1632 Wallenstein, who had been restored to his command, took the field against his old comrade, but ∏ttle was done by either, and more than a suspicion was roused that they were playing into each other’s hands. In February 1634 Wallenstein was assassinated, and Arnim at once began more active operations. In May he gained a great victory over the imperialists at Liegnitz; but after the conclusion of peace, not thinking himself sufficiently honoured by the elector, he withdrew to his castle of Boitzenburg. Here he was seized by the Swedes, and imprisoned at Stockholm. He escaped, and was engaged in raising an army to revenge himself when he died suddenly in 1641.
