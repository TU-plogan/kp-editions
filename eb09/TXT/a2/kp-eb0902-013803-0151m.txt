ANTIUM, a city on the Italian coast, about 33 miles S. from Rome. Its site is now occupied by the village Porto d ’ Anzio, or d’Anzo. Founded, it is supposed, by Pelasgians, it became connected with the Latin League, and about the beginning of the 4th century before Christ passed into the hands of the Volsci. As the chief city of this people it continued, in spite of repeated defeat, to carry on, with intervals of peace, a pertinacious war against the Romans till the year 338 B.C., when, it was finally subdued, and garrisoned by a Roman colony, its ships being destroyed, and their rostra or beaks sent to ornament the speaker’s platform in the Forum. Towards the close of the republic it was again a beautiful and flourishing town, greatly resorted to by the wealthier Romans. There was a magnificent temple to Fortune, and others to Aesculapius, to Venus, and to Apollo. It was patronised by the emperor Augustus, and became the birth-place of Caligula and Nero. The latter enriched it with a fine artificial harbour, and it was afterwards indebted to Antoninus Pius for an aqueduct. It seems to have fallen into decay about the 5th century; and the attempts made in the 17th by Innocent XII. to restore it had only a temporary success. It is now the property of the Borghese family, and is a favourite bathing-place in the early summer months. Among the ancient remains that have been discovered here are the Apollo Belvedere, and the Borghese or Fighting Gladiator.
