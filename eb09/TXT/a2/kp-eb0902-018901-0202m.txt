APOLLOS, a Jew of Alexandria, who came to Ephesus during the absence of St Paul at Jerusalem (Acts xviii. 24). Apollos was a learned man (λoγιbs, in the authorised version translated eloquent'), “ mighty in the Scriptures,” and preached “boldly” in the synagogue the doctrine of a Messiah, knowing as yet “only the baptism of John.” Aquila and Priscilla having heard him, instructed him more fully in the doctrines of the gospel. Some time after this he went to Corinth, and was there very useful in convincing the Jews out of the Scriptures that Jesus was the Christ. Thus he watered what St Paul had planted in that city (1 Cor. iii. 6). The division in the church at Corinth, in which one of the parties calleditself by his name (1 Cor. i. 12), was not prompted by him, and did not disturb the friendly relations that existed between him and St Paul. Apollos hearing that the apostle was at Ephesus, went to meet him, and declined to return to Corinth, though St Paul “greatly desired” him to do so (1 Cor. xvi. 12). St Jerome says that Apollos was so dissatisfied with the division at Corinth, that he retired into Crete with Zenas, a doctor of the law; and that the schism having been healed by St Paul’s letter to the Corinthians, Apollos returned to the city, and became its bishop. Less probable traditions assign to him the bishopric of Duras, or of Iconium in Phrygia, or of Caesarea.
