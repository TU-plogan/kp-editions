ANTONIO, Nicolao, a Spanish bibliographer, was born at Seville in 1617. After finishing his studies at Salamanca, he returned to Seville, and shut himself up in the royal monastery of Benedictines, where he devoted several years to writing his Bibliotheca Hispanica, a work in four vols, folio, two of which he published at Rome in 1672. The work consists of two parts: the one containing the Spanish writers who flourished before the end of the 15th century; the other—the part published by Antonio himself—treating of later writers. He was recalled to Madrid by Charles II., and died in 1684, leaving nothing but a magnificent library of over 30,000 volumes. The earlier volumes of his Bibliotheca were published in 1696 at the expense of Cardinal d’ Aguirre, and under the superintendence of his librarian, Marti, who added notes in the name of the cardinal. An improved edition of the entire work, by F. P. Bayer, was published at Madrid in four vols, folio, in 1783-8.
