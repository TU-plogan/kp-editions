APPENDINI, Francesco Maria, historian and philologist, was born at Poirino, near Turin, on the 4th Nov. 1768. Educated at Rome, he took orders and was sent to Ragusa, where he was appointed professor of rhetoric. When the French seized Ragusa, Napoleon placed Appen-dini at the head of the Ragusan Academy. After the Austrian occupation he was appointed principal of the Normal Institution at Zara, where he died in 1837. Appendini’s chief work was his Notizie Istorico-critiche sulle Àntichità, Storia, e Letteratura dei Ragusci (1802-3).
