ARISTIDES, surnamed the Just, was the son of Lysimachus, a native of Athens, of the tribe Antiochis. His family appears to have been of noble descent; at least it is known that Callias, the torch-bearer at the Eleusinian mysteries, and reputedly the wealthiest man in Athens, was a cousin or near kinsman. Plutarch maintains, in opposition to Demetrius Phalereus, that Aristides was [9:2:505] very poor, and never enriched himself at the expense of the state. His poverty, however, seems scarcely reconcilable with the fact that he was made archon at a time when the possession of a certain amount of property was an indispensable qualification for that office. But extremely little is known of his early life. So far as political tendencies went, he had been a companion and follower of Clisthenes, and it is also told that he had a great veneration for the character and legislation of Lycurgus. He, therefore, natnrally took the aristocratic side in questions of state policy, and consequently found himself incessantly opposed to the great democratic leader, Themistocles. Plutarch relates many anecdotes of the constant opposition between the two, but in several points his account must be inaccurate.l

The first certain appearance of Aristides in history was at the battle of Marathon, 490 B.c., where he was one of the ten generals, and led his own tribe, Antiochis. He is said to have been second in command to Miltiades. According to custom each of the ten generals had supreme command of the whole army for one day; Aristides saw the disadvantages of this system, which totally prevented any fixed plan being carried out, and by his advice and example prevailed on the other generals to relinquish their right in favour of Miltiades. This prudent measure contributed largely to the success of the battle, in which also, according to Plutarch, much was due to the valour of Aristides. He was left with one tribe to collect the spoil from the field of battle, while Miltiades marched to Athens to protect the city from the Persian fleet. He discharged the duty intrusted to him with the most scrupulous honesty. Next year he was made archon eponymus, and his reputation for justice appears to have been increased by the manner in which he performed the duties of his office. But his great rival, Themistocles, who had been meanwhile increasing his own power, grew jealous, and gradually raised a strong feeling against him by representing how dangerous it was for a democracy that any individual should be allowed to gain such influence as that of Aristides. The Athenians, uneasy at this idea, banished him by ostracism in 483. It is said that, on this occasion, an ignorant fellow, who did not know Aristides, came up to him, and, giving him his shell, desired him to write upon it the name of Aristides. The latter asked in surprise if Aristides had done him any wrong. “No,” was the reply, “and I do not even know him, but it irritates me to hear him everywhere called the justP Aristides made no answer, but took the shell and wrote his own name on it

On the night before the battle of Salamis, Aristides, who was still in exile, made a perilous journey through the enemy’s fleet, and reached the tent of Themistocles. He told him that he had come to bury in oblivion their former differences; that he had learned his plan for giving battle to the Persian fleet in the narrow straits of Salamis, and highly approved of it; and that he would assist him to the utmost of his ability. By his influence the other generals were induced to assent to the plans of Themistocles, of whom they were somewhat jealous. On the day of battle, Aristides collected some Athenian volunteers, and made a descent on the little island of Psyttalea, which was filled with the forces of the enemy. These he routed and almost annihilated. After the victory of Salamis he dissuaded Themistocles from his ambitious plan of conquering Asia by destroying the bridge which the Persians had built over the Hellespont, and thereby cutting off their communications.

About this time his sentence of exile appears to have been revoked, for in 479 he was general of the Athenians in the campaign against Mardonius, and shared with Pausanias the glory of the victory-at Plataea. By his prudent counsels before the battle, he settled a dangerous dispute with the Tegetae; and after the victory, when the Athenians and Lacedaem onians were contending as to the right of erecting the trophy, he prevailed on the Athenians to give up their claim. The Lacedaemonians immediately followed this example, and the honours of the day were given to the Plataeans. He also instituted yearly sacrifices and quinquennial games at Plataea, to celebrate the victory over the barbarians and the liberation of Greece. On his return to Athens, Aristides introduced the famous measure by which the archonship was thrown open to all classes of citizens. In 477, he was sent along with Cimon, over whom he had great influence, to take command of the Athenian contingent, under the general command of Pausanias the Lacedaemonian. The haughtiness and oppressive conduct of the Spartans had disgusted the allies, who were completely won over by the mildness and prudence of Aristides and Cimon. In a body the allied Greeks threw off the hegemony of Sparta, and formed a confederation under the Athenians. To Aristides was committed the task of drawing up the laws for this confederacy, and settling the amount of tribute which should be paid by each state. This duty he discharged to the complete satisfaction of the allies, who were delighted to be assessed at only 460 talents. The first instalment of the tax was paid into the national treasury, then situated on the sacred island of Delos, but afterwards transferred to Athens, a measure which Aristides is said to have declared unjust but expedient.

The time and place of his death are uncertain. It is known, at least, that he survived the banishment of Themistocles, for his generous conduct towards his fallen rival is commemorated by Plutarch. He died, probably, about 468 B,c., according to some at Athens, according to others at Pontus. He is said to have died in such poverty that he did not leave enough to defray his funeral expenses, but had a tomb erected to him with funds from the public treasury. This tomb at Phalerum was still to be seen in the time of Plutarch. His daughters received marriage portions from the state, and his son, Lysimachus, was granted a sum of money and a portion of land. Such was the respect of the Athenians for the memory of their great statesman, that even his remote descendants are said to have received assistance from the public treasury.
