ARISTARCHUS, a Greek astronomer of Samos, who lived about 280-264 b.c. He is famous as being the first to maintain that the earth moves round the sun. No mention, indeed, is made of this doctrine in his only surviving work, ∏epι ∕z∈γ<∙0ωv και αποστημάτων, which treats of the Magnitudes and Distances of the Sun and Moan; but Archimedes, in his Arenarius, quotes from a work written by Aristarchus as a refutation of astrology, which renders it certain that the Samian astronomer had clearly anticipated the grand discovery of Copernicus. That the latter was unacquainted with the doctrine of Aristarchus is equally certain from the fact that the editio princeps of Archimedes had not appeared till after Copernicus’s death. The method given by Aristarchus of estimating the relative lunar and solar distances is geometrically correct, though the instrumental means of observation at his command rendered his data erroneous. His work has been published in Latin by G. Valla, Venice, 1498, folio; in Greek and Latin, with the commentary of Pappus, by Wallis, Oxford, 1688; andin a French translation by Fortia d’Urban, Paris, 1823, 8vo. See Delambre, Hist, de V astronomie ancienne.
