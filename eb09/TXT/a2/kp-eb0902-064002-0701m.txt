ARTA, Gulf of, the Sinus Ambracius of the ancients, is a large and beautiful inlet of the Ionian sea, twenty-five miles long and ten broad, the northern shores of which belong to Turkey, and the southern and eastern to Greece. Its only important affluent, besides the Arta, is the Luro (Charadra) also from the north. It abounds with mullets, soles, and eels. Around its shores are numerous ruins of ancient cities, as well as several flourishing modern towns, of which may be mentioned Actium at the entrance, Nicopolis, Previsa, Arta, Argos, Limnaea, Karavasaras, Olpoe, and Vonitza.
