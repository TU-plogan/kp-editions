ASTRABAD, or Asterabad, a small province of Persia, bounded on the N. by the Caspian Sea and the desert, on the S. by the Elburz Mountains, W. by Mazanderan, and E. by the river Gourgan. The country, although mountainous, and interspersed with dense forests, in which it is scarcely possible to travel, possesses beautiful and fertile valleys, producing rice, wheat, and other grains in abundance, or spread out in a boundless expanse of verdure, the pasturage of numerous flocks and herds. Fraser, who travelled through Persia in 1822, extols in the most lavish terms the appearance of the country. The soil, with little culture, is exceedingly productive, owing to the abundance of water which irrigates and fertilises it. But while the province in many parts presents a landscape of luxuriant beauty, it is a prey to the ravages of disease, and the frequent incursions of the surrounding tribes. The heavy torrents which fall in the rainy season stagnate in the forests, forming morasses, which, in the heats of summer and autumn, exhale a pestilential vapour, from the decomposition of the vegetable matter they contain. From these seats of noxious effluvia the wandering tribes of shepherds fly beyond the Gourgan or the Atrek, and live on the verge of the burning sand, although they have to carry water for each day’s consumption from the distant river. The better classes retire from the intense heats of summer into the mountains; but the settled inhabitants of the villages, who cannot so easily remove, and who generally remain, suffer severely from sickness. The inhabitants, notwithstanding the unhealthiness of their climate, are a stout and athletic race. The province is famous for furnishing a supply of matchlocks for the king’s body-guard. It is the ancient Hyrcania, and the native country of the Kajers, a Turkish tribe, of whom the king is the head, and on whom he considers he can rely in times of danger.

Astrabad, or Asterabad, the capital of the above province, is situated near the mouth of the River Gourgan, which flows into the Caspian, and at the head of a sheltered bay, convenient for shipping. It is a straggling town, about 3J∙ miles in circuit, and picturesque in appearance, from the buildings being intermingled with trees and gardens. At one time of greater size, it was reduced by Nadir Shah within its present limits. It is surrounded by a dilapidated mud wall, once lofty and formidable, and defended by numerous towers, and also by a wide and deep ditch, now almost filled with rubbish. Astrabad owes its origin to Yezzen-ibn-Messlub, who commanded the armies of Soliman, the seventh caliph of the Ommiades, early in the 7 th century. It was destroyed by Tamerlane in 1384. In 1744 Hanway the English traveller visited the place, and attempted to open a direct trade with Europe. At present its bazaars, though extensive, are but poorly filled, but commercial activity is said to be on the increase, in spite of the insecurity caused by the Turcomans, who attack the caravans at the very gate of the town. The number of houses within the walls is estimated at jfrom 2000 to 3000. Owing to the noxious exhalations of-,the surrounding forests, the town is so extremely unhealthy during the hot weather as to have acquired the title of the City of the Plague. Distance N.E. of Ispahan, 400 miles. Long. 54’ 25' E., lat. 36° 50' N.
