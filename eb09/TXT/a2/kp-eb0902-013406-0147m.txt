ANTIPODES, a word of Greek derivation (αντί, against, opposed to, 7r0δ∈ς, feet),—from the inhabitants walking feet to feet,—is a relative term applied to any two peoples or places on opposite sides of the earth, so situated that a line drawn from the one to the other passes through the centre of the globe and forms a true diameter. Thus, the North Pole is exactly antipodal to the South. Any two places having this relation—as London and, approximately, Antipodes Island, near New Zealand—must bo distant from each other by 180° degrees of longitude, and the one must be as many degrees to the north of the equator as the other is to the south. Noon at the one place is midnight at the other, the longest day corresponds to the shortest, and mid-winter is contemporaneous with mid-summer. In the calculation of days and nights, midnight on the one side may be regarded as corresponding to the noon either of the previous or of the following day. If a voyager sail eastward, and thus anticipate the sun, his dating will be twelve hours in advance, while the reckoning of another who has been sailing westward will be as much in arrear. There will thus be a difference of twenty-four hours between the two. In this way the Portuguese in Macao are a day before their Spanish neighbours in the Philippine Islands.
