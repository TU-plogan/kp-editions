ANGUIER, François (born 1604, died 1669), and Michael (born 1612, died 1686), two brothers, natives of Normandy, were distinguished sculptors in the time of Louis XIV. The chief works of Francis are the monument to Cardinal de Beruhe, in the chapel of the oratory at Paris, and the mausoleum of the last due de Montmorency at Moulins. Michael executed the sculptures of the triumphal arch at the Porte St Denis. A marble group of the Nativity in the church of Val de Grâce, was reckoned his masterpiece.
