APPERLEY, Charles James, a sportsman and sporting writer, better known as “Nimrod,” the nom de plume under which he published his works on the chase and the turf, was born at Plasgronow, near Wrexham, in Denbighshire, in 1777. During the period of his education at Rugby he paid more attention to field-sports than to classics; and between the years 1805 and 1820 he devoted himself almost wholly to fox-hunting, so that he was by early training well fitted for the position of authority he afterwards acquired in the sporting world. About 1821 he began to contribute to the Sporting Magazine, under the pseudonym of “Nimrod,” a series of articles, which from their racy character did the magazine admirable service. Its circulation doubled within two years; and the proprietor, Mr Pittman, with great liberality, kept for “Nimrod” a stud of hunters, and defrayed all expenses of his tours, besides giving him a handsome salary. The death of Mr Pittman, however, led to a law-suit with the proprietors of the magazine for money advanced to “Nimrod;” and the latter, to avoid imprisonment, had to take up his residence near Calais (1830), where he supported himself by his writings. He died in London, 19th May 1843. The most important of his works are—(1.) Remaries on the Condition of Hunters, the Choice of Horses, &c., Lond. 8vo, 1831; (2.) The Chase, the Turf, and the Road (originally written for the Quarterly Review), Lond. 1837; (3.) Memoirs of the Life of the late John Mytton, Lond. 1837; (4.) Nimrod's Northern Tour, Lond. 1838; (5.) Nimrod Abroad, 2 vols. 12mo. Lond. 1842; (6.) The Horse and the Hound (a reprint from the seventh edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica), 1842; (f.) Hunting Reminiscences, Lond. 1843.
