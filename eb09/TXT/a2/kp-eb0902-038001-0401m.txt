ARCHIMANDRITE (from /χάνδρα, a fold, cloister, or convent), is a title in the Greek Church applied to a superior abbot, who has the supervision of several abbots and cloisters. The name has sometimes been applied generally to superiors of large convents. In Russia the bishops are selected from among the archimandrites. Although the title is peculiar to the Greek Church, it has found its way into Western Europe. It is used in Sicily, Hungary, and Poland, and has even been applied to bishops of the Latin Church.
