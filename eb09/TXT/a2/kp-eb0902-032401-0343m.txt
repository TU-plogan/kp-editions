ARBROATH, or Aberbrothock, a seaport and manufacturing town of Scotland, in the county of Forfar, 17 miles N.E. of Dundee and 60 N.N.E. of Edinburgh, in lat. 56° 33' N. and long. 2° 35' W. Of its origin we have no information, but it is probable that the shelter of the river Brothock, from which it derives its name, early attracted a settlement of seafaring folk. It was certainly in existence before the Tyronensian monks came from Kelso to take possession of the beautiful abbey dedicated to Thomas a-Becket, which King William the Lion had just founded in 1178. Whether the town was created a royal burgh in 1186, as has been stated, is uncertain; but it still preserves its charter of 1599. By King John of England it was exempted from. “toll and custom” in every part of the southern kingdom except London. In 1320 a parliament was held in the abbey by Robert I., and a letter—one of the most remarkable documents of our early history— was addressed to the Pope in regard to the relations between Scotland and England. In 1394 the burgesses of Arbroath entered into an agreement with John Gedy, the abbot, by which he and his successors were bound to maintain a sufficient harbour at their own expense. The abbacy was held in succession by Bishop Beaton of Glasgow, and his nephew, Cardinal Beaton, afterwards Archbishop of St Andrews. It was abolished by Act of Parliament, and erected into a temporal lordship of the Hamilton family in 1541. There is a tradition that the abbey was burned by a neighbouring “laird” in consequence of a private quarrel with the commendatary; but it is more generally believed that it merely fell into ruin from neglect. There is no evidence that it suffered from the attacks of the Reformers. The vestry, the south transept, part of the chancel, the south wall of the nave, part of the entrance towers, the fine Norman gateway, and part of the secular buildings are still standing, and the abbot’s house, now called the abbey house, is still inhabited. At the beginning of the 18th century Arbroath was a place of but little importance, but has since gradually risen. It is now the principal seat of the sail-cloth manufacture, has about thirty spinning-mills, and seventeen factories, several considerable foundries, tanneries, and other works. During the course of last century the abbot’s harbour was superseded by one more commodious a little to the west, which was enlarged and improved, about 1844,at a cost of £50,000. More recently, by means of a Government loan and other funds, amounting together to <£35,000, the entrance and bar have been much deepened, and a wet dock is (1875) in course of formation. A neat signal tower, 50 feet in height, with an excellent telescope, communicates with the Bell-Rock lighthouse; and on the north pier is a fixed red light, at an elevation of 24 feet, visible 8 miles off. The imports are flax, hemp, coal, &c.; and the exports, paving-stones, grain, potatoes, fish, &c. At the first of December 1873 the number of vessels registered at the port was 64, with an aggregate burden of 9242 tons. The customs receipts that year amounted to £15,861, 13s. Id.; the tax on British spirits to £6767, 11s.; total, £22,629, 4s. Id., showing an increase on the previous year of £604, 14s. Id. Among the public buildings are the town-hall, a trades’ hall, the new hall, the parish church, with a spire 150 feet high, three quoad sacra churches, five Free, three United Presbyterian, one Episcopalian, one Roman Catholic, and two· Independent. There are six branch banks, a savings bank, a public library, an excellent museum, a high school, five other public and a number of adventure and denominational schools, with an aggregate attendance of 3000 children, an infirmary, and a considerable number of charitable endowments. The municipal government is vested in a provost, three bailies, a treasurer, a dean of guild, and twelve councillors; and there are seven incorporated trades. In the year 1873-74 the expenditure for general public purposes— including paving, lighting, cleansing, but excluding improvements, water, and sanitary expenditure—was £6773, 15s. 3d. The town has been drained and well paved; an additional though somewhat small supply of water has been recently obtained, and the sanitary condition is on the whole satisfactory.

Arbroath unites with Forfar, Montrose, Brechin, and Bervie, in sending a member to parliament. By the census of 1871 it contained 2359 inhabited houses, and, including [9:2:325] 179 within the royalty but beyond the parliamentary boundary, 20,170 inhabitants. Of these 3723 are engaged in manufacturing linen fabrics. Arbroath is a station on the Caledonian Railway. The market day is Saturday; .and fairs are held on the last Saturday of January, the first Saturday after Whitsunday, the 18th of July, if that day is a Saturday, or on the first Saturday thereafter, and the first Saturday after Martinmas. About a mile from the town, at St Vigeans Church, is one of the most interesting of the Scottish sculptured stones, containing what has been held to be the only legible inscription left us in the Pictish language {Sculptured Stones of Scotland). See Statistical Account of Scotland, vol. xi., and local histories.
