APOSTASY (άπόστασις), denoting in classic Greek (Herodotus, Thucydides) a defection or revolt from a military commander, is generally employed to describe a complete renunciation of the Christian faith. In the first centuries of the Christian era, apostasy was most commonly induced by persecution, and was indicated by some outward act, such as offering incense to a heathen deity or blaspheming the name of Christ. The Emperor Julian, who is known in history as The Apostate, abandoned Christianity for paganism soon after assuming the purple, though it is questionable whether he had ever really embraced the Christian faith. In the Roman Catholic Church the word apostasy is also applied to the renunciation of monastic vows (apostasis a monachatu), and to the abandonment of the clerical profession for the life of the world (apostasis a clericatu). Of the latter class a celebrated instance was Talleyrand.
