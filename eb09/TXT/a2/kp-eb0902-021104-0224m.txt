APPIANI, Andrea, the best fresco painter of his age, born at Milan in 1754, died in 1817. He was made pensioned artist to the kingdom of Italy by Napoleon; but having lost his allowance after the events of 1814, he fell into poverty. Correggio was his model, and his best pieces, which are in the church of the Virgin and the royal palace of Milan, almost rival those of his great master. He is also said to have painted Napoleon and the chief personages of his court. Among the most graceful of his oil paintings are his “Venus and Love,” and “Orlando in the garden of Armida.”
