ARDROSSAN, a sea-port in Ayrshire, Scotland, 31 miles by rail from Glasgow, in N. lat. 55° 38', and W. long. 4° 49'. It dates from an early period, as there seems to have been a castle and a small fishing village in existence for several centuries. The name of Arthur of Ardrossan is found in connection with a charter dated 1226; and Sir Fergus of Ardrossan accompanied Edward Bruce in his Irish expedition in 1316, and in 1320 signed the appeal to the Pope, by the barons of Scotland, against the aggressions of Edward I. of England. The castle, famous for its capture by Wallace, was finally destroyed by Cromwell, who is said to have used part of its masonry for the construction of the fort at Ayr. The family of the barons of Ardrossan is now merged, by marriage, in that of the earl of Eglinton and Winton. The rise of Ardrossan into commercial importance is due to the exertions of Hugh the twelfth earl of Eglinton, who commenced the construction of the present town and harbour in 1806. The harbour was intended to be in connection with a canal from Glasgow to Ardrossan, but this was only completed as far as Johnstone. Owing to the stoppage of the canal works, and the death of Lord Eglinton, the construction of tho harbour was suspended till 1845, when it was partially completed, and placed in connection with the Glasgow and South-Western Railway by a branch railway which joins the main line at Kilwinning. The cost of the harbour up tα 1874 has been upwards of £200,000. The works now consist of a wet dock of 4 acres in area, with 19 feet at high water over the lock sill, and of two tidal harbours— one 18 acres, and the other 6 acres in area. There is a lighthouse on the north-west point of the outer breakwater, with a white flashing light. The works are well supplied with steam cranes, and all modern appliances for discharging and loading vessels. The exports consist principally of coal and iron from collieries and ironworks in the neighbourhood, and the imports of timber, ores, and general goods. There are lines of steamers plying to Glasgow, Arran, Belfast, Newry, and to various ports in Spain. In 1874 the number of vessels entering and leaving the port was 2044, with a registered tonnage of 296,690; the number of vessels belonging to the port was 114, with a registered tonnage of 15,611, and there were exported 276,081 tons of coal, and 80,516 tons of iron. Iron founding and shipbuilding[9:2:481] are carried on to a considerable extent; and for the repair of vessels there are a graving-dock, which can take in vessels of 1500 tons, and a floating dock and patent slip, which can each accommodate vessels of 500 tons. In 1846 an Act of Parliament was obtained, erecting the town into a burgh, with a corporation consisting of a provost, two bailies, and five town councillors. The public buildings consist of a townhall, the property of the corporation, and of five churches, belonging to the Established Church, the Episcopal, the Free, the United Presbyterian, and the Evangelical Union denominations respectively. There are three branch banks in the town. The population in 1851 was 2071; it was 3929 in 1871; and in 1874 it is estimated to be 4228.
