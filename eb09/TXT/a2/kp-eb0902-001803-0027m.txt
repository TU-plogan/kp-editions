ANDOVER, an ancient market-town in the north-west of Hampshire, situated near the left bank of the river Anton, 63 miles from London, and 12 from Winchester. It is well built, and contains a large parish church—erected about forty years ago on the site of the old one, which existed in the time of William the Conqueror—several dissenting places of worship, various elementary schools, and a spacious town hall. It returns one member to parliament; and its corporation, which is said to date from the reign of King John, consists of a mayor, four aldermen, and twelve councillors. Andover is the centre of a large agricultural district; its weekly markets and its fairs, held three times a year, are well attended, while at Weyhill, a village about 3 miles to the west, a fair is held every October, which was formerly one of the most celebrated in England. Malting is largely carried on, and there is an extensive iron foundry near the town; but the silk manufactures, once so prosperous, are now almost extinct. The Romans had a station at Andover, and the remains of their encampment are still to be seen in the neighbourhood. Population in 1871, 5501.
