APOLLONIUS, surnamed Dyscolus (Δύσκολος), or The Crabbed, was a native of Alexandria, and lived in the reigns of Hadrian and Antoninus Pius. He was the first systematic writer on grammar, and is styled by Priscian ii Grammaticorum Princeps.” Of his extant grammatical works the principal one is the treatise On Syntax, the best edition of which is that of Bekker, Berlin, 1817.
