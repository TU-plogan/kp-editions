ARCTIC OCEAN. The Arctic Circle (66° 30') being taken as a boundary, the whole of the ocean lying to the north is called the Arctic Ocean. From a physical point of view this limit is hardly satisfactory, since between Greenland and Europe the Atlantic, with its Gulf Stream, makes an inroad on the Arctic territory, and the southern extremity of Greenland brings down the Arctic region beyond the Arctic limit; but the other parallel of latitude (70°) which has been chosen as a southern limit is perhaps still more [9:2:479] objectionable. The Arctic Ocean washes the north of Europe, Asia, and America. It communicates with the Atlantic by a broad opening on the east of Greenland, and a narrow but important channel on the west, which has been traced as far north as 84°, and is known in the various parts of its extent by special names—Davis’ Strait, Baffin’s Bay, Utlak Soak, Smith Sound, Kennedy Channel, Robeson Channel, Lincoln Sea,—but might conveniently be distinguished by some such general designation as the West Greenland Channel. With the Pacific there is communication between Asia and America through Behring’s Strait. The coast line of all the three continents is for the most part exceedingly irregular, though this is less the case with Asia than with the other two. · Europe sends down the Onega, Dwina, Pinega, Mezen, and Petchora; Asia the Obi, Yenisee, Lena, Indigarka, and Robima; and America the Mackenzie River. The most important of the numerous islands are Spitzbergen and Nova Zembla, with the multitudinous adjacent islets, to the north of Europe; the Liakhov Islands, or New Siberia, off the coast of Asia; and the vast irregular Archipelago into which the north-eastern portion of America is split, which extends to the quasi-continent of Greenland. While for human habitation the regions of the Arctic Ocean are the most desolate that can well be conceived, there is extraordinary abundance of the lower forms of animal life; and while for centuries men have only visited them to gather their living harvests, or for purposes of-exploration, traces are in many places to be found of human inhabitants in a distant age. At a still remoter period the islands of the Arctic Archipelago have been covered with forests, and Barrow’s Straits have been the habitat of coral and sponge (Markham, in the Journ. Hoy. Geogr. Sοc. 1865, p. 88). A very large portion of the area included by the Arctic Ocean is still unexplored; but almost every year diminishes the extent of the unknown. The nearest approach to the Pole has been made up the West Greenland Channel; the passage along the eastern, coast away to the north of Spitzbergen being the next in order of success. For information regarding the various Arctic expeditions, see the article Polar Regions.
