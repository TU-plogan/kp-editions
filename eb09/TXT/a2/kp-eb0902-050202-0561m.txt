ARION (pronounced Aιd'on), a celebrated poet and cithara player, a native of Methymna, in Lesbos. As he is said to have been the friend of Periander, tyrant of Corinth, he must have flourished about 625 b.c. Several of the ancients ascribe to him the invention of the dithyramb and of dithyrambic poetry; it is probable, however, that his real service was confined to the organisation of that verse, and the conversion of it from a mere drunken song, used in the Bacchic revels, to a measured antistrophic hymn, sung by a trained body of performers. Nothing more is known of the life of Arion, with the exception of the beautiful story first told by Herodotus, and afterwards elaborated and embellished by many subsequent writers. According to Herodotus, Arion had become desirous of exhibiting his skill in foreign countries, and, leaving Corinth, had travelled through Sicily and parts of Italy, where he gained great fame, and amassed a large sum of money. At Tarentum he embarked for his homeward voyage in a ship belonging to Corinth. The sight of his treasure roused the cupidity of the sailors, who resolved to possess themselves of it by putting him to death. Tn answer to his entreaties that they would spare his life, they insisted that he should either die by his own hand on shipboard, or cast himself into the sea. Arion chose the latter, and as a last favour begged permission to sing a parting song. The sailors, desirous of hearing so famous a musician, consented, and the poet, standing on the deck of the ship, arrayed in the rich garments in which he was accustomed to be habited, sang a dirge accompanied by his lyre. He then threw himself overboard; but instead of perishing, as the sailors imagined, he was miraculously borne up in safety by a dolphin, supposed to have been charmed by the music. Thus he was conveyed to Taenarus, whence he proceeded to Corinth, arriving before the ship from Tarentum. Immediately on his arrival Arion related his story to Periander, the tyrant of Corinth, who was at first incredulous, but eventually learned the truth by a stratagem. Summoning the sailors, he demanded what had become of the poet. They affirmed that he had remained behind at Tarentum; upon which they were suddenly confronted by Arion himself, arrayed in the same garments in which he had leapt overboard. The sailors confessed their guilt, and were punished. Herodotus and Pausanias both refer to a brass figure at Taenarus, which was supposed to represent Arion seated on the dolphin’s back. But this story is only one of several in which the dolphin appears as saving the lives of favoured heroes. Among others, it is curious that Taras, the mythical founder of Tarentum, is said to have been conveyed in this manner from Taenarus to Tarentum. On Tarentine coins a man and dolphin appear, and hence it may be thought that the monument at Taenarus represented Taras, and not Arion. From the frequent appearance of the dolphin in mythical stories of voyages, it has been conjectured that it was looked upon as in some way the preserver of those at sea, and votive offerings would therefore be given to it by those who had escaped the perils of the deep. At the same time, the connection of Apollo with the dolphin must not be forgotten. Under this form the god appeared when he founded the celebrated oracle at Delphi, the name of which commemorates the circumstance. He was also the god of music, the special preserver of poets, and to him the lyre was sacred. The story of Arion seems, therefore, to be but one of the many and varied forms of the wide-spread myth of Apollo. Among the numerous modern versions of it, particular mention may be made of the pretty Pomanze “Arion” by A. W. Schlegel.
