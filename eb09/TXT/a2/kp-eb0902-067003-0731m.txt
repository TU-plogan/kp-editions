ARUNDEL, a town in Sussex, on the river Arun, about 4 miles from its mouth, 10 miles E. of Chichester, 19 W. of Brighton, and 55 S.W. of London. It is built on the slope of a hill surmounted by the castle of the duke of Norfolk, which dates from the time of Alfred the Great. It confers on its possessor the title of Earl of Arundel. At the time of the Conquest the castle waβ rebuilt by Roger de Montgomerie, but it was taken from his son, who rebelled against the reigning monarch, Henry I. In 1397 it was the scene of a conspiracy organised by the earl of Arundel, archbishop of Canterbury, and duke of Glou cester, to dethrone Richard II. and murder the lords of his council, a plot which was discovered before it could be carried into execution. During the parliamentary wars of the 17th century the stronghold was frequently assaulted by the contending parties, and consequently greatly damaged; but it was restored by Charles the 11th duke of Norfolk, who made it what it now is, one of the most splendid baronial mansions in England. The town which, according to the whimsical etymology of the corporation seal, takes its name from hirondelle (a swallow), is divided into two parts by the river Arun, which is here navigable for vessels of 300 tons, and a canal connects it with the Thames and Portsmouth. The town-hall is a castellated building, which cost £9000, and was presented to the corporation by the duke of Norfolk. The church of St Nicholas is a very ancient structure (founded about 1375), with a low tower rising from the centre. In the north aisle of the chancel there are several ancient monuments of the earls of Arundel, and the high altar is held to be the only perfect original example in England. The church is otherwise remarkable for its reredos and iron work. Some remains of a Maison Dieu, or hospital, erected in the time of Richard II. still exist. Arundel was a borough by prescription, and returned two members to parliament from the time of Edward I., but it lost one by the Reform Act of 1832, and the other by that of 1868. (See Tierny’s Hist, of Castle and Town of Arundel, 2 vols., 1834.)
