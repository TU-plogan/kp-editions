ARISTOXENUS, of Tarentum, a celebrated Greek philosopher and writer on music, was the son of Spintharus or Mnesias. He was at first a pupil of the Pythagorean school, and received instruction from Xenophilus; afterwards removing to Athens, he studied under Aristotle. He became one of the most distinguished pupils of the Peripatetic school, and is said to have been much disappointed when, after the death of Aristotle, Theophrastus was preferred to him as scholarch. His writings, which, according to Suidas, were 453 in number, have been almost entirely lost. The titles of some of them have been preserved, and show that his activity had been directed to a great variety of topics. With the exception of a few fragments quoted by other authors, there is extant of all his writings only one treatise on Harmony, in three books, which is probably not a complete work, but made up of portions of one or more separate writings. His doctrine of harmony is directly opposed to that of the Pythagoreans, according to whom musical concord depended upon certain numerical ratios, and who were obliged to reject some combinations as dissonant, only because there was no ratio corresponding to them. This theory Aristoxenus considered to be an attempt to force a priori determinations upon nature, and he sought to develop a theory of harmony from an empirical basis. According to him, the ear is the true judge of concord, and its impressions can be generalised into rules. His followers were called μουσικοί, or musicians by ear, in opposition to the Pythagoreans, who were κανονικοί, or musicians by rule. Another doctrine attributed to Aristoxenus brings out forcibly the strong empirical tendency of his mind. He is said to have held that the soul stood in the same relation to the parts of the body as harmony stands to the parts of a musical instrument; it was the result of organisation. What proofs he advanced in favour of this view, and how the opinion was connected with his general system of thought, we have not now the means of determining.

The best edition of Aristoxenus is by Marquard, with German translation and full commentary, Aristoxenus’ harmonische Fragmente, 1868. The fragments are also given in Müller, Frag. Hist. Grcec., ii. 269, sqq. See also Mahne’s work, Diatribe de Aristoxeno, 1793; and that of Brill, Aristoxenus' rhythmische und metrische Messungen, 1871.
