NEUNKIRCHEN, or Ober-Neunkirchen, a small manufacturing town of Prussia, in the district of Treves and circle of Ottweiler, is situated on the Blies, 12 miles to the north-west of Saarbrücken. The principal industrial establishment is a huge iron-foundry, employing upwards of 2000 hands, and producing about 80,000 tons of manufactured iron per annum; but there are also boilerworks, soap manufactories, and a brewery. It lies in an important coal-basin, in which about 4 million tons of coals, worth £1,500,000, are raised annually. The 14,647 inhabitants (1880) consist of Protestants and Roman Catholics in almost equal proportions.
