NORDHAUSEN, a flourishing town in Prussian Saxony, in the district of Erfurt, is situated on the Zorge, at the south base of the Harz mountains, and at the west end of the Goldene Aue (Golden Plain), a fruitful valley watered by the Helme. It is built partly on the slope of the mountains and partly on the plain, and the upper and lower parts of the town are connected by flights of steps. Among the churches the most noteworthy are the cathedral, a late Gothic edifice with a Romanesque crypt, and the church of St Blasius, containing two pictures by Lucas Cranach. Near the mediaeval town-house stands a Rolandâ€™s column, the ancient symbol of free commercial intercourse and civic liberty. The chief importance of the place arises from its distilleries, which yearly produce about 8,000,000 gallons of brandy. The breweries are also important, and there are manufactures of leather, tobacco, cotton and linen goods, carpets, chicory, and chemicals. Nordhausen is sometimes called the Cincinnati of Germany on account of its extensive export trade in pork, corned beef, ham, and sausages. In 1880 it contained 26,198 inhabitants, of whom 23,943 were Protestants, 1255 Roman Catholics, and 494 Jews.

Nordhausen, one of the oldest towns in North Germany, was surrounded with walls in the 10th century, and is spoken of as a free imperial town in 1220. Several diets, tournaments, and assemblies of princes were held here during the 12th, 13th, and 14th centuries. It appears to have usually placed itself under the protection of a prince of the empire, and in 1697 we find the elector of Brandenburg selected for this purpose. It was annexed to Prussia in 1803 and again finally in 1815, having in the interim belonged to the kingdom of Westphalia.
