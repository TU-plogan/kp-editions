NATHANAEL (⅛3Γ>J, “he whom God gave,” equivalent to Nethaniah or the Greek Theodore), a common name in later Old Testament times. It appears in the Gospel of John (i. 45 sq., xxi. 2) as the name of a man of Cana of Galilee, one of the first disciples of Jesus. He is not named in the synoptical Gospels, and the fathers (Chrysostom, Augustine, &c.) do not number him among the apostles; [9:17:243] but his position in the Fourth Gospel has given rise to a prevalent conjecture that Nathanael is the true name of the apostle whose patronymic was Bartholomew (son of Ptolemy). This indeed is mere conjecture, and recent writers have advanced rival hypotheses, e.y., that the name is another form for Mattaniah or Matthew (Hilgenfeld), or that Nathanael is identical with the beloved disciple of the Fourth Gospel (Späth) or even a mere symbol of Paulinism (Holtzmann).
