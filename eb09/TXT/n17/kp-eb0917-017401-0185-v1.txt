NANTUCKET, an island, county, and town of the United States, forming (since 1693) part of Massachusetts. The island, with an area of about 50 square miles, lies within the 10-fathom line, but is separated from the mainland by Nantucket Sound, which measures from 25 to 30 miles in breadth, and has a general depth of from 5 to 8 fathoms. With the exception of a few inconsiderable hills, the surface for the most part consists of open, breezy, and now almost treeless downs. The soil is generally sandy, but affords in some places good pasture. On the north or landward side of the island there is a large lagoon-like harbour formed by a long narrow tongue of land—the Coatue Beach—which, curving north-west, runs out into Great Point, the end of which is marked by a white lighthouse tower in 41° 23' 24" N. lat. and 70° 2' 24" W. long. Within the harbour the depth at low water is about 12 or 14 feet, but on the bar it is only between 6 and 7. The western end of the island shelves out in a broad submarine platform (Tuckernuck Bank), which supports the two considerable islands of Tuckernuck and Muskeget, both included in the county. Nantucket post-village, the principal settlement, lies at the south-west end of the harbour, —a quiet place, but beginning to attract attention as a summer residence. A library and museum are maintained in the Athenøeum building.

Nantucket (Natocko on the map of 1630) was visited by Gosnold (1602), who found it covered with oaks and other trees, and inhabited by about 1500 Indians. Governor Mayhew, in 1659, granted nine-tenths of the island to ten men for £30 and two beaver hats, and shortly afterwards the first settler, Thomas Macy, took possession. The town of Nantucket (known as Sherburne from 1673 to 1795) was incorporated in 1671; the original site was at Maddequet, 5 or 6 miles west of the present position, to which it was removed in the following year. About the same time whaling operations were commenced, and Nantucket gradually became the greatest whaling station in the world. In 1775 it had 150 vessels engaged in the business; but since the beginning of the century its prosperity has rapidly declined: in 1852 there were still 18,105 tons of its registered shipping employed in whale-fishing; in 1863 there were only 3739; and the number has gradually sunk to zero. The last full-blood Indian in Nantucket died in 1821; the last halfbreed in 1854. The population of the county was 4500 in 1775, 9012 in 1840, 6094 in 1860, 4123 in 1870, and 3727 in 1880.
