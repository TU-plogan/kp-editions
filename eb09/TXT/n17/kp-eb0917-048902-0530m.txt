NICOL, William, the inventor of the invaluable polarizing prism (Light, vol. xiv. p. 612), was born about 1768, and died at Edinburgh in September 1851. Nothing is known of his early history, â…›eyond the fact that, after amassing a small competence as an itinerant popular lecturer on various parts of natural philosophy, he settled in Edinburgh to live a very retired life in the society of his apparatus alone. Besides the invention of his prism (of which we are told that he himself did not understand the mode of action), he devoted himself chiefly to the examination of fluid-filled cavities in crystals, and of the microscopic structure of various kinds of fossil wood. In the preparation of the sections of wood he introduced improvements of the utmost value. Before his time only the roughest slices were employed. His skill as a working lapidary was very great; and he executed a number of lenses of garnet and other precious stones, which he preferred to the achromatic microscopes of the time. The majority of the few, though important, papers which he published are to be found in the old and new Edinburgh Philosophical Journal.
