NICHOLAS II., a Burgundian, whose Christian name was Gerard, was archbishop of Florence when he was chosen (December 28, 1058) at that place to succeed Stephen IX. in the papal chair. Some time previously the [9:17:484] old Roman feudatory barons had caused to be consecrated, under the name of Benedict X., John, cardinal bishop of Velletri, who, however, was speedily deposed. The election of Nicholas had been brought about by Hildebrand (afterwards Gregory VII.), and his whole pontificate derived its character from that master-spirit. Its first act of historical importance was the framing by the second Lateran council (April 1059) of the decree which vested the election of popes in the cardinal bishops in the first instance, the assent of the cardinal priests and deacons being next required, then that of the laity, and finally that of the emperor. It was at the same council that Berengarius of Tours was temporarily induced to admit the doctrine of the corporeal presence in the sacrament. In the following June Nicholas visited Apulia, accepted the submission of the Normans, and removed the ban of excommunication, investing Richard in the principality of Capua and Robert Guiscard in the dukedom of Apulia, Calabria, and Sicily. He died at Florence in June 1061, and was succeeded by Alexander II.
