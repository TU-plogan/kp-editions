NIMÁR, a district in the Central Provinces, India, lying between 21° 4' and 22° 26' N. lat. and between 75° 50' and 77° 1' E. long., and bounded on the N. and W. by Dhar and Indore states, S. by Khandesh and West Berar, and E. by Hoshangâbâd. The area is 3340 square miles, of which only 659 are under cultivation. The population in 1881 was 231,341 (embracing 199,454 Hindus, 24,426 Mohammedans, 5282 aborigines,—the most numerous tribe of these being the Bhils). Khandwa town is the administrative headquarters. The district consists of two portions of the Nerbudda and Tapti valleys, separated by a range of hills, a section of the Sâtpurâ range, about 15 miles in breadth. On the highest peak, about 850 feet above the plain and 1800 above sea-level, stands the fortress of Asirgarh, commanding a pass which has for centuries been the chief highway between Upper India and the Deccan. The district contains extensive forests, but the only tract reserved by Government is the Pun<isa forest, which extends for about 120 miles along the south bank of the Nerbudda, and contains very fine young teak, besides sdj (^Terminalia tomentosa) and anjan (flardwickia binata) of great size. The only towns with a population exceeding 5000, in 1881, were Khandwa, the district capital (15,142), and Burhanpur (30,017). The principal line of road is that from Khandwa to Indore. The Great Indian Peninsular Railway traverses the district.
