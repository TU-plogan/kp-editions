NARCISSUS, a genus of bulbous plants belonging to the family Awiaryllidaceae. There are twenty or thirty wild forms, natives of central Europe and the Mediterranean region, while one extends through Asia to Japan. From these, or rather from some of these, by cultivation and hybridization, have arisen the very numerous forms which adorn our gardens in spring (see vol. xii. p. 257). The most interesting feature botanically is the “corona,” or “cup,” which springs from the base of the flower-segments. This gives the special character to the flower, and the members of the genus are classified according to the length of this organ as compared with that of the segments. Much has been written as to the real nature of this cup, but the most probable supposition is that it does not, as once supposed, represent one or more rows of modified stamens, but is simply an excrescence or “enation” from the mouth of the flower-tube, and probably is in some way connected with the fertilization of the flowers by insect agency.
