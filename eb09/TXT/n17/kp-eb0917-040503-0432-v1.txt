NEWPORT, a seaport, market-town, and municipal and parliamentary borough of Monmouthshire, is situated on the right bank of the Usk, about 4 miles from its confluence with the Bristol Channel, and 12 miles north-east from Cardiff. On the east, north, and west it is finely sheltered [9:17:406] by a line of lofty hills, and the neighbouring scenery is picturesque; but the town is chiefly composed of a mean class of houses, although there are many good villas in the suburbs. The old parish church of St Woollos is one of the most curious churches in England. Originally it consisted only of the present nave,—a fine specimen of grand though perfectly unadorned Romanesque architecture; but a massive square tower (of the time of Henry III.) and a chancel were subsequently added; a large western lady-chapel is interposed between the nave and the tower. The old castle, built about 1130 by Robert earl of Gloucester, was a very extensive structure in the Late Perpendicular. The two towers and the main central mass still remain; a portion has been converted into a brewery. The old monastery of Friars Preachers (Dominicans or Black Friars) has been entirely rebuilt, and is occupied as a private residence. The other principal public buildings are the spacious Victoria Hall, the Albert Hall, the new town-hall, the market-house, the custom-house, the union workhouse, the infirmary, and the free library and school of art. Newport owes its rapid increase to its situation on a deep and spacious tidal river, which renders it a convenient outlet for the trade of a very rich mineral district. It is now supplied with very extensive docks and wharves, to which steamers of the largest size can have access at all tides. The old dock of 4 j acres, opened in 1842, received in 1858 an addition of 7f acres; and in 1875 the new Alexandra dock of 25 acres was opened, land being retained surrounding it to the extent of 400 acres, available for the construction of wharves and warehouses, and for extension of the dock area. There is regular steam communication with Bristol, Liverpool, and Ireland. In 1882 the number of vessels in the foreign and colonial trade that entered the port was 1656 of 734,264 tons, the number that cleared 2143 of 1,078,245 tons. In the same year there entered in the coasting trade 8020 vessels of 1,048,626 tons, and cleared 7667 vessels of 700,500 tons. The town possesses large iron foundries and engineering works, and among the other industries the principal are the manufacture of waggons and wheels, patent nails, bolts, and wire. The manufacture of steel in the district is rapidly increasing. Shipbuilding was formerly carried on to a large extent. The building of iron ships has recently been commenced by several firms. The population of the municipal borough, which in 1801 was only 1135, had increased in 1831 to 7062, in 1851 to 20,279, in 1871 to 27,069, and in 1881 to 35,313. The population of the parliamentary borough (area 1690 acres) in 1881 was 38,427.

Newport is called Novus Burgus by Giraldus Cambrensis to distinguish it from the old Roman city of Caerleon about 3 miles distant. The town is nowhere mentioned in history before the beginning of the 10th century. Tradition states that Ethelfleda was killed at a great battle at Castell Newydd (Newport), but according to another account the Saxon sovereign slain was Ethelfred. The town received its first charter from Edward II. It is included in the Monmouth parliamentary district of boroughs.
