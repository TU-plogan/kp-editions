NORTH BIERLEY, an urban sanitary district in the West Riding of Yorkshire, England, about 2 miles south of Bradford, includes the villages of Bierley Lane, Wibsey, and Low Moor, and other smaller hamlets. There are extensive collieries in the district as well as blast and puddling furnaces and rolling-mills, the ironworks at Low Moor employing between 3000 and 4000 persons. The church of the Holy Trinity at Low Moor was erected in 1606 in the Early English style, but has undergone restoration. The manor of North Bierley originally belonged to the Swillingtons of Swillington, who were strong adherents of the house of Lancaster. The population of the urban sanitary district (area 4309 acres) in 1871 was 18,616, and in 1881 it was 20,935; that of the township of North Bierley (area 3342 acres) in the same years was 14,433 and 15,620.
