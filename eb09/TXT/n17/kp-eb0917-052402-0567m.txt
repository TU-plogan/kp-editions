NOBILI, Leopoldo (1784-1834), was in youth an officer of artillery, but afterwards became professor of physics in the archducal museum at Florence, the old habitat of the Accademia del Cimento. His most valuable contributions to science consist in the suggestion of the astatic combination of two needles, by which the sensibility of a galvanometer is so greatly increased, and in the invention of the so-called thermo-multiplier or thermo-electric pile. His own experimental work with these instruments was soon eclipsed by the brilliant applications made of them by Melloni and Forbes. He also discovered the exquisitely coloured transparent films of metal deposited by electrochemical processes, which from their common form are usually known as Nobili’s rings. Guebhard has lately improved the process for producing them. Nobili has left a large number of theoretical writings, chiefly on magnetism, light, and electricity, most of which are to be found in the Bibliothèque Universelle of Geneva. It is worthy of note that for the measurement of currents he seems to have preferred the use of his “rings” to the use of the galvanometer.
