NATAL, a city of Brazil, the capital of the province of Rio Grande do Norte, is situated on the eastern bank of the river of that name, 2 miles above the mouth, with its fort in 5° 45' S. lat. and 35° 13' 12" W. long. Though the water on the bar is only 14 feet at low tide, Natal is the first port of any note to the south of Cape Roque, and trades in cotton, sugar, dye-wood, and other local produce. It was founded in 1597. The population is about 11,000.
