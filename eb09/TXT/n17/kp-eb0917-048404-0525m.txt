NICHOLAS V. (Pietro di Corvara), antipope in Italy from 1328 to 1330, during the pontificate of John XXII. at Avignon, was a native of the Abruzzi and a member of the Franciscan order. He owed his nomination to the papacy, and his election (May 12, 1328) by popular [9:17:485] acclamation, to the influence of the excommunicated emperor Louis the German, on whose head he placed the crown after his own enthronement. After spending four months in Rome he withdrew along with Louis to Viterbo and thence to Pisa; but, on the revolt of that city from Ghibellinism, he was compelled to throw himself on the mercy of John. Carried to Avignon, on making full confession and abjuration of his heresies and impieties {September 6, 1330), he was kept in honourable imprisonment in the papal palace until his death in 1334.
