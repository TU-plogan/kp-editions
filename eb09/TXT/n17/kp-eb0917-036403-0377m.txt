NEU-SANDEC, or Neu-Sandez (Polish, N^oviSdcz), the chief town of a district in western Galicia, lies on the river Dunajec, about 45 miles to the south-east of Cracow. It contains a mediaeval chateau, a Gothic church of 1448, a Protestant church, a gymnasium, and several benevolent [9:17:365] institutions. In Alt-Sandec, a little to the south, at the confluence of the Poprad and Dunajec, is an old convent of Clarissine nuns, formerly one of the wealthiest in Poland. Sandec was founded by Wenzel, king of Poland and Bohemia, in 1294. It contains (1880) 11,185 inhabitants, most of whom are Protestants.
