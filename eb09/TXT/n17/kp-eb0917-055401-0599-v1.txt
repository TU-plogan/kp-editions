NORTH, Sir Dudley (1641-1691), political economist, was third son of Dudley, fourth Lord North, wdιo published, besides other things, Passages relating to the Long Parliament, of which he had himself been a member. He was born 16th May 1641. In his early years he was carried off by Gipsies and recovered with some difficulty by his family,—an incident curiously similar to that which befell Adam Smith in his infancy. He entered the mercantile profession, engaged in foreign trade, especially with Turkey, and spent a number of years at Constantinople and Smyrna. Some notices of the manners and customs of the East were printed from his papers by his brother. Having returned to London with a considerable fortune, he continued to prosecute trade with the Levant. His ability and knowledge of commerce attracted the attention of the Government, and he was further recommended by the influence of his brother Lord Guilford. During the Tory reaction under Charles II. he was a pliant instrument in the hands of the court, and was one of the sheriffs forced on the city of London with an express view to securing verdicts for the crown in the state trials of the period. He obtained the honour of knighthood, and was appointed a commissioner of customs, afterwards of the treasury, and again of the customs. Having been elected a member of parliament under James II., “he took,” says Roger North, “the place of manager for the crown in all matters of revenue.” After the Revolution he was called to account for his alleged unconstitutional proceedings in his office of sheriff, and did not show much highmindedness in his defence. He died 31st December 1691.

The work by which he has obtained an honourable place in the history of political economy is his Discourses upon Trade, principally directed to the cases of the interest, coinage, clipping and increase of money. This tract was published anonymously in 1691. It is supposed that for some unknown reason it was suppressed soon after its appearance; however this may be, it became very scarce, so that, in his brother’s words, “it hath been ever since utterly sunk, and a copy not to be had for money.” It does not seem to have been much noticed on its publication, or used by subsequent writers. A copy was purchased at the sale of the Rev. Rogers Ruding, author of a work on the coinage, and from this a gentleman of Edinburgh printed some copies for distribution. Other copies of the original impression were afterwards discovered, and from them J. R. M i Culloch edited the tract in the Select Collection of Early English Tracts on Commerce printed by the Political Economy Club of London in 1856. North is named by Roscher as one of that “great triumvirate” which in the 17th century raised the English school of economists to the foremost place in Europe, the other members of the group being Locke and Petty. His tract, Roscher further remarks, reads like a chapter of the Wealth of Nations. It does, indeed, in a very remarkable manner anticipate the doctrines of Adam Smith and the later free-trade school. Its author was quite free from the errors and prejudices of the mercantilism which was dominant in his day, and which had misled on some subjects even so able a writer as Child, against whom, though without naming him, North’s arguments on the legal limitation of the rate of interest appear to be in part directed. At the end of the preface to the Discourses are brought together a number of propositions, embodying the author’s views, which he announces as “paradoxes, no less strange to most men than true in themselves.” They are so remarkable for the time at [9:17:555] which they appeared, more than eighty years before Smith’s great work, that they deserve to be quoted in full.

‘ * That the whole world as to trade is but as one nation or people, and therein nations are as persons. That the loss of a trade with one nation is not that only, separately considered, but so much of the trade of the world rescinded and lost, for all is combined together. That there can be no trade unprofitable to the public, for, if any prove so, men leave it off; and wherever the traders thrive, the public, of which they are a part, thrive also. That to force men to deal in any prescribed manner may profit such as happen to serve them; but the public gains not, because it is taking from one subject to give to another. That no laws can set prices in trade, the rates of which must and will make themselves; but, when such laws do happen to lay any hold, it is so much impediment to trade, and therefore prejudicial. That money is a merchandise, whereof there may be a glut as well as a scarcity, and that even to an inconvenience. That a people cannot want money to serve the ordinary dealing, and more than enough they will not have. That no man shall be the richer for the making much money, nor have any part of it, but as he buys it for an equivalent price. That the free coinage is a perpetual motion found out whereby to melt and coin without ceasing, and so to feed goldsmiths and coiners at the public charge. That debasing the coin is defrauding one another, and to the public there is no sort of advantage from it, for that admits no character, or value, but intrinsic. That the sinking money by alloy or weight is all one. That exchange and ready money are the same, nothing but carriage and re-carriage being saved. That money exported in trade is an increase to the wealth of the nation, but spent in war and payments abroad is so much impoverishment. In short, that all favour to one trade or interest against another is an abuse, and cuts so much of profit from the public.” The tract closes with these weighty words: “No people ever yet grew rich by policies; but it is peace, industry, and freedom that bring trade and wealth, and nothing else.”
