NADIYÁ, or Nuddea, a district in the lieutenantgovernorship of Bengal, lying between 22° 52' 33'' and 24° 1Γ N. lat., and between 88° 11' and 89° 24' 41" E. long., bounded on the N. by Râjshâhi, on the E. by Pabnd and Jessor, on the S. by the 24 Parganâs, and on the W. by Hιigli, Bardwân, Birbhùm, and Murshidàbâd districts, with an area of 3404 square miles. It is emphatically a district of great rivers. Standing at the head of the Gangetic delta, its alluvial surface, though still liable to periodical inundation, has been raised by ancient deposits of silt sufficiently high to be permanent dry land. Along the entire northeastern boundary flows the wide stream of the Padma or Ganges; and all the remaining rivers of the district are offshoots of the great river. The Bhâgirathi on the eastern border, and the Jalangi and the Matabhanga meandering through the centre of the district, are the chief of these offshoots, and are called distinctively the “Nadiyâ rivers.” But the whole surface of the country is interlaced with a network of minor streams, communicating with one another by side channels. All the rivers are navigable in the rainy season for boats of the largest burthen, but during the rest of the year they dwindle down to shallow streams, with dangerous sandbanks and bars.

In former times the Nadiya rivers afforded the regular means of communication between the upper valley of the Ganges and the seaboard; and much of the trade of the district still comes down to Calcutta by this route during the height of the rainy season. But the liues of the East Indian and Eastern Bengal Railways, with the main stream of the Ganges and the Sundarbans route, now carry by far the larger portion of the traffic.

The census of 1881 returned the population at 2,017,847, of whom 1,146,603 were Mohammedans and 864,773 Hindus. Of the 6439 Christians, 6304 were natives. Krishnagar had 24,477 inhabitants in 1881; and six others had in 1872 a population exceeding 5000:—Santipur, 28,635; Kushtia, 9245; Ranaghât, 8871; Nadiya, 8863; Mihrpur, 5562; and Kumârkhàli, 5251. Nadiya, the ancient capital, was formerly situated on the east bank of the Bhagirathi (which has since changed its course). It has always been celebrated for the sanctity ami learning of its pandits. The battlefield of Plassey was situated in this district, but the floods of the Bhagirathi have washed away the scene of that memorable engagement. «

Rice is the staple crop, and there are four harvests in the year. Indigo is the chief export staple; but the district was the centre of the indigo riots in 1860, and the industry then received a blow from which it has never recovered. A large proportion of the cultivable area of the district is held on utbandi tenure—that is, for a single season only, the rents being assessed according to the out turn of the crop. Floods are common, and frequently cause much damage.

The number of indigo factories is still considerable. Cottonweaving is carried on, but is everywhere on the decline, especially at the town of Santipur, where, in the beginning of the century, the Company used to purchase muslin to the annual value of £150,000. Santipur muslin is still exported to a small extent. Raw date sugar is largely manufactured. The chief exports are indigo, jute, linseed, wheat, pulses and gram, rice, chillies, sugar, and tobacco.

The only institutions in the district worthy of note are the tols or indigenous Sanskrit schools. In these snιriti (Hindu social and religious law) and nydya (logic) are taught by learned pandits to eager pupils. The tols consist generally of a mere collection of mud hovels round a quadrangle, where the students live in the most primitive manner, each in his own hut, with his brass water-pot and mat, and seldom any other furniture. A student generally remains at the tol for eight or ten years. No fees are charged, and the pandits depend for their livelihood on the presents which their fame as teachers ensures them at religious ceremonies. Most of the tols are in Nadiya town, but there are also a few in the surrounding villages. Their number is rapidly decreasing.

The district revenue in 1880-81 amounted to Rs. 1,654,813, Rs. 1,051,776 being derived from the land-tax. Education was afforded in 1877 by 897 schools, attended by 28,489 pupils. The principal educational institution is the Government college at Krishnagar. The average annual temperature is 77° Fahr.; the average annual rainfall about 65 inches. Besides remittent and intermittent fevers, which cause very great mortality, small-pox, diarrhoea, dysentery, and cholera are prevalent. Cattle disease is common.
