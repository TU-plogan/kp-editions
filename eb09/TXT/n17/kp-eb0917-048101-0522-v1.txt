NICEPHORUS I., emperor of Constantinople from 802 to 811, born at Seleucia in Pisidia, is alleged on very doubtful authority to have been a descendant of Jaballah, who had been monarch of the small Arabian kingdom of Ghassân in the time of Heraclius, and for a time had professed the Mohammedan religion. In the reign of Irene he rose to the office of logothetes, or lord high treasurer, and in 802 he was joined by her favourite eunuchs in a plot by which she was dethroned and exiled, while he himself assumed the crown (October 31). Soon after his accession, Bardanes, one of his ablest generals, rose in revolt against him and received much powerful support, including that of Leo the Armenian and Michael the Armorian (names which reappear in history), but the skilful diplomacy of Nicephorus soon brought the rebel to the position of a suppliant, willing to accept the seclusion of a monastery. The conspiracy headed by the patrician Arsaber in 808 had a similar issue. In 803 Nicephorus had entered into a treaty with Charlemagne by which the limits of the tλvo empires were amicably fixed,— Venice, Istria, the maritime parts of Dalmatia, and South Italy being assigned to the East, while Rome, Ravenna, and the Pentapolis were recognized as belonging to the West; this treaty was renewed in 810. Shortly after the retirement of Bardanes, who had been appointed to march against the Saracens, Nicephorus in person took the field against Haroun al·-Rashid, but sustained a great defeat at Crasus in Phrygia; and subsequent inroads of his conqueror compelled him to sue for peace, which was granted only on condition of an annual tribute of 30,000 pieces of gold, besides three additional pieces (perhaps, as Finlay suggests, medallions of superior size) for himself, and three for his son Stauracius. By the death of Haroun in 809 Nicephorus was left free to turn his attention to the Bulgarians, whose warlike king, Crumn, had begun to harass the empire in the north; but six days after it had crossed the frontier the powerful Byzantine army was [9:17:482] attacked in force by night, and Nicephorus, along with six patricians, many officers of high military rank, and a large number of rank and file, was put to the sword. Crumn is recorded to have made a drinking cup of the emperor’s skull. After a brief reign of two months, Stauracius, who had been proclaimed emperor by the soldiers, was deposed by his brother-in-law, Michael Rhangabe. Nicephorus, who “though a brave soldier was essentially a statesman,” gave considerable attention to the finance department of the empire, but did not escape the imputation of avarice and oppression. Ecclesiastically his reign is noted for the comparative success with which he asserted the supremacy of the civil power, and gave effective preponderance to imperial over monkish opinion.
