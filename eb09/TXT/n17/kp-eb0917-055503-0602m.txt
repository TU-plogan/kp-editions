NORTH ADAMS, a township, manufacturing village, and important railway junction of the United States in Berkshire county, Massachusetts, on the Hoosac river, 143 miles from Boston by the Troy and Boston Railroad. Cotton and wool-weaving and shoemaking are the leading industries. The population of the township, formerly included in Adams township, was 10,191 in 1880. About a mile to the east of the village the Hudsonâ€™s Brook is arched over for a considerable distance by a romantic cave from 30 to 60 feet in height. Nathaniel Hawthorne, who spent the summer of 1838 at North Adams, gives a fine description of the spot.
