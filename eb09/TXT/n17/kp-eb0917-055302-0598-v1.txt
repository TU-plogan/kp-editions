NORRKÖPING, the “Manchester of Scandinavia,” a town of Sweden in the province of Östergötland, 113 miles south-west of Stockholm by rail, situated on both banks of the Motala, the wide and rapid emissary of Lake Wetter, and not far from the head of Brävik Fjord. The river, which here forms the two islands of Laksholm and Brux-holm, is spanned by a number of bridges. Having been burned by the Russians in 1719 and visited by further conflagrations in 1812, 1822, and 1826, the whole town, since rebuilt, has quite a modern appearance, with wide and regular streets. Among the more conspicuous buildings are. St Olaf’s church (erected by Gustavus Adolphus in 1616, and rebuilt after 1765-67); St Hedwig’s, built by the German colony in 1670; the town-house, dating from the beginning of the 19th century; the theatre, the Gustavus orphanage, and the palatial high school (1868). The industrial importance of Norrköping has steadily increased from the close of the 18th century Woollen cloth is the great staple (thirty-three factories in 1876), but cotton goods, paper, sugar, flour, tobacco and snufl", soap, starch, <fcc., are also manufactured. Steamers, gun-boats, and ironclads, as well as smaller craft, are constructed in the ship-yards on the lower Motala. At the close of the 17th century Norrköping was a place of from 5000 to 6000 inhabitants; after the Russian invasion it sank to 2600, but afterwards gradually rose, until in 1861 the total amounted to 20,828, and in 1878 to 27,410.

A bull of Pope Lucius III. shows that Norrköping existed in 1185. Margaret held a meeting of the states in the town in 1404. Its fortress, known as Knäppingsberg, was destroyed in 1567. At the meeting of the states in 1604 Duke Charles assumed the Swedish crown as Charles IX.; and not long afterwards Duke John of Östergötland introduced German craftsmen into Norrköping, and thus originated its industrial activity. Under Charles XII. the town suffered not only from war but from pestilence,—2700 of its inhabitants perishing in 1710-11.
