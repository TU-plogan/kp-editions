NÁSIK, or Nassick, a district in the Bombay presidency, India, between 19° 34' and 20° 52' N. lat., and between 73° 21' and 75° 2' E. long., bounded on the N. by Khândesh, E. by the Nizâm’s Dominions, S. by Ahmednagar, and W. by Thânâ (Tanna), with an area of 5940 square miles. With the exception of a few villages in the west, the whole district is situated on a table-land from 1300 to 2000 feet above sea-level. The western portion is hilly, and intersected by ravines, and only the simplest kind of cultivation is possible. The eastern tract is open, fertile, and well cultivated. The Sahyâdri range stretches from north to south; the watershed is formed by the Chânder range, which runs east and west. All the streams to the south of that range are tributaries of the Godâvari. To the north of the watershed, the Girna and its tributary the Mosam flow through fertile valleys into the Tâpti. The district generally is destitute of trees, and the forests which formerly clothed the Sahyâdri hills have nearly disappeared; efforts are now being made to prevent further destruction, and to reclothe some of the slopes. The district contains several old hill forts, the scenes of many engagements during the Mahratta wars. Nâsik district became British territory in 1818 on the overthrow of the peshwâ. The population in 1881 was 781,206 (Hindus 683,579, Mohammedans 35,294).

Nâsik, the chief town of the district (population 22,436), is situated on the Godâvari, and is considered a place of great sanctity by Hindus, who make pilgrimages to its temples from all parts of India. Places of worship fringe both banks of the river, and even the bed of the stream is thickly dotted with temples and shrines. Nâsik has brass and copper works, but commercially is of little more than local importance.
