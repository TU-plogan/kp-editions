NODIER, Charles {c. 1780-1844), a writer of greater intrinsic merit and more importance in the history of French literature than is generally recognized, was born at Besançon somewhat less than ten years before the outbreak of the Revolution, but the exact date is strangely uncertain. Besançon for the place and the 29th of April for the day of the month appear to be agreed upon, but the year is sometimes given as 1780, sometimes as 1781, and sometimes as 1783. The earliest seems the most probable. His father was a lawyer of some distinction and had been a teacher of law, and after the outbreak of the Revolution he was appointed mayor of Besançon and consequently chief police magistrate. He seems, from some euphemistic expressions of his friends, to have rather lent himself as an instrument to the tyranny of the Jacobins than to have shared their principles; but his son was for a time an ardent citizen, and is said to have been a club member when he could at the most have been twelve years old. His education in these troublesome times was necessarily haphazard, but appears to have been sufficient. His love of books began very early, and he combined with it, what is not perhaps very often characteristic of the bibliophile proper, a strong interest in natural science. The dates of his early life are given very sparingly, and the chief authority for the details of it is his own Souvenirs, a not very trustworthy source. Having obtained and then lost the post of librarian in his native town, he went to Paris and plunged into literature. He had published a dissertation on the antennae in insects as early as 1798 at Besançon. Entomology continued to be a favourite study with him, but he varied it with philology and pure literature— Le Peintre de Salzbourg dates from this early period—and even political writing. A “skit” on Napoleon in 1803 got him into trouble, which was not very serious. He was obliged, or thought himself obliged, to quit Paris, and for some years lived a very unsettled life at Besançon, Dole (where he married), and other places. In 1811 he appears at Laibach in the singular character of editor of a polyglot journal, the Illyrian Telegraph, published in French, German, Italian, and Slav. Then he returned to Paris, and the restoration found him, or made him, an ardent royalist. Literary and journalistic work of all kinds filled up his time, until in 1823 he was appointed to the librarianship of the Bibliothèque de ΓArsenal. He was not disturbed in this post by the revolution of July, but, on the contrary, was elected a member of the Academy in 1833, and made a member of the Legion of Honour in 1843, a year before his death, which happened on 27th January 1844. These twenty years at the arsenal were by far the most important and fruitful of Nodier’s life. He had much of the Bohemian in his composition, and the wandering and unsettled life that he had led was more favourable to the cultivation of this feature of his character than to the production of solid work. His post at the arsenal was not very lucrative, and even after his appointment his way of life is said by some chroniclers not to have been extraordinarily regular. But he had the advantage of a settled home in which to collect rare books (for which he had a real vocation), and to study them; and, what was of still more importance, he was able to supply a centre and rallying place to a knot of young literary men of greater individual talent than himself—the so-called Romantics of 1830—and to colour their tastes and work very decidedly with his own predilections. Much older than most of them, possessing a literary reputation already formed, though resting on no single work of great importance, with very decided idiosyncrasies and a considerable power of personally influencing his associates, Nodier must be credited with no small part in the making of the men of 1830.

His own literary work is abundant, but much of it is obsolete, much more mere miscellanies, much injured by hasty production, and some, it is said, is not due to himself. His best and most characteristic work, some of which is exquisite in its kind, consists partly of short tales of a more or less fantastic character, partly of nondescript articles, half bibliographic, half narrative, the nearest analogue to which in English is to be found in some of the papers of De Quincey. The best examples of the latter are to be found in the volume entitled Mélanges tirés d'une Petite Bibliothèque, published in 1829 and afterwards continued. Of his tales the best are Smarra (1821), Histoire du Roi de Bohême et de ses sept Châteaux (1830), La Fée aux Miettes (1832), Inès de las Sierras (1837), Légende de Soeur Béatrix (1838), together with some fairy stories published in the year of his death, and Franciscus Columna, which appeared after it. The Souvenirs de Jeunesse (1832), already referred to, are interesting but untrustworthy, and the Dictionnaire Universel de la Langue Française (1823), a book of considerable merit, which, in the days before Littré, was one of the most useful of its kind, is said to have been not wholly or mainly Nodier’s. His chief tales are accessible in three or four volumes of the Bibliothèque Charpentier, and the best yield to few things in French for charm of style and especially for the rendering of fantastic and picturesque sentiment, but they are very unequal. There is a so-called collection of Oeuvres Complètes, in 12 vols., 1832, but at that time much of the author’s best work had not appeared, and it included but a part of what was actually published.
