NEW BERNE, or Newbern, a city of the United States, the capital of Craven county, North Carolina, and the port of entry of the district of Pamlico, is situated at the meeting of the Neuse and the Trent, on the Atlantic and North Carolina Railroad, 107 miles south-east of Raleigh. Vessels drawing 8âˆ£ feet can reach the wharves at mean water-level, and steamers run regularly to New York, Baltimore, and Norfolk. Cotton, lumber, naval stores, fish, rice, corn, and early vegetables for the northern markets are the chief articles of trade. Tobacco factories, turpentine distilleries, candy factories, lumber mills, a wooden-plate factory, a cotton-seed-oil factory, a rice mill, and a cigar factory are the most noteworthy of the industrial establishments in the city. The population was 5849 in 1850, and 6443 in 1880. Founded by Swiss settlers in 1701, New Berne continued to be the capital of the province of North Carolina till 1793. It was captured by Burnside in 1862, and suffered from fire.
