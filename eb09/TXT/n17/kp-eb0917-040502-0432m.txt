NEWPORT, a municipal and parliamentary borough of Hampshire, and the county town of the Isle of Wight, is situated near the centre of the island, at the head of the navigation of the Medina river, about 7 miles from the sea at Cowes. Three separate railway lines connect it with Cowes, Ryde, and Ventnor. On account of its central position Newport has since the decay of the more ancient town of Carisbrooke absorbed the principal trade of the island. The church of St Thomas of Canterbury, rebuilt in 1854 in the Decorated style, contains many interesting old monuments; and one by Marochetti to the princess Elizabeth, daughter of Charles I., has been erected by Queen Victoria. Carisbrooke castle is about a mile from the town, and Parkhurst barracks are in the immediate neighbourhood. The guildhall, erected in 1816 from the designs of Nash, includes the town-hall in the upper story with the market-place below. The grammar school (the scene of the negotiations between Charles I. and the Parliament) was founded in 1612, and there is a blue-coat school for girls founded in 1761. A considerable trade is carried on in timber, malt, wheat, and flour; and Newport is the commercial centre whence the smaller towns of the island are supplied. The boundary of the borough of Newport was defined and extended by the Newport Borough Act, 1876. The population of the municipal borough (area 501 acres) in 1881 was 9357, and of the parliamentary borough (area 410 acres) 9144.

When the lordship of the Isle of Wight passed from the lords of Carisbrooke to Edward I., Newport began to supersede Carisbrooke as the chief town of the island. Camden speaks of it as the principal seaport of the island, “intimes past Medena and Novus Burgus de Meden,” that is, the new borough of Medina. In the 23d of Edward I. it sent two members to parliament, but not again till the 27th of Elizabeth, from which time it enjoyed the privilege without interruption until 1867, when the number of members was reduced to one. The borough was incorporated by James I.
