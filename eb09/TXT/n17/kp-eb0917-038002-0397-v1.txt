NEWCASTLE-UNDER-LYME (or Lyne), a municipal and parliamentary borough of Staffordshire, England, is situated on a small stream, the Lyme brook, and near the Grand Trunk Canal, 16 miles north-north-west of Stafford, and 35 south from Manchester. The parish church of St Giles was, with the exception of the old square tower, which dates from the 12th century, rebuilt (1873-76) from the pläns of Sir Gilbert Scott, in the Decorated style, at a cost of <£15,000. The free grammar school, originally founded in 1602, possesses very large endowments, increased by the amalgamation of various subsequent bequests for educational purposes, and now consists of a high school for boys, a middle school for boys, and Orme’s school for girls. The high school is a fine structure of red brick in the Elizabethan style, erected in 1874 at a cost of £12,000. There are also national and board schools and a school of art. The other principal buildings are the town-hall, recently rebuilt, the covered market (1854), and the militia barracks. The manufacture of hats was at one time the staple trade, but it has now greatly declined. There are silk, cotton, and paper mills; and tanning, brewing, malting, and sugar-refining are also carried on. In the neighbourhood there are large collieries. The population of the parliamentary borough was 15,948 in 1871, and in 1881 it was 17,493. The municipal borough, which was slightly increased in extent in 1877, had 17,506 inhabitants in 1881.

The town, which was of some importance before the Conquest, derives the name Newcastle from the rebuilding of the castle in the reign of Henry I. The addition Lyme was due to the neighbouring extensive forest of Lyme, which stretched'into Cheshire. The town and manor reverted in 1231 to Henry III. In 1263 the town and castle were bestowed on Simon de Montfort, on whose death they were forfeited to the crown. The town received its first charter from Henry II., and this was extended by Henry III. and Elizabeth. It possessed the privilege of returning two members to parliament some time before 1352.
