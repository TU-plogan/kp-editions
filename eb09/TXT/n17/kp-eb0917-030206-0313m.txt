NAZARETH, in Galilee, now al-Nasira, the city of Mary and Joseph, and the place where our Lord spent his youth, is pleasantly situated in a hollow on the south slope of the hills (J. al-Sikh) which bound the plain of Esdraelon on the north. Though it had a synagogue (Matt, xiii. 54; Luke iv. 16), and is called in the Gospels a city, Nazareth [9:17:303] must have been an obscure place^[1. Even the form of the name is uncertain, Nαfαpeτ, Nafap∈0, Naζapd. These variations are intelligible in a Hebrew or Syriac name with fem. termination, but hardly enable us to fix the original form. In Syriac and Arabic the £ is transcribed as sharp s; thus the root of the name Nazareth would be n-s-r, and so many ancients and moderns suppose that in Matt. ii. 23 the prophecy referred to is that of the Branch (néser) in Isa. xi. 1. ] in the time of Jesus, for we find no mention of it outside of the New Testament till Eusebius and Jerome identify it with a “village” which undoubtedly occupied the place of the modern Nasira. In Jerome’s time it was already visited by pilgrims, but as yet we hear nothing of relics or places associated with special incidents in the life of Jesus. The population was mainly Jewish,—exclusively so, we are told by Epiphanius, down to the time of Constantine,—and the Jews, after their manner in modern as in ancient times, seem to have been the inventors of various marvellous relics and identifications which were palmed off upon Christian pilgrims in the 6th century. Such at least is the natural inference from what Antoninus Martyr tells of these wonderfully friendly and communicative Hebrews. A century later Arculphus describes two great churches corresponding to the modern Greek church over the Virgin’s Well and the Latin church of the Franciscan monastery over the Grotto of the Annunciation. The place has since passed through various vicissitudes; it was most flourishing in the time of the crusaders, who transferred to it the bishopric of Scythopolis. The Ottomans at length expelled the Christians; but the Franciscans established themselves under the protection of Fakhr al-Din in 1620. The town has now a Greek, a Latin, and a Moslem quarter, as well as a Protestant mission and orphanage. The population is variously estimated at from 6000 to 10,000.

The Virgin’s Well, just outside the town, must have been frequented by the women of ancient as of modern Nazareth; all the other traditional sites are highly dubious. But this hardly affects the interest attaching to the town, for the character of Nazareth must at all times have depended on its position and surroundings. It was a little country town of peasants and handicraftsmen, nestling in olive groves and green meadows, separated and yet not distant from the busy life of the greater Galilaean cities, surrounded on all sides by the pleasantest landscapes of Canaan. The hill above the town commands one of the finest views in Galilee, from Hermon to Mount Carmel.
