NEUBURG, a small town of Bavaria, in the district of Schwaben und Neuburg, is pleasantly situated on the Danube, and in 1880 contained 7690 inhabitants, three-fourths of whom are Roman Catholics. It is a place of very ancient origin, but is chiefly noteworthy from the fact that for three centuries (1503-1802) it was the capital of the independent duchy of Pfalz-Neuburg. The most important building is the old ducal chateau, the handsomest part of which is in the Renaissance style of the 16 th century. A considerable trade in agricultural products is carried on by the Danube.
