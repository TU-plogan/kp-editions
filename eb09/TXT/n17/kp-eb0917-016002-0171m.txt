NABHA, or Narbal, one of the Cis-Sutlej states in the Punjab, India, lying between 30° 17' and 30° 40' N. lat., and between 75° 50' and 76° 20' E. long., has an area of 863 square miles, with a population in 1881 of 261,824. The first relations of the state with the British were in 1807-8, when the râjâ applied for and obtained protection against the threatened encroachments of Ranjit Sinh. During the mutiny in 1857 this chief showed distinguished loyalty, and was rewarded by grants of territory to the value of over £10,000. The râjâ is a Sikh of the Sidhu Jât tribe; he has full powers of life and death over his subjects, and has an estimated annual revenue of £65,000. The chief products of the state are sugar, cereals, cotton, and tobacco.,
