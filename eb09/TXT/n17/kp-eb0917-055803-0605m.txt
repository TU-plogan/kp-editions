NORTHAMPTON, Spencer Compton, Earl of (1601- 1643), born in 1601, was the son of the Lord Compton who obtained a large fortune by his wife, the daughter of Sir John Spencer, the rich lord mayor, and who was created earl of Northampton in 1618. The young Lord Compton accompanied Prince Charles to Spain in 1623. He succeeded to the earldom in 1630. Though he sometimes appeared at court ceremonies, he preferred a home life. In the Civil War he took the king’s side, opposing Lord Brook L· Warwickshire in 1642, and taking part in the battle of Edgehill. When Banbury was taken he was placed in command of the garrison, and was active on the Royalist side in Staffordshire and Northamptonshire, as well as in his own county of Warwick. On 19th March 1643 he was dismounted in the fight at Hopton Heath near Stafford. His life was offered to him, but he answered that “he scorned to take quarter from such base rogues and rebels as they were,” and was immediately slain.
