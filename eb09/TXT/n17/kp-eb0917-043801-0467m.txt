NEWTON, a city of the United States, in Middlesex county, Massachusetts, about 8 miles west of Boston, on the south bank of the Charles river. It is divided into seven wards, and contains the post-villages of Auburndale, Chestnut Hill, Newton, Newton Centre, Newton Highlands, Newton Lower Falls, Newton Upper Falls, Newtonville, West Newton, and Nonantum. Newton is principally inhabited by Boston merchants, and, each village being a collection of fine residences with beautiful grounds, it has been designated “the Garden City of New England.” The water-power furnished by the river is turned to account by numerous manufactories producing paper, hosiery, dye stuffs, emery paper, ink, soap, shoddy, &c. The first Baptist theological seminary in America was established in Newton Centre in 1826; it is now a flourishing institution with a library of 15,000 volumes, and five resident professors. Laselle Female Seminary at Auburndale dates from 1851. First settled in 1630, Newton was incorporated as a town in 1679, as a city in 1873. Its population was 3351 in 1840, 8382 in 1860, 12,825 in 1870, and 16,995 in 1880.
