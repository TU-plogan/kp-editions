NEUTRA (Hungarian, Nyitra), the chief town of a district and bishopric of the same name in Hungary, is situated on the river Neutra, 90 miles to the east of Vienna. It lies partly on the slope of a hill, which is strongly fortified, and crowned with the episcopal chateau and the ancient and modern cathedrals. The town also contains three convents, a theological seminary, a gymnasium, and two hospitals, and carries on manufactures of vinegar, spirits, and liqueurs. Its grain-markets are important. Neutra has lagged far behind most Hungarian towns in the march of improvement, and a recent visitor describes its internal economy as on a par with that of Bokhara and other towns in Central Asia. The population in 1880 was 8650.

Neutra is one of the oldest towns in Hungary, and is said to have been the seat of a bishop in the 4th century, when in possession of the Marcomanni. The present and historically authenticated line of bishops dates from 1130.
