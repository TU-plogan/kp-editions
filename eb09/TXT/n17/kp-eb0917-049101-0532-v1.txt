NICOSIA is the name in common use, though originally a mere corruption of the Greek name Lefkosia, for the capital of Cyprus. It is situated in the midst of the great plain of the Mesaria, which traverses the island from sea to sea, and is nearly equidistant from the Gulf of Morphu at one end and that of Famagosta at the other. Though the name of Lefkosia (Λευκωσία) is undoubtedly Greek, it is not found in the ancient geography of the island; and, though the discovery of some ancient tombs in the immediate neighbourhood prove that the site was inhabited in very early times, no mention is found of it before the reign of Constantine, by whom it was fortified with a circuit of walls, which continued to exist down to the time of the Venetians. It became the capital of the island under the kings of the Lusignan dynasty, who were the rulers of Cyprus from 1192 to 1489,—an advantage which it probably owed to its inland, and somewhat central, situation, though in other respects its position affords few advantages. It stands in a barren and treeless plain, on the banks of the river Pedias, which is, however, a mere shingly bed during the greater part of the year, and the town is dependent for its supply of water upon an aqueduct by which it is conveyed from the neighbouring hills. Like many other Oriental towns, Nicosia has rather an imposing effect from a distance, in consequence especially of its lofty walls, built by the Venetians to replace the previously existing circuit, which remain unbroken to the present day. Above these towers the beautiful Gothic cathedral, now converted into a mosque. But the interior of the city is a mere labyrinth of narrow streets, and presents an aspect of great decay. The population, which was previously estimated at 16,000, was found by an actual census, taken in 1879, to amount to only 11,197 souls, of whom 5628 were Mohammedans and 5251 Greeks. Since the occupation of Cyprus by the English, some improvements have been introduced at Nicosia, which still continues to be the capital of the island, and the residence of the British commissioner, as well as of the Greek archbishop. A new carriage road has also been constructed from thence to Larnaca, which is becoming a place of considerable trade. But the natural disadvantages of its situation will probably prevent Nicosia from ever rising again to an important town. At the present day it is worthless as a fortress, on account of its being completely commanded from the neighbouring heights.
