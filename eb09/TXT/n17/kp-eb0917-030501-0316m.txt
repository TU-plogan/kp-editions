NEANDER, Joachim (c. 1650-1680), German hymnwriter, when about twenty years of age came under the influence of a Labadist preacher (see vol. xiv. 163) named Untereyk, in his native city of Bremen. After studying at Heidelberg and Frankfort, where he formed friendships with Spanheim and Spener, he settled at Düsseldorf as rector of the Latin school in connexion with the Reformed Church. His Labadist views were somewhat out of harmony with those of the rulers and of the church, and in 1676 he incurred church censure for abstaining and inducing others to abstain from joining in the celebration of the communion. It was during the term of his suspension from his teaching office that many of his hymns were written. He ultimately renounced his connexion with the separatists, and in 1679 returned to Bremen as one of the preachers of St Martin’s church. In the same year he published the Bundeslieder and Dankpsalmen. He died in 1680. The Neanderthal near Düsseldorf takesits name from him. For his place in hymnology see vol. xii. p. 587.
