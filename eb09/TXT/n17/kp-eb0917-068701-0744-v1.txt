NUTTALL, Thomas (1786-1859), botanist and ornithologist in the United States of America, where he lived and worked from 1808 until 1842, was born at Settle in Yorkshire in 1786, and spent some years as a journeyman printer in England. Soon after going to the United States he was induced by Professor Barton to apply himself to the study of the plants of that region; and in pursuance of his investigations he undertook many long and arduous as well as dangerous journeys, usually spending the summers in the field and the winters in working out the materials accumulated during his expeditions. In 1822 he was appointed curator of the botanic gardens of Harvard university, but continued his explorations, and in 1834 crossed the continent to the Pacific Ocean, and visited the Sandwich Islands. Some property having been left him in England on condition of his residing on it during part of each year, he left America in 1842, and did not again revisit it, except for a short time in 1852. He died at St Helen’s, Lancashire, 10th September 1859.

Almost the whole of his scientific work was done in the States, and his published works appeared there. The more important of these are, The Genera of North American Plants, and a Catalogue of the Species for the year 1817, 2 vols. (1818); Journal of Travels into the Arkansas Territory during the year 1819 (1821); The North American Sylva, 3 vols. (1842-1849); Manual of the Ornithology of the United States and of Canada (1834 and 1840); and numerous papers on similar subjects in the various American scientific periodicals.
