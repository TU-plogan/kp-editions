NEWTOWNARDS, or Newtownardes, a market-town, formerly a parliamentary borough, of the county Down, Ireland, is beautifully situated near the northern extremity of Lough Strangford, on the Belfast and County Down Railway, 9⅜ miles east of Belfast and 4⅜ south by west of Bangor. The town, which is sheltered by hills on the west and north, is well built, and possesses a fine square, from which the principal streets diverge. There is a courthouse and a town-hall. In the market square the pedestal of an ancient cross was erected in 1636. Muslin embroidery is the principal industry, a hem-stitching factory affording employment to 500 females. There is also a mill for flax and hemp yarns. In the neighbourhood there are freestone quarries. The population in 1871 was 9562, and in 1881 it was 8676.

From an early period there were a large number of religious foundations in the district, and the town owes its origin to a Dominican monastery founded in 1244 by Walter de Burgh. The town was forfeited by the O’Neills, and given to the Hamiltons and Montgomeries, from whom it passed to the marquis of Londonderry. It received a charter from James I., and until the Union returned two members to parliament.
