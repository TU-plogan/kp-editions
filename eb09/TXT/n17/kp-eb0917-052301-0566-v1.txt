NOAH (⅛ Nω∈, Noe) is, according to the book of Genesis, the son of Lamech, and the second father of mankind after the deluge. His name, which is of obscure origin, is connected in Gen. v. 29 with a play on the word DΠ3 (nahem), to comfort. The story of the flood, the two elements of which the extant narrative is composed, and the parallel traditions of other nations, particularly of the Babylonians, have been spoken of in the article Deluge. The earlier narrative does not mention the point at which Noah left the ark, and it is doubtful if Gen. xi. 1 sq., which seems to be a fragment of a still older tradition, and which makes mankind disperse from Babylonia, originally stood in any connexion with the story of Noah and the flood. The later priestly (or, as it used to be called, Elohistic) narrative names the mountains of Ararat, i.e., one of the mountains of the land of Ararat, as the place where the ark rested. The identification of this mountain with the Ararat of modern maps (Μ. Masis) is tolerably old; Jerome (on Isa. xxxvii. 38) already places the land of Ararat in this quarter; but a more ancient Jewish tradition, which remained alive throughout the Middle Ages, seeks Ararat in the land of Kardu, i.e., the mountains of the Kurds east of the Tigris (comp. Ararat). From the Bible it is only certain (Isa. xxxvii. 38; Jer. li. 27) that the kingdom of Ararat was a remote northern district. After describing the covenant which God made with Noah on leaving the ark (Gen. ix. 1-17) the priestly narrative has nothing further to tell of the patriarch’s life; but an older fragment (Gen. ix. 20-27) makes him plant a vineyard and drink of the wine with consequences which lead him to pronounce a blessing on Shem and Japheth and a curse of slavery on Canaan. The story seems to require, for clearness, the omission of the words “Ham, the father of” in verse 22; and if this be so we find that in one tradition the sons of Noah are Shem, Japheth, and Canaan. So taken, the names of the three sons would represent three elements, not in the population of the world, but in that of Palestine. Shem, in Hebrew, means name, and “sons of name,” as opposed to “sons of no name” (Job xxx. 8, A. V., “sons of base men ”), would naturally denote the Hebrew pure-blooded aristocracy, in antithesis to the subject aborigines (Canaan). Wellhausen, to whom this ingenious theory is due, would further identify Japheth in this passage with the Philistines; Budde thinks rather of the Phoenicians. That the divisions Shem, Ham, and Japheth had not always one fixed sense is clear from Gen. x., where two distinct schemes of classification have been mixed up with such results as that Sheba and Havilah appear under Ham at ver. 7, and under Shem in ver. 28 sq. The one division appears to be mainly geographical, and is preserved complete, vers. 2-7, 20-23, 31; it bears the marks of the priestly narrator, and was not written before the exile. On the other hand, vers. 8-19, 25-30 belong to the older narrative, and are fragments of a classification seemingly more ethnographical in character.
