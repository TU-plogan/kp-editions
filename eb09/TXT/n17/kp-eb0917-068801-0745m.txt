NYIREGYHAZA, a town of Hungary, in the district of Szabolcs, is situated at the junction of the river Theiss and the railways of the north-east of Hungary, 30 miles to the north of Debreczin. It contains four churches, a gymnasium, and a mineral bath. The inhabitants of the town, who numbered 24,102 in 1880, are engaged in agriculture, wine-growing, and the manufacture of soda, matches, and saltpetre. The annual fairs are largely frequented. A little to the north-west is the famous wineproducing district of Tokay, which yields about 18 million gallons of wine annually, including 3 or 4 million gallons of genuine Tokay.
