NEWPORT, a city of the United States, capital of Campbell county, Kentucky, lies on the south bank of the Ohio river, opposite Cincinnati, and separated from Covington by the Licking river. With the larger city it is connected by a road-and-railway pier bridge, and with the lesser by a suspension bridge partly used by a street railway. Practically both Newport and Covington are residental suburbs of Cincinnati, but in the matter of population (20,433 in 1880) Newport ranks third among the cities in the State. The local manufactories comprise rolling-mills, steel-works, iron foundries, watch-case factories, and stove factories. For many years a small garrison of United States soldiers has been stationed here. The first settlement dates from 1791.
