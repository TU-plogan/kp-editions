NEMESIS occasionally appears as a Greek goddess. At Rhamnus in Attica she had a famous temple, and there was an Attic legend that Helen was the daughter of Nemesis. The Attic goddess was perhaps a form of Aphrodite, who sometimes bears the epithet Nemesis. In Smyrna and the neighbouring Temnos we find a pair of goddesses of the name. They are represented on coins of these cities, and it is said that they appeared in a dream to Alexander the Great, bidding him rebuild Smyrna. They are certainly connected with the cultus of Meter Sipylene or Cybele, the tutelary goddess of Smyrna and all the country round Mount Sipylus. In general Nemesis appears as a personification of that righteous indignation which punishes the arrogant and tyrannical abuse of prosperity. Often the idea is carried much further than this; in Herodotus especially the divine Nemesis is offended by all great prosperity among men, quite irrespective of the moral guilt of the persons concerned.
