NAWAWÍ. Mohyi al-Din Abd Zakaryd Yahya b. Sharaf al-Nawawi, born at Nawd in Jauldn, October 1233, head of the Ashrafia academy at Damascus from 1267, died at Nawd 20th December 1277, where his grave is still visited as that of a saint. To this honour he has better claims than most Moslem sheikhs, for not only was his life one of the most intense and unselfish devotion to learning, but he had the rare courage to take open part for his oppressed countrymen against Sultan Bibars, and alone among the Syrian doctors refused to sanction the exactions of which the “Holy War” was the pretext. “Thou hast a thousand mamelukes,” he said, “each of whom wears a golden girdle, and two hundred female slaves adorned with I all manner of jewels. When thou hast spent all this, and [9:17:302] thy mamelukes have only girdles of cord and thy slavegirls only clothes without jewels, I will vote for the tax.” The angry sultan banished him from Damascus, and, though public opinion compelled this sentence to be revoked, Nawawi refused to return while Bibars was in the city.

Forty-two works of Nawawi are catalogued by Wüstenfeld, Leben und Schriften des Scheich . . . el Nawawi, Göttingen, 1849. His biographical ‘ ‘ Dictionary of Illustrious Men chiefly at the Beginning of Islamism,” forming the first part of the Tahdhib al-asmd wal-loghdt (a sort of analytical index to six theological and juristic works), was published by the same scholar, Gottingen, 1842-47. An edition of his manual of Shafi'ite jurisprudence (Mirihàj al-tdlibin), a book of great reputation in the East, has been commenced by L. W. C. van den Berg (vol. i., Batavia, 1882, with French version and notes).
