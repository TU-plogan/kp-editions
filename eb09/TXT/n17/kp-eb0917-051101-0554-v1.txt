NIMROD (Nεβpωδ, LXX.), apart from the mere mention of his name in Micah v. 5 (A.V., v. 6), occurs only once in Scripture, namely, in Gen. x. 8-12 (1 Chron. i. 10), where, in a Jehovistic portion of the genealogy of the nations there given, we are told that “Cush begat Nimrod, who was the first mighty one in the earth (he was a mighty hunter before Jehovah, wherefore it is said—A mighty hunter before Jehovah even as Nimrod), and the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech and Accad, and Calneh in the land of Shinar. Out of that land he went forth into Asshur^[1. Not “out of that land went forth Asshur”; for the “beginning” of his kingdom demands a continuation, and Asshur is called Nimrod’s land in Micah v. 5.] and builded Nineveh,” &c. Just as Enos was the first to call upon the name of Jehovah, and Noah the first to plant vines, so is Nimrod the first mighty ruler in the earth, and as such at the same time a mighty hunter before Jehovah, after the manner of the Oriental sovereigns of old. By the Hebrews the Assyrio-Babylonian empire was at all periods regarded as the prototype of the worldly power; and it is of this kingdom that Nimrod here figures as the founder—not in its prehistorical but in its historical form as actually subsisting at the time of the writer. This is apparent, not only from the general character of the genealogical table, but also from the enumeration of the cities in the land of Shinar and Asshur. As founder of the kingdom, Nimrod represents both kingdom and people; the genealogy knows no distinction between the hero and the nation,—the latter is the family of the former. When, therefore, Nimrod is said to be descended from Cush, the mighty nation of Asshur and Babel (which in Gen. x. 22 is regarded as belonging to

Shem) is also by the Jehovist assigned to Cush. Shem for him seems to have a very narrow meaning, expressing merely the contrast between the Hebrew lords and their Canaanite subjects; Cush, on the other hand (like *Ivδoι with the Greeks), is a very comprehensive and vague word, which does not readily admit of clear geographical or ethnological definition, and therefore also cannot be brought into contrast with Shem if Shem be used in its modern application as indicating race. A god spoken of as “Marri with his hounds” was still worshipped in Harran after the introduction of Christianity (Assem., Bibl. Or., i. 327); that this Marri is akin to Nimrod is suggested on the one hand by his hounds and on the other by the etymology of the two names derived from the synonymous roots mry and mrd. Nimrod looks like a Syriac imperfect of the root mrd, in which case it would seem to follow that the legend arose among the Syrians, the next neighbours of the Babylonians and Assyrians, and from them had passed over to the Hebrews. Then, further, Nimrod may be a modification of the name Merodach, the Babylonian chief god, the final syllable -aclι being dropped.^[2. Compare the converse φaKa>χ, LXX., in 1 Chron. v. 26 for ∕B.] To the later Jews Babylon was the complete embodiment of the enmity of the heathen world against the kingdom of God, and the idea they formed of Nimrod was influenced by this view. The arrogance of his character, which seemed to be implied in his very name, was conceived of as defiance of God, and he became a heaven-storming Titan. As such he built the tower of Babel, and as such was he identified with the giant in bonds in the constellation of Orion. Jewish legend made choice of Abraham to be his antithesis, the representative of God’s kingdom over against the heathen autocrat. Nimrod cast the bold confessor of the true God into the fire of the Chaldøeans (UrKasdim), whence, according to Gen. xv. 7, Isa. xxix. 22, Jehovah delivered him.^[3. Beer, Leben Abrahams (1859), p. 1 sq. Compare Dan. iii., whence the confusion of Nimrod with Nebuchadnezzar by the Arabs.] The Jewish material was afterwards treated by Mohammed and the Arabian theologians, who mixed it up with other elements.
