NOTKER, a name of somewhat frequent occurrence in the ecclesiastical history of the Middle Ages. Among those by whom it was borne two are specially distinguished. Notker Balbulus (c. 840-912) was a native of northern Switzerland, and, having become a monk of the monastery of St Gall, held the position of “magister” in its school for many years. He was canonized in 1513. Balbulus compiled a martyrology and was the author of other works, but is mentioned principally in connexion with his services to church music and with the “sequences” of which he was the composer. See Hymns, vol. xii. p. 583. Notker Labeo, also a monk of St Gall, died on 29 th June 1022. His translations of the Old Testament Psalms, the De Consolatione of Boetius, the Categories of Aristotle, and some other works into Old High German are of considerable philological interest. See vol. x. p. 517.
