NERBUDDA (properly Narbada), one of the great rivers of India, traditionally regarded as the boundary between Hindustan proper and the Deccan. It rises on the summit of Amarkantak hill in Rewah state, in 22“
[9:17:346]

4Γ N. lat., 89° 4Γ Ε. long., and after a westward course of 800 miles through the Central Provinces and Guzerat, falls into the sea in 21° 38' N. lat., 72° 0' 30" E. long., in the Bombay district of Broach. During its passage through the Central Provinces several falls interrupt its course, the principal of which are a series of glittering cascades and rapids for some hundreds of feet down the heights of Amarkantak, and the well-known falls of the “Marble rocks” 9 miles below Jabalpur. After leaving the Central Provinces, the river widens out in the fertile district of Broach, with an average breadth of from half a mile to a mile. Below Broach city it forms an estuary which is 13 miles broad where it enters the Gulf of Cambay. The Nerbudda is nowhere utilized for irrigation, and navigation is confined to the lower section. In the rainy season boats of considerable size sail about 60 miles above Broach city. Sea-going ships of about 70 tons frequent the port of Broach, but they are entirely dependent on the tide. In sanctity the Nerbudda ranks only second to the Ganges among the rivers of India, and along its whole course are special places of pilgrimage. The most meritorious act that a pilgrim can perform is to walk from the sea to the source of the river and back along the opposite bank. This pilgrimage is chiefly undertaken by devotees from Guzerat and the Deccan, and takes from one to two years to accomplish.
