NUMANTIA, a town in Hispania Tarraconensis, of great natural strength, is famous for the memorable siege by the Romans under Scipio Africanus the younger. The siege began in 134 b.c.; the city was defended with the utmost bravery and tenacity, but after enduring the last extreme of famine the Spaniards were forced to surrender at discretion in 133. The inhabitants were sold as slaves and the town levelled to the ground. The victor was honoured with the title Numantinus by his countrymen. The site of Numantia is to be sought at or near the modern village of Puente de Garray, about four miles to the north of the town of Soria (Old Castile).
