NORD, the most northern of the departments of France, formed out of Flanders, French Hainault, and the district of Cambrais (Cambrésis), lies between 50° and 51° 6' N. lat., and between 2° 5' and 4° 15' E. long., but in such a way that, while it has a length from south-east to north-west of 112 miles, its breadth is nowhere more than 40 miles, and contracts to 4 at the point where it is crossed by the Lys. Bounded N.W. and N. for 21 miles by the North Sea, it has the Belgian provinces of West Flanders and Hainault on the N.E. and E., the departments of Aisne and Somme on the S., and that of Pas-de-Calais on the W. The Flanders portion to the west of the Scheldt is very flat, the hill at Cassel, only 575 feet high, rising like a mountain, and looking north towards Dunkirk over a stretch of 155 square miles of richly fertile lowlands, which about a thousand years ago were still covered by the sea. To the south-east of the Scheldt the country has the character of the neighbouring district of Ardennes, is better wooded, and contains the highest point in the department (875 feet). The greater part of Nord is in the Scheldt basin, but certain portions belong to those of the Sambre (Meuse), the Oise (Seine), and the little coast-streams the Aa and the Yser. The Scheldt, flowing by Cambrai, Bouchain, Valenciennes, and Condé, receives the Scarpe, which touches Douai, Marchiennes, and St Amand. The Lys, which does not join the Scheldt till it has entered Belgium, passes Armentières, and receives the Deule, on which Lille is situated. The Sambre passes Landrecies and Maubeuge. The Aa falls into the port at Gravelines. The climate of Nord is colder than that of France in general, the mean temperature being 49° or 50° Fahr. The rainfall is 12 inches at Dunkirk and a little more [9:17:535] at Lille. In the arrondissement of Avesnes, rain is more abundant, and cold more severe. In population (1,603,259 inhabitants in 1881) and in agricultural and industrial importance Nord is second only to the department of the Seine.

Of the total area (2193 square miles), two-thirds are arable, one-sixth under pasture, and one-eleventh consists of forest. The livestock comprises 93,000 horses, asses, and mules, 240,000 cattle, 125,000 sheep, 78,000 pigs, 29,000 goats, and 75,000 dogs. The grain crops yield about 19,250,000 bushels, potatoes about half as much. Beetroot, flax, tobacco, chicory, colza, rape-seed, and hops are all of importance. The natural pastures support a good breed of Flemish cows. Stone, marble, clay, and sand are obtained in the department; but its mineral wealth lies rather in its coal-pits, for the most part belonging to the Anzin Company, which employs 20,000 workmen, and raises 3⅛ million tons per annum. Iron mines also are worked in the arrondissement of Avesnes. The best mineral waters are those of St Amand. There are numerous foundries, rolling-mills, steel-works, file-works, agricultural implement factories, and engineering works. More than 240,000 tons of pig-iron and 279,000 tons of malleable iron, cast iron, rails, sheet-iron, and Bessemer steel were produced in 1881. Copper foundries and zinc rolling-mills also exist. Spinning is more extensively prosecuted in Nord than in any other department, Lille and its suburbs being the principal seat of the industry. About 12,000 persons are employed in flax and tow spinning, 8000 in cotton spinning, and 4000 to 5000 in the manufacture of sewing-thread. Roubaix and Tourcoing spin wool, cotton, and silk. Jute spinning employs more than 20,000 bobbins at Dunkirk. In Roubaix alone there are upwards of 300 weaving factories; carpets (Tourcoing and Roubaix), linen (Armentieres), ribbons, damask, muslins, tulles, laces, &c., are all largely manufactured, and there are also sugar-factories, distilleries, oil-works (scattered throughout the department), 1000 breweries, glass-works, soap-works, dye-works. The exports of the department comprise cortι, fruit, eggs, vegetables, and butter to England, oil-cake, linseed, oils, colza seed. Consuming 4,500,000 tons of coal, it has to supplement its own production by importing from Pas de Calais, Belgium, or England. Most of the foreign trade passes through Dunkirk, a much larger port than Gravelines. Abundant means of transit exist throughout the department. The total length of the navigable rivers and canals is 325 miles, and railways to a total length of 450 miles have been constructed between all the most important localities.

Nord forms the archiépiscopal diocese of Cambrai, is comprised in the first or Lille region of corps d’armée, and depends on the court of appeal at Douai. It is divided into seven arrondissements (Avesnes, Cambrai, Douai, Dunkirk, Hazebrouck, Lille, and Valenciennes), 61 cantons, and 663 communes. The number of communes of importance especially for their industries is very large—St Arnaud les Eaux (11,184 inhabitants), with mineral waters and an old abbey; Anzin (10,043), near Valenciennes; Armentières (25,089); Bailleul (12,712), with antiquities; Bavai (1863), the ancient Bagacum ; Bergues (5385), with its old fortifications and a splendid belfry of the 16th century; Bouvines (565), with an obelisk in memory of the victory of Philip Augustus in 1214; Cassel (4276); Le Cateau Cambrésis (9564); Condé (4621), a fortified town with coal-mines; Cysoing (3160), with a monument of the battle of Fontenoy (1745); Denain (17,202), with coal-pits, iron-works, and a monument of Villars’s victory (1712); Fourmies (15,052), with spinning and weaving of woollen goods; Gravelines (8416); and Landrecies, a garrison town on the Sambre.
