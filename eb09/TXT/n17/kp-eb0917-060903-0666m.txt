NOY, William (1577-1634), attorney-general, was born, it is believed, on the family estate of Pendrea in Buryan, Cornwall, in 1577, his father belonging to a family whose pedigree is included in the visitation of Cornwall in 1620. He matriculated at Exeter College, Oxford, 27th April 1593, and looked back upon his academical life with such affection that, twenty years later, when the privileges of that institution were invaded by Lord Petre, he pleaded its cause gratuitously and successfully. His legal career began at Lincoln’s Inn, and throughout life he was a diligent student of the grounds and precedents on which English law is based. From 1603 until his death he was elected, with one exception, to each parliament, sitting invariably for a constituency of his native county. For several years his sympathies were in antagonism to the wishes of the court, so that his historical knowledge was freely laid at the service of the opposition. Every commission that was appointed numbered Noy among its members, and even those who were opposed to him in politics acknowledged his learning. A few years before his death he was drawn over to the side of the court, and in October 1631 he was created attorney-general, but was never knighted. It was through his advice that the impost of ship-money was levied, and popular feeling vented its rage against him for its disastrous revival. Noy had long been a martyr to disease of the stone, and his death occurred, under circumstances of great agony, 9th August 1634; two days later he was buried at New Brentford church. Though he was of a reserved, almost morose disposition, and after his change of principles had little regard for the feelings of his old friends, many acts of kindness which he showed can be gleaned from the literature of his time. His principal works, On the grounds and maxims of the laws of this kingdom (1641) and The compleat lawyer (1661), went through many editions. Further particulars concerning him and his children may be found collected in Davies Gilbert’s Cornwall, iii. 143-60, and in the Bibliotheca Cornubiensis, vols. i. and iii.
