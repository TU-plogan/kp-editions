NÉRAC, a town of France, formerly the capital of the duchy of Albret, is situated in the department of Lot-et-Garonne, on both banks of the Bayse, a navigable tributary of the Garonne, 16 miles west-south-west of Agen. It is a pretty and flourishing little place of 4803 inhabitants (1881; commune 7384), with cloth factories, cork-works, and a number of flour-mills; the ruins of its castle are entered in the Government list of historical monuments; and in the old royal park (La Garenne) it has one of the finest promenades of the south of France.

Roman ruins of hot baths, villas, &c., discovered at Nérac in 1831-33 show that the site must have been occupied in the 3d century. In 1250 a Benedictine monastery was established, and in 1306 the lords of Albret expelled the monks and began to build a castle for themselves, which gradually grew into an imposing edifice. Here Marguerite d’Angoulême held court as queen of Navarre, and gathered round her the Protestant literati of her time, Beza, Marot, &c.; here Henry IV. spent a large part of his youth; and here Catherine de ’ Medici in 1579 held a conference with the Protestant leaders. The town was dismantled in 1622 by Louis XIII. because it had sided with the Protestant party.
