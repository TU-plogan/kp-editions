NESTOR (c. 1056-c. 1114), the patriarch of Russian literature, concerning whom, however, we have but little information, except that he was a monk of the Pestcherski cloister of Kieff from 1073. The only other fact of his life told us is that he was commissioned with two other monks to find the relics of St Theodosius, a mission which he succeeded in fulfilling. His history begins with the deluge, as those of most chroniclers of the time did. He appears to have been acquainted with the Byzantine historians; he makes use especially of John Malala and George Armatolus. He also had in all probability other Slavonic chronicles to compile from, which are now lost. The labours of the Byzantine annalists, some of which were translated into Palaeo-Slavonic, would stimulate the production of such works. Of course there are many legends mixed up with Nestor’s Chronicle·, the style is occasionally so poetical that we may easily fancy that he has incorporated bilini which are now lost. The early part is rich in these quaint stories, among which may be cited the arrival of the three Varangian brothers, the founding of Kieff, the murder of Askold and Dir, the death of Oleg, who was killed by a serpent concealed in the skeleton of his horse, and the vengeance taken by Olga, the wife of Igor, on the Drevlians, who had murdered her husband. The account of the labours of Cyril and Methodius among the Slavs is also given in a very interesting manner, and to Nestor we owe the tale of the summary way in which Vladimir suppressed the worship of Peroun and other idols at Kieff. As an eye-witness he could only describe the reigns of Vsevolod and Sviatopolk (1078-1112), but he gathered many interesting details from the lips of old men, two of whom are especially mentioned, Giourata Rogovich, an inhabitant of Novgorod, who furnished him with information concerning the north of Russia, Petchora, and other places, and Jan, a man ninety years of age, who died in 1106, and was son of Vishata the waywode of Yaroslavl and grandson of Ostromir the Posadnik, for whom the Codex was written. Besides the historical portion, many of the ethnological details given by Nestor of the various races of the Slavs are of the highest value

This interesting work lias come down ro us in several manuscripts, but unfortunately no contemporary ones, the oldest being the so-called Lavrientski of the 14th century (1377). _ It was named after the monk Lavrentii, who copied it out for Dimitri Constantinovich, the prince of Souzdal. The work, as contained in this manuscript, has had many additions made to it from previous and contemporary chronicles, such as those of Volinia and Novgorod. Solovieff, the Russian historian, justly remarks that Nestor cannot be strictly called the earliest Russian chronicler, but he is the first writer who took anything like a national point of view in his history, the others being merely local writers. The language of his work, as shown in the earliest manuscripts just mentioned, is Palaeo-Slavonic with many Russisms. It has formed the subject of a valuable monograph by Professor Miklosich.

Nestor’s Chronicle has been translated into Polish, Bohemian, German, and French, but no version has appeared in our own language. Besides his historical work, Nestor was also'the author of the Lives of Boris and Gleb, the martyrs, and of the St Theodosius previously mentioned. In recent times the genuineness of his Chronicle has been attacked by ∏ovaiski and others, but the accusations have hardly been considered serious in Russia, and have been completely refuted, if they needed refutation, by Pogodin. The body of the ancient chronicler may still be seen among the relics preserved in the Pestcherski monastery at Kieff. His work is of primary importance for the study of early Russian history, and, although devoid of literary merit in the strictest sense of the term, is not without its amusing and well-told episodes of a somewhat Herodotean character.
