NUMENILTS, one of the so-called Neo-Pythagoreans, and a forerunner of the Neo-Platonists, was a native of Apamea in Syria, and flourished during the latter half of the second Christian century. He was a somewhat voluminous writer in philosophy and philosophical biography, but all that is known of his opinions is found in passing references by Clement of Alexandria, Origen, Eusebius, and one or two of the Neo-Platonists. He seems to have taken Pythagoras as his highest authority, and at the same time to have been unaware of any discrepancy between his own views and those of Plato, whom he further described as an “Atticizing Moses,” and as deriving all his knowledge, like Pythagoras, from the East. He held a kind of trinity, the members of which he designated as ττάτττΓο?, ∈κγovos, and απόγονο? respectively,—the first being the supreme deity, or pure vous, the second the demiurge, and the third the world.
