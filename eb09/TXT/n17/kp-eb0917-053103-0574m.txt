NOETUS, a presbyter of the church of Asia Minor about 230 A.D., was a native of Smyrna, where (or perhaps in Ephesus) he became a prominent representative of the particular type of Christology which is now technically called modalistic monarchianism (see vol. xvi. p. 719). His views, which led to his excommunication from the Asiatic church, are known to us chiefly through the controversial writings of Hippolytus, his contemporary.
