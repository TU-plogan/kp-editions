NAIRNE, Caroline Oliphant, Baroness (1766— 1845), the authoress of many fine Scotch songs, was born in the “auld hoose” of Cask, Perthshire, 16th August 1766. She was descended from an old family which had settled in Perthshire in the 13 th century, and which could boast of kinship with the royal race of Scotland. Her father, Laurence Oliphant, was one of the foremost supporters of the Jacobite cause, and she was named Caroline in memory of Prince Charlie. In early childhood her health was extremely delicate, but a certain refined sensibility was the only trace of this which she retained in after years. In the schoolroom she was known as “pretty Miss Car,” and afterwards her striking beauty and pleasing manners earned for her the name of the “Flower of Strathearn.” Miss Oliphant was one of the earliest admirers of Robert Burns, and induced her brother Laurence to enter his name as subscriber to the first edition of his poems. It was the attempts of Burns in the Scots Musical Museum to adapt words of a more refined character to the old Scotch airs that suggested to her to undertake a similar enterprise. Her first effort was a new version of the “Pleughman,” which her brother introduced at an entertainment to the Gask tenantry, and which soon met with great popularity throughout central Scotland. In June 1800 she married William Murray Nairne, whose rank as fifth Lord Nairne was in abeyance on account of attainder. He was then assistant inspector-general of barracks in Scotland. At the instigation of the Misses Hume, daughters of Baron Hume, she some time after her marriage undertook to bring out a collection of national airs set to appropriate words. To the collection she contributed a large number of original songs, adopting the signature’“B.B.”—“Mrs Bogan of Bogan.” The music was edited by R. A. Smith, and the collection was published at Edinburgh under the name of the Scottish Minstrel (6 vols., 1821-24). Her husband was restored to his rank in 1824, but died 9th July 1830. After his death she took up her residence at Enniskerry, county Wicklθλv, but on account of the delicate health of her only son she went to the Continent, where she spent several years. The son died at Brussels in 1838. Lady Nairne returned to Gask in 1843, and died there 26th October 1845.

The songs of Lady Nairne may be classed under three heads :— (1) those illustrative of the characters and manners of the old Scotch gentry, such as “The Laird of Cockpen,” “The Fife Laird,” and “John Tod”; (2) Jacobite songs, composed for the most part to gratify her kinsman the aged chief of Strowan, among the best-known of which are perhaps “Wha’ll be King but Charlie,” “Charlie is my Darling,” “The Hundred Pipers,” “He’s owτe the Hills,” and “Bonnie Charlie’s noo awa”; and (3) songs not included under the above heads, ranging over a variety of subjects from “Caller Herrin’” to the “Land o’ the Leal.” For vivacity, genuine pathos, and bright wit her songs are surpassed only by those of Burns, and, although their note is less full and strong than his, it is perhaps in some respects more mellow and tender.

Lays from Strathearn, by Caroline. Baroness Nairne, arranged with Symphonies and Accompaniments for the Pianoforte by Finlay Dun, appeared without date some time after her death. Her poems were published in vol. i. of the Modern Scottish Minstrel, 1857; but the most complete collection is that contained in Life and Songs of the Baroness Nairne, with a Memoir and Poems of Caroline Oliphant the Younger, edited by Rev. Charles Rogers, LL.D., 2d ed., 1869.
