NORTHAMPTON, Henry Howard, Earl of (c. 1539- 1614), the second son of the earl of Surrey, the poet, born about 1539, was restored in blood by the first parliament of Elizabeth. He bore a high character for learning, but during the greater part of Elizabeth’s reign he remained in obscurity, sharing the fortunes of his family. Towards the end of the century he attached himself first to Essex and afterwards to Cecil, and took part in the secret correspondence of the latter with James VI. of Scotland. W hen James became king of England, Lord Henry Howard at once sprang into favour. Though a Catholic in principle, he was ready to attend the Protestant service to please the king, and it is probable that he was one of the few who, in consideration of the services which they were able to render, were authorized by the authorities of that church to take this course. He was a good flatterer, and in 1603 he became a privy councillor. In 1604 he was made lord warden of the Cinque Ports and earl of Northampton. In 1608 he became lord privy seal, and in 1612 one of the commissioners of the treasury.

In politics he gave his support to the Spanish alliance and to the toleration of the Catholics, believing, as was said by a Catholic agent, that the restoration of the Catholic religion in England was the only bulwark against Puritan democracy. After the signature of the treaty with Spain in 1604 he accepted a pension from the king of Spain. After Salisbury’s death in 1612 he won over Carr, who was then earl of Rochester, to his interests by countenancing the favourite’s intimacy with his great-niece, Lady Essex, and by supporting the divorce which made a marriage possible between them. Rochester, who soon became earl of Somerset, placed himself completely at Northampton’s service in supporting an alliance with Spain. Northampton died in 1614, before the detection of the murder of Overbury, which brought about the fall of Somerset, and ultimately the exclusion from office of the Howard family.
