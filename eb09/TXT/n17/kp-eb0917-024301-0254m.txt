NATICK, a town of the United States, in Middlesex county, Massachusetts, near the left bank of the Charles River, a few miles to the south-east of Cochituate Lake, and about 18 miles west-south-west of - Boston by the railway between that city and Worcester. It is mainly engaged in the manufacture of boots and shoes, but also produces clothing, boxes, and carriages. The population in 1880 was 8480.

Natick (“our land”) was in 1650 granted to John Eliot, the Indian “Apostle,” for the occupancy of Indians converted to Christianity; and until 1721 the community was governed by a constitution modelled on that of Exodus xviii. Portions of the records, written in the Indian language, are extant. The site of the first Indian church is now occupied by the Unitarian church. Of the Natick Indians only four or five remain, all of mixed blood. The incorporation of the town dates from 1781.
