NORICUM was the ancient name of the country south of the Danube, around the rivers Inn and Drave, and extending on the south to the banks of the Save. The original population appears to have been Illyrian, but in the great emigration of the Gauls the country was occupied by a Celtic people, Taurisci or Norici. The latter name seems to be derived from their town of Noreia, now Neumarkt. The country is mountainous, and the soil poor, but it is rich in iron, and has always been one of the great European centres of the trade. A great part of the Roman weapons were made of Noric steel. The country was conquered by the Romans under Tiberius and Drusus in 15 b.c., but for a time retained its old constitution and the name of Regnum Noricum. See Austria, Bavaria, Carinthia, <fcc.
