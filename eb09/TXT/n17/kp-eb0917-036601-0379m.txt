NEUSTADT-EBERSWALDE, now officially named Eberswalde simply, is a manufacturing town of Prussia, province of Brandenburg, situated 28 miles to the northwest of Berlin, on a canal connecting the Oder and the Havel. It possesses a mineral spring, which has lately attracted numerous summer visitors, but its chief importance arises from its various industries, which include ironfounding and the making of horse-shoe nails, roofing material (Dachpappe, a kind of thick pasteboard), and bricks. A considerable trade is carried on in grain, wood, and coals. In the immediate vicinity are one of the chief brass-foundries in Germany and an extensive Government paper-mill, in which the paper for the notes of the national bank (Deτchsbanlc) is manufactured. The town contains no noteworthy buildings except the large lunatic asylum for the province, and the school of forestry, which is attended by students from all parts of Germany. There are two Protestant churches, a Roman Catholic church, and a synagogue. In 1880 the population was 11,524, including 436 Roman Catholics and 171 Jews.

Neustadt-Eberswalde received its municipal charter in 1237, and was taken and sacked during the Thirty Years’ War. In 1747 Frederick the Great brought a colony of Thuringian cutlers to the town, but this branch of industry has entirely died out. About 4 miles to the north lies the old Cistercian monastery of Chorin, the fine Gothic church of which contains the tombs of several margraves of Brandenburg.
