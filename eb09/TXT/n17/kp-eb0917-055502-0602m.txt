NORTH, Sir Thomas, son of Edward North, first Baron North of Kirtling, is memorable as the author of the English version of Plutarch’s Lives that supplied Shakespeare with materials for his classical plays. Materials for a biographical notice are extremely scanty; and neither the exact date of his birth nor that of his death is known. His literary career was long, for he was living in decayed old age in 1603 when a third edition of his Plutarch was published, with a supplement of other translated biographies. His first appearance in literature was in 1557, when Wayland published for him a translation of Guevara’s Diall of Princes, a compendium of moral counsels pleasantly interwoven with incidents in the life of Marcus Aurelius. The English of this work is one of the earliest specimens of the more ornate, copious, and pointed style for which educated young Englishmen had acquired a taste in their Continental travels and studies, and which such fashionable tutors as Ascham and Wilson inculcated by both precept and example. North translated from a French copy of Guevara. The first edition of his Plutarch, translated from the French of Amyot, appeared in 1579.
