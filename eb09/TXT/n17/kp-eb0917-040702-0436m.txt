NEW ROSS, a market-town and parliamentary borough of Leinster, Ireland, partly in Wexford and partly in Kilkenny, is situated on the acclivity of a hill on the east bank of the Barrow, 2 miles below its junction with the Nore, 85 miles south-south-west of Dublin and 24 westnorth-west of Wexford. The Barrow is crossed by an iron bridge, erected at a cost of Â£50,000, with a swivel pillar in the centre on which a portion of the bridge is turned to admit the passage of vessels. The principal buildings are the tholsel surmounted by turret with clock, the courthouse, the fever hospital, Trinity hospital, and the poorhouse. There is a brisk trade by means of the Barrow, the principal exports being grain, flour, butter, bacon, and wool. In 1882 the number of vessels that entered the port was 1670 of 260,578 tons, the number that cleared 1635 of 281,101 tons. There is inland communication for ships by the Nore to Inistiogue, and by the Barrow to St Mullins, while barges can proceed as far as Athy, where the Barrow joins the Grand Canal. New Ross possesses breweries and tanyards. There is a salmon fishery above and below the town. The population of New Ross in 1871 was 6772, and in 1881 it was 6626.

It is stated that St Abban built the abbey of Rossmactreoin, which gave rise to an ancient city formerly called Rossglas. According to Camden, New Ross was founded by Isabella, daughter of Strongbow and consort of William le Mareschal, afterwards Earl Pembroke. A charter was granted to it by Roger Bigod in the reign of Edward I., which was extended by James I. and James II. From 1374 it enjoyed the privilege of returning two members to parliament, but at the Union the number was reduced to one. In 1269 the town was surrounded by walls. The fortresses were dismantled by Cromwell, but some of their remains are still extant.
