NORTHFLEET, a village and urban sanitary district in the county of Kent, forming part of the parliamentary borough of Gravesend, is situated on the Thames and the North Kent Railway, 20 miles east of London and 2 west of Gravesend. The church of St Botolph, chiefly in the Later Decorated style, dates from the middle of the 13th century; but the nave is of later date, and the old tower, having fallen down, was rebuilt in 1628. The church contains a brass of the 14th century and other interesting monuments. The nave and chancel have undergone modern restoration. Huggens College, with residences for forty decayed gentry, was established in 1847. A factory club for the use of those engaged in the chemical works was opened in 1878. Besides chemical manufactures there are chalk, lime, cement, and brick works, and a large shipbuilding yard. Rosherville pleasure-gardens are in the neighbourhood. The population of the urban sanitary district (3934 acres) in 1871 was 6515 and in 1881 it was 8790.
