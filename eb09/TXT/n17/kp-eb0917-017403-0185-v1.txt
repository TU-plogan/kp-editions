NAPHTALI, the son of Jacob by Bilhah, Rachel’s maid, and uterine brother of Dan. The narrator of Gen. XXX. 8 explains the name √∏92 by the verb ⅛93, “wrestle.” The seats of the tribe lay in the eastern half of upper Galilee, a fertile mountainous country sloping down to the headwaters of Jordan and the Sea of Galilee (Josh. xix. 32-39). Within this country the Canaanites continued to hold Beth-shemesh and Beth-anath (Judg. i. 33). After the wars with Sisera, in which the tribe took a prominent part (Judg. iv.; v. 18), and with Midian (Judg. vii. 23), we hear little of Naphtali. Dwelling near the settlements of the Aramaeans, the tribe was an early sufferer in the bloody conflicts of Damascus with Israel (1 Kings XV. 20), and it was depopulated in the first Assyrian captivity by Tiglath Pileser (2 Kings xv. 29; Isa. ix. 1 [viii. 23]).
