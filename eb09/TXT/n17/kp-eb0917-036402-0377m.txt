NEU-RUPPIN, the chief town of a circle in the district of Potsdam and province of Brandenburg, Prussia, lies on the west bank of a small lake (the Ruppiner See), 37 miles to the north-west of Berlin. The town, which was rebuilt after a destructive fire in 1787, contains three Protestant churches, a small Roman Catholic church, and various educational and benevolent institutions. Its inhabitants are employed in the manufacture of cloth, starch, and machinery, iron-founding, and lithography. In 1880 they numbered 13,985. Important cattle and horse fairs are held here. The small town of Alt-Ruppin lies at the north end of the lake, and about 10 miles to the north is the chateau of Rheinsberg, where Frederick the Great spent his youth.
