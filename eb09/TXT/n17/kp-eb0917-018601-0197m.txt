NAPIER, Sir William Francis Patrick (1785-1860), the third son of Colonel and Lady Sarah Napier, and brother of Sir Charles and Sir George Napier, was born at Cellbridge, near Dublin, on the 17th of December 1785. He became an ensign in the Royal Irish Artillery in 1800, but at once exchanged into the 62d, and was put on halfpay in 1802. He was afterwards made a cornet in the Blues by his uncle the duke of Richmond, and exchanged into the 52d regiment. He obtained a company in a West India regiment, but exchanged again into the 43d when it was being trained at Shorncliffe under Sir John Moore, who took Napier into special favour, and won his everlasting gratitude. He served in Denmark, and was present at the engagement of Kioge, and, his regiment being shortly afterwards sent to Spain, he bore himself nobly through the retreat to Corunna. In 1809 he became aide-de-camp to his uncle in Ireland, but joined the 43d when ordered again to Spain. With the light brigade (the 43d, 52d, and 95th), under the command of General Craufurd, he marched to Talavera in the famous forced march which he has described in his History, and had a violent attack of ])leurisy on the way. He, however, refused to leave Spain, was wounded on the Coa, and shot near the spine at Cazal Nova. His conduct was so conspicuous during the pursuit of Masséna after he left the lines of Torres Vedras that he as well as his brother George was recommended for a brevet majority. He became brigade major, was present at Fuentes d’Onor, but had so bad an attack of ague that he was obliged to return to England. In England he fell in love with and married Caroline Fox, the daughter of General Henry Fox, with whom Moore had been in love in Sicily. Three days after his marriage he again started for Spain, and was present at the storming of Badajoz, where his great friend Colonel M i Leod was killed. In the absence of the new lieutenant-colonel he took command of the 43d regiment, and commanded it at the battle of Salamanca. After a short stay at home he again joined his regiment at the Pyrenees, and did his greatest military service at the battle of the Nivelle, where, with instinctive military insight, he secured the most strongly fortified part of Soult’s position, practically without orders. He served with his regiment at the battles of the Nive, Orthes, and Toulouse. For his services he was made brevet lieutenant-colonel, and one of the first C.B.’s. Like his brother Charles he then entered the military college at Farnham. He commanded his regiment in the army of occupation in France until 1819, when he retired on halfpay. As it was impossible for him to live on his half-pay with a wife and family, he determined to become an artist, and took a house in Sloane Street, where he studied with George Jones, the academician. The years he had spent in France he had occupied in improving his general education, for it will hardly be believed that the author of the History of the War in the Peninsula could not spell or write respectable English till that time. But his career was to be great in literature, not in art. The tendency appeared in an able review of Jomini in 1821, and in 1823 Mr Bickersteth, afterwards Lord Langdale, suggested to him the expediency of writing a history of the Peninsular War. For some time he did not take kindly to the suggestion, but at last determined to become an author in order to defend the memory of Sir John Moore, and to prevent the glory of his old chief being overshadowed by that of Wellington. The duke of Wellington himself gave him much assistance, and handed over to him the whole of Joseph Bonaparte’s correspondence which had been taken at the battle of Vittoria; this was all in cipher, but Mrs Napier, with great patience, discovered the keys. In 1828 the first volume of the History appeared, and it was at once seen that the great deeds of the Peninsular War were about to be fitly commemorated. The excitement which followed the publication of each volume is proved by the innumerable pamphlets issued by those who believed themselves to be attacked, and by personal altercations with many distinguished officers. But the success of the book was proved still more by the‘absence of competition than by these bitter controversies. The histories of Southey and Lord Londonderry fell still-born, and Sir George Murray, who had determined to produce the history, gave up the attempt in despair. This success was due to a combina tion of qualities which have justly secured for Napier the title of being the best military historian England has produced. The best military histories have always been written by eye-witnesses. It is impossible for a new generation to analyse the military combinations and understand the minute facts which account for the winning or losing of a battle, though it may often unravel political intrigues which were veiled to the eyes of contemporaries. Napier added to this qualification a wonderful insight into the nature of war, and was able to describe and understand the movements and feelings of the French as well as of the army in which he himself served. But neither contemporary knowledge nor military ability could have made his History memorable without a peculiarly appropriate literary style. He knew well how to mingle passages relating to individuals with descriptions of military movements, and how to relieve the dryness of details by an occasional glance at more extended subjects. He possessed an enthusiastic admiration for nearly all the heroes whose deeds he touched on. His admiration for Napoleon was only second to that for Moore, and he could feel for Soult in defeat as well as for Wellington in the hour of victory. When in 1840 the last volume of the History was published, his fame not only in England but in France and Germany was safely established. His life during these years had been chiefly absorbed in his History, but he had warmly sympathized with the movement for political reform which was agitating England. The Radicals of Bath pressed him to sit for their city, and it was commonly reported that if the reformers had found it necessary to resort to force Colonel Napier would have been their commander-in-chief. In 1842 he was promoted major-general, and had given him the lieutenant-governorship of Guernsey. Here he found plenty of occupation in controlling the relations between [9:17:187] the soldiers and the inhabitants, and also found time to propound a complete scheme of reform for the government of the island. While he was at Guernsey his brother Charles had conquered Sind, and the attacks made on the policy of that conquest brought William Napier again into the field of literature. In 1845 he published his History of the Conquest of Scinde, and in 1851 the corresponding History of the Administration of Scinde — books which in style and vigour rivalled the great History, but which, being written for controversial purposes, are not likely to maintain such an enduring popularity. In 1847 he resigned his governorship, and in 1848 was made a K.C.B., and settled at Scinde House, Clapham Park. His time was fully occupied in defending his brother, in revising the numerous editions of his History which were being called for, and in writing letters to the Times on every conceivable subject, whether military or literary. His energy is the more astonishing when it is remembered that he never recovered from the effects of the wound he had received at Cazal Nova, and that he often had to lie on his back for months together.

His domestic life was shadowed by the incurable affliction of his only son, and when his brother Charles died in 1853 the world seemed to be darkening round him. He devoted himself to writing the life of that brother, which appeared in 1857, and which is in many respects his most characteristic book. In the end of 1853 his younger brother, Captain Henry Napier, R.N., the historian of Florence, died, and in 1855 his brother Sir George. Inspired by his work, he lived on till the year 1860, when, broken by trouble, fatigue, and ill-health, he died (on February 12) at Clapham.

As a military historian Sir William Napier is incomparably superior to any other English writer, and. his true compeers are Thucydides, Caesar, and Davila. All four had been soldiers in the wars they describe; all four possessed a peculiar insight into the mainsprings of action both in war and peace; and all four possessed a peculiar and inimitable style. Napier always wrote as if he was burning with an inextinguishable desire to express what he was feeling, which gives his style a peculiar spontaneity, and yet he rewrote the first volume of his History no less than six times. His descriptions of sieges and of battles are admirable by themselves, and his analyses of the peculiarly intricate Spanish intrigues are even more remarkable, while the descriptions and analyses are both lit up with flashes of political wisdom and military insight. It is to be noted that he displays the spirit of the partisan, even when most impartial, and defends his opinions, even when most undoubtedly true, as if he were arguing some controverted question. If his style was modelled on anything, it was on Caesar’s commentaries, and a thorough knowledge of the writings of the Roman general will often explain allusions in Napier. The portraits of Sir John Moore and Colonel M*Leod, and the last paragraphs descriptive of the storming of Badajoz, may be taken as examples of the great natural eloquence which arose from the loving recollection of friends, or the deep impression made by a most terrible scene upon his vivid imagination.

For Sir William Napier’s life, see his Life and Letters, edited by the Right Honourable H. A. Bruce (now Lord Aberdare), 2 vols., 1862. The dates of his books are given above. The edition of the History published in 1851 is the best, and contains the answers to various criticisms which sum up the controversies arising from statements in the work. The French translation is by Count Mathieu Dumas. (H. Μ. S.)
