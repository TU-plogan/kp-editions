NICOSIA, a city of Italy in the province of Catania in Sicily, about 50 miles west of Catania, near the rise of the Seminato. It is a picturesque mediaeval-looking place, with a cathedral in the Norman style, a communal library, mineral wells, and a trade in grain, wine, and oil. The population of the commune was 14,731 in 1861 and 15,460 in 1881; that of the town was 14,508 in 1871.

Nicosia probably represents the ancient Herbita, which gallantly maintained its independence against Dionysius of Syracuse. Destroyed by the Saracens, the city was restored by the Normans, and the Lombard colony introduced by Roger is said to have left its trace in the popular speech. The bishopric dates from 1816.
