NEOPHYTE (v∈0<∕>υτoς, “newly planted ”) was the designation applied to newly baptized persons in the ancient church. These usually wore the white garments which they received at their admission to the church (see Baptism, vol. iii. p. 351) during the whole of the following week, but the application of the name did not necessarily cease at the close of that period. A special employment of the word was to denote one who, not having duly passed through the inferior grades, was in view of 1 Tim. iii. 6 considered canonically unfit to be consecrated a bishop.
