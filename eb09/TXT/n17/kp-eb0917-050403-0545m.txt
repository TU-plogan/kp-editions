NIKOPOL, a town of Russia, in the government and district of Ekaterinoslaff, on the right bank of the Dnieper, 7 6 miles to the south-south-west of Ekaterinoslaff. The town, formerly called Nikitin Rog, occupies an elongated peninsula between two branches of the Dnieper, at a point where its banks are covered on both sides and to a considerable distance with marshes, and has been for many centuries one of the places where the middle Dnieper could most conveniently be crossed. The old“setcha,” or fortified camp, of the Zaporogian Cossacks had its seat a little above. Numbers of graves around it recall the battles which were fought for the possession of this important strategic point. One of them, close to the town, “the Great Grave” (Tolstaya Moghila), contained, along with other Scythian antiquities, the well-known precious vase representing the capture of wild horses. Even now Nikopol, which is situated on the highway from Ekaterinoslaff to Kherson, is also the point where the “salt-highway” of the Chumaks (Little-Russian carriers of salt) to the Crimea crosses the Dnieper. A wharf for the building of trading ships navigating the estuary of the Dnieper has been established at Nikopol, and it is still one of the chief places on the lower Dnieper for the export of corn, linseed, tallow, and wool. Its 10,000 inhabitants are Little-Russians, Jews, and Mennonites, who prosecute agriculture extensively. The trade in wheat, hemp, tallow, and wool is important in connexion with the export trade of Nikolaieff and Odessa.
