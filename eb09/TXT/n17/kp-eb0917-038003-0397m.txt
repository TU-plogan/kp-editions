NEWCASTLE, Dukes of. Within the space of a century there were no less than four successive creations of dukes of Newcastle. William Cavendish, nephew of the first earl of Devonshire, was raised to the dignity of duke of Newcastle-upon-Tyne in 1664. His son and successor Henry died leaving daughters only, and one of these married John Holies, earl of Clare, who was created duke in 1694. This duke died also without male issue in 1711, leaving his estates to his sister’s son Thomas Pelham, who, with other dignities, had the title of duke of Newcastle-upon-Tyne conferred on him in 1715, and a second and similar ducal title (that of Newcastle-under-Lyme) in 1757. His first dukedom became extinct at his death, but the second title was granted him with remainder to the earl of Lincoln, at once his nephew and nephew-in-law, whose descendants (Pelham-Cliutons) have been dukes of Newcastle-under-Lyme in direct lineal succession down to the present time. Two of the dukes of Newcastle, and one duchess, call for separate notice :—

I. William Cavendish, duke of Newcastle (1592- 1676), son of Sir Charles Cavendish, youngest brother of the first earl of Devonshire, by Catherine, daughter of Cuthbert Lord Ogle, was born in 1592. In his early years he showed little inclination for study, and while at St John’s College, Cambridge, he took “more delight in sports than in learning.” At an early age he acquired marvellous proficiency in horsemanship and weapons, “which increased much his father’s hopes of his future perfections.” His personal beauty and manly accomplishments gained him special favour at the court of James I., who, when his son Henry in 1610 was created prince of Wales, made Cavendish a knight of the Bath. Ten years afterwards he became Viscount Mansfield and in 1628 earl of Newcastle-upon-Tyne. In 1638 he was appointed by Charles I. governor of Charles, prince of Wales. When the king in 1639 visited Scotland, he was entertained with great splendour by the earl of Newcastle at Welbeck. On the outbreak of the civil war the earl was appointed governor of the town of Newcastle and the four neighbouring counties, and a short time afterwards he was named general of the forces north of the Trent. In this position his energy and circumspection proved invaluable to the royal cause. For his victory over Fairfax at Adderton Heath, near Bradford, June 30, 1643, he was created marquis. The Parliamentary generals were step by step losing their hold on the north, and were reduced to the hardest straits, when they were relieved by a Scottish army under the earl of Leven. Newcastle had to fall back on York, where he was closely besieged when Prince Rupert hurried to his assistance. Contrary to his advice Prince Rupert risked the battle of Marston Moor, which resulted in the utter rout of the royal forces and the ruin of the king’s cause in the north of England. Newcastle, with about eighty gentlemen, retired to the Continent. He returned with Charles II. at the Restoration, when he was appointed chief justice of the counties north of the Trent, and in 1664 he was created duke. From this time, however, he ceased to take an active part in political life, occupying himself chiefly with literary pursuits and the retrievement of his broken fortunes. He died December 25, 1676, and was buried in Westminster Abbey.

Dryden’s Even Song is dedicated to Newcastle in very eulogistic terms. The duke, besides publishing A New Method and Extraordinary Invention to Dress Horses, 1667, which had previously appeared in 1657 in French, was the author of several comedies, including TheExile (doubtful); The Country Captain, 1649; Variety, 1649; The Humorous Lovers, 1677. He also translated Moliere’s L'Étourdi under the title Sir Martin Mar-All. His wife’s Life of him is noticed below.

II. Margaret Lucas, duchess of Newcastle (c. 1625-1673), second wife of the duke of Newcastle noticed above, was born about 1625, the youngest daughter of Thomas Lucas of St John’s, near Colchester, Essex. She joined the court at Oxford in 1643 as maid of honour tα Henrietta Maria, and met there the marquis (afterwards duke) of Newcastle, whom she married at Paris in 1645, after the battle of Marston Moor. Throughout life they continued to cherish a mutual admiration of a very exaggerated character, each regarding the other as endowed with transcendent merits both of person and mind. The duchess cultivated literary composition with exuberant fervour, and kept a bevy of maids of honour obliged to [9:17:381] be ready at all hours “to register her Grace’s conceptions.” Walpole speaks of her as a “fertile pedant” with an “Unbounded passion for scribbling”; and, although giving evidence of learning, ingenuity, and imagination, her writings are fatally marred by a deficiency in judgment and self-restraint.

She is best known by The, Life, of the Thrice Noble, High, and Puissant Prince, William Cavendish, Duke, Marquess, and Earl of Newcastle; written by the Thrice Noble, Illustriores, and Excellent Princess, Margaret, Duchess of Newcastle, his Wife, originally printed by A. Maxwell at London in 1667. She also published Philosophical Fancies, 1653; Poems and Fancies, 1653; The World's Olio, 1655; Nature's Picture drawn by Fande' s Pencil to the Life, which includes an autobiography, 1656; Philosophical and Physical Opinions, 1655; Orations, 1662; Plays, 1662; Sodable Letters, 1664; Observations upon Experimental Philosophy, 1666; Letters and Poems, 1676. Her Select Poems were edited by Brydges in 1813, and her Autobiography in 1814. The latter, edited by Lower, was published along with her Life of the Duke of Newcastle in 1872.

III. Thomas Pelham Holles, duke of Newcastle (1693-1768), who was for thirty years one of the two secretaries of state, and for seven more prime minister, and whose official life extended throughout the Whig supremacy of the 18th century, was the elder son of Thomas, first Lord Pelham, by his second wife Lady Grace Holies, younger sister of John Holies, duke of Newcastle-on-Tyne. Born in 1693, he was educated at Westminster and at Clare Hall, Cambridge. In 1711 his uncle the duke of Newcastle died, and left the whole of his vast estates to him. In 1712 he also succeeded his father in his peerage and estates, and in 1714, when he came of age, was one of the greatest landowners in the kingdom. He vigorously sustained the Whig party at Queen Anne’s death, and had much influence in making the Londoners accept King George. His services were too great to be neglected, and in 1714 he was created earl of Clare, and in 1715 duke of Newcastle in Northumberland. He also became lord-lieutenant of the counties of Middlesex and Nottingham and a knight of the Garter in 1718, in which year he increased his Whig connexion by marrying Lady Henrietta Godolphin, granddaughter of the great duke of Marlborough. In 1717 he first held political office as lord chamberlain of the household, and in 1724 was chosen by Sir Robert Walpole to be secretary of state in place of Lord Carteret. This office he held continuously for thirty years (1724-1754), and only changed it for the premiership on his brother’s death. His long tenure of office has been attributed to his great Whig connexions and his wealth, but some praise must be given to his inexhaustible activity and great powers of debate. He was a peculiarly muddle-headed man, and unhappy if he had not more to do than he could possibly manage, but at the same time he was a consummate master of parliamentary tactics, and knew how to manage the Houses of Lords and Commons alike. Lord Hervey compares him with Walpole in 1735, and says—“We have one minister that does everything with the same seeming ease and tranquillity as if he were doing nothing; we have another that does nothing in the same hurry and agitation as if he did everything.” He continued in office on Walpole’s fall in 1742, and became more powerful on his younger brother Henry becoming prime minister in 1743. On Henry Pelham’s death in March 1754, Newcastle succeeded him as premier; but people who had been accustomed to him as secretary of state would not stand him as premier, and in November 1756 he gave place to the duke of Devonshire. For his long services he was created duke of Newcastle-under-Lyme, with remainder to the earl of Lincoln, who had married his niece Catherine Pelham. In July 1757 he again became prime minister —for Pitt, though a great statesman, was a bad party leader—on the understanding, according to Horace Walpole, that “Mr Pitt does everything, the duke gives everything.” Under this ministry England became famous abroad, but it gradually fell before the young king’s affection for Lord Bute, who, after supplanting Pitt, became prime minister in the room of Newcastle in May 1762. The duke went into strong opposition, and lost his two lord-lieutenancies for opposing the peace of 1763. In 1765 he became lord privy seal for a few months, but his health was fast giving way, and he died in August 1768. The duke was certainly not a great man, but he must have possessed far more ability than has generally been allowed to have maintained office as long as he did; he was industrious and energetic, and to his credit be it said that the statesman who almost monopolized the patronage of office for half a century twice refused a pension, and finally left office £300,000 poorer than he entered it.

The best authority for the duke of Newcastle’s life is the Memoirs of the Administration of the Right Hon. H. Pelham, by the Ven. W. Coxe, 1829. See also the histories of his time, and such books as Lord Hervey’s Memoirs and Horace Walpole’s Letters.
