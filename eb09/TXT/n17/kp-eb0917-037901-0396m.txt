NEWCASTLE, a city of New South. Wales, and the principal seaport on the northern coast, is situated on a steep acclivity rising from the sea, at the mouth of the Hunter river, about 75 miles north of Sydney. It is a well-built town, and most of the streets are paved, and lighted with gas. For the water supply a reservoir has been constructed on Monument Hill capable of holding 500,000 gallons. Among the public buildings the principal are the court-house, the lunatic asylum, the grammar school, the school of arts (with a library of over 4000 volumes), the Victoria market building, and the customhouse. The harbour, which is defended by a fort, and protected by a breakwater rendering it more easy of access in stormy weather, affords ample accommodation for present requirements, and has a depth at the shores of 23 feet. In 1883 the number of vessels that entered was 945 [9:17:380] of 656,906 tons, the number that cleared 1305 of 925,926 tons. There is daily communication with Sydney by two lines of steamers. Besides the agricultural produce of the Hunter river district, the principal export is coal from the extensive mines in the neighbourhood of the town, which give employment to over 5000 men. The industries of the town include copper and iron founding, engineering, carriage building, shipbuilding, and brewing. The population of the census district in 1881 was 15,595.

The mouth of the Hunter river was discovered in 1797. The station, which for a long time was a convict dépôt, was formerly called Port Hunter. In 1821 it became a free settlement, and in 1859 it was erected into a municipality, since which time its progress has been very rapid.
