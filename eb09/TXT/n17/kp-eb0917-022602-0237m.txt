NAPOLEON III. (1808-1873). Louis Napoleon, emperor of the French, was the younger son of Louis, king of Holland (brother of Napoleon I.), and of Hortense, daughter of the empress Josephine by her first husband Beauharnais. He was thus both nephew and step-grandson of Napoleon I. His father and mother were on the worst terms, and rarely lived together. Louis was born at Paris on April 20, 1808, at the house belonging to his mother in the street that is now Rue Lafitte. He was brought up at Paris, and was occasionally taken to the Tuileries and noticed by the emperor, who gave him the cordon of the Legion of Honour. But it is impossible that the child could have remembered much of Napoleon I., who, from the beginning of the Russian campaign in 1812, was constantly away from Paris. When, in 1814, the allies entered the French capital, generosity towards the conquered was the order of the-day. Queen Hortense was courteously treated and visited by the czar Alexander, to whom her boy is said to have given a ring. The family continued to reside in France during the first restoration of the Bourbons, and were there when Napoleon returned from Elba. A story that when Napoleon was on the point of setting out for Waterloo the young Louis interrupted him in a conference with Marshal Soult, and begged him not to go to the war, is probably mythical. The [9:17:227] second restoration of the Bourbons was not effected in so gentle a spirit as the first. The family of the Bonapartes was banished from France. Hortense—who, like the rest of her kindred, had enriched herself out of public property —retired to Switzerland, and purchased the chateau of Arenenberg, overlooking the Lake of Constance. The next fifteen years were passed by the young Louis partly at Arenenberg and partly at Augsburg, which his mother chose as the place of his education. He grew up a gentle, studious, brooding youth, and the influence of his Augsburg schooling remained both in his habits of thought and in his German-like pronunciation, which was noticeable long afterwards. Until 1830 he attracted little attention from those around him, and none at all from the world, for he was as yet only one among several cadets of the Napoleonic house, Napoleon’s own son, the duke of Reichstadt, being still alive. He seems, however, to have had dreams of a great future at an early age; and the instinct that some knowledge of military affairs would be useful to him led him to serve as an artillery volunteer in the Swiss camp of Thun under Colonel Dufour. The revolution of 1830, which dethroned the Bourbons and awoke insurrectionary movements in so many countries, first launched Louis Napoleon upon his eventful career. Along with his elder brother he joined the Italian bands who were in revolt against the rule of the pope in Romagna. This revolt was put down by Austrian soldiers. The elder of the two brothers fell ill and died at Forli; Hortense, setting out to rescue her sons from their danger, found one dead and the other ill with fever, and on the point of falling into the hands of the Austrians at Ancona. After nursing Louis through his illness she succeeded in carrying him away in disguise, and the mother and son, after a most perilous journey, reached France, which they had not seen for sixteen years. They arrived in Paris in April 1831: but the law banishing the Bonapartes was still in force, and the Government of Louis Philippe did not allow them to remain there more than twelve days. They were sent on, like other exiles, to England, and stayed for some weeks in London, from which they returned to Arenenberg. Louis, now twenty-three years old, was beginning to form the political theories which the memory of the first empire and the actual state of affairs in France under Louis Philippe naturally suggested to a thoughtful and ambitious mind. A pamphlet called Political Reveries, containing the draft of a constitution for France, and an Essay on Switzerland, Political and Military, were written by him in 1832-33. The first of these contains in a crude and superficial form the ideas elaborated by the author in his later works; the second gained for him the complimentary rank of captain of artillery from the authorities of Bern. Louis remained quiet for some years in Switzerland, but the death of the duke of Reichstadt in 1832 had made him presumptive head of the house of Bonaparte,—his uncle Joseph, the actual head, having no sons; and, in company with some adventurous friends, he formed the design of overthrowing Louis Philippe’s Government by presenting himself to the army. On the 28th October 1836 he came to Strasburg, and, after passing the next day in consultations with Colonel Vaudrey and a few officers who were in the plot, appeared at the quarters of the 4th artillery regiment, which Vaudrey commanded. This regiment welcomed him, and Louis then went on to the infantry barracks, where, however, the enterprise ended disastrously. He was arrested and imprisoned, and, after a short interval, sent to America by Louis Philippe without trial. He had not long been in the United States when he received a letter from his mother stating that she was about to undergo a dangerous operation. He returned to Switzerland in time to see her before her death (October 5, 1837), denying, probably with truth, that he had made any promise to Louis Philippe to remain absent from Europe. A pamphlet on the Strasburg affair, which was now published at his instigation by one of his companions, Lieutenant Laity, led the French ministry to demand his expulsion from Switzerland. The Swiss Government declining to expel him, and, difficulties with France becoming imminent, Louis voluntarily withdrew from the country and went to England. He lived there for the next two years, renting a house in Carlton Terrace, leading the life of a man of fashion, and associating with persons of prominence in society and on the turf. Among the gaieties of the time in which he took a part was Lord Eglinton’s famous tournament. His real interests, however, were of a more serious character, and in the autumn of 1839 he published the treatise Des Idées Napoléoniennes, a vigorous but sophistical account of Napoleon’s work as an administrator and organizer, and of his foreign policy. He idealized the emperor, contrasting his internal government with that of his successors in a series of questions addressed to the existing rulers of France, and he exhibited his wars of conquest as struggles forced upon him by the English and other Governments in consequence of his efforts to spread civilization, and to unite the peoples of Europe in a federal tie. This work was intended by its author to prepare the way for a new attempt against Louis Philippe; and in August 1840, while the body of Napoleon was being brought back from St Helena, he made his second descent upon France. Above fifty persons assisted him on this occasion, the best-known being Count Montholon, a companion of Napoleon I. in his exile. A ship was chartered, and the conspirators landed at Boulogne, carrying with them a tame eagle. The enterprise had not even the gleam of success which attended the expedition to Strasburg. No one joined them, and within an hour or two those of the party who were not shot or drowned in attempting to escape were lodged in prison. Louis was now brought to trial before the Chamber of Peers, where he was defended by Berryer. He was condemned to perpetual imprisonment, and the castle of Ham, on the Somme, was chosen as the place of his captivity. For the next six years Louis remained in confinement. He had the qualities which enable a man to bear imprisonment well,—patience,· calmness, a low vitality and sluggish temperament, and the power of absorbing himself in work. The fortitude with which, during these six dreary years, he pursued the occupations which he had marked out for himself, and retained, with intervals of depression, the belief in his own future, had certainly something of nobility in it. Happiness,” he wrote, “lies much more in the imagination than in the real world; and as I carry my imaginary world with me, composed of memories and hopes, I feel as strong in solitude as in the crowd.” In later life he described the prison of Ham as the university where he had taken his honours; and it was no doubt within this prison that he made himself, so far as literary study and discipline ever made him, a statesman. He published at intervals during his confinement, besides numerous occasional papers, an essay on the sugar question, in which he advocated a policy of protection; a treatise on the Extinction of Pauperism, in which he proposed the colonization of waste lands, and the establishment of communities organized on a somewhat socialistic basis; a scheme for cutting through the isthmus of Panama; and historical fragments on the English Revolution of 1688. He was working also at a History of Artillery, which was never finished. At the end of six years, after asking in vain for permission to visit his father, who was dying, Louis effected his escape, disguising himself with the aid of his faithful friend and fellow-prisoner, [9:17:228] Dr Conneau, as a workman, and walking out of the gates of the castle with a plank over his shoulder (May 25, 1846). He went again to London, and it is characteristic of the life of exile and imprisonment which he had hitherto passed that he heard for the first time a French tragedy performed when Rachel played in London in July 1846. He was now again in the fashionable world, and he appears to have been compelled to raise very large sums of money from money-lenders. The house in which he lived was No. 10 King Street, St James’s. In February 1848 Louis Philippe lost his throne. Louis Napoleon at once set off for Paris, offering his services to the provisional Government. He was, however, requested to withdraw from France, and did so. In April 1848, during the Chartist disturbances, he was serving in London as a special constable. But his name was kept before the public in France; he was put up for election to the assembly, and was elected at Paris and in three departments. As a Bonapartist movement was now evidently beginning, the executive commission demanded authority to arrest Prince Louis as an avowed pretender. This, however, was refused by the assembly, and it was voted that he should take his seat. Louis, however, had the astuteness to remain in the background until the workmen’s insurrection of June was over, declaring himself unwilling to be the cause of any disturbance. The insurrection was put down by Cavaignac; reaction set in, and Louis now appeared upon the scene as the candidate of order and the representative of authority. His first appearance in the assembly was on September 26, 1848; and in December he was elected president of the republic by above 5,000,000 votes, Cavaignac, who was second on the list, receiving a million and a half, and Lamartine a few thousands. On assuming office he swore in the presence of God to remain faithful to the republic, and to fulfil the duties imposed on him by the constitution. From this time the political history of Louis Napoleon is the history of France (see article France). The principal foreign affair of his presidency was the expedition to Rome, in which, for the sake of anticipating the action of Austria, French troops put down the Roman republic by force, and restored the pope to his sovereignty. Abroad this gained for Louis Napoleon the bitter hostility of Italian patriots, who remembered him as a companion in insurrection against the pope in 1831; and it was one of the many inconsistencies of his position that he was at once a friend of Italian freedom in his heart and yet, as the “man of order” and the “saviour of society” in France, dependent to a great extent upon the support of the priesthood. On the 2d of December 1851 he executed the coup d'état, which made an end of constitutional government. Approved at first by an enormous majority of the French people, and even by English public men of the type of Palmerston, this act is now almost universally recognized as a disastrous crime. The sham constitution which was promulgated by the president immediately afterwards lasted less than twelve months. In the following November a plebiscite was taken upon the question whether the imperial dignity should be re-established in the person of Louis Napoleon, and an affirmative answer was given by nearly 8,000,000 voters, against a dissentient minority of 250,000. The empire was inaugurated on the anniversary of the coup d'état, and for eighteen years Louis Napoleon was sovereign of France. The first ten years of his reign were successful, and in some respects brilliant. His marriage with Eugenie de Montijo, countess of Téba (January 30, 1853), placed beside him a figure which long charmed Paris and its visitors. Adhering to the alliance with England which, since 1830, had served France well against the three eastern courts, Napoleon III. entered into war against Russia. He had always represented the restoration of Poland to be one of the tasks left by his uncle to France; and, had his army encountered fewer difficulties in the Crimea, or had the German powers shown any inclination to take part in the struggle against Russia, he would probably have made some serious attempt to restore at least the duchy of Warsaw. But he was no soldier himself; the war proved a serious and embarrassing matter, and in the end Napoleon was far more anxious to make peace than his English ally. The second nationality which associated itself with Napoleonic history, and which had been crushed by the treaties of 1815, was the Italian. Napoleon III. had warning that the cause of Italy could not be safely abandoned. In January 1858 Orsini attempted to take his life. Whether or not the act of Orsini and the letters which he wrote from prison had the effect of quickening the emperor’s determination to do something for Italy may be disputed; but the time had now come, and in the interviews which took place between Napoleon and Cavour at Plombières in the autumn of 1858 the alliance between France and Sardinia against Austria was arranged. In the spring of 1859 French armies entered northern Italy, and the emperor himself took command. On the 4th of June he witnessed the battle of Magenta, and on the next morning entered Milan in company with Victor Emmanuel. During the battle of Solferino on June 24th, he gave directions from the tower of the church of Castiglione. He met the emperor of Austria at Villafranca on July 11 th, and there agreed to those preliminaries of peace which so deeply disappointed the hopes that had been excited by his own words,—“Italy free from the Alps to the Adriatic.” Venice was left to Austria; Lombardy west of the Mincio alone was liberated; and the subsequent union of the peninsula under the house of Savoy was no work of Napoleon III., whose own plan was to form an Italian federation under the presidency of the pope, and in virtual dependence upon France. Nevertheless the expulsion of Austria from Lombardy was in itself so great a blow that the later effects, though not foreseen by Napoleon, naturally resulted from it; and he has a better title to the gratitude of the Italians than they have generally acknowledged. The feelings with which Napoleon was regarded in Italy before and after the meeting of Villafranca are well exhibited in Mrs Browning’s two poems, Napoleon in Italy and An August Voice. The annexation of Nice and Savoy to France excited great uneasiness in the British Government, but the treaty of commerce between France and England, which was signed in January 1860, gave the emperor a popularity in England which he retained even after his fall. With the termination of the Italian war and the inauguration of a policy of free trade the rule of Napoleon III. had reached its best. His ill-judged interference in the affairs of Mexico ended disastrously; the part played by France in reference to the Danish War of 1864 was weak and inconsequent; and when the great struggle between Prussia and Austria was impending Napoleon appears to have been duped by Count Bismarck, and to have expected to gain Rhenish territory without taking up arms. Meanwhile the splendour of the court, the continuous improvements in Paris, the rapid growth of wealth throughout France, the subservience of officials, deputies, and journalists, had veiled the decline of administrative energy and the progress of corruption and mismanagement. At length, after the establishment of a great North-German power in 1866, the prestige of the emperor unmistakably sank. He had to loosen the reins of government at home; and yet the grant of any degree of liberty appeared to jeopardize his own existence. Failing in health, in confidence, in reputation, he was hurried into the war of 1870 by the clerical party at court, and by advisers who saw no help [9:17:229] for his dynasty but in a successful war. He was present with his only child^[1. Napoleon Eugène Louis born at Paris, March 16, 1856, killed in Zululand, June 1, 1879. ] at the bombardment of Saarbrücken on August 2d, and then retired into Metz, which he left on the 15th, the day between the battles of Courcelles and Mars-la-Tour. The empress insisted on the relieving movement which was then undertaken by Macmahon, and the emperor, going with the army, was made prisoner with 90,000 men at Sedan on September 2d. He was sent to the castle of Wilhelmshöhe, near Cassel, from which he subsequently retired to England. He lived with the empress at Chislehurst, and died there on January 9, 1873.

Napoleon III. was a thinker and man of letters rather than a statesman. Presuming on the accident of birth to seize absolute power and to direct the affairs of a great nation, he proved himself totally incapable as an administrator, and allowed office, political and military, to fall into the most unfit hands. Far superior himself, as a man of ideas, to his conqueror the king of Prussia, he never chose and never possessed a minister or a general who could be compared with those selected by his rival. In private life he was kindly and amiable, and the worst acts of his reign were rather those of the adventurers who surrounded him than his own. (C. A. F.)
