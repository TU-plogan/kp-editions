NOVOGEORGIEVSK, a town, and a fortress of Russia. (1) The former, usually known under the name of Kriloff, in the government of Kherson, district of Alexandriya, stands at the junction of the Tyasmin with the Dnieper, 9 miles to the north-west of the Krementchug railway station. Its fort was erected by the Poles in 1615 to protect the passage across the Dnieper, and to guard the steppe on the left bank of the river. The 10,500 inhabitants of Kriloff now carry on a lively trade in timber, grain, and cattle, and have a few flour-mills and candleworks. (2) Novogeorgievsk or Modlin is a first-class fortress of Russia in Poland, at the junction of the Nareff with the Vistula, 19 miles to the north-west of Warsaw. It constitutes the right flank of the line of defence of the Vistula against attack from the west, the centre of this line being at Warsaw, and the left flank at Ivangorod; 12,000 men are needed for its defence, and the fortifications can shelter from 48,000 to 50,000 men. The small town of Novoye Myesto, opposite the fortress, has 5500 inhabitants.
