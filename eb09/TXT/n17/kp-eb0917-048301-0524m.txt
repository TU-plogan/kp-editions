NICHOLAS, St, of Myra, according to the Roman breviary (December 6) was a native of Patara in Lycia, and was given to his parents in answer to their prayers. From his earliest infancy he signally displayed the piety for which his whole life was remarkable, on Wednesdays and Fridays regularly refusing to receive nourishment from his nurse except once only, and that after sunset. While still a youth he was deprived of his parents, and the wealth that he thus early inherited he forthwith distributed to the poor. To this périod belongs what may be called the characteristic deed of his life,—his secret bestowal of dowries upon the three daughters of a citizen fallen into poverty, who, unable to procure fit marriages for them, was minded to give them up to a life of shame. Having given himself wholly to God, Nicholas made a pilgrimage to Palestine, and in his voyaging miraculously stilled a storm by his prayers. On his return to his native province he visited Myra, the capital, where, as it fell out, the bishop had just died, and the chapter had been divinely advised to select as his successor a man named Nicholas who should be the first to enter the church next morning. Nicholas, thus plainly indicated, was duly consecrated, and displayed throughout his whole term of office every episcopal virtue. Under Maximian and Diocletian he was seized for his constancy, removed far from his diocese, and thrown into prison, where he lay until the days of Constantine, when he returned to Myra. He afterwards attended the council of Nice, and died a natural death not long after his return. His remains were subsequently removed to Bari (Barium) in Apulia. So far the authoritative Roman legend, the documentary evidence for which, however, does not take us farther back than to the 9th century at the earliest (Simeon Metaphrastes). Nicholas is not mentioned among the Nicene fathers by any of the church historians of that or the succeeding century, and the earliest extant trace of his existence is in the fact that a church was dedicated to him in Constantinople by Justinian about the year 560. Before the 12th century his name had become very prominent both in the Eastern and in the Western Church, it is difficult to tell precisely why; and to this day he is one of the most popular saints in the orthodox Greek communion. Among the miracles assigned to him is that of restoring to life three youths who had been murdered and salted down by an innkeeper in whose house they had taken lodging; thus Nicholas figures as the patron saint not only of poor maidens and of sailors but also of travellers and merchants. Children, and especially schoolboys, are also regarded as being especially under his guardianship, and in Russia and Greece, as well as throughout the north of Europe, the liberality of Nicholas or Klaus is yearly appealed to by them on the eve of his festival (December 6). His protection is specially invoked against thieves and losses by robbery and violence. It may be well to note that the “Old Nick” belonging to another cycle of legend has no connexion, as has sometimes been supposed, with the subject of the present article, that designation being etymologically connected with such words as Nixie, Nickar, and perhaps even with the river-name Neckar (see Grimm’s Deutsche Mythologie}.
