NAUMBURG, the chief town of a circle in the district of Merseburg, Prussian Saxony, and the seat of the provincial law courts, is pleasantly situated on the Saale, near its junction with the Unstrut, in the centre of an amphitheatre of vine-clad hills. The cathedral, an imposing building in the Romanesque Transition style (1207-42), has a Gothic choir at each end, and contains some interesting mediaeval sculptures. There are also three other Protestant churches, a Roman Catholic church, a gymnasium, a real-school, an orphanage, and two or three hospitals. The town-hall was originally the residence of the bishop. The inhabitants, who in 1880 numbered 17,868, are chiefly employed in producing wine (12,000 gallons yearly), but also manufacture cotton and woollen fabrics, chemicals, combs, and leather. Trade, facilitated by the navigable river, is [9:17:249] mainly concerned with wine, grain, vegetables, and dried fruit. An annual fair, founded by the emperor Maximilian in 1514, is still held here, but is now of little importance. Near Naumburg are Kosen, a favourite watering-place, and the celebrated school of Schulpforta, which has perhaps the strongest claim to the title of a German Eton.

In the 10th century Naumburg was a stronghold of the margraves of Meissen, who in 1029 transferred to it the bishopric of Zeitz for protection against the Wends. In Saxon history Naumburg is memorable as the scene of various treaties; and in 1561 an assembly of Protestant princes was held there, which made a futile attempt to cement the dissensions of the Protestants on doctrinal points. In 1564 the last bishop died, and the bishopric fell to the elector of Saxony. In 1631 the town was taken by Tilly, and in 1632 by Gustavus Adolphus. It became Prussian in 1814. An annual festival, with a procession of children, is referred to an apocryphal siege of the town by the Hussites in 1432, but is probably connected with an incident in the Brothers’ War, between elector Frederick of Saxony and his brother Duke William (1447— 51). Lepsius the antiquary and his more distinguished son the Egyptologist were born at Naumburg.
