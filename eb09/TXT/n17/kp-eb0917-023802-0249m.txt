NASMYTH, Patrick (1787-1831), the eldest son of Alexander Nasmyth, was born at Edinburgh on January 7, 1787. Having studied under his father, he went to London at the age of twenty, and soon attracted attention as a clever landscapist. He was a diligent student of the works of Claude and Richard Wilson, and of Ruysdael and Hobbema, upon whom his own practice was mainly founded. His most characteristic paintings are of English domestic scenery, full of quiet tone and colour, and detailed and minute expression of foliage, and with considerable brilliancy of sky effect. They were executed with his left hand, his right having in early life been injured by an accident. He died at Lambeth, August 17, 1831, during a thunderstorm, which at his own request he had been raised in bed to contemplate.
