NEPOS, Julius, the last but one of the Roman emperors of the West, from 474 to 475, was a nephew of that Marcellinus who in the latter half of the 5th century had established a semi-independent principality in Dalmatia. After the death of Olybrius, on October 23, 472, the throne of the West remained for some months vacant, during which Italy was abandoned to lawless barbarians. On the 5th of March 473, the army, at the instigation of Gundobaid the Burgundian, who had succeeded to the power and authority of his uncle Ricimer, raised Glycerius, an obscure officer, to the imperial dignity. Meanwhile Leo I., emperor of the East, was discussing with his council the election of a new colleague for the Western empire. At length choice was made of Nepos, who married a niece of the empress Verina. After considerable delay he landed in Italy and took Glycerius prisoner at Portus at the mouth of the Tiber in 474. Glycerius, being compelled to enter the church, was appointed bishop of Salona. The only event of the reign of Nepos was the inglorious cession to the Visigoths of the province of Auvergne. In 475 Orestes, father of Augustulus, who afterwards was the last emperor of the West, raised the standard of revolt and marched against Nepos at Ravenna. The emperor fled into Dalmatia, and continued to reside at Salona until his assassination by two of his own officers in 480. There exists some doubt, however, whether his death was, as Gibbon affirms, caused by his former rival, the bishop of Salona.
