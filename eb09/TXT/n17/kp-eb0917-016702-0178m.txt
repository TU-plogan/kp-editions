NAKHICHEVAN, or Nakhjevan, a city of Russian Armenia, the chief town of a circle in the government of Erivan, is situated in 39° 12' N. lat. and 45° 25' E. long., 100 miles south-east of Erivan and 267 miles from Tiflis. It occupies the brow of one of the last spurs of the Karabakh Mountains (Anti-Caucasus), 3015 feet above the sea, and looks out over the wide and beautiful valley of the Araxes. Built and rebuilt again and again, Nakhichevan is full of half-obliterated evidence of former periods of prosperity. The present houses have for the most part been quarried from ancient ruins; of the palace of the Atabeks of Azerbijan there still remains a gateway with a Persian inscription, flanked by two brick towers; and at a little distance stands the so-called Tower of the Khans, a richly decorated twelve-sided structure about 102 feet in circumference and 75 feet in height, dating, to judge by the marvellously executed inscription which runs round the cornice, from the 12th century. There are also ruins of a large mosque. Situated on the highroad to Tabriz and Teheran, Nakhichevan is the seat of a considerable transit trade. In the Persian period the city is said to have had 40,000 inhabitants; in 1863 there were only 6251, and in 1873 6877 (2157 Armenians, 4697 Tartars). At the latter date there were 1200 houses, one Russian Greek church, three Armenian churches, four mosques, and two caravanserais.

The origin of Nakhichevan (the Naxuana of Ptolemy) is unknown. Armenian tradition claims Noah as its founder, and a mean mound of earth in the city is still visited by many pilgrims as his grave. Laid waste by the Persians in the 4th century, Nakhichevan sank into comparative insignificance, but by the 10th century had recovered its prosperity. In 1064 it was taken by Alp Arslan, and in the 13th century it fell a prey to the followers of Jenghiz Khan. It afterwards suffered frequently during the wars between the Persians, Armenians, and Turks, and it finally passed into Russian possession by the peace of Turkmen-Chai in 1828.
