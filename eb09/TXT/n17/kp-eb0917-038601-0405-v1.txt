NEW GRANADA. The vast regions of the north-west of South America conquered by Spanish adventurers in the first half of the 16th century received from Quesada, one of the great leaders of the movement, the title of the New Kingdom of Granada. It was not till 1718, however, that the Spanish Government granted the president of the colony, Pedroza y Guerrero, the rank of viceroy; and at the desire of his successor, Jorge Villalonga, the honour was again withdrawn. In 1739 the New Kingdom of Granada was re-established under a viceroy, whose authority extended over the provinces of Tierra-firma (state of Panama), Cartagena (state of Bolivar), Santa Marta and Riohacha (state of Magdalena), Maracaibo, Caracas, Cumana, and Guiana (republic of Venezuela), Antioquia (state of Antioquia), Pamplona and Socorro (state of Santander), 'Tunja (state of Boyaca), Santa Fé (state of Cundinamarca), Neyva and Mariquita (state of Tolima), Popayan and Pasto (state of Cauca), and Quito, Cuenca, and Guayaquil (republic of Ecuador). In 1777 the provinces of Maracaibo, Caracas, Cumana, and Guiana were separated from the viceroyalty to form the captaincygeneral of Venezuela. For the republic of Colombia (1820-30), the republic of New Granada (1831-61), and the United States of Colombia (1861 to the present time), which have successively taken the place of the viceroyalty, see Colombia (vol. vi. p. 156); and compare Pereira, Les États-Unis de Colombie (Paris, 1883).
