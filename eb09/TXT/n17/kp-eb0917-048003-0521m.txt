NICE, a city of France, the chief town of the department of Alpes Maritimes, and previous to 1860 the capital of the countship of Nice (Nizza) in the kingdom of Sardinia, is situated in 43° 42' N. lat. and 7° 16' E, long., 739 miles by rail from Paris, and occupies a fine position at the mouth of the Paillon (Paglione), a stream (often dried up in summer) which, after a course of 20 miles, enters the northern end of the Baie des Anges. A steep isolated limestone hill, 315 feet in height, running back for some distance from the shore, forms the historical nucleus of the town. Formerly crowned by a castle, which previous to its destruction by the duke of Berwick in 1706 was one of the strongest fortresses on the coast, it is now laid out as a public pleasure-ground, and planted with aloe, cactus, agave, and palm. Towards its south-west corner stands a tower (Tour Bellanda or Clérissy) dating, it is believed, from the 5th century. The old town stretches along the western base of the hill; the “town of the 18th century” occupies the ground farther west, which slopes gently towards the Paillon; and away to the north-east and north and west beyond the stream lie the ever-growing quarters of the modern city. To the east of the hill, and thus out of sight of the more fashionable districts, the commercial quarter surrounds the port. The whole frontage of Nice is composed of fine embankments: the Quai des Ponchettes, constructed in 1770 round the base of the castle hill, is continued westward by the Quai du Midi as far as the Pont des Anges, which crosses the mouth of the Paillon; and from the public gardens and the municipal casino on the other side of the stream the Promenade des Anglais, a boulevard 85 feet wide, extends for more than a mile to the mouth of the Magnan, and is likely to be prolonged to the Var. A pier projecting into the sea from the promenade contains a “crystal palace” and a sea-bathing establishment. The course of the Paillon also is embanked on both sides, and at one part the Place Masséna, one of the largest public squares in the city, and the principal resort of foreign visitors, has been laid out across the stream. Besides a Roman Catholic cathedral—Ste Réparate, dating from [9:17:481] 1650—Nice possesses a Russian church, two synagogues, and several Protestant chapels. Architecturally the most remarkable church is Notre Dame, a modern Gothic building with two towers 213 feet high, erected by the town in 1835 to commemorate its preservation from cholera. The secular buildings include the town-house, the prefecture, the theatres, the hospitals, the lycée (founded by the Jesuits in the 17th century), the natural history museum, the library (especially rich in theology), and, at some distance from the town, the astronomical and meteorological observatory on Mount Gros. The industrial establishments comprise perfume factories, distilleries, oil-works, furniture and wood work factories, confectionery works, soap-works, tanneries, and a national tobacco factory employing several hundred persons. Besides the vine, the trees principally cultivated in the neighbourhood are the olive, the orange, the mulberry, and the carob; and the staple exports are oil, agricultural produce, fruits, and flowers. The harbour, which as yet only covers 10 acres, is being enlarged. In 1881 the population of the city was 54,953, and of the commune 66,279,—an increase respectively of about 9000 and 13,900 since 1872. During winter there is a large proportion of strangers from all parts of the world.

Protected towards the north by hills which rise stage behind stage to the main ridge of the Alps, Nice is celebrated for the mildness of its climate. The mean temperature is 60° Fahr., that of winter being 49°,of spring 56°, of summer 72°, and of autumn 63°. For a few nights in winter the mercury sinks below freezing point, but snow is practically unknown, falling, on an average, only half a day in the year. The highest reading of the thermometer is rarely above 90°. There are sixty-seven days with rain in the course of the year; but it usually falls in heavy showers which soon leave the sky clear again, though the whole annual amount exceeds 32 inches. Fine days and rainy days are almost equally distributed throughout the different seasons. The winds are very variable, sometimes changing several times a day. Apart from the ordinary land and sea breezes, the most frequent is the east wind, which is especially formidable during autumn. The south-west wind is moist and warm; the north-east, which is happily rare, brings storms of hail and even snow in winter. The mistral (from the north-west) and the tramontane (from the north) are generally stopped by the mountains; but when they do reach the city they raise intolerable dust-storms. For two thousand years the climate of Nice has been considered favourable in chest complaints. Those who are requiring rest, and those suffering from gout, asthma, catarrhs, rachitic affections, scrofula, stone, also experience benefit; but the reverse is the case when heart disease, nervous disorders, or ophthalmia are concerned. Autumn is the best season; in spring the sudden changes of temperature demand great care. Means of passing the time pleasantly are fairly abundant. The city is at its liveliest during the carnival festivities, in which, ' as at Rome, battles are waged with sweetmeats and flowers.

Nice (Nicaea) was founded about two thousand years ago by the Phocaeans of Marseilles, and received its name in honour of a victory {.νίκη) over the neighbouring Ligurians. It soon became one of the busiest trading stations on the Ligurian coast; but as a city it had an important rival in the town of Cemenclium, which continued to exist till the time of the Lombard invasions, and has left its ruins at Cimiez (Italian, Cemella), 2⅛ miles to the north. In the 7th century Nice joined the Genoese league formed by the towns, of Liguria. In 731 it repulsed the Saracens; but in 859 and 880 they pillaged and burned it, and for the most of the 10th century remained masters of the surrounding country. During the Middle Ages Nice had its share in the wars and disasters of Italy. As an ally of Pisa it was the enemy of Genoa, and both the king of France and the emperor of Germany endeavoured to subjugate it; but in spite of all it. maintained its municipal liberties. In the course of the 13th and 14th centuries it fell more than once into theΙιands of the counts of Provence; and at length in 1388 it placed itself under the protection of the counts of Savoy. The maritime strength of Nice now rapidly increased till it was able to cope with the Barbary pirates; the fortifications were largely extended and the roads to the city improved. During the struggle between Francis I. and Charles V. great damage was caused by the passage of the armies invading Provence; pestilence and famine raged in the city for several years. It was in Nice that the two monarchs in 1538 concluded, through the mediation of Paul III., a truce of ten years; and a marble cross set up to commemorate the arrival of the pope still gives its name, Croix de Marbre, to part of the town. In 1543 Nice was attacked by the united forces of Francis I. and Barbarossa; and, though the inhabitants, with admirable courage, repulsed the assault which succeeded the terrible bombardment, they were ultimately compelled to surrender, and Barbarossa was allowed to pillage the city and to carry off 2500 captives. Pestilence appeared again in 1550 and 1580. In 1600 Nice was taken by the duke of Guise. By opening the ports of the countship to all nations, and proclaiming full freedom of trade, Charles Emmanuel in 1626 gave a great stimulus to the commerce of the city, whose noble families took part in its mercantile enterprises. Captured by Catinat in 1691, Nice was restored to Savoy in 1696; but it was again besieged by the French in 1705, and in the following year its citadel and ramparts were demolished. The treaty of Utrecht in 1713 once more gave the city back to Savoy; and in the peaceful years which followed the “new town” was built. From 1744 till the peace oi Aix-la-Chapelle (1748) the French and Spaniards were again in possession. In 1775 the king of Sardinia destroyed all that remained of the ancient liberties of the commune. Conquered in 1792 by the armies of the French Republic, the countship of Nice continued to be part of France till 1814; but after that date it reverted to Sardinia. By a treaty concluded in 1860 between the Sardinian king and Napoleon III. it was again transferred to France, and the cession was ratified by nearly 26,000 electors out of a total of 30,700. Nice is the seat of a bishopric, at present dependent on the archbishopric of Aix, and the headquarters of a military division forming part of the corps d’armée of Marseilles. Masséna and Garibaldi were natives of the city.
