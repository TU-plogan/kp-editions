NAHARRO, Bartolom√©de Torres, a Spanish dramatist of the period immediately preceding that of Cervantes and Lope de Vega, born at Torres in the neighbourhood of Badajoz, was for some time a captive in Algiers, and after receiving his freedom visited the court of Leo X. at Rome. Here his satirical pen excited such hostility that he was compelled to fly to Naples, where he lived for some time under the protection of Fabricio Colonna, and where he published his Propaladia in 1517. He died in poverty and obscurity; the time and place are unknown. See Drama, vol. vii. p. 420.
