NEWTOWN (Welsh, Drefnewydd∙, ancient name, Llanfair Cedewain), a market-town and parliamentary borough of Montgomeryshire, is situated on both sides of the Severn, 11 miles east-north-east of Llanidloes, and 13 south-southwest of Welshpool. It is a well-built town with wide and regular streets, although some of the houses are of timber. The principal buildings are the public rooms (1835), the infirmary (1867), and the market-hall (1870). Newtown is the principal seat of the Welsh flannel manufacture, to which now has been added that of tweeds and shawls. It joins with Welshpool, Llanfyllin, Montgomery, Llanidloes, and Machynlleth in returning a member to parliament. The population of the urban sanitary district of Newtown and Llanllwchaiarn in 1871 was 5886, and in 1881 it was 7170.
