NET. A net consists of a fabric of thread, twine, or cord, the intersections of which are firmly knotted so as to form meshes or interspaces of fixed dimensions,—the meshes being usually lozenges of uniform size. The art of netting is intimately related to weaving, knitting, plaiting, and pillow-lace and machine-lace making, from all of which, however, it is distinguished by the knotting of the intersections of the cord. It is one of the most ancient and universal of arts, having been in all times commonly practised among the rudest and most primitive tribes, to whom the net is of great importance in hunting and fishing.

Net-making, as a modern industry, is principally concerned with the manufacture of the numerous forms of net used in fisheries, but netting is also largely employed for many and varied purposes, as for catching game and birds, for the temporary division of fields, for protecting fruit in gardens, for collecting insects, for hammocks, and ship use, for screens and other furniture purposes, for ladies’ hair, house bags, &c. While to a large extent net-making continues to be a handicraft, since the early part of the 19 th century numerous forms of machine have been invented for netting, and several of these have been successfully introduced on a large scale in factories for the manufacture Of fishing nets. Such fishing nets were formerly made principally from hemp fibre—technically called “twine”; but since the adaptation of machinery to net-making cotton has been increasingly used. Cotton nets, being more flexible and lighter than those made of twine, are much more easily handled and stowed, and in practice they are rapidly superseding all others.

The forms of fishing nets vary according to the manner in which they are intended to act. This is either by entangling the fish in their complicated folds, as in the trammel; receiving them into pockets, as in the trawl; suspending them by the body in the meshes, as in the mackerel-net; imprisoning them within their labyrinthlike chambers, as in the stake-net; or drawing them to shore, as in the seine (See Fisheries, vol. ix. p. 247). The parts of a net are the head or upper margin, along which the corks are strung upon a rope called the head [9:17:359] rope; the foot is the opposite or lower margin, which carries the foot-rope, on which in many cases leaden plummets are made fast. The meshes are the squares composing the net. The width of a net is expressed by the term “over”; e.g., a day-net is three fathoms long and one over or wide. The lever is the first row of a net. There are also accrues, false meshes, or quarterings, which are loops inserted in any given row, by which the number of meshes is increased. To bread or breathe a net is to make a net. Dead netting is a piece without either accrues or stole (stolen) meshes, which last means that a mesh is taken away by netting into two meshes of the preceding row at once.

Hand-Netting.— Net-making as a handicraft is a simple and easily acquired art; the labour is not hard; and the implements and materials are easily obtained and inexpensive, while a little practice in meshing is sufficient to develop wonderful dexterity of movement. The tools used in netting are the needle, an instrument for holding and netting the material; it is made with an eye E, a tongue T, and a fork F (fig. 1). The twine is wound on it by being passed alternately between the fork and round the tongue, so that the turns of the string lie parallel to the length of the needle, and are kept on by the tongue and fork. A spool or mesh-pin is a piece of wood on which the loops are formed (round, as in fig. 2, or flat, as in fig. 3), the circumference or the spool determining the size of the loops. Each loop contains two sides of the square mesh; therefore, supposing that it be required to 1 o — „

make a mesh 1 inch square,-that is, f ⅛∙ 1 * i ⅛ r ∙ 2 ∙ Flg ' 3 ∙

measuring 1 inch from knot to knot,—a spool 2 inches in circumference must be used. Large meshes may be formed by giving the twine two or more turns round the spool, as occasionmayrequire; or the spool may be made flat, and of a sufficient width, having a portion cut away to admit the finger and thumb to grasp it conveniently (fig. 3). The method of making the hand-knot in pets known as the fisherman’s knot is more easily acquired by example than described in writing. Fig. 4 shows the course of the twine in forming a single knot. From the last-formed knot the twine passes over the front of the mesh-pin h, and is caught behind by the little finger of the left hand, forming the loop s, thence it passes to the front and is caught at d by the left thumb, then through the loops s and m as indicated, after which the twine is released by the thumb and the knot is drawn ’ ‘ taut” or tight. Fig. 5 shows the form of the fisherman s knot, and fig. 6 is a bend knot used for uniting two ends of twine.

Machine-Netting.— So long ago as 1778 a netting-machine was patented by William Horton, William Ross, Thomas Davies, and John Golby. From that time till the end of the 18th century several other patents for similar· machines were secured in Great Britain, but there is no evidence that any of them was practically successful. In 1802 the French Government, through the Société d’Encouragement pour ΓIndustrie Nationale, offered a reward of 10,000 francs to the person who should invent an automatic machine for net-making. The reward attracted the attention of Jacquard, who submitted a model of a machine which was brought under the notice of Napoleon I. and Carnot. Jacquard was summoned to Paris by the emperor, who, with forcible if profane point, asked of the inventor—“Are you the man who pretends to do what God Almighty cannot—tie a knot in a stretched string ?” Jacquard’s model, which is incomplete, was deposited in the Conservatoire des Arts et Métiers; it was awarded a prize, and he himself received an appointment in the Conservatoire, where he was not long in peι ’ fecting his famous Jacquard attachment to the common loom. In 1806 Μ. Buron of Bourgthéroulde (Eure) submitted to the Société d’Encouragement a model of a netting-machine for which he was awarded a gold medal. His model is also deposited in the Conservatoire. Meantime attention continued to be given to the problem in the United Kingdom, and the first to succeed practically in inventing an efficient machine and in establishing the industry of machine net-making was Mr James Paterson of Musselburgh. Paterson, originally a cooper, served in the army through the Peninsular war, and was discharged after the battle of Waterloo. From his early days he had devoted his mind to the invention of a net-making machine, and on his retirement from the army he set himself to carry out his purpose. After much labour he succeeded, and established a machine net factory in Musselburgh about 1820. The early form of machine was, however, imperfect, the knots it formed slipped readily, and, there being much prejudice against machine nets, the demand for his manufactures was small. Mr Walter Ritchie, a native of Musselburgh, devised a method for forming the ordinary hand-knot on the machine nets, and the machine, so improved, and patented in July 1835, became the foundation of an extensive and flourishing industry. Paterson’s factory about 1849 passed into the hands of Messrs J. & W. Stuart, by whom the machine and processes have been still further developed and perfected.

The mechanism of the Paterson net-loom or machine is complex, and not to be understood without elaborate diagrams or actual inspection. It consists of an arrangement of hooks, needles, and sinkers, one of each being required for every mesh in the breadth being made. The needles hold the meshes, while the hooks seize the lower part of each and twist it into a loop. Through the series of loops so formed a steel wire is shot, carrying with it twine for the next range of loops. This twine the sinkers successively catch and depress sufficiently to form the two sides and loop of the next mesh to be formed. The knot formed by threading the loops is now tightened up, the last formed mesh is freed from the sinkers and transferred to the hooks, and the process of looping, threading, and knotting thus continues.

Another form of efficient net-loom, working on a principle distinct from that of Paterson, was invented and patented in France by Μ. Onésiphore Pecqueur in 1840, and again in France and in the United Kingdom in 1849. The machine of Pecqueur was improved on by many subsequent inventors; and especially the additions made by MM. Baudouin and Jouannin, patented in the United Kingdom in 1861, greatly perfected its principle. In this machine separate threads or cords running longitudinally for each division of the mesh are employed, as will be seen from fig. 7, which represents a section of the net with the knots loose to show their structure. It will also be observed that the alternate threads a and b are differently disposed—the a series being drawn into simple loops over and through which the threads of the b series have to pass. On the machine the a series of threads are arranged vertically, while the b series are placed horizontally in thin lenticular spools. Over the horizontal b series is a range of hooks equal in number with the threads, and set so that they seize the b threads, raise them, and give them a double twist, thus forming a row of open loops. The loops are then depressed, and, seizing the vertical a threads, draw them crotchet-like through the b loops into loops sufficiently long and open to pass right over the spools containing the b threads (fig. 8), after which it only remains to tighten the threads and the mesh is complete. The machines work well λvith steam-power; and each requires only one female attendant.

Bobbin Net, which is the foundation of machine-made lace, is made by the intertwisting—not knotting—of contiguous threads (see Lace, vol. xiv. p. 185).

Wire-netting, which is in extensive demand for garden use, poultry coops, and numerous like purposes, is also a twisted structure made principally by machine power. The chief centre of wire-net making is Warrington in Lancashire. (J. PA.)
