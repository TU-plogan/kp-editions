NEW ALBANY, a flourishing manufacturing city of the United States, in Floyd county, Indiana, occupies a good position on the left bank of the Ohio, nearly opposite the west end of Louisville, 156 miles below Cincinnati. It is handsomely built, with wide and well-shaded streets, and among its public edifices are a city-hall, a court-house, an opera-house capable of containing 2500 persons, a masonic hall, and an oddfellowsâ€™ hall. Abundant waterpower is obtained from the falls about two miles up the river. Besides the glass-works, which rank as the largest in the United States, the industrial establishments comprise foundries, pork-packing factories, boatbuilding yards, rolling mills, cotton and woollen mills, and hosiery mills. Laid out in 1813, and incorporated as a city in 1839, New Albany increased its population from 4226 in 1840 to 16,423 in 1880, and is still rapidly growing.
