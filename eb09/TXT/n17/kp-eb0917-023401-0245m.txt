NARSINHPUR,^[1. Narsinhpur is also the name of a petty native state in Orissa. ] a district in the chief-commissionership of the Central Provinces, India, lying between 22° 45' and 23° 15' N. lat. and between 78° 38' and 79° 38' E. long., bounded on the N. by Bhôpâl state and by Sâgar, Damoh, and Jabalpur districts, E. by Seoni, S. by Chhindwârâ, and W. by Hoshangâbâd. It forms a portion of the upper part of the Nerbudda valley. The first of those wide alluvial basins which, alternating with rocky gorges, give so varied a character to the river’s course opens out just below the famous marble rocks in Jabalpur, and extends westward for 225 miles, including the whole of Narsinhpur, together with the greater part of Hoshangâbâd. The Sâtpurâ hills to the south are here a generally regular range, nowhere more than 500 feet above the plain, and running almost parallel to the river, at a distance of 15 or 20 miles. In the intervening valley, the rich level of black wheat land is seldom broken, except by occasional mounds of gravel or nodular limestone, which afford serviceable village sites. Along the foot of the boundary hills the alluvium gives -way to belts of red gravelly soil, rice and sugar-cane take the place of wheat, and forest trees that of mango groves.

The population in 1880 was 365,173, the Hindus numbering 305,562, and the Mohammedans only 13,425. The most numerous of the aboriginal tribes are the Gonds (46,645). Only two towns contained upwards of 5000 inhabitants—Narsinhpur (7816) and Gadarwàra (6553). Of the area of 1916 square miles, 974 were under cultivation in 1882. Wheat is the staple crop, occupying 280,898 acres; other food grains took up 245,797 acres; cotton, 46,204 acres; and sugar-cane, 2271 acres. Rotation of crops is not practised, but when the soil shows signs of exhaustion gram or some other pulse is substituted for two or three years. Cultivators dare not leave their lands fallow, even for a single year, for the ground would be immediately occupied by rank kdns grass, which no exertions can eradicate till it has run its course of about ten years. The principal export is cotton. Coal mining is carried on at Moh-pani, Sihora, and Setarewa; and iron-ore of excellent quality is smelted in large quantities at Tendukherâ and elsewhere there being 38 mines in operation in 1882.
