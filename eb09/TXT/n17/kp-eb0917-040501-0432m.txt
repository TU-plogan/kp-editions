NEW PLYMOUTH, a seaport on the west coast of the North Island of New Zealand, is situated about 20 miles to the north-eastward of Cape Egmont, in 39° 4' S. lat. and 174° 5' E. long. It is the capital of the provincial district of Taranaki. The position of the town is picturesque, sloping to the ocean in front, and with a background of forest surmounted by the snow-clad cone of Mount Egmont (8000 feet). The settlement was founded in 1841 by the Plymouth Company under the auspices of the New Zealand Company, and chiefly consisted of emigrants from Devonshire and Cornwall. The railway to Wellington is rapidly approaching completion. The town has a hospital, several places of worship, and manufactories for coach-building and painting, for furniture, for rope and twine, for tanning, and for making brick, tile, and pottery. On the beach at New Plymouth there are extensive deposits of ironsand. New Plymouth returns one member to the house of representatives, and is a borough with an elective mayor and municipal council. The population in 1883 was about 4000.
