NOVEMBER (or Novembris, sc. mensis, from novem), the ninth month of the old Roman year, which began with March. By the Julian arrangement, according to which the year began with 1st January, November, while retaining its old name, became the eleventh month and had thirty days assigned to it. The 11th of November was held to mark the beginning of winter (hiemis initium); the sacred banquet called “epulum Jovis” took place on the 13th. The principal November festivals in the calendar of the Roman Church are :—All Saints’ Day on the 1st, All Souls’ on the 2d, St Martin’s on the 11 th, the Presentation of the Virgin on the 21st, St Cecilia’s on the 22d, St Catherine’s on the 25th, and St Andrew’s on the 30th. St Hubert is commemorated on the 3d. In the English calendar All Saints’ and St Andrew’s are the only feasts retained, and the “Papists’ Conspiracy,” for which a particular service is appointed, is commemorated on the 5th. The eve of St Andrew’s is a fast. The Anglo-Saxon name of November was Blotmonath (blood month), the latter name probably alluding to the custom of slaughtering cattle about Martinmas for winter consumption. In the calendar of the first French republic November reappeared partly as Brumaire and partly as Frimaire.
