NYBORG, a town and seaport of Denmark on the east side of the island of Fünen, 28∣ miles by rail east of Odense, and the point from which the steam-packets cross the Great Belt to Korsör in Zealand. The fortress, built by Christian IV. and Frederick III., was dismantled in 1869, and the ruins of the castle are now used as a prison. From 4812 in 1870 the population increased to 5402 by 1880.

As early as the 12th century the town was founded and a castle erected on Knudshoved (Canute’s Head) by Knud, nephew of Waide-mar the Great; and from the 13th to the 15th century Nyborg was one of the most important places in Denmark, a seat of the royal court, and a frequent meeting-place of the estates. In 1531 the people of Lübeck took the town by storm. In 1658 it surrendered to the Swedes; but Peter Bredal, icebound in the harbour, held [9:17:688] them at bay till he was able to make his escape. By the defeat of the Swedes under the walls of the fortress in 1659 the country was freed from their dominion. In 1808 the marquis La Romana, who with a body of Spanish troops garrisoned the fortress for France, revolted from his allegiance and held out till he and a portion of his men got off with the English fleet.
