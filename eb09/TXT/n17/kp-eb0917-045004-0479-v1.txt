NEW YEAR’S DAY. The first day {calends) of January, as marking the beginning of the year, was observed as a public holiday in Rome from at least the time of the Julian reformation of the calendar. Ovid (A⅛s., i. 63 sq.) alludes to the abstinence from litigation and strife, the smoking altars, the white-robed processions to the Capitol; and later writers describe the exchanges of visits, the giving and receiving of presents {strenae), the masquerading, and the feasting with which the day was in their time celebrated throughout the empire. Libanius (c. 346 a.d.) speaks of it as being in his day the one ’ great holiday common to all under the Roman rule. Participation by Christians in the ordinary New Year’s Day observances, as well as in the Saturnalia of the preceding month of December, which was from the first discouraged by the church, called forth repeated protests, not only from eminent individuals such as TertulL·an {De Idol., 14), Augustine {Serm. de Kai. Jan.), and Chrysostom {Hom. in Kal.), but also from various provincial synods; and the sixty-second canon of the Quinisext general council (692) was expressly directed against “the so-called Calends, and Vota, and Brumalia.” Christians were expected to spend the day in quiet meditation, reading of scripture, and acts of charity and beneficence. When about the 5th century the 25th of December had gradually become a fixed festival commemorative of the Nativity, the 1st January ultimately also assumed a specially sacred character as the octave of Christmas Day and as the anniversary of the circumcision of our Lord, and as such it still figures in the calendars of the various branches of the Eastern and of the Western Church, though only as a feast of subordinate importance. The practice of giving and receiving “strenae” for luck about the beginning of the year survives in such institutions as the French “jour d’étrennes” and the Scottish “Handsel Monday.” The Persians also, it may be mentioned, celebrated the beginning of the year {nev rûz) by exchanging presents of eggs. For particulars as to the date of commencement, and also as to the duration, of the year, whether civil or sacred, in various nations and religions, reference may be made to the article Calendar.
