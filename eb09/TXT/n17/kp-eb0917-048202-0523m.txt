NICEPHORUS III. (Botaniates), emperor of Constantinople from 1078 to 1081, belonged to a family which claimed descent from the Roman Fabii. He served in the army, and rose to be commander of the forces in Asia. In 1078 he assumed the purple at Nicaea, almost simultaneously with Nicephorus Bryennius (father or uncle of the historian of that name), who had revolted against Michael VII. at Adrianople; the aristocracy and clergy of the capital supported the claims of Botaniates, who was crowned on March 25, 1078. With the able help of Alexius Comnenus, the recalcitrant generals Ursel, Bryennius, and Basilacius were successively driven from the field, but soon afterwards the wakeful jealousy of the emperor was turned upon their conqueror, who was compelled to flee the court. Alexius, however, had hold of the army, and on April 1, 1081, ascended the throne, Nicephorus being forced to abdicate and become a monk of St Basil. He died in obscurity.
