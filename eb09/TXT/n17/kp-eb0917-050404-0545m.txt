NIKOPOLI, or Nicopoli (Turkish, Nighebolu or Nebuï), a city of Bulgaria, the chief town of a circle in the district of Plevna (Plyeven), is picturesquely situated on the south bank of the Danube, at the confluence of the Osma. According to the census of 1881 it had only 4652 inhabitants, but previous to its destruction by the Russians in 1877 they numbered about 10,000, and as a military post the town has for centuries been of considerable importance. A ruined castle still dominates the place, and fortifications stretch down to the river.

Nikopoli occupies the site of the ancient Asanιus, but by some mediaeval confusion bears the name of Nicopolis ad Istrum, which was founded by Trajan several miles down the river, at the inflow of the Iatrus or Yantra, at the spot still called Nikup. The following are the chief points in the modern history of the place :— capture of the fortress by Sigismund of Hungary in 1392 and 1395; defeat of Sigismund and his hosts in 1396 by Bajazet; siege of the town by Uladislaus of Hungary in 1444; defeat of the Turks by Bathori in 1595 and by Michael of Wallachia in 1598; occupation of the fortress by the Russians in 1810; destruction of the Turkish flotilla and storming of the Turkish camp by Govaroff in 1829; and the capture and burning of the town by the Russians under Krüdener on 15th June 1877.
