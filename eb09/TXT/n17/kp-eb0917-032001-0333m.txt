NELSON, a seaport of New Zealand, capital of a provincial district of the same name, prettily situated in 41° 18' S. lat. and 173° 19' E. long., on the shores of a small harbour at the bottom of Blind Bay on the northern coast of the South Island. It is a diocesan city, and contains several churches and a college. The climate is healthy, and the surrounding scenery very picturesque. The woods and fields in the neigbourhood abound with English song-birds, and the streams are stocked with trout; while the orchards in the town and suburbs are famous for English kinds of fruit, and hops are extensively cultivated. The industries include brewing, the manufacture of cloth (chiefly a superior kind of tweed), tanning, soap-boiling, candle-making, and the preparation of paint produced from haematite. A railway 23 miles long connects Nelson with Bellgrove, and is in course of extension towards Roundell up the Wai-iti valley. The borough returns one member to the house of representatives, and its local affairs are administered by a mayor and council elected by the ratepayers. The entrance to Nelson harbour is 10 miles south-west of Pepin Island. Six miles from the entrance commences the long and remarkable Boulder Bank, whose southern portion forms the natural breakwater to that anchorage. The population of Nelson in 1881 was 6764 (3261 males and 3503 females).
