NEVIANSK(Nevianskiy, or Neivinskiy Zavod ), a town of Russia, in the government of Perm, 62 miles to the north-north-west of Ekaterinburg, is situated on the eastern slope of the Ural mountains, in the populous valley of the Neiva, surrounded by mountains composed of talc and chlorite schists and granites, in a district very rich in iron and also in auriferous sands. The population in 1881 numbered 13,980 (17,950 with its suburb, the Byngovskiy iron-work), all Great-Russians, and mostly Nonconformists (edinovyertsy), of whom about 3000 are employed at the iron-works, while the others carry on various small trades, such as the manufacture of boxes widely sold in Siberia, small iron-wares, and boots, or engage in agriculture. The merchants of the town carry on an active trade, and its fairs are very animated. The iron industry produced in 1879 96,000 cwts. of cast iron and 45,000 cwts. of wrought iron, and the average yearly yield of gold is about 400 lb.

The iron-work at Neviansk is the oldest on the Ural, having been founded in 1699. In 1702 Peter I. presented it to Demidoff, with 3,900,000 acres of land around it, of which 522,000 acres, besides 60,000 acres of forest, still belong to the present proprietors of the works, the merchants Yakovleffs. Five iron-mines, seven gold-washings, and two iron-works are its dependencies. Several other important iron-works are situated within short distances of Neviansk, on the Neiva river, and are usually comprised under the same name of Neivinsk iron-works, the chief being Verkhne-Neivinsk (Upper Neivinsk), situated 14 miles to the south (3960 inhabitants); Neivo-Rudyansk, 8 miles to the south (4020); Petrokamensk, 32 miles to the north-east (2200); Neivo-Shaytansk, 8 miles lower down the Neiva (3000); and Neivo-Alapaevsk (6000).
