NEPOS, Cornelius, a Roman historian, friend of Catullus, Cicero, and Pomponius Atticus, was probably a native of Verona. Nothing is known of his life, but he is recorded to have written a universal history under the title Chrqnica, letters to Cicero, and other works, especially a series of biographies styled De Viris Illustribus. It is one of the problems of Latin literature whether or not any of these works have been preserved. There is a series of biographies, chiefly of Greek generals, first printed at Venice in 1471 under the title Aemilii Probi de Vita Excellentium. Other later editions bear slightly varying titles, and add the lives of Cato and Atticus. Many MSS. expressly assign the last to Cornelius Nepos, and in 1569 Lambinus, in a famous edition of the Lives, maintained that the whole of them were the work of Nepos. The chief argument in favour of this view is founded on the language, which is a model of chaste, elegant Latinity. The view of Lambinus has been very generally accepted; the only question debated is whether all the lives are in the original condition, or whether some of them have been modified or abridged by Aemilius Probus. The editions of Neposâ€™s Lives are extremely numerous, the book having long been much read in schools.
