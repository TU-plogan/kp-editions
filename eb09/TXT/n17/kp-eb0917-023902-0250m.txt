NASTURTIUM. The common water-cress (A r . officinale), so largely used as a salad, may be taken as a representative of this genus of Cruciferse,— a genus characterized, for the most part, by pinnately divided foliage, white or yellow cruciform flowers, and long pods with a double row of seeds. The embryo root is folded up along the edges of the cotyledons, accumbent. Four species are British, but the only one cultivated is the A r . officinale. Its flavour is due to an essential oil containing sulphur, its antiscorbutic properties to the presence of iodine, iron, and phosphates. Although now so largely consumed, it does not appear to have been cultivated in England prior to the present century, though in Germany, especially near Erfurt, it had been grown long previously. The plants are grown in shallow water in rows parallel to the direction of the current, and from 5 to 7 feet apart. It is essential that the water be free from impurity, especially sewage. To avoid this latter contingency cresses are sometimes grown in a north border, the soil being kept constantly moist; or they may be grown in pots in a frame or greenhouse, the pots being placed in a saucer of water, and the plants frequently watered. This plan was introduced by Mr Shirley Hibberd, and when the requisite attention is given is highly successful when commercial considerations are not a matter of primary importance. The name Nasturtium is also applied in gardens, but incorrectly, to the species of Troρεeolum.
