NAPHTHA, a word originally applied to the limpid liquid portion of the petroleum which exudes abundantly at Baku, &c., on the shores of the Caspian Sea. It is the νάφθα of Dioscorides, and the naphtha or hitumen liquidum candidum of Pliny. Both in commerce and in science the term is now used somewhat vaguely, but more in a generic sense, to embrace several bodies having certain properties in common, than as a specific name for a particular substance. Naphtha indeed has no distinct place or meaning in modern chemistry. By the alchemists the word was used principally to distinguish various highly volatile, mobile, and inflammable liquids, such as the ethers,— sulphuric ether and acetic ether having been known respectively as Naphtha sulphurici and Naphtha aceti. In recent times naphtha has been employed to indicate the volatile, limpid, inflammable hydrocarbons obtained by destructive distillation of organic substances artificially conducted, as well as those produced by similar agencies acting within the earth. In commerce the application of the term is still more restricted, and in general it embraces no more than the more volatile portion of the fluid hydrocarbons separated in the distillation of tar.

Under the name naphtha we thus find the subjoined series of substances comprehended. (1) Coal-tar naphtha consists of the lightest and first separated portions of the hydrocarbons obtained in the distillation of gas-tar. It embraces the hydrocarbons having a specific gravity ranging from about 850° up to 950°, and is, especially in its lighter fractions, rich in benzole. (2) Shale naphtha is obtained in the purification of the crude oil got by the destructive distillation of shale and other carbonaceous minerals. The first fraction secured, having a specific gravity ranging from 640° to 680°, is termed gasoline; and coming between this and the ordinary burning oils is a light volatile and highly inflammable oil with a specific gravity of 700°-760°, known commonly as naphtha, but also more conveniently termed shale spirit. It is valuable as a solvent, and is also used to some extent for burning in open air. (See Paraffin.) (3) Native naphtha is the more fluid portion of the rock oil or petroleum found in many parts of the world. (4) Wood naphtha, or methyl alcohol, has been already described under Methyl, vol. xvi. p. 195. (5) Caoutchouc naphtha: a series of hydrocarbons can be prepared by the distillation of india-rubber, [9:17:175] and may be separated by means of fractional distillation; together, under the name of caoutchine, they form a most efficient solvent for india-rubber itself. (6) Bone naphtha, or bone oil, known also as Dippel’s animal oil, is a most offensively smelling product of the distillation of bones in the preparation of animal charcoal. The persistent and repulsive stench of this substance effectually precludes its industrial use among the naphthas.
