NEALE, John Mason (1818-1866), ecclesiastical historian and hymnologist, was born in London, January 24, 1818, and was educated at Trinity College, Cambridge. He became incumbent of Crawley, Sussex, in 1842, and in 1846 warden of Sackville College, East Grimstead, an appointment which he held till his death, August 6, 1866.

Neale was strongly High Church in his sympathies, and in 1855 founded a sisterhood named St Margaret’s. The most important of his publications is his History of the Eastern Church (1850-51). He occupies a high place as a hymnologist, but principally as a translator of ancient and modern hymns, his best-known translations being probably “Brief life is here our portion,” “To thee, 0 dear, dear country,” and “Jerusalem the golden,” which are included in the poem of Bernard of Cluny, De Contemptu Mundi, translated by him in full. He also published Essays on L·iturgiology, 1863; and among his other works are Mcdiaeval Preachers, 1857, and History of the so-called Jansenist Church of Holland, 1858.
