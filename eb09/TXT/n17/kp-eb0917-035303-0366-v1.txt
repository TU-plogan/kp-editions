NESSELRODE, Charles Robert (1780-1862), long foreign minister of Russia, was born at Lisbon, where his father was Russian ambassador, in December 1780. Like so many other Russian statesmen and soldiers, he was sprung from German ancestors settled in Livonia. He entered early upon a diplomatic career, and at the age of twenty-five was attached to the Russian embassy in Paris. When the alliance of Tilsit was breaking down, Nesselrode was recalled to St Petersburg, and during the events that followed Napoleon’s invasion of Russia he rose high in the favour of the czar Alexander. From the time when Romanzoff, the advocate of a peace-policy, was dismissed, Nesselrode was employed in all the great diplomatic transactions of his master. He was present, though not as a plenipotentiary, at the congress of Prague, and signed the treaty of Chaumont, in which the allies pledged themselves to continue the struggle against Napoleon, if necessary, for twenty years. In the negotiations as to the future of France, both in 1814 and 1815, he seems to have encouraged the czar in his policy of moderation. At the congress of Vienna his duties were shared by Capodistrias, and a certain rivalry existed then and afterwards between the two statesmen. In Capodistrias the czar found more sympathy both with his own earlier liberal tendencies and with his religious sentimentality. In the subsequent congresses of Troppau and Laibach, when Metternich, as the champion of European conservatism, set himself to repress any sympathies that the czar might have for constitutional rule in Naples and for Greek independence, it was with Nesselrode that he allied himself; Capodistrias, a Greek and a man of more modern ideas, was now treated as a dangerous person, and ultimately had to retire from office. Nesselrode followed the fluctuating and reactionary course of the czar’s thoughts, and remained in favour till the death of Alexander in 1825. Nicholas kept him in office, and Nesselrode now promptly adapted himself to the more vigorous policy that suited his new master, especially [9:17:354] in Eastern affairs. He conducted the diplomacy of Russia throughout the contention which led to the war of 1828 and to the peace of Adrianople. Years passed by, and he grew old in office, pursuing with patience and discretion the ends which Russian statesmanship has always set before itself. Belonging rather to the cautious than the adventurous school of politicians, and attaching great value to the support of the German powers, he viewed with no great pleasure the approach of the Crimean war. He continued in office, however, until its close; and it is remarkable that a man who was at the head of Russian diplomacy during the conflict with Napoleon I. should have lived to conclude the peace of Paris under Alexander II. in 1856. He died in 1862, still retaining the office of chancellor of Russia, though he had ceased to hold the ministry of foreign affairs.
