NEVA, a river of Russia which carries off into the Gulf of Finland the waters of Lakes Ladoga, Onega, and Ilmen and many smaller basins. It issues from the south-west corner of Lake Ladoga in two channels which form the island of Oriekhoff, and are obstructed by sandstone reefs, so that the better of the two has a depth of only from 7 to 16 feet in its fairway. A little farther down it becomes completely navigable, and in the neighbourhood of the island of St Nicholas it attains a breadth of 4200 feet; but between the village of Ostrovkofi and that of Ust-Tosnui (Tosna-mouth) it passes over a limestone bed which, lying only from 2 to 12 feet below the surface, produces a series of rapids, and reduces the width of the river to from 1050 to 840 and that of the navigable passage to from 350 to 175 feet. From Ust-Tosnui downwards there is no further obstacle. Nine or ten miles from its outfall the river enters St Petersburg, and then 5 or 6 miles lower down [9:17:367] breaks up into the Great Neva (850 to 1700 feet wide), the Little Neva (945 to 1365), and the Great Nevka (280 to 1205), this last, two miles farther on, sending off the Little Nevka (370 to 1129). In front of the delta are sandbanks and rocks which prevent the passage of vessels except by five narrow channels, of which the best has a depth of 7 to 20 feet. The most of its alluvial burden being deposited in the lakes, the Neva takes a long time to alter its channels or extend its delta: an accession of 1570 acres was all that was registered between 1718 and 1834. According to Destrem the current above the delta is 114,659,529 cubic feet per minute, a mass of water greater than that of the Rhone or the Rhine. The ordinary rise and fall of the river is comparatively slight, but when the west wind blows steadily for a long time, or when Lake Ladoga sends down its vast accumulations of block-ice, inundations of a dangerous kind occur. In 1824 and 1879 the former cause produced a rise of more than 12 feet. According to observations extending from 1703 to 1879, the mean day of the freezing of the Neva is November 25, the earliest October 28 (1805), the latest (not quite certain) January 9 (1711), and the next latest December 26 (1826). The mean day of opening is April 21, the earliest March 18 (1822), and the latest May 12 (1810). The mean number of days open is 218, the least 172 (1852), the greatest 279 (1822).
