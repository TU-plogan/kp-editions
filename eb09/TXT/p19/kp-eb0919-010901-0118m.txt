PINZON, a family of wealthy Spanish navigators, of Palos de Moguer, in Andalusia, three members of which —Alonzo, Francesco, and Vicente, brothers—were associated with Columbus in his great discovery.

Martin Alonzo Pinzon, born about the middle of the 15th century, gave material assistance to Columbus in carrying out his project. In the expedition of 1492 Alonzo commanded the “Pinta,” on board of which his brother Francesco was pilot; another brother, Vicente Yanez, had command of the “Nina.” It was at Alonzo’s pursuasion that on October 7th the course of the expedition was changed to the south-west; the island of Guanahani or San Salvador, four days after, was sighted. On November 21, off the coast of Cuba, Alonzo separated himself from the expedition, and crowded sail to the westward, hoping to be the first to arrive at the land of gold of which they had heard the natives speak. After an absence of six weeks he rejoined Columbus, who accepted the excuses he gave for his absence. On the return journey Alonzo again separated from his leader, probably by design, and when Columbus arrived at Palos on March 15, 1493, he learned that Alonzo had already landed at Bayona in Galicia. If his object was to forestall Columbus and obtain the credit of being the discoverer of the Neλv World, his intentions were foiled; he λvas refused the [9:19:110] audience which he craved of the sovereigns, and very shortly after died, it is supposed of chagrin. Even although it could be proved that Alonzo’s intentions were dishonourable, we should remember that it was largely through his liberality that Columbus was enabled to carry out his immortal voyage.

Vicente Yanez Pinzon, who commanded the “Nina,” also gave Columbus material help, and remained loyal to his leader throughout. In after years he made important discoveries on his own account. In 1499 he sailed with four caravels across the Atlantic to the south-west, and on January 20, 1500, he struck the South-American continent at Cape S. Agostinho, its most easterly projection, three months before the Portuguese navigator Cabral reached Brazil, the discovery of which is generally attributed to him. Proceeding southwards a short distance, he then turned north, followed the coast to the north-west, and went as far at least as what is now Costa Rica. After touching at Hayti, and losing two of his vessels among the Bahamas, Vicente returned to Palos in the end of September 1500. Although concessions were made to him, and he was created governor of the newly discovered lands by Ferdinand and Isabella, he does not seem to have ever taken possession. In 1508 we find Vicente sailing with Juan Diaz de Salis along the east coast of South America, in their attempt to find an opening towards the west that would conduct them to the Spice Islands. He did not get beyond the 40th degree of S. lat., about the mouth of the Rio Negro, having passed the mouth of the La Plata without recognizing it. After 1523 all traces of Vicente are lost.
