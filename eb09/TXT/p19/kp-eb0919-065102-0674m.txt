PRADIER, James, French sculptor, was born at Geneva in 1790 and died in Paris on 5th June 1852. He was a member of the Academy and a brilliant and popular sculptor of the pre-Romantic period, representing in France the drawing-room classicism which Canova illustrated at Rome. His chief works are the Son of Niobe, Atalanta, Psyche, Sappho (all in the Louvre), Prometheus (Tuileries Gardens), a bas-relief on the triumphal arch of the Carrousel, the figures of Fame on the Arc de l’Étoile, and a statue of J. J. Rousseau for Geneva.
