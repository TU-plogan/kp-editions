PROSKUROFF, a district town of the government of Podolia, Russia, situated on the railway from Odessa to Lemberg, 62 miles to the north-west of Schmerinka junction, and on the highway from Zhitomir to Kieff. It is poorly built, mostly of wood, on a low marshy plain surrounded by hills, at the junction of the Ploskaya with the Bug. Its old castle has been destroyed, the site being occupied by a Catholic church. The Orthodox cathedral (1839) contains a very ancient and highly venerated icon of the Virgin. The manufactures are insignificant; but the Jewish merchants carry on an active export trade in corn and sugar, while the imports consist of salt and various manufactured wares. Agriculture and market-gardening are the chief occupations of its Little-Russian inhabitants. Of the population (11,750 in 1880) more than one-half are Jews.
