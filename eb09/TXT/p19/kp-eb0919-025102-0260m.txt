PO, the largest river of Italy, traverses the whole length of the great plain between the Alps and the Apennines, which was in the Miocene period an arm of the sea connecting the Adriatic with the Mediterranean by what is now the Col d’Altare or Col di Cadibona and has gradually been filled by detritus from the surrounding highlands. That its course lies much nearer the Apennines than the Alps is evidently due to the fact that the tributaries from the loftier range on the north, whether in the form of glacier or stream, have all along been much more powerful than the tributaries from the south. The total length of the river from its conventional source to the mouth of the principal channel is 417⅛ miles, and the area of its basin, which includes portions of Switzerland and Austria, is estimated at 26,798 square miles. The general course of the river has been already described in Italy (vol. xiii. p. 435).

The Po forms a very extensive delta, and is probably one of the most active of all rivers in the work of denudation. Prony has calculated that between 1200 and 1600 the delta advanced at the rate of 80 feet per annum; and between 1600 and 1804 the rate is said to have been as much as 230 feet. This advance has naturally been attended by great changes in the course and size of the several channels. Ravenna, for example, once a great port, now stands on dry land 4 miles from the sea. The modern lagoons of Comacchio, which stretch southwards from the delta, are being artificially reclaimed by the help of the alluvial deposits.

In its ordinary condition the Po has a depth between Pancalieri and the month of the Ticino of from 6 to 10 feet, and between the mouth of the Lambro and that of the Adda of about 14 or 15 feet. Lower down the depth occasionally exceeds 40 feet. Permanent fords exist only in the upper Po, and between the mouths of the Ticino and the Lambro. In times of great drought the bed is quite dry at Rovello, and fords appear below Casalmaggiore and at Borgoforte, where the French and Germans crossed in 1796, 1807, 1813, and 1814; but in general the river forms a complete barrier both to foot and horse. The principal points where crossing is effected by ferries or bridges are *Moncalieri, Turin, *Casale Monferrato, Frassinato, *Valenza, *Mezzana Corti, *Piacenza, Cremona, Casalmaggiore, Brescello, *Borgoforte, San Benedetto, Ostiglia, *Occhiobello, Pontelagoscuro, Francolino. Railway bridges exist at the places distinguished by an asterisk.

The river in general is at its fullest in May and June, and at its lowest in January (see details in Lombardini’s elaborate study on the lower Po in Memorie del Reale Istituto Lombardo, Milan, 1870). The ordinary floods on the Po are attended with little danger; but at intervals sometimes of a few sometimes of many years they become events of the gravest national concern. Those of 1651 and 1705 are among the most destructive recorded in history, and in the present century the more memorable are those of 1839, 1846, 1855, 1857, 1868, 1872, and 1879. In 1872 1150 square miles of country between the Reno and ∙the Adige were submerged, the district about Modena was turned into a lake, the people of Revere saved the rest of their town only by sacrificing the front row of houses to form a temporary embankment, and it was only by the wisely conducted energy of its inhabitants that Ostiglia was kept from destruction. During April and May 1879 the rainfall was exceptionally heavy, the quantity for May alone being equal to more than a third of the annual total. The result was a rise in all the tributaries of the Po, and on May 30 the flood in the main river was 21 feet above low water at Mt·zzana Corta. A breach 720 feet long in the embankment between Bonizzo and Borgofranco caused the submergence of 155 square miles in the provinces of Mantua, Modena, and Ferrara, and involved in its repair a national expenditure of £53,460.

Of the £5,902,981 devoted by the Government to the regulation of the rivers of Italy in the twenty years 1861-1880, £2,257,872 had to be appropriated to the Po and its tributaries. Nowhere in Europe except in Holland has the system of embankment been carried to such perfection on so extensive a scale. A wide bed for the river at its height is enclosed for long distances by a massive master-dyke or froldo, and in the space between this and the ordinary channels suitable areas are often enclosed by secondary dykes or golene. The following figures show the extent of the system in 1880

Recent researches (see Helbig, Die Italiker in der Po-Ebene, Leipsic, 1879) show that the lower valley of the Po was at an early period occupied by people of the Palaeolithic and Neolithic stages of civilization, who built houses on piles along the swampy borders of the streams. It is possible that even they may have begun by crude dykes the great system by which the waters are now controlled; at least it is certain that these works date their origin from pre-Roman antiquity. Pliny refers them to the Etruscans, who occupied the country before the arrival of the Gauls. The reclaiming and protecting of the riparian lands went on rapidly under the Romans, and in several places the rectangular divisions of the ground, still remarkably distinct, show the military character of some of the agricultural colonies. During the time of the barbarian invasions much of the protective system was allowed to fall into decay; but the later part of the Middle Ages saw the works resumed and carried out with great energy, so that the main features of the present arrangement were in existence by the close of the 15th century.

The usual name for the Po among Greek and Latin authors was Padus (∏αδor); but the Greek writers of the empire began to apply to it the poetic name of Eridanus, familiar in the Phaethon myth.
