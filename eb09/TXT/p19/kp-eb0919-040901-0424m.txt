POLOTSK, a district town of the government of Vitebsk, at the confluence of the Polota with the Dwina (Düna), 5 miles from the Smolensk and Riga Railway, is one of the oldest towns of Russia. The continuous wars, however, of which, owing to its position on the line of communication between central Russia and the west, it was for many centuries the scene, have allowed almost nothing of its remarkable antiquities to remain. The “upper castle” which stood at the confluence of the rivers and had a stone-wall with seven towers, is now in ruins, as also is the “lower castle,” formerly enclosed with strong walls and connected with the upper by a bridge. The numerous monasteries and convents also have disappeared. The cathedral of St Sophia in the upper castle, built in the 12th century, and successively used as a place of worship by the Greek, the Catholic, and the “United” Churches, fell to ruins in the 18th century, when the “United” bishop Grebnicki substituted a modern structure. The town is now of trifling importance, and the population (12,200 in 1880, against 13,800 in 1865) is decreasing. Upwards of two-thirds of the inhabitants are Jews; the remainder have belonged mostly to the Greek Church since [9:19:410] 1839, when they were compelled to abandon the Union. Flax, linseed, corn, and timber are the leading articles of the commerce of the town.

Polotesk or Poltesk is mentioned in 862 as one of the towns given by Rurik to his men, together with Byelo-ozero and Rostoff. In 980 it had a prince of its own, Rogvolod,‘whose daughter is the subject of many legends. It remained an independent principality until the 12th century, resisting the repeated attacks of the princes of Kieff; those of Pskoff, Lithuania, and the Livonian knights, however, proved more powerful, and it fell under Lithuanian rule in the following century. About 1385 its independence was destroyed by the Lithuanian prince Witowt. It was five times besieged by Moscow in 1500-18, and was taken by John the Terrible in 1563. Recaptured by Stephen Batory sixteen years later, it became Polish by the treaty of 1582. It was then a populous city, which, enjoying the privileges of “Magdeburg law” from 1498, carried on an active commerce, and covered a large area. Pestilences and conflagrations were its ruin; the plague of 1566 wrought great havoc among its inhabitants, and that ot 1600 destroyed 15,000. The castles, the town, and its walls were burned in 1607 and 1642. The Russians continued their attacks, burning and plundering the town, and twice taking possession of it for a few years, in 1633 and 1705. It was not definitively annexed, however, to Russia until 1772, after the first dismemberment of Poland. In 1812 its inhabitants resisted the French invasion, and the town was partially destroyed.
