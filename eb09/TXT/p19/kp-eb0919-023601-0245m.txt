PLUTUS (πλούτος, “wealth”), the Greek god of riches, whom Demeter bore to Iasion “in the fat land of Crete.” He enriched every one whom he fell in with. According to Aristophanes, he was blinded by Zeus in order that he might not enrich the good and wise alone. At Thebes there was a statue of Fortune holding the child Plutus in her arms; at Athens he was similarly represented in the arms of Peace; at Thespiae he was represented standing beside Athene the Worker. Elsewhere he was represented as a boy with a cornucopia. He is the subject of one of the extant comedies of Aristophanes.
