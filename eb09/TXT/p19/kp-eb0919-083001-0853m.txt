PROTOZOA

PROTOZOA is the name applied to the lowest grade of the animal kingdom, and originated as a translation of the German term “Urthiere.” Whilst at first used some forty years ago in a vague sense, without any strict definition, so as to include on the one hand some simple organisms which are now regarded as plants and on the other some animals which are now assigned a higher place in the animal series, the term has within the last twenty years acquired a very clear signification.

The Protozoa are sharply and definitely distinguished from all the rest of the animal kingdom, which are known by the names “Metazoa” or “Enterozoa.” They are those animals which are structurally single “cells” or single corpuscles of protoplasm, whereas the Enterozoa consist of many such units arranged definitely (in the first instance) in two layers—an endoderm or enteric cell-layer and an ectoderm or deric cell-layer—around a central cavity, the enteron or common digestive cavity, which is in open communication with the exterior by a mouth.

The Protozoa are then essentially unicellular animals. The individual or person in this grade of the animal kingdom is a single cell; and, although we find Protozoa which consist of aggregates of such cells, and are entitled to be called “multicellular,” yet an examination of the details of structure of these cell-aggregates and of their lifehistory establishes the fact that the cohesion of the cells in these instances is not an essential feature of the life of such multicellular Protozoa but a secondary and non-essential arrangement. Like the budded “persons” forming, when coherent to one another, undifferentiated “colonies” among the Polyps and Corals, the coherent cells of a compound Protozoon can be separated from one another and live independently; their cohesion has no economic significance. Each cell is precisely the counterpart of its neighbour; there is no common life, no distribution of function among special groups of the associated cells, and no cor- Γ3sponding differentiation of structure. As a contrast to this we find even in the simplest Enterozoa that the cells are functionally and structurally distinguishable into two groups—those which line the enteron or digestive cavity and those which form the outer body wall. The cells of these two layers are not interchangeable; they are fundamentally different in properties and structure from one another. The individual Enterozoon is not a single cell; it is an aggregate of a higher order consisting essentially of a digestive cavity around which two layers of cells are disposed. The individual Protozoon is a single cell; a number of these individuals may, as the result of the process of fission (cell-division), remain in contact with one another, but the compound individual which they thus originate has not a strong character. The constituent cells are still the more important individualities; they never become differentiated and grouped in distinct layers differing from one another in properties and structure; they never become subordinated to the individuality of the aggregate produced by their cohesion; hence we are justified in calling even these exceptional aggregated Protozoa unicellular.

By far the larger number of Protozoa are absolutely single isolated cells, which, whenever they duplicate themselves by that process of division common to these units of structure (whether existing as isolated organisms or as constituents of the tissues of plants or of animals), separate at once into two distinct individuals which move away from one another and are thenceforward strangers.

Whilst it is easy to draw the line between the Protozoa and the Enterozoa or Metazoa which lie above them, on account of the perfectly definite differentiation of the cells of the latter into two primary tissues, it is more difficult to separate the Protozoa from the parallel group of unicellular plants.

Theoretically there is no difficulty about this distinction. There is no doubt that organisms present themselves to us in two great series starting in both cases from simple unicellular forms. The one series, the plants, can take up the carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen necessary to build up their growing protoplasm from mineral compounds soluble in water, compounds which constitute the resting stage of those elements in the present physical conditions of our planet. Plants can take their nitrogen in the form of ammonia or in the form of nitrates and their carbon in the form of carbonic acid. Accordingly they require no mouths, no digestive apparatus; their food being soluble in water and diffusible, they absorb at all or many points of their surface. The spreading diffuse form of plants is definitely related to this fact. On the other hand the series of organisms which we distinguish as animals cannot take the nitrogen, necessary to build up their protoplasm, in a lower state of combination than it presents in the class of compounds known as albumens; nor can they take carbon in a lower state of combination than it presents when united with hvdroeen or with [9:19:831]

hydrogen and oxygen to form fat, sugar, and starch. Albumens and fats are not soluble in water and diffusible; they have to be seized by the animal in the condition of more or less solid particles, and by chemical processes superinduced in the living protoplasm of the animal by the contact of these particles they are acted upon, chemically modified, and rendered diffusible. Hence the animal is provided with a mouth and a digestive cavity, and with organs of locomotion and prehension by which it may search out and appropriate its scattered nutriment. Further the albumens, fats, sugars, and starch which are the necessary food of an animal are not found in nature excepting as the products of the life of plants or of animals; accordingly all animals are in a certain sense parasitic upon either plants or other animals. It would therefore seem to be easy to draw the line between even the most minute unicellular plants and the similarly minute unicellular animals—assigning those which feed on the albumens, &c., of other organisms by means of a mouth and digestive apparatus to the animal series, and those which can appropriate the elements of ammonia, nitrates, and carbonates to the plants.

Such absolute distinctions lending themselves to sharp definitions have, however, no place in the organic world; and this is found to be equally true whether we attempt to categorically define smaller groups in the classification of plants and animals or to indicate the boundaries of the great primary division which those familiar names imply. Closely allied to plants which are highly and specially developed as plants, and feed exclusively upon ammonia, nitrates, and carbonates, we find exceptionally modified kinds which are known as “insectivorous plants” and are provided with digestive cavities (the pitchers of pitcherplants, &c.), and actually feed by acting chemically upon the albumens of insects which they catch in these digestive receptacles. No one would entertain for a moment the notion that these insectivorous plants should be considered as animals. The physiological definition separating plant from animal breaks down in their case; but the consideration of the probable history of their evolution as indicated by their various details of structure suffices at once to convince the most sceptical observer that they actually belong to the vegetable line of descent or family tree, though they have lost the leading physiological characteristic which has dominated the structure of other plants. In this extreme case it is made very obvious that in grouping organisms as plants or as animals we are not called upon to apply a definition but to consider the multifarious evidences of historical evolution. And we find in the case of the Protozoa and the Protophyta that the same principle holds good, although, when dealing with extremely simple forms, it becomes much more difficult to judge of the genetic relationship of an organism in proportion as the number of detailed points of possible agreement with and divergence from other forms to which it may be supposed to be related are few.

The feeding of plants upon carbonic acid is invariably accompanied by the presence of a peculiar green-colouring matter—chlorophyll. In virtue of some direct or indirect action of this chlorophyll the protoplasm of the plant is enabled to seize the carbon of the mineral world—the carbon which has sunk to the lowest resting stage of combination—and to raise it into combination with hydrogen and oxygen and ultimately with nitrogen. There are plants which have no chlorophyll and are thus unable to feed upon carbonic acid. They are none the less plants since they agree closely with particular chlorophyll-bearing plants in details of form and structure, mode of growth and reproduction. A large series of these are termed Fungi. Though unable to feed on carbonic acid, they do not feed as do animals. They can take their carbon from acetates and tartrates, which animals cannot do, and their nitrogen from ammonia. Even when it is admitted that some of these colourless plants, such as the Bacteria (Schizomycetes), can act upon albumens so as to digest them and thus nourish themselves, it is not reasonable to place the Bacteria among animals, any more than it would be reasonable so to place Nepenthes, Sarracenia, and Drosera (insectivorous Phanerogams). For the structure and mode of growth of the Bacteria is like that of well-known chlorophylligerous minute Algae from which they undoubtedly differ only in having secondarily acquired this peculiar mode of nutrition, distinct from that which has dominated and determined the typical structure of plants.

So we find in a less striking series of instances amongst animals that here and there the nutritional arrangements which we have no hesitation in affirming to be the leading characteristic of animals, and to have directly and perhaps solely determined the great structural features of the animal line of descent, are largely modified or even altogether revolutionized. The green Hydra, the freshwater Sponge, and some Planarian worms produce chlorophyll corpuscles in the protoplasm of their tissues just as green plants do, and are able in consequence to do what animals usually cannot do—namely, feed upon carbonic acid. The possibilities of the protoplasm of the plant and of the animal are, we are thus reminded, the same. The fact that characteristically and typically plant protoplasm exhibits one mode of activity and animal protoplasm another does not prevent the protoplasm of even a highly developed plant from asserting itself in the animal direction, or of a thoroughly characterized animal, such as the green Hydra, from putting forth its chlorophylligenous powers as though it belonged to a plant.

Hence it is not surprising that we find among the Protozoa, notwithstanding that they are characterized by the animal method of nutrition and their forms determined by the exigencies of that method, occasional instances of partial vegetable nutrition such as is implied by the development of chlorophyll in the protoplasm of a few members of the group. It would not be inconsistent with what is observed in other groups should we find that there are some unicellular organisms which must, on account of their structural resemblances to other organisms, be considered as Protozoa and yet have absolutely given up altogether the animal mode of nutrition (by the ingestion of solid albumens) and have acquired the vegetable mode of absorbing ammonia, nitrates, and carbonic acid. Experiment in this matter is extremely difficult, but such “vegetable” or “holophytic nutrition” appears to obtain in the case of many of the green Flagellata, of the Dinoflagellata, and possibly of other Protozoa.

On the other hand there is no doubt that we may fall into an error in including in the animal line of descent all unicellular organisms which nourish themselves by the inception of solid nutriment. It is conceivable that some of these are exceptional creophagous Protophytes parallel at a lower level of structure to the insectivorous Phanerogams. In all cases we have to balance the whole of the evidence and to consider probabilities as indicated by a widely-reaching consideration of numerous facts.

The mere automatic motility of unicellular organisms was at one time considered sufficient indication that such organisms were animals rather than plants. We now know that not only are the male reproductive cells of ferns and similar plants propelled by vibratile protoplasm, but such locomotive particles are recognized as common products (“swarm-spores” and “zoospores ”) of the lowest plants.

The danger of dogmatizing erroneously in distinguishing[9:19:832] Protozoa from Protophyta, and the insuperable difficulty in really accomplishing the feat satisfactorily, has led at various times to the suggestion that the effort should be abandoned and a group constituted confessedly containing both unicellular plants and unicellular animals and those organisms which may be one or the other. Haeckel has proposed to call this group the Protista (I).^[1. These numbers refer to the bibliography at p. 866. ] On the whole, it is more satisfactory to make the attempt to discriminate those unicellular forms which belong to the animal line of descent from those belonging to the vegetable line. It is, after all, not a matter of much consequence if the botanist should mistakenly claim a few Protozoa as plants and the zoologist a few Protophyta as animals. The evil which we have to avoid is that some small group of unattractive character should be rejected both by botanist and zoologist and thus our knowledge of it should unduly lag. Bearing this in mind the zoologist should accord recognition as Protozoa to as wide a range of unicellular organisms as he can without doing violence to his conceptions of probability.

Â very interesting and very difficult subject of speculation forces itself on our attention when we attempt to draw the line between the lowest plants and the lowest animals, and even comes again before us when we pass in review the different forms of Protozoa.

That subject is the nature of the first protoplasm which was evolved from not-living matter on the earth’s surface. Was that first protoplasm more like animal or more like vegetable protoplasm as we know it to-day? By what steps was it brought into existence?

Briefly stated the present writer’s view is that the earliest protoplasm did not possess chlorophyll and therefore did not possess the power of feeding on carbonic acid. A conceivable state of things is that a vast amount of albuminoids and other such compounds had been brought into existence by those processes which culminated in the development of the first protoplasm, and it seems therefore likely enough that the first protoplasm fed upon these antecedent steps in its own evolution just as animals feed on organic compounds at the present day, more especially as the large creeping plasmodia of some Mycetozoa feed, on vegetable refuse. It indeed seems not at all improbable that, apart from their elaborate fructification, the Mycetozoa represent more closely than any other living forms the original ancestors of the whole organic world. At subsequent stages in the history of this archaic living matter chlorophyll was evolved and the power of taking carbon from carbonic acid. The “green” plants were rendered possible by the evolution of chlorophyll, but through what ancestral forms they took origin or whether more than once, i.e., by more than one branch, it is difficult even to guess. The green Flagellate Protozoa (Volvocineae) certainly furnish a connecting point by which it is possible to link on the pedigree of green plants to the primitive protoplasm; it is noteworthy that they cannot be considered as very primitive and are indeed highly specialized forms as compared with the naked protoplasm of the Mycetozoon’s plasmodium.

Thus then we are led to entertain the paradox that though the animal is dependent on the plant for its food yet the animal preceded the plant in evolution, and we look among the lower Protozoa and not among the lower Protophyta for the nearest representatives of that first protoplasm which was the result of a long and gradual evolution of chemical structure and the starting point of the development of organic form.

The Protozoon Cell-Individual compared with the Typical Cell of Animal and Vegetable Tissues. Morphology.

The Protozoon individual is a single corpuscle of protoplasm, varying in size when adult from less than the ττ> 1 σt7^ °f an i nc h in diameter (some Sporozoa and Flagellata) up to a diameter of an inch (Nummulites), and even much larger size in the plasmodia of Mycetozoa. The substance of the Protozoa exhibits the same general properties —irritability, movement, assimilation, growth, and division —and the same irremediable chemical alteration as the result of exposure to a moderate heat, which are observed in the protoplasm constituting the corpuscles known as cells which build up the tissues of the larger animals and plants. There is therefore no longer any occasion to make use of the word “sarcode” which before this identity was established was very usefully applied by Dujardin (2) to the substance which mainly forms the bodies of the Protozoa. Like the protoplasm which constitutes the “cells” of the Enterozoa and of the higher plants, that of the Protozoon body is capable of producing, by chemical processes which take place in its substance (over and above those related merely to its nutrition), a variety of distinct chemical compounds, which may form a deposit in or beyond the superficial protoplasm of the corpuscle or may accumulate centrally. These products are therefore either ectoplastic or entoplastic. The chemical capacities of protoplasm thus exhibited are very diverse, ranging from the production of a denser variety of protoplasm, probably as the result of dehydration, such as we see in the nucleus and in the cortical substance of many cells, to the chemical separation and deposition of membranes of pure chitin or of cellulose or of shells of pure calcium carbonate or quasicrystalline needles of silica.

Nucleus. —The nucleus is probably universally present in the Protozoon cell, although it may have a very simple structure and be of very small size in some cases. The presence of a nucleus has recently been demonstrated by means of appropriate staining reagents in some Protozoa (shellbearing Reticularia or Foraminifera and many Mycetozoa) where it had been supposed to be wanting, but we are not yet justified in concluding absolutely that there are not some few Protozoa in which this central differentiation of the protoplasm does not exist; it is also a fact that in the young forms of some Protozoa which result from the breaking up of the body of the parent into many small “spores” there is often no nucleus present.

In contrast to this it is the fact that the cells which build up the tissues of the Enterozoa are all derived from the division of a nucleated egg-cell and the repeated division of its nucleated products, and are invariably nucleated. The same is true of tissue-forming plants,— though there are a few of the lowest plants, such as the Bacteria, the protoplasm of which presents no nucleus. In spite of recent statements (3) it cannot be asserted that the cells or protoplasmic corpuscles of the yeast-plant (Saccharomyces) and of the hyphae of many simple moulds contain a true nucleus. We are here brought to the question “What is a true nucleus ?” The nucleus which is handed on from the egg-cell of higher plants and Enterozoa to the cells derived from it by fission has lately been shown to possess in a wide variety of instances such very striking characteristics that we may well question whether every more or less distinctly outlined mass or spherule of protoplasm which can be brought into view by colouring or other reagents, within the protoplasmic body of a Protozoon or a Protophyte, is necessarily to be considered as quite the same thing as the nucleus of tissueforming egg-cell-derived cells.

Researches, chiefly due to Flemming (4), have shown that the nucleus in very many tissues of higher plants and animals consists of a capsule containing a plasma of “achromatin” not deeply stained by reagents, ramifying in which is a reticulum of “chromatin” consisting of fibres which readily take a deep stain (Fig. I., A). Further it is demonstrated that, when the cell is about to divide into two, definite and very remarkable movements take place in the nucleus, resulting in the disappearance of the capsule and in an, arrangement of its fibres first in the form of a wreath (Fig. I., D) and subsequently (by the breaking of the loops formed by the fibres) in the form of a star (E). A further movement within the nucleus leads to an arrangement of the broken loops in two groups (F), the position of the open ends of the broken loops being reversed [9:19:833]

as compared with what previously obtained. Now the two groups diverge, and in many cases a striated appearance of the achromatin substance between the two groups of loops of chromatin is observable (H). In some cases (especially egg-cells) this striated arrangement of the achromatin substance precedes the separation of the loops (G). The striated achromatin is then termed a “nucleusspindle,” and the group of chromatin loops (Fig. I., G, α) is known as “the equatorial plate.” At each end of the nucleus-spindle in these cases there is often seen a star consisting of granules belonging to the general protoplasm of the cell (G, c). These are known as “polar stars.” After the separation of the two sets of loops (H) the protoplasm of the general substance of the cell becomes constricted, and division occurs, so as to include a group of chromatin loops in each of the two fission products. Each of these then rearranges itself together with the associated achromatin into a nucleus such as was present in the mother-cell to commence with. This phenomenon is termed “karyokinesis,” and has been observed, as stated above, in a large variety of cells constituting tissues in the higher animals and plants.

There is a tendency among histologists to assume that this process is carried out in all its details in the division of all cells in the higher plants and animals, and accordingly to assume that the structural differentiation of achromatin plasma and chromatin nucleus-fibres exists in the normal nucleus of every such cell. If this be true, it is necessary to note very distinctly that the nucleus of the Protozoon cell-individual by no means conforms universally to this model. As will be seen in the sequel, we find cases in which a close approach is made by the nucleus of Protozoa to this structure and to this definite series of movements during division (Fig. VIII. 3 to 12, and Fig. XXV.); and a knowledge of these phenomena has thrown light upon some appearances (conjugation of the Ciliata) which were previously misinterpreted. But there are Protozoa with a deeply-placed nucleus-like structure which does not present the typical structure above described nor the typical changes during division, but in which on the contrary the nucleus is a very simple homogeneous corpuscle or vesicle of more readily stainable protoplasm.

The difficulties of observation in this matter are great, and it is proportionately rash to generalize; but it appears that we are justified at the present moment in asserting that not all the cells even of higher plants and animals exhibit in full detail the structure and movement of the typical cell-nucleus above figured and described; and accordingly the fact that such structure and movement cannot always be detected in the Protozoon cell-nucleus must not be regarded as either an isolated phenomenon peculiar to such Protozoon cells, nor must it be concluded that we have only to improve our means of analysis and observation in order to detect this particular structure in all nuclei. It seems quite possible and even probable that nuclei may vary in these details and yet be true nuclei. Some nuclei which are observed in Protozoon cell-bodies may be regarded as being at a lower stage of differentiation and specializa tion than are those of the epithelial and embryonic cells of higher animals which exhibit typical karyokinesis. Others on the contrary, such as the nuclei of some Badiolaria (vide infra), are probably to be regarded as more highly developed than any tissue cell-nuclei, and will be found by further study to present special phenomena peculiar to themselves. In some of the highest Protozoa (the Ciliata) it has lately been shown that the nucleus may have no existence as such, but is actually dispersed throughout the protoplasm in the form of fine particles of chromatin-substance which stain on treatment with carmine but are in life invisible (84). This diffuse condition of the nuclear matter has no parallel, at present known, in tissue-cells, and curiously enough occurs in certain genera of Ciliata whilst in others closely allied to them a solid single nucleus is found. The new results of histological research have necessitated a careful study of the nucleus in its various stages of growth and division in the cellbodies of Protozoa and a comparison of the features there observed with those established as “typical” in tissue-cells. Accordingly we have placed the figure and explanation of the typical cell-nucleus in the first place in this article for subsequent reference and comparison.

Cortical Substance. —The superficial protoplasm of an embryonic cell of an Enterozoon in the course of its development into a muscular cell undergoes a change which is paralleled in many Protozoa. The cortical layer becomes dense and highly refringent as compared with the more liquid and granular medullary substance. Probably this is essentially a change in the degree of hydration of the protoplasm itself, although it may be accompanied by the deposition of metamorphic products of the protoplasm which are not chemically to be regarded as protoplasm. The differentiation of this cortical substance (which is not a frequent or striking phenomenon in tissue-cells) may be regarded as an ectoplastic (i.e., peripheral) modification of the protoplasm, comparable to the entoplastic (central) modification which produces a nucleus.

The formation of “cortical substance” in the Protozoa furnishes the basis for the most important division into lower and higher forms, in this assemblage of simplest animals. A large number (the Gymnomyxa) form no cortical substance; their protoplasm is practically (excepting the nucleus) of the same character throughout. A nearly equally large number (the Corticata) develop a complete cortical layer of denser protoplasm, which is distinct from the deeper medullary protoplasm. This layer is permanent, and gives to the body a definite shape and entails physiological consequences of great moment. The cortical protoplasm may exhibit further specialization of structure in connexion with contractile functions (muscular).

Ectoplastic Products chemically distinct from Protoplasm. —The protoplasm of all cells may throw down as a molecular precipitate distinct from itself chemical compounds, such as chitin and horny matter and other nitrogenized bodies, or again non-nitrogenous compounds, such as cellulose. Very usually these substances are deposited not external to but in the superficial protoplasm[9:19:834]. They are then spoken of as cell-cuticle if the cell bounds the free surface of a tissue, or as matrix or cell-wall in other cases. The Protozoon cell-body frequently forms such “cuticles,” sometimes of the most delicate and evanescent character (as in some Amoebae), at other times thicker and more permanent. They may give indications (though proper chemical examination is difficult) of being allied in composition to chitin or gelatin, in other instances to cellulose, which is rare in animals and usual in plants. These cuticular deposits may be absent, or may form thin envelopes or in other cases jelly-like substance intimately mixed with the protoplasm (Radiolaria). They may take the form of hooks, tubercles, or long spines, in their older and more peripheral parts free from permeation by protoplasm, though deeply formed in and interpenetrated by it. Such pellicles and cuticles, the deeper layers (if not the whole) of which are permeated by protoplasm, lead insensibly to another category of ectoplastic products in which the material produced by the protoplasm is separated from it and can be detached from or deserted by the protoplasm without any rupture of the latter. These are—

Shells and Cysts. — Such separable investments are formed by the cell-bodies of many Protozoa, a phenomenon not exhibited by tissue-cells. Even the cell-walls of the protoplasmic corpuscles of plant tissues are permeated by that protoplasm, and could not be stripped off without rupture of the protoplasm. The shell and the cyst of the Protozoon are, on the contrary, quite free from the cellprotoplasm. The shell may be of soft chitin-like substance (Gromia, &c.), of cellulose (Labyrinthala, Dinoflagellata), of calcium carbonate (Globigerina, &c.), or of silica (Clathrulina, Codonella). The term “cyst” is applied to completely closed investments (“shells” having one or more apertures), which are temporarily produced either -as a protection against adverse external conditions or daring the breaking up of the parent-cell into spores. Such cysts are usually horny.

Stalks.— By a localization of the products of ectoplastic activity the Protozoon cell can produce a fibre or stalk of ever-increasing length, comparable to the seta of a Chaetopod worm produced on the surface of a single cell.

Entoplastic Products distinct from Protoplasm.— Without pausing here to discuss the nature of the finest granules which are embedded as a dust-cloud in the hyaline matrix of the purest protoplasm alike of Protozoa and of the cells of higher animals and plants, and leaving aside the discussion of the generalization that all protoplasm presents a reticular structure, denser trabeculae of extreme minuteness traversing more liquid material, it is intended here merely to point to some of the coarser features of structure and chemical differentiation, characteristic of the cell-body of Protozoa.

With regard to the ultimate reticular structure of protoplasm it will suffice to state that such structure has been shown to obtain in not a few instances (e.g., Lith-amoeba, Fig. V.), whilst in most Protozoa the methods of microscopy at present applied have not yielded evidence of it, although it is not improbable that a recticular differentiation of the general protoplasm similar to that of the nucleus may be found to exist in all cells.

Most vegetable cells and many cells of animal tissues exhibit vacuolation of the protoplasm ; i.e., large spaces are present in the protoplasm occupied by a liquid which is not protoplasm and is little more than water with diffusible salts in solution. Such vacuoles are common in Protozoa. They are either permanent, gastric, or contractile.

Permanent vacuoles containing a watery fluid are sometimes so abundant as to give the protoplasm a 11 bubbly” structure (Thalamophora, Radiolaria, <fcc.), or may merely give to it a trabecular character (Trachelius, Fig. XXIV. 14, and Noctiluca, Fig. XXVI. 18). Such vacuoles may contain other matters than water, namely, special chemical secretions of the protoplasm. Of this nature are oil-drops, and from these we are led to those deposits within the cell-protoplasm which are of solid consistence (see below).

Gastric vacuoles occur in the protoplasm of most Protozoa in consequence of the taking in of a certain quantity of water with each solid particle of food, such ingestion of solid food-particles being a characteristic process bound up with their animal nature.

Contractile vacuoles are frequently but not universally observed in the protoplasm of Protozoa. They are not observed in the protoplasm of tissue-cells. The contractile vacuole whilst under observation may be seen to burst, breaking the surface of the Protozoon and discharging its liquid contents to the exterior ∙ l its walls, formed of undifferentiated protoplasm, then collapse and fuse. After a short interval it re-forms by slow accumulation of liquid at the same or a neighbouring spot in the protoplasm. The liquid is separated at this point by an active process taking place in the protoplasm which probably is of an excretory nature, the separated water carrying with it nitrogenous waste-products. A similar active formation of vacuoles containing fluid is observed in a few instances (Arcella, some Amoebae) where the protoplasm separates a gas instead of liquid, and the gas vacuole so produced appears to serve a hydrostatic function.

Corpuscular and Amorphous Entoplastic Solids.— Concretions of undetermined nature are occasionally formed within the protoplasm of Protozoon cells, as are starch and nitrogenized concretions in tissue-cells (Lithamoeba, Fig. V. conc.). But the most important corpuscular products after the nucleus, which we have already discussed, are chlorophyll corpuscles. These are (as in plants) concavo-convex or spherical corpuscles of dense protoplasm resembling that of the nucleus, which are impregnated superficially with the green-coloured substance known as chlorophyll. They multiply by fission, usually tetraschistic, independently of the general protoplasm. They occur in representatives of many different groups of Protozoa (Proteomyxa, Heliozoa, Labyrinthulidea, Flagellata, Ciliata), but are confined to a few species. Similar corpuscles or band-like structures coloured by other pigments are occasionally met with (Dinoflagellata).

Recently it has been maintained (Brandt, 5) that the chlorophyll corpuscles of Protozoa and other animals are parasitic Algae. But, though it is true that parasitic Algae occur in animal tissues, and that probably this is the nature of the yellow cells of Radiolaria, yet there seems to be no more justification for regarding the chlorophyll corpuscles of animal tissue-cells and of Protozoa as parasites than there is for so regarding the chlorophyll corpuscles of the leaves of an ordinary green plant.

Corpuscles of starch, paramylum, and other amyloid substances are commonly formed in the Flagellata, whose nutrition is to a large extent plant-like.

Entoplastic Fibres.— A fibrillation of the protoplasm of the Protozoon cell-body may be produced by differentia tion of less and more dense tracts of the protoplasm itself. But as distinct from this we find horny fibres occasionally produced within the protoplasm (Heliozoa) having definite skeletal functions. The threads produced in little cavities in the superficial protoplasm of many Ciliate Protozoa, known as trichocysts, may be mentioned here.

Entoplastic Spicules. — Needle-like bodies consisting either of silica or of a horny substance (acanthin) are produced in the protoplasm of many Protozoa (Heliozoa, Radiolaria). These are known as spicules; they may be free or held together in groups and arranged either radially or tangentially in reference to the more or less spherical [9:19:835]

body of the Protozoon. A similar production of siliceous spicules is observed in the tissue-cells of Sponges. Crystals of various chemical nature (silica, calcium carbonate, oxalate, &c.) are also frequently deposited in the protoplasm of the Protozoa, differing essentially from spicules in that their shape is due purely to crystallization.

General Form of the Protozoon Cell. —Those Protozoa which have not a differentiated cortical substance, and are known as Gymnomyxa, present very generally an extreme irregularity of contour. Their protoplasm, being liquid rather than viscous, flows into the most irregular shapes. Their fundamental form when at rest is in many cases that of the sphere; others are discoidal or may be monaxial, that is to say, show a differentiation of one region or “end” of the body from the other. Frequently the protoplasm is drawn out into long threads or filaments which radiate uniformly from all parts of the spherical or discoidal cell-body or originate from one region to the exclusion of other parts of the surface.

These non-corticate Protozoa can take solid particles of food into their protoplasm, there to be digested in an extemporized “gastric vacuole,” at any part or most parts of their superficies. They have no permanent cell-mouth leading into the soft protoplasm since that soft protoplasm is everywhere freely exposed.

The corticate Protozoa have (with the exception of some parasites) one, and in the Acinetaria more than one, definite aperture in the cortical substance leading into the softer medullary protoplasm. This is the cell-mouth,— morphologically as distinct from the mouth of an Enterozoon as is the hole in a drain pipe from the front door of a house, but physiologically subserving the same distinctively animal function as does the mouth of multicellular animals. The general form of the body is in these Protozoa oblong, with either monaxial symmetry, when the mouth is terminal, or bilateral symmetry, when the body is oblong and flattened and the mouth is towards one end of what becomes by its presence the “ventral” surface. Though the protoplasm is not nakedly exposed in irregular lobes and long filaments in these corticate Protozoa so as to pick up at all points such food-particles as may fall in its way, yet the protoplasm does in most Corticata project in one or more peculiarly modified fine hair-like processes from the otherwise smooth surface of the cell-body. These processes are vibratile cilia, identical in character with the vibratile cilia of epithelial tissue-cells of Enterozoa. They are essentially locomotor and current-producing (therefore prehensile) organs, and, whilst unable to ingest solid food-particles themselves, serve to propel the organism in search of food and to bring food into the cellmouth by the currents which they excite. Either a single vibratile filament is present, when it is called a flagellum, or a row or many rows of cilia are developed.

Constituent cells of the Enterozoa are well known which closely resemble some of the Gymnomyxa or non-corticate Protozoa in their general form. These are the colourless blood corpuscles or lymph corpuscles or phagocytes (Mecz-nikow, 6) which float freely in the blood and ingest solid particles at any part of their surface as do non-corticated Protozoa; they exhibit a similar irregularity and mutability of outline, and actually digest the particles which they take in. The endodermal digestive cells of some Enterozoa (Coelentera and Planarians) are also naked protoplasmic corpuscles and can take in solid food-particles.

No tissue-cells are known which present any close parallel to the mouth-bearing corticate Protozoa. The differentiation of the structure of a single cell has in these forms reached a very high degree, which it is not surprising to find without parallel among the units which build up the individual of a higher order known as an Enterozoon. Cilia are developed on such cell units (ciliated epithelium), but not used for the introduction of foodparticles into the cell. In rare cases (the ciliated “pots” of the vascular fluid of Sipunculus) they act so as to freely propel the ciliated cell through the liquid “blood” of the Enterozoon, as the cilia of a Protozoon propel it through water. An aperture in the cortical substance (or in the cuticular product) of a tissue-cell is sometimes to be observed, but is never (?) used for the ingestion of focd-particles. Such an aperture occurs in unicellular glands, where it serves as the outlet of the secretion.

Physiology. Motion.— As has just been hinted, the movement of protoplasm, which in the tissue-cells of Enterozoa and higher plants is combined and directed so as to produce effects in relation to the whole organism built up of countless cells, is seen in the Protozoa in a different relation, namely, as subserving the needs of the individual cell of which the moving protoplasm is the main substance. The phenomena known in tissue-cells as “streaming” {e.g., in the cells of the hairs of Tradescantia), as local contraction and change of form (e;·., in the corpuscles of the cornea), as muscular contraction, and as ciliary movement are all exhibited by the protoplasm of the cell-body of Protozoa, with more or less constancy, and are intimately related to the processes of hunting, seizing, and ingesting food, and of the intercourse of the individuals of a species with one another and their evasion of hostile agencies. Granule streaming and the implied movement of currents in the protoplasm are seen in the filamentous protoplasm of the Heliozoa, Radiolaria, Reticularia, and Noctiluca, and in the cyclosis of the gastric vacuoles of Ciliata. Local contraction and change of form is seen best in the Amoebae and some Flagellata, where it results in locomotion. Definite muscular contraction is exhibited by the protoplasmic band in the stalk of Vorticella, by the leg-like processes of the Hypotrichous Ciliata, and by the cortical substance of some large Ciliata. Ciliary movement ranging from the vibration of filaments of protoplasm temporarily evolved, up to the rhythmic beat of groups of specialized cilia, is observed in all groups of Protozoa in the young condition if not in the adult, and special varieties of ciliary movement and of cilia-like organs will be noted below. For an account of the conditions and character of protoplasmic movement generally which cannot be discussed in the present article the reader is referred to Engelmann (7).

The protoplasm of the cell-body of the Protozoa is drawn out into lobes and threads which are motile and are used as locomotive and prehensile organs. These processes are of two kinds, which are not present on the same cell and are not capable of transmutation, though there are exceptions to both of these statements. The one kind are termed “pseudopodia,” and are either lobose or filamentous or branched and even reticular (Figs. IV. and IX. ). The Protozoa which exhibit them are sometimes termed Myxopods. The other kind are cilia and flagella, and are simple threads which are alternately bent and straightened almost incessantly during the life of the organism. These Protozoa are termed Mastigopods. Whilst the cilia and flagella are permanent organs, the pseudopodia vary greatly in character; they are in some cases rapidly expanded and withdrawn in irregular form, and can hardly be said to be more than lobose protuberances of the flowing moving mass of protoplasm. In other cases they are comparatively permanent stiff threads of protoplasm which can be contracted and can fuse with one another but rarely do so (Heliozoa, Radiolaria). Between these extreme forms of “pseudopodia” there are numerous intermediate varieties, and the [9:19:836] whole protoplasmic body of the Protozoon may even assume the form of a slowly changing network of threads of greater or less tenuity (Chlamydomyxa, Fig. VI. ).

Nutrition.— Typically—that is to say, by determinate hereditary tendency—the Protozoa take solid food-particles into their protoplasm which form and occupy with the water surrounding them “gastric vacuoles” in the protoplasm. The food-particle is digested in this vacuole, by what chemical processes is not ascertained. It has been shown that the contents of the gastric vacuole give in some cases an acid reaction, and it is not improbable that free acid is secreted by the surrounding protoplasm. It is not known whether any ferment^[2. The digestive ferment pepsin has been detected by Krukenberg in the plasmodium of the Mycetozoon Fuligo (flowers of tan). See on this subject Zopf (18), p. 88. ] is separated by the protoplasm, but it is probable from observations made on the digestive process of Coelentera (Actiniae) that the ferment is not separated, but that actual contact of the food-particle with the protoplasm is necessary for a “ferment influence” to be exerted. The digestion of a food-particle by a Protozoon is intra-cellular, and has been contrasted with the cavitary digestion of higher animals. In the latter, ferments and acids are poured out by the cells bounding the enteric cavity into that space, and digestion is extra-cellular. In the lowest Enterozoa (many Coelentera and some Planarian worms) it has been shown that food-particles are actually taken up in a solid state by the soft protoplasm of the enteric cells and thus subjected to intra-cellular digestion. There appears to be a gradual transition from this process, in which close contact with living protoplasm is necessary that the solution of an albuminous food-particle may be effected, onwards to the perfectly free cavitary digestion by means of secretions accumulated in the enteron.

We have not yet any satisfactory observations on the chemistry of intra-cellular digestion either of Protozoa or of Coelentera.

Certain Protozoa which are parasitic do not take solid food particles; they (like higher parasites, such as the Tapeworms) live in the nutritious juices of other animals and absorb these by their general surface in a liquid state. The Gregarinae (Sporozoa), many Ciliata, &c., are in this case. Other Protozoa are known which are provided with chlorophyll corpuscles and do not take in solid food, but, apparently as a result of exceptional adaptation in which they differ from closely-allied forms, nourish themselves as do green plants. Such are the Volvocinean Flagellata and some of the Dinoflagellata. It has also been asserted that other Protozoa (viz., some Ciliata)—even some which possess a well-developed mouth—can (and experimentally have been made to) nourish themselves on nitrogenous compounds of a lower grade than albumens—such, for instance, as ammonium tartrate. Any such assertions must be viewed with the keenest scepticism, since experimental demonstration of the absence of minute albuminous particles (e.g. i Bacteria) from a solution of ammonium tartrate in which Ciliate Protozoa are flourishing is a matter of extreme difficulty and has not yet been effected.

Undigested food-remnants are expelled by the protoplasm of the Protozoon cell either at any point of the surface or by the cell-mouth or by a special cell-anus (some Ciliata, see Fig. XXIV. 22).

Respiration and Excretion.— The protoplasm of the Protozoa respires, that is, takes up oxygen and liberates carbonic acid, and can readily be shown experimentally to require a supply of oxygen for the manifestation of its activity. No special respiratory structures are developed in any Protozoa, and as a rule also the products of oxidation appear to be washed out and removed from the protoplasm without the existence of any special apparatus.

The contractile vacuole which exists in so many Protozoa appears, however, to be an excretory organ. It has been shown to rapidly excrete in a state of solution colouring matters (anilin blue) which have been administered with food particles (8). No evidence has been adduced to show whether traces of nitrogenous waste-products are present in the water expelled by the contractile vacuole.

Chemical Metamorphosis.— The form which the various products of the activity of the Protozoon’s protoplasm may assume has been noted above. It will be sufficient here to point out that the range of chemical capacities is quite as great as in the cells of the higher Enterozoa. Chitin, cellulose, silicon, calcium carbonate, fats, pigments, and gases can be both deposited and absorbed by it. Owing to the minuteness of the Protozoa, we are at present unable to recognize and do justice to the variety of chemical bodies which undoubtedly must play a part in their economy as the result of the manufacturing activity of their protoplasm. See, however, Zopf (13), p. 71.

Growth and Reproduction.— The Protozoon cell follows the same course as tissue-cells, in that by assimilation of nutriment its protoplasm increases in volume and reaches a certain bulk, when its cohesion fails and the viscid droplet divides into two. The coefficient of cohesion varies in different genera and species, but sooner or later the disrupting forces lead to division, and thus to multiplication of individuals or reproduction. The phenomena connected with the division of the nucleus (already alluded to) will be noticed in particular cases below.

Whilst simple binary division is almost without exception a chief method of reproduction among the Protozoa, it is also very usual, and probably this would be found if our knowledge were complete to have few exceptions, that under given conditions the Protozoon breaks up rapidly into many (from ten to a hundred or more) little pieces, each of which leads an independent life and grows to the form and size of its parent. It will then multiply by binary division, some of the products of which division will in their turn divide into small fragments. The small fragments are called “spores.” Usually the Protozoon before breaking up into spores forms a “cyst” (see above) around itself. Frequently, but not as a necessary rule, two (rarely three or more) Protozoon cell-individuals come together and fuse into one mass before breaking up into spores. This process is known as “conjugation;” and there can be no doubt that the physiological significance of the process is similar to that of sexual fertilization, namely, that the new spores are not merely fragments of an old individual but are something totally new inasmuch as they consist of a combination of the substance of individuals who have had different life experiences.

Whilst spore-formation is not necessarily preceded by conjugation, conjugation is not necessarily followed by spore-formation. Among the Mycetozoa the young individuals produced from spores conjugate at a very early period of growth in numbers and form “plasmodia,” and after a considerable interval of feeding and growth the formation of spores takes place. Still more remarkable is the fact observed among the Ciliata where two individuals conjugate and after a brief fusion and mixture of their respective protoplasm separate, neither individual (as far as certain genera at least are concerned) breaking up into spores, but simply resuming the process of growth and recurrent binary division with increased vigour.

There is certainly no marked line to be drawn between reproduction by simple fission and reproduction by sporeformation; both are a more or less complete dividing of the parent protoplasm into separate masses; whether the products of the first fissiou are allowed to nourish themselves and grow before further fission is carried out or not [9:19:837]

does not constitute an essential difference. The fission of the Ciliate Protozoon, Opalina (see below Fig. XXIV. 4-8), is a step from the ordinary process of delayed binary division towards spore-formation. In some Protozoa spores are produced after encystation by a perfectly regular process of cleavage (comparable to the cleavage of the egg-cell of Enterozoa)—first two, then four, then eight, sixteen, and thirty-two fission products being the result (see Fig. XX. 24, 25, &c.).

But more usually there is a hastening of the process, and in these cases it is by no means clear what part the parent cell-nucleus takes. An encysted Gregarina (or two conjugated Gregarinae) suddenly breaks up into a number of equal-sized spores, which do not increase in number by binary division and have not been formed by any such process. This multicentral segregation of the parent protoplasm is a marked development of the phenomenon of sporulation and remote from ordinary cell-division. How it is related to ordinary cell-division is not known, inasmuch as the changes undergone by the nucleus in this rapid multicentral segregation of the parent protoplasm have not been determined. The spores of Protozoa may be naked or encased singly or in groups in little envelopes, usually of a firm horny substance (see Fig. XX. 23 to 26, and Fig. XXIV. 15 to 18). Whenever the whole or a part of a Protozoon cell divides rapidly into a number of equal-sized pieces which are simultaneously set free and are destined to reproduce the adult form, the term spore is applied to such pieces, but the details of their formation may vary and also those of their subsequent history. In typical cases each spore produced as the result of the fission of an encysted Protozoon (conjugated or single) has its own protective envelope, as in the Mycetozoa (Fig. III.) and the Sporozoa (Fig. XVIII.), from which the contained protoplasm escapes by “germination ” as a naked corpuscle either flagellate or amoebiform. In some terminologies the word “spore” is limited to such a “coated” spore, but usually the naked protoplasmic particles which issue from such “coated” spores, or are formed directly by the rapid fission of the parent Protozoon, are also called “spores.” The former condition is distinguished as a “chlamydospore,” whilst the latter are termed “gymnospores.” Many Protozoa produce gymnospores directly by the breaking up of their protoplasm, and these are either “flagellulae” (swarm-spores) or “amoebulae” (creeping spores). The production of coated spores is more usual among the lower plants than it is among Protozoa, but is nevertheless a characteristic feature of the Gregarinae (Sporozoa) and of the Mycetozoa. The term “gemma” or “bud-spore” is applied to cases, few in number, where (as in Acinetaria, Fig. XXVI., Spiro-chona, Fig. XXIII. 10, and Reticularia, Fig. X. 8) the spores are gradually nipped off from the parent-cell one or more at a time. This process differs from ordinary cell-division only in the facts (1) that the products of division are of unequal size—the parent-cell being distinguishable as the larger and more complete in structure, and (2) that usually the division is not binary, but more than one bud-spore is produced at a time.

Whilst in the binary cell-division of the Protozoa the two products are usually complete in structure at the period of separation, spores and spore buds are not only of small size and therefore subject to growth before attaining the likeness of the parent, but they are also very often of simple and incomplete structure. The gap in this respect between the young spore and its parent necessarily varies according to the complexity of the parental form.

In the case of the Radiolaria, of the Gregarinae, of Noctiluca, and of the Acinetaria, for instance, the spore has before it a considerable process of development in structure and not merely of growth, before attaining the adult characters. Hence there is a possible embryology of the Protozoa, to the study of which the same principles are applicable as are recognized in the study of the embryology of Enterozoa. Embryonic forms of great simplicity of structure, often devoid of nucleus, and consisting of simple elongate particles of protoplasm, are hatched from the spore-cases of the Gregarinae (Fig. XVII. 13,14) These gradually acquire a differentiated cortical protoplasm and a nucleus. A very large number of Gymnomyxa produce spores which are termed “monad if orm,” that is, have a single or sometimes two filaments of vibratile protoplasm extended from their otherwise structureless bodies. By the lashing of these flagella the spores (swarm-spores or zoospores) are propelled through the water. The resemblance of these monadiform young (best called “flagel∙ lulae ”) to the adult forms known as Flagellata has led to the suggestion that we have in them a case of recapitular tive development, and that the ancestors of the Gymnomyxa were Protozoa similar to the Flagellata. Again the Acinetaria produce spores which are uniformly clothed with numerous vibratile cilia (Fig. XXVL), although the adults are entirely devoid of such structures; this is accounted for by the supposition that the Acinetaria have been developed from ancestors like the Ciliata, whose characters are thus perpetuated in their embryonic stages. There can be little doubt that these embryological suggestions are on the whole justified, and that the nucleated Protozoa are the descendants of non-nucleated forms similar to the spores of Gymnomyxa and Sporozoa, whilst it seems also extremely probable that the ancestral Protozoa were neither exclusively amoeboid in the movement of their protoplasm nor provided with permanent vibratile filaments (flagella and cilia); they were neither Myxopods nor Mastigopods (to use the terms which have been introduced to express this difference in the character of the locomotor processes), but the same individuals were capable of throwing out their protoplasm sometimes in the form of flowing lobes and networks, sometimes in the form of vibratile flagella. A few such undifferentiated forms exist at the present day among the Proteomyxa and in a little more advanced condition among the lowest Flagellata, e.g., Ciliophrys.

Death.— It results from the constitution of the Protozoon body as a single cell and its method of multiplication by fission that death has no place as a natural recurrent phenomenon among these organisms. Among the Enterozoa certain cells are separated from the rest of the constituent units of the body as egg-cells and sperm-cells; these conjugate and continue to live, whilst the remaining cells, the mere carriers as it were of the immortal reproductive cells, die and disintegrate. There being no carrying cells which surround, feed, and nurse the reproductive cells of Protozoa, but the reproductive cell being itself and alone the individual Protozoon, there is nothing to die, nothing to be cast off by the reproductive cell when entering on a new career of fission. The bodies of the higher animals which die may from this point of view be regarded as something temporary and non-essential, destined merely to carry for a time, to nurse, and to nourish the more important and deathless fission-products of the unicellular egg. Some of these fission-products of the new individual developed from an egg-cell—namely, the egg-cells and spermcells—are as immortal as the unicellular Protozoon. This method of comparing the unicellular and the multicellular organism is exceedingly suggestive, and the conception we thus gain of the individuality of the Enterozoon throws light upon the phenomena of reproduction and heredity in those higher organisms.

Experiment and observation in this matter are extremely [9:19:838] difficult; but we have no reason to suppose that there is any inherent limit to the process of nutrition, growth, and fission, by which continuously the Protozoa are propagated. The act of conjugation from time to time confers upon the protoplasm of a given line of descent new properties, and apparently new vigour. Where it is not followed by a breaking up of the conjugated cells into spores, but by separation and renewed binary fission (Ciliata), the result is described simply as “rejuvenescence.” The protoplasm originated by the successive division of substance traceable to one parent cell has become specialized, and in fact too closely adapted to one series of life-conditions; a fusion of substance with another mass of protoplasm equally specialized, but by experience of a somewhat differing character, imparts to the resulting mixture a new combination of properties, and the conjugated individuals on separation start once more on their deathless career with renewed youth.

CLASSIFICATION OF THE PROTOZOA.

In attempting a scheme of classification it would be most in accordance with the accepted probabilities of the ancestral history of the Protozoa to separate altogether those forms devoid of a nucleus from those which possess one, and to regard them as a lower “grade” of evolution or differentiation of structure.

By some systematists, notably Bütschli (9), the presence or absence of a nucleus has not been admitted as a basis of classificatory distinction, whilst on the other hand both Haeckel (1) and Huxley (10) have insisted on its importance.

The fact is that during recent years many of those Protozoa which were at one time supposed to be devoid of nucleus even in a rudimentary form, and furnished therefore the tangible basis for a lowest group of “Protozoa Homogenea” or “Monera,” have been shown by the application of improved methods of microscopic investigation to possess a nucleus, that is to say, a differentiated corpuscle of denser protoplasm lying within the general protoplasm, and capable when the organism is killed by alcohol or weak acids of taking up the colour of various dyes (such as carmine and haematoxylin) more readily and permanently than is the general protoplasm. In such cases the nucleus may be very small and exhibit none of the typical structure of larger nuclei. It is usually surrounded by a clear (i.e., non-granular) halo of the general protoplasm which assists the observer in its detection. Nuclei have been discovered in many Reticularia (Foraminifera), a group in which they were supposed to be wanting, by Schultze (11) and the Hertwigs (12) and more recently in the Mycetozoa and in Vampyrella and Protomonas (Zopf, 13), where so excellent an observer as Cienkowski had missed them.

It seems therefore not improbable that a nucleus is present though not observed in Protomyxa, Myxastrum, and other similar forms which have been by Haeckel and others classed as “Monera” or “Homogenea.” The recently described (14) Archerina (Fig. II. 8, 11) certainly possesses no nucleus in the usual sense of that term, but it is possible that the chlorophyll-coloured corpuscles of that organism should be considered as actually representing the nucleus. Whilst then refraining from asserting that there are no existing Protozoa devoid of nucleus corresponding in this character with non nucleate Protophyta, such as the Bacteria, we shall not in our scheme of classification institute a group of Homogenea, but shall leave the taking of that step until it has been shown after critical examination that those forms now regarded by some observers as Homogenea are really so. In the meantime these forms will find their places alongside of the Nucleata most nearly allied to them in other characters.

The Protozoa with a definite permanent cortical substance of differentiated protoplasm are undoubtedly to be regarded as evolved from forms devoid of such differentiation of their substance, and we accordingly take this feature as the indication of a primary division of the Protozoa.^[3. The “exoplasm” and “endoplasm” described in Amoebae, &c., by some authors are not distinct layers but one and the same continuous substance—what was internal at one moment becoming external at another, no really structural difference existing between them. ] The lower grade, the Gymnomyxa, afford in other respects evidence of their being nearly related to the ancestral forms from which the Corticata (the higher grade) have developed. The Gymnomyxa all or nearly all, whilst exhibiting amoeboid movement and the flowing of their protoplasm in ρ “pseudopodia” of very varied shapes, produce spores which swim by means of one or two flagella of vibratile protoplasm (monadiform young or flagellulae). These flagellate young forms are closely related to the Flagellata, a group of the Corticata from which it seems probable that the Dinoflagellata, the Ciliata, and the Acinetaria have been derived. The Gymnomyxa themselves cannot, on account of the small number of structural features which they offer as indications of affinity and divergence in genetic relationships inter se, be classified with anything like confidence in a genealogical system. We are obliged frankly to abandon the attempt to associate some of the simpler forms with their nearest genetic allies and to content ourselves with a more or less artificial system, which is not, however, artificial in so far as its main groups are concerned. Thus the genetic solidarity of each of the large classes Heliozoa, Reticularia, Mycetozoa, and Radiolaria is not open to question. The Lobσsa on the other hand appear to be a more artificial assemblage, and it is difficult to say that genetically there is any wide separation between them and the Mycetozoa or between the Mycetozoa and some of the simpler forms λvhich we bring together under the class Proteomyxa.

The scheme of classification which we adopt is the following :—
