PROSPER of Aquitaine(Aquitanus, or Aquitanicus), a Christian prose and verse writer of the first half of the 5th century. Of his personal history almost nothing is known; his surname seems to imply that he was a native of Aquitania, and there are various indications that he was educated as a “rhetorician.” While still comparatively young he gave himself to a religious and ascetic life, and at Marseilles soon made himself prominent as a champion of orthodoxy in the controversy with the Massilians or SemiPelagians. In this connexion he opened a correspondence with Augustine, along with his friend Hilarius (c. 429 A.D.), and about the same time (c. 430) he composed an hexameter poem of upwards of one thousand lines, Adversus Ingratos, a glowing polemic against the Pelagians. After Augustine’s death he wrote Pro Augustino Responsiones, and about 431 he visited Rome, still in the interests of Augustinianism, eliciting from Pope Celestine his Epistola ad Episcopos Gallorum against Cassianus. There are some indications that the latter years of his life [9:19:825]

were spent in Rome, and that he wrote his Chronicon there. The year of his death is unknown; the chronicle is brought down to 455.

Prosper’s enthusiastic admiration for Augustine (to whom, however, he was not personally known) led him to make an abridgment of that author’s commentary on the Psalms, as well as a collection of sentences for his works,—probably the first dogmatic compilation of the class in which the Liber Sententiarum is the best known example. Some of Augustine’s theological dicta he also put into elegiac metre (one hundred and six epigrams). Prosper’s Chronicon is of value from the year 29 A.D. onwards, some of the sources which he used for that period being no longer extant. The best edition of the Opera is the Benedictine by Le Brun and Mangeant (Paris, 1711), reprinted in Migne’s collection.
