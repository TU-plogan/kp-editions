PLATON, Levshin (1737-1812), a celebrated Russian archbishop, was born at the village of Tchashnikovo, near Moscow, in 1737, and was educated in the academy of that city. On completing his studies there in 1758 he was appointed teacher of rhetoric in the school connected with the monastery of St Sergius, and about this time entered the priesthood. In 1763 Catherine invited him to instruct her son Paul in theology, and he became one of the court chaplains. Three years afterwards Platon was appointed archimandrite of the monastery of the Trinity (Troitzkaia Lavra) near Moscow; in 1770 he was made archbishop of Tver, and finally in 1787 archbishop of Moscow and metropolitan. He died in 1812. Platon was a brilliant and learned man, not only in the opinion of his countrymen, but in the estimation of all foreigners who made his acquaintance. We get a graphic and interesting picture of him at the beginning of the present century in the travels of Edward Clarke of Cambridge, who was much struck with his wit and wide range of reading. As a preacher he enjoyed great celebrity, one of the most remarkable specimens of his eloquence being the sermon preached at the coronation of Alexander I. He was also the author of several works which enjoyed considerable reputation in their time, such as A Short Course of Divinity, compiled for the use of the emperor Paul when grandduke, several Catechisms, A Short History of the Russian Church, which has been translated into English, and other works. Platon is altogether a striking and important figure in a very -eventful period of his countryâ€™s history.
