PÖLLNITZ, Karl Ludwig, Freiherr von (1692- 1775), known as a writer of memoirs, was born on the 25th February 1692. His father, G. Bernhard von Pöllnitz, was a major-general and minister of state in the electorate of Brandenburg. Pöllnitz was a man of restless and adventurous disposition, and after squandering his fortune travelled from court to court, his pleasant manners generally securing for him a kind reception. He was made reader to Frederick the Great, and afterwards the director of a theatre; but before accepting these appointments he had served as a soldier in Austria, the States of the Church, and Spain. He was repeatedly converted to Catholicism and re-converted to the Reformed faith; but he died a Catholic on the 23rd June 1775.

The most famous work attributed to him is La Saxe galante, which contains an account of the private life of Augustus of Saxony; but it has been doubted whether he was the author of this book. His contemporaries expressed much admiration for the lively style of his Lettres et mémoires, avec nouveaux mémoires de sa vie et la relation de ses premiers voyages, and general interest was excited by his État abrégé de la cour de Saxe sous le règne d'Auguste 111., roi de Pologne. He was probably the author of the Histoire secrète de la duchesse d'Hanovre, épouse de George I., roi de la Grande-Bretagne. After his death Brunn issued Mémoires de Pöllnitz pour servir à l'histoire des quatre derniers souverains de la maison de Brandebourg, royale de Prusse.
