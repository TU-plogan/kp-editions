PORTSMOUTH, a city and port of entry of the United States, one of the two shire-towns of Rockingham county, New Hampshire, and alternately with Concord the seat of the sessions of the United States courts for the district of New Hampshire, lies on a peninsula on the right bank of the Piscataqua, 3 miles from its mouth, in 43° 4' N. lat. and 70° 45' W. long. By rail it is 57 miles northnorth-east of Boston. Quiet and old-fashioned beyond most of the New England cities, with shaded streets and many quaint antique houses, survivals from colonial times, Portsmouth is a favourite summer resort. Notwithstanding the excellence of its harbour—which is from 35 to 75 feet deep, safe, free from ice at all seasons, and capable of containing 2000 vessels—it has very little foreign trade. There are cotton-mills (Kearsarge), breweries, boot and shoe factories, and some other industrial establishments in the city; and shipbuilding, which is the principal industry, has long been extensively prosecuted. The United States navy yard, though situated on Continental or Navy Island, on the north side of the river, in the township of Kittery (Maine), is generally known as Portsmouth yard. It contains a fine balance dry dock, 350 feet by 105. Among the more conspicuous buildings in Portsmouth are the old church of St John, the athenaeum (15,000 volumes), and the custom-house. There is a public library of 8000 volumes. At Little Harbour, 2 miles distant, is Governor Wentworth’s mansion, dating from 1750. The entrance to the harbour is defended by earthworks at Jaffrey’s Point and Gerrish’s Island. The population was 9738 in 1850, 9211 in 1870, and 9690 in 1880.

Settled in 1623 under the Laconia Company, Strawberry Bank (as it was first called) was named Portsmouth in 1653, and incorporated as a city in 1849. It was the capital of the colony and State of New Hampshire till 1807, when that rank was bestowed on Concord. The “Ranger,” afterwards commanded by Paul Jones, and the first ship to carry the stars and stripes, was built at Portsmouth for the American Congress in 1777. The New Hampshire Gazette, started at Portsmouth in 1756, is the oldest of all the existing newspapers of the United States, and the Portsmouth Journal, established in 1793, is also still published. T. B. Aldrich, J. T. Fields, Eliza B. Lee, and B. P. Shillaber (“Mrs Partington ”) are natives of the city.
