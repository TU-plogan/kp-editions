PEOCK, capital of the above province, is situated on the right bank of the Vistula, 60 miles to the west-northwest of Warsaw. It is well built of stone on a high hill facing the river, and has an ancient cathedral. It is now of importance only as the seat of the provincial administration; and its population, which is partly agricultural, increases very slowly. In May 1883 it had 19,640 inhabitants, of whom 7135 were Jews and about 450 Germans. The Russian garrison numbered 2500. Ptock has two colleges for boyS and girls, with 864 male and 496 female scholars, and twelve primary schools (exclusive of the Jewish heders), with 890 scholars. Its manufactures are insignificant (not above 100,000 roubles yearly), and there is some trade in agricultural produce.
