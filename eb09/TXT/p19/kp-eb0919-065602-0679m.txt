PRAeTORIUS,^[1. German Schultz or Schultze (Schultheiss'), meaning the head-man of a township, Latinized into Praetor or Praetorius. Many other members of the family of Praetorius were eminent as musicians. ]Michael (1571-1621), German musical historian, theorist, and composer, was born at Kreuzberg in Thuringia on 15th February 1571. He acted as kapellmeister at Lüneburg early in life, was engaged first as organist and later as kapellmeister and secretary to the duke of Brunswick, and was eventually rewarded for his long services with the priory of Ringelheim, near Goslar. He died at Wolfenbüttel on 15th February 1621. Of his very numerous compositions copies are now so scarce that it is doubtful whether a complete set is anywhere to be found. The most important are— Polyhymnia (15 vols.), Musae Sioniae (16 vols.), and Musa Aonia (9 vols.), all written partly to Latin and partly to German words. But more precious than all these is the Syntagma musicum (3 vols, and a cahier of plates, 4to, Wittenberg and Wolfenbüttel, 1615-20). Only two copies of this very rare work are believed to exist in England, one in the library of the Rev. Sir F. A. Gore-Ouseley and the other in that of Mr Alfred Littleton. In the original prospectus of the work four volumes were promised, but it is certain that no more than three were ever published. The fourth volume mentioned in Forkel’s catalogue is clearly nothing but the cahier of plates attached to vol. ii.

The chief value of this very remarkable work lies in the information it gives concerning the condition of instrumental music in the early years of the 17th century. The plates include excellent representations of all the musical instruments in use at the time they were published, together with many forms even then treated only as antique curiosities. Many of these instruments are known to us only through these representations and the descriptions with which they are accompanied, the instruments themselves having long fallen into disuse, and no real examples having been preserved to us. Among the most important instruments described and figured are the whole family of flutes, oboes, and bassoons; the different kinds of trombone, many of which exactly resemble those now in use; trumpets and horns of all conceivable varieties; viols, violins, and basses; the entire family of stringed and keyed instruments, including the psaltery, the spinet, the harpsichord, and a curious combination of the harpsichord and viol called the “Nurembergisch Geigenwerck,” known only through this description; and finally the organ, to the historical and technical description of which an entire section is devoted. The work thus throws a light upon the earlier forms of instrumental music which to the historian is invaluable. In fact, without the information bequeathed to us by Praetorius it would be impossible to reconstruct in theory the orchestra of the earlier half of the 17th century, during which the opera and the oratorio both sprang into existence, or even to understand the descriptions left us by other less careful writers.
