PORT HURON, a city and port of entry of the United States, county seat of St Clair county, Michigan, lies 58 miles by rail north-east of Detroit, at the southern extremity of Lake Huron and on the west bank of the St Clair river, which is there joined by the Black river. Port Huron is a point of great importance in the railway system, being the terminus of the Chicago and Grand Trunk and the Port Huron and North-Western Railways (lines to East Saginaw, Sand Beach, Almont, and Port Austin), and connected by ferry to Samia with the Great Western of Canada and the Grand Trunk Railways. It is also the terminus and a stopping-place of several lines of lake steamers. It has a large lumber trade, ship-yards, dry docks, saw-mills, flour-mills, planing-mills. The population was 5973 in 1870, 8883 in 1880, and 10,396 in 1884. Commenced in 1819, Port Huron was incorporated as a village in 1835, and as a city in 1857.
