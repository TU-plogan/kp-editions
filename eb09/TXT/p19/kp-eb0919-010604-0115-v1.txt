PINK. As usually applied this word corresponds to a genus of Caryophyllaceae, the Dianthus of botanists. It is characterized by the presence of opposite simple leaves proceeding from thickened nodes, a cymose inflorescence, a tubular calyx surrounded by a number of overlapping bracts, a showy corolla of five free long-stalked petals, ten stamens proceeding, together with the petals, from a short stalk supporting the ovary, which latter has two styles and ripens into an oblong pod which splits by two valves. The species are herbaceous or perennial, of low stature, often with very showy flowers. They are natives chiefly of southern Europe and the Mediterranean region, a few being found in temperate Asia and South Africa. One species only is native to America, and that only in the northwest. Four species are wild in Britain, with two others which are more or less naturalized. These two are the more interesting as being the originals of the pinks and of the carnations and picotees of English gardens. Garden Pinks are derivatives from Dianthus plumarius, a native of central Europe, with leaves rough at the edges, and with rose-coloured or purplish flowers. The use of “pink” to denote a colour is derived from the name of the plant.

The Carnation and Picotee are modifications of Dianthus Caryophyllus, the Clove Pink, a species with smooth edges to the leaf. This is a native of Europe, growing on rocks in the south, but in the north usually found on old walls. Its occurrence in England on some of the old Norman castles, as at Rochester, is supposed by Canon Ellacombe to indicate its introduction by the Normans; in any case the plant grows in similar situations in Normandy. The original species has “self ’’-coloured flowers, that is, flowers of one hue, generally some shade of pink, but the variations in gardens are infinite. The carnation includes those flowers which are streaked or striped lengthwise—the picotees are those in which the petals have a narrow band of colour along the edge, the remainder of the petal being free from stripes or blotches. These by the old writers were called “gillyflowers” (see vol. x. p. 601). The Sweet William of gardens is a product from Dianthus barbatus ; the Indian Pink comes from D. sinensis, of which D. Heddewigii is a variety; the Alpine Pink, D. alpinus, is a very lovely plant for the rockery; and there are many hybrid and other varieties met with in gardens, for an account of which reference must be made to treatises on horticulture.
