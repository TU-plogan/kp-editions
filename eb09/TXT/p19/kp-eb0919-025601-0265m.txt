POERIO, Carlo (1803-1867), Italian statesman, born in 1803, was descended from an old Calabrian family and was the son of Giuseppe Poerio, a distinguished lawyer of Naples. In 1815 he accompanied his father into political exile, but, a pardon having been obtained in 1818, he returned to Naples where he afterwards adopted the profession of advocate. From 1837 to 1848 he was frequently arrested and imprisoned, but, when Ferdinand, moved by the demonstration of 27th January of the latter year, promulgated a constitution, he was at once raised to honour, being made prefect of police and shortly afterwards minister of public instruction. Discovering, however, that the king was only temporizing, he resigned office in April of the same year and was returned for Naples to parliament, where he led the constitutional opposition. On 19th July 1849 he was arrested, and after trial on the charge of belonging to the sect denominated the “Italian Unity,” was condemned to irons. Chained in pairs, he and other fifteen political prisoners were confined in one small room in the bagno of Nisida near the lazaretto. The eloquent exposure of the horrors of the Neapolitan dungeons by Mr Gladstone in 1851, who emphasized especially the case of Poerio, awakened the universal indignation of Europe, but he did not obtain his liberty till 1858. He and other exiles were then placed on board a ship bound for the United States, but they compelled the crew to land them at Cork, whence Poerio made his way to London. In the following year he returned to Italy, and in 1860 he was elected deputy to the parliament of Turin, of which he was chosen vice-president in 1861. He died at Florence, 28th April 1867.
