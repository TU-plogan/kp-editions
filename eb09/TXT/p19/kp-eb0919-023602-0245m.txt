PLYMOUTH, a municipal and parliamentary borough and seaport town of Devonshire, England, is picturesquely situated on Plymouth Sound in the south-west corner of the county, at the confluence of the Tamar and Plym, 44 miles south-west of Exeter. With the borough of Devonport and the township of East Stonehouse it forms the aggregate town known as the “Three Towns.” There is railway communication by means of the Great Western and South-Western lines, and by several branch lines connected with these systems. The defences of the town, in addition to the citadel, an obsolete fortification built by Charles II., on the site of an older fort, consist of a most elaborate chain of forts of great strength mounted with guns of the heaviest calibre, and forming a complete line of defence round the whole circumference both landwards and seawards. The streets are for the most part narrow and crooked, and the houses very irregular both in style of architecture and in height. Great improvements have, however, recently taken place. The more ancient part of the town near the water-side has been much altered, and a number of model dwellings have also lately been erected. In the principal thoroughfares there are numerous handsome shops and other imposing business establishments. Among the most important of the public buildings is the Guildhall, completed in 1874 at a cost of £56,000, a fine group in the Gothic style of the 13th century, with a lofty tower, and containing the town-hall with a fine organ and a series of historical windows, a police court and offices, a sessions and other court rooms, and the council chamber and municipal offices. The new post office in Westwell Street was erected at a cost of £12,000. The market, dating from 1804, and occupying about three acres in the centre of the town, is in course of reconstruction. A fine clock-tower, erected by the corporation, stands at the junction of George Street and Union Street. The parish church of St Andrews, some portions of which date from about 1430, has undergone alterations and improvements at different periods, and in 1874-75 was completely restored under the direction of the late Sir G. G. Scott. The tower, built in 1460, contains a fine peal of bells. The church of Charles the Martyr was begun in 1640, when the parish was divided, but owing to the Civil War was not completed till 1657. Of the other more modern parish churches there are none of special interest. The town is the seat of a Roman Catholic bishopric, the cathedral of which, a good building in the Early English style, was opened in 1858 at a cost of £10,000. Attached to it is the convent of Notre Dame, and several other religious houses and chapels. The Athenaeum (1812) is the home of the Plymouth Institution and the Devon and Cornwall Natural History Society. In connexion with it there are a lecture hall, a museum, art gallery, and a small but select scientific library. The Plymouth Proprietary Library (1812) has a good selection of books in general literature, and the building also contains the library of the Plymouth Incorporated Law Society and the Cottonian collection, which includes many relics of Sir Joshua Reynolds and a number of his pictures. The Free Public Library, established in 1876, at present occupies the old Guildhall. The principal educational establishments are the Western College for the training of students for the ministry of the Independent denomination; the Plymouth College, a high school for boys; the High School for Girls; the Corporation Grammar School, founded in 1572; the Public School, established in 1809 (one of the largest public schools in England); the Grey Coat School; the Blue Coat School; the Orphan’s Aid; Lady Rogers’s School; the Orphan Asylum; and the Household of Faith founded by the well known Dr Hawker. The Plymouth school board has nine schools in full operation; and each of the principal parishes has also its parochial day school. The charitable institutions embrace the South Devon and East Cornwall Hospital, for which a fine range of buildings has lately been erected; the Devon and Cornwall Female Orphan Asylum (1834); the Penitentiary and Female Home (1833); the Royal Eye Infirmary (1821); the South Devon and Cornwall Institution for the Blind (1860, new building erected 1876), and various other philanthropic societies. The only public recreation ground of any extent is the Hoe Park, 18 acres, a fine promenade sloping gradually to the sea, attached to which is a handsome promenade pier. On the Hoe a statue in bronze, by Boehm, of Sir Francis Drake was unveiled in 1884. Smeaton’s lighthouse has been removed from the reef on which it stood for one hundred and twenty years, and is now a prominent object on the Hoe. The view from the Hoe includes Mount Edgcumbe with its beautifully wooded slopes, the Cornwall hills, the Dartmoor hills on the north-eastern horizon, and Eddystone lighthouse far away over the waters of the Channel.

Plymouth mot only holds a leading position in the country as a naval station, but is the centre of the growing trade of Devonshire and Cornwall, and is also becoming a holiday centre and health resort. To the south of the town is the Sound, protected by the magnificent breakwater, within the limits of which and the harbours connected[9:19:237] with it the whole British navy might find a safe anchorage. The western harbour, known as the Hamoaze, at the mouth of the river Tamar, is devoted almost exclusively to the requirements of the royal navy, as along its banks are the dockyard, the Keyham factory, the arsenal, and other Government establishments (See Devonport, vol. vii., 138; and Dockyards, vol. vii., 315). The eastern harbour, Cattewater with Sutton Pool, now protected by a new breakwater at Mount Batten, is the anchorage ground for merchant shipping. Commodious dock accommodation is provided at the Great Western Docks, Millbay, between Plymouth and Stonehouse, opened in 1857, and comprehending a floating basin over 13 acres in extent with a depth of 22 feet at spring tides, a tidal harbour of 35 acres, and a graving dock. The port has an extensive trade with America, the West Indies, Mauritius, Africa, and the Baltic ports, as well as an extensive coasting trade. It is the starting point for many of the emigrant ships for Australia, New Zealand, and British America. The chief exports are minerals, including copper, lead, tin, granite, and marble. There is also some trade in pilchards and other fish. The imports are chiefly agricultural produce and timber. The total number of vessels that entered the port in cargo and in ballast in 1883 was 3852, of 843,227 tons, the number that cleared 3443, of 754,318 tons. Plymouth has few manufactures, the principal being biscuits, black-lead, candles, manures, soap, starch, sugar, lead, and the celebrated Plymouth gin. The principal industries are connected with shipbuilding and the fisheries. According to the Act of 1835, the borough is divided into six wards, and is governed by a mayor, twelve aidermen, and thirty-six councillors. The water-works are under the control of the corporation, but the gas works are in the hands of a company. The population of the municipal borough (area 1468 acres) in 1871 was 68,758, and in 1881 it was 73,794. The population of the parliamentary borough (area 2061 acres) in the same years was 70,091 and 76,080. It returns two members to parliament.

The Hoe at Plymouth is claimed to be the high rock from which, according to Geoffrey of Monmouth, Corinaeus the Trojan hurled the giant Goemagot into the sea, and at an early period there was cut out in the ground at the Hoe the likeness of two figures with clubs in their hands, which for many years was renewed by the corporation, and was in existence till the erection of the citadel about 1671. Both British and Roman remains have been found in the neighbourhood, the most important being those of a Romano-British cemetery discovered in 1864 during the construction of Fort Stamford. In Domesday it occurs as Sutone, and afterwards it was divided into tlιe town of Sutton Prior, the hamlet of Sutton Valletort, and the tithing of Sutton Ralph, a part of it having been granted to the Norman family of Valletort, while the greater part belonged to the priory of Plympton. About 1253 a market was established, and in 1292 the town first returned members to parliament. In the 14tb century it was frequently the port of embarkation and of disembarkation in connexion with expeditions to France. It suffered considerably at the hands of the French in 1338, 1350, 1377, 1400, and 1402, the Bretons on the last occasion destroying six hundred houses. In 1412 the inhabitants petitioned for a charter, but for a long time their application was opposed by the prior and convent of Plympton. In 1439 a charter was, however, at last granted by Henry VI., defining the limits of the town, permitting the erection of walls and defences, allowing the levying of dues on shipping for the purpose of such buildings and their maintenance, and directing the institution of a corporate body under the title of the “mayor and commonalty of the borough of Plymouth.” Leland speaks (1540-47) of Plymouth harbour as being chained across in times of necessity, and of an ‘ ‘ old ‘ castel quadrate’ between the town and the sea.” A small fragment of one of the outer works of this castle still stands at the foot of Lambhay Street. During the rebellion of 1548-49 the town suffered severely at the hands of the insurgents, and according to Westcote the “evidences” of the borough were burnt. Under Elizabeth it rose to be the foremost port of England, and Camdeq, who visited the town about 1588, [9:19:238] States that “though not very large its name and reputation is very great among all nations.” In the discovery of the New World it played a part of prime importance. Martin Cockeram, a native of the town, sailed with Sebastian Cabot when he touched the coast of America in 1497. Sir John Hawkins and his father William were natives of the town, and in 1571 Sir John was returned member of parliament for the borough. In 1572 Sir Francis Drake left the port for the West Indies, and in 1577 he set out from it on his voyage “about the earth.” He was elected mayor of the town in 1581, and in 1592-93 represented it in parliament. Sir Humphrey Gilbert, who was M.P. for Plymouth in 1571, had in 1578 received from Queen Elizabeth letters patent for a colony in America; but, after setting out in 1579, he was compelled to return with the loss of his principal ship. In 1583 he sailed again from Plymouth (see Gilbert). In 1585 Drake again sailed from Plymouth for the West Indies, bringing back on his return the remnant of Raleigh’s Virginian colony. The port supplied seven ships against the Spanish Armada, and it was in the Sound that the English fleet of 120 sail awaited the sighting of the Spaniards. In 1590 Drake was successful in the oft attempted task of bringing in a stream of fresh water for the use of the town, from the river Meavy near Sheepstor, Dartmoor. He and Sir John Hawkins sailed from Plymouth on their last voyage in 1595, both dying at sea in the following year. Many other expeditions from Drake’s time to the present have been despatched from this port, which was the last at which the Pilgrim Fathers touched when they set sail for America. Plymouth was throughout nearly the whole Civil War closely invested by the Royalists, and was the only town in the west of England which never fell into their hands. The town was one of the first to declare for William of Orange. It was in 1691, during his reign, that the dockyard was commenced. The “local literature” of Plymouth is singularly rich and comprehensive. It has also a connexion with many men of great eminence. Sir Joshua Reynolds, born at Plympton, first practised his art in the town, and its native artists are represented by Sir Charles Lock Eastlake, James Northcote, Benjamin Robert Haydon, and Samuel Prout. Besides Sir John Hawkins and other celebrated seamen, it has also given birth to Sir William Snow Harris, Dr James Yonge, Dr John Kitto, Dr S. P. Tregelles, Dr Robert Hawker, N. T. Carrington the Dartmoor poet, Mortimer Collins, and Sir R. P. Collier.
