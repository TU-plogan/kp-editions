PHYLACTERY(φυλακτήρων) is the name given in the New Testament to the Γ⅛∏ (tefillîn) or “prayerthongs” of the Jews. Every Jew wears at prayer two of these thongs—(1) the hand-tefilla, a leather thong wound round the left arm and supporting a small case containing a parchment strip with the passages Exod. xiii. 1-10,11-16, Deut. vi. 4-9, xi. 13-21 written in four columns; (2) the head-tefilla, a similar thong with the four passages inscribed on four separate slips of parchment, and worn round the head so that the box with the texts rests on the forehead. The use of these phylacteries is justified by a literal interpretation of expressions in the passages above cited, and they form, together with the ΓWy (zîzîth) or “fringe” (Numb. XV. 37 sq.) and the Hfflô (mezûza) above the door, the three sets of visible signs by which the Israelite is constantly reminded of his duty to God. The zîzîth is no longer placed on the outer garment as in New Testament times (Matt, xxiii. 5), but on the woollen scarves called ∏ , ψip (tallith), of which the Jewish man always wears one, while another is wound round the head and neck during prayer. The mezûza is now a longish box fixed over the right doorpost of houses or rooms and containing a parchment with Deut. vi. 4-9, xi. 13-21.

In their origin there can be little doubt that the phylacteries are, according to the proper sense of the Greek word, a kind of amulet, not essentially different from the Aramaic kmi'é, and in fact “the Hebrew” of the Hexapla uses the word “phylacteries” for the amulets (J?. V. pillows) of Ezek. xiii. 18. Phylactery and mezûza were supposed to keep off hurtful demons (Targ. on Cant, viii. 3). For further particulars, see Surenhusius, Mishna, i. 9 sq., and Bodenschatz, Kirch. V^erf. d. heutigen Juden, iv. 9 sq.
