PORTO MAURIZIO, a city of Italy, chief town of a province and centre of a maritime district, lies on the coast of the Ligurian Sea, 46 miles by rail east of Nice and 70 miles west of Genoa, and consists of a picturesque old town situated on the heights and a modern town of villas on the lower slopes. The principal church, designed by Gaetano Cantone, is perhaps the most notable building of its class in the whole Riviera; the roof is divided into arches, domes, and semi-domes resting on massive piers. A few remains of the old city Avails may still be seen. In 1881 the population of the city was 6309 and of the commune 6827. About 2 miles east of Porto Maurizio is the town of Oneglia, with a fine church, S. Giovanni Battista, designed by Gaetano Amoretti, a hospital (1785), and a national penitentiary on the cell-system. Its population in 1881 was 7286, that of the commune 7433. Both Porto Maurizio and Oneglia lie on the same bay, and schemes are under discussion for uniting their harbours into one great port. At Porto Maurizio an extension is being made (1884) in the western mole. The foreign traffic of the two ports was represented in 1883 by 154 sailing vessels and 27 steamers entering or clearing (the steamers all preferring Porto Maurizio), and the coasting trade by 627 vessels. Both towns are embowered amid olive groves, and the district is famous for the quality of its oil.

Porto Maurizio appears as Portus Mauricii in the Antonine Itinerary. After being subject to the marquises of Susa (llth century), of Savona (12th century), and of Clavesana, it was sold by Boniface of Clavesana in 1288 to Genoa for a yearly pension; in 1354 it became the seat of the Genoese vicar of the western Riviera, and remained in the possession of the republic till it was merged in the kingdom of Sardinia. Oneglia, formerly situated inland at the place called Castelvecchio (Old Castle), has occupied its present site-from about 935. The bishops of Albenga sold it in 1298 to the Dorias of Genoa, who in their turn disposed of it in 1576 to Emanuel Philibert. In the various Avars of the house of Savoy Oneglia often changed hands. In 1614 and 1649 the Spaniards and in 1623 and 1672 the Genoese obtained possession; in 1692 it had to repulse an attack by a French squadron; in 1744-45 it was again occupied by the Spaniards, and in 1792 bombarded and burned by the French.
