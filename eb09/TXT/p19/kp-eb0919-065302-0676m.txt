PRAeMUNIRE, the name given to a writ originating in the 14th century in the attempt to put restraint on the action of the papal authority in regard to the disposal of ecclesiastical benefices in England before the same became vacant, and subsequently, to the prejudice of the rightful patron, and also in the encouragement of resort to the Roman curia rather than to the courts of the country, in disregard of the authority of the crown, leading thereby to the creation of an imperium in imperio and the paying that obedience to papal process which constitutionally belonged to the king alone. The λvord “praemunire”^[1. Praemunire is a corruption of the Latin praemonere, to pre-admonish or forewarn, and is taken from the words of the writ itself, which runs “Praemunire facias” A. B., &c., i.e., cause A. B. to be forewarned that he appear to answer the contempt wherewith he stands charged. ] is applied also to the offence for which the writ is granted, and furthermore to the penalty it incurs. The range and description of offences made liable to the penalties of praemunire became greatly widened subsequently to the Reformation, so that acts of a very miscellaneous character were from time to time brought within the scope of enactments passed for a very different purpose. The offence is of a nature highly criminal, though not capital, and more immediately affects the crown and Government. The statute 16 Rich. II. c. 5 (1392) is usually designated the Statute of Praemunire; it is, however, but one only of numerous stringent measures (many of which are still unrepealed) resulting from the enactment of the Statute of Provisors (35 Edw. I. c. 1), passed in a previous reign, which according to Coke (Instit.) was the foundation of all the subsequent statutes of praemunire. Cowel (Laιo Diet.) describes a provisor as one who sued to the court of Rome for a provision which was called gratia expectiυa.

The penalties of praemunire involved the loss of all civil rights, forfeiture of lands, goods, and chattels, and imprisonment during the royal pleasure. In the Habeas Corpus Act (31 Car. II. c. 2, 1679) the committing of any man to prison out of the realm was made praemunire unpardonable even by the king. It thus appears that, whilst the crown by its prerogative might at any time remit the whole or any part of the punishment incurred by a praemunire, an exception was made in transgressions of the Statute of Habeas Corpus. The Royal Marriage Act (12 Geo. III. c. 11) of 1772 is the last statute which subjects any one to the penalties of a praemunire as ordained by 16 Rich. II.

It cannot be doubted that the legislation exemplified in the Statutes of Praemunire and Provisors was felt by the [9:19:654] popes to be a great check on their freedom of action. In the hands of Henry VIII. praemunire became eventually a lever for the overthrow of papal supremacy. The last ancient statute concerning praemunire, until the Reformation, was the 2 Hen. IV. c. 3 (1400), by which all persons who accepted any provision from the pope to be exempt from canonical obedience to their proper ordinary were subjected to the penalties prescribed. Bishop Stubbs,^[2. Constit. Hist, of Eng. (1880), iii. 356 sg. ] in summing up his account of the various statutes of praemunire, succinctly says of them that they were intended to prevent encroachments on and usurpations of jurisdiction on the part of the pope, and he adds that the more important statute was that of 16 Rich. II. c. 5 (1392), which he describes as one of the strongest defensive measures taken during the Middle Ages against Rome, and which was called for in consequence of the conduct of the pope, who had forbidden the bishops to execute the sentences of the royal courts in suits connected with ecclesiastical patronage. Tomlins {Law Diet.) states that there is only one instance of a prosecution on a praemunire to be found in the state trials, in which case the penalties were inflicted upon some persons for refusing to take the oath of allegiance to Charles II. It may be added that on an indictment for praemunire a peer might not be tried by his peers.
