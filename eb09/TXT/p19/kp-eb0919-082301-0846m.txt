PROSELYTE(πpoσηλvτo<i) is the term most frequently adopted by the Septuagint, especially in legal passages, to represent the Hebrew ηj. The ger, or more fully ger vftöshäb, is not any “stranger” but a stranger dwelling in a Hebrew community and enjoying a certain measure of protection. In old time at least the position of such a stranger was no doubt very insecure, for he had no strong kinsmen to take his part, and so, like the widow and orphan, with whom many passages of the Old Testament associate him, he was liable to oppression. The law as well as the prophets commend him to the humane regard of his neighbours, but it would have been quite foreign to antique ideas to grant him equal rights (see Lev. xxv. 45; Deut, xxiii. 20). Like the Arabic jar, therefore (whose name is at bottom the same), he must have generally sought to attach himself as a client to some individual or community able to protect him, and so we must understand the metaphor in passages like Ps. xv. 1, xxxix. 12.

In the old Hebrew kingdom the word gër had a civil not a religious significance, and it would almost seem that a poor Israelite without inheritance might sink to this position, which indeed is scarcely distinguishable from that of the Le vite in Jud. xvii. 8, who went forth to sojourn (gur) where he might find a place. The exile and the restoration made a change in this as in all other aspects of Hebrew society. On the one hand Ezekiel xlvii. 22 and Isa. xiv. 1 contemplate that the restored nation shall be recruited by strangers who are received on equal terms; but, as the Jews returned not as an independent nation but as a distinct religious community, this implies especially that the sons of the stranger, by joining Israel, observing the Sabbath, and holding fast to Jehovah’s covenant, may gain admission to all the privileges of the temple and its worship. So it is put in Isa. Ivi. 6, 7 in marked contrast to the restrictions laid down in Deut, xxiii. 3, 7 sq. That the views of the prophets had practical issue cannot be doubted; even the foreign Nethinim in the second temple were rapidly transformed not merely into good Israelites but into Levites. The condition of admission to the full privileges of an Israelite, in particular to the passover, is, according to the Priestly Code (Exod. xii. 48; Numb. ix. 14), circumcision,—to which the later Jewish usage adds lustration by immersion in water (baptism, t ’ blla) and the presentation of a sacrifice (korbän). The immersion, about which there has been a good deal of controversy, some maintaining that it came into use later than Christian baptism, was really a necessary act for one who had been previously unclean, and may be held to be involved in the general Pentateuchal law of ceremonial washings. The later technical name for a heathen who thus joined the theocracy was pηχ∏ *1J, “proselyte of righteousness.”

The free admission of foreigners to the Jewish church is a mark of the universalistic tendency which, in spite of all the narrownesses of Judaism under the law, accompanied the break-up of the old national system. On the other hand the so-called Law of Holiness (later than Ezekiel but earlier than the Priestly Code), which is contained in Lev. xvii. sq., presents a different line of transition from the purely civil to the religious meaning of gêr. In these laws, which proceed throughout on the principle that Israel, and all that has to do with Israel, must be regulated by regard to formal holiness, it is demanded that certain rules shall be enforced not only on Israelites proper but on strangers sojourning in their land. They are not to eat blood (xvii. 10), commit incest (xviii. 26), sacrifice to Moloch (xx. 2), or blaspheme Jehovah (xxiv. 16); and for murder and other crimes they are to be answerable to the Hebrew authorities according to Hebrew law (xxiv. 22). These rules are in substance—the third being extended to a prohibition of idolatry generally—-the “Noachic laws” to which in later usage a man or woman might promise to conform and thereby, without becoming a regular member of the theocracy, be recognized as a “proselyte of the gate,” i.e., “within the gates of Israel.” What the Law of Holiness proposed to enforce became in fact—the theocracy not possessing political power over strangers— a voluntary obligation assumed by those “who worshipped God” (σeβ0gevoL τbv θeov, Acts xiii. 50, xvi. 14, xvii. 4, 17, xviii. 7—in E.V. often rendered “devout”).

The proselytizing zeal of the Jews is spoken of in Mat. xxiii. 15, and by many Greek and Latin writers. Up to the time of Hadrian it was facilitated by the favour generally extended to the Jews by the Roman emperors; and not only on Semitic soil, as at Damascus, where Josephus tells us that most of the women were proselytes, but [9:19:824] throughout the Roman world many converts were made, especially among women. The most noted conversion was that of the royal house of Adiabene (Josephus, Ant., xx. 2), of which the splendid tomb of Queen Helena, a little way outside of Jerusalem, still remains a monument.
