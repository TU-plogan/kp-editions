POSEN (Polish, Poznan), capital of the above province, the seat of a Roman Catholic archbishop, and the headquarters of a corps of the German army, is situated at the confluence of the Cybina and Warthe, 150 miles to the east of Berlin and 90 miles to the north of Breslau. It is a fortress of the first rank and of great strategic importance; the works consist of a citadel and inner line of bastions, and an outer circle of twelve detached forts. The principal part of the town lies on the west bank of the Warthe, and comprises the so-called Altstadt and the [9:19:560] well-built modern quarter that has sprung up under the Prussian régime. On the other bank is the Wallischei, a poor district inhabited by Poles. Among the older buildings none calls for remark except the town-house, a quaint specimen of the Slavonic adaptation of Romanesque forms. The chief modern buildings are the various military and public offices, the law courts, the theatre, the real school, and the Raczynski library. The churches are devoid of architectural interest, but the cathedral contains numerous interesting objects of art, including two bronze-gilt statues of the first Christian kings of Poland, by Rauch. The manufactures of Posen are multifarious enough, including machinery, carriages, tobacco, copper boilers and vats, military requisites, chemicals, <tc.; but there is nothing that can be called a staple industry. A lively trade is carried on in the agricultural products of Russia and Poland, and several well-attended fairs and markets are held. In 1880 Posen contained 65,713 inhabitants, including 35,725 Roman Catholics, 22,869 Protestants, and 7063 Jews. The German inhabitants are at present considerably more numerous than the Poles, though it would seem that the latter have increased in a greater ratio since 1875. The Jewish element is stronger here (10 ’ 7 per cent.) than in any other town in Germany. The garrison consists of 7000 men.

Posen, one of the oldest towns in Poland and the residence of some of the early Polish princes, became the seat of a Christian bishop towards the end of the 10th century. The original settlement was on the east bank of the Warthe, but the new or German town, established on the west bank about the year 1250, soon became the more important half of the doable city. Posen was a royal free town, and was directly represented in the Polish diet down to 1733. In the Middle Ages it became a great depot of the trade between Germany and the west of Europe on the one hand and Poland and Russia on the other. Numerous foreign merchants took up their abode here, including a strong colony of Scotsmen, who exported raw produce to Edinburgh. The town attained the climax of its prosperity in the 16th century, when its population is variously estimated at from 30,000 to 80,000. The intolerance shown to the Protestants, the troubles of the Thirty Years’ War, the visitation of the plague, and other causes, however, soon conspired to change the state of affairs, and in the 18th century the town had only 5000 inhabitants. New life was infused into it on its annexation by Prussia at the second partition of Poland, and since then its progress has been limited only by its position as a fortress. The relations of the German and Polish elements of the population continue to be somewhat strained.
