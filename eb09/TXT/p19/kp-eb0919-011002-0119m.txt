PIOTRKÃ“W, the chief town of a government of the same name in Russian Poland, and formerly the seat of the high court of Poland, is situated on the railway from Warsaw to Vienna, 90 miles by rail to the south-west of the capital, 5 miles to the west of the river Pilica. Ten years ago it was a poor town of 17,000 inhabitants, but it has grown during the last few years, partly as the seat of the provincial administration, and partly in consequence of the development of trade. In April 1882 it had 23,050 inhabitants, including 3000 military. Its manufactures are still insignificant; it has a few flourmills, saw-mills, soap-works, and breweries.
