PRISHTINA, or Pristina, a town of European Turkey, since 1877 at the head of a liwa in the vilayet of Kossovo, lies on an affluent of the Sitnitza, a subtributary of the Morava, and gives its name to one of the stations on the Salonica-Uskub-Mitrowica Railway, which runs at a distance of 6 or 7 miles to the west of the town.

lating ground, and presents in the distance a pleasant appearance with the minarets erected, according to the legend, by Turkish women whose husbands fell in the battle of Kossovo fought in the neighbourhood. Prishtina is the seat of a Greek bishop. Its population is estimated at from 8000 to 10,000. To the south-east lies the partly ruined monastery of Gratchanitza founded by King Milutin of Servia, who reigned from 1275 to 1321. It is a graceful building with a large central dome surrounded by four smaller domes and a variety of arches, of which the higher are pointed and the lower round. Among the frescos are portraits of the founder and his queen Simonida, daughter of Andronicus II. Palaeologus, and a remarkable head of Christ in the dome. See Mackenzie and Irby, The, Slavonic Provinces of Turkey.
