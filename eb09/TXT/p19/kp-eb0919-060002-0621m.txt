POTTER, Paul (1625-1654), animal painter, was born at Enkhuizen, Holland, in 1625. He was instructed in art by his father, Peter Potter, a landscape and figure painter of some merit, and by the time he had attained his fifteenth year his productions were already much esteemed. At the age of twenty he settled at The Hague, and there married in 1650. He was patronized by Maurice, prince of Orange, for whom he painted the life-size picture of the Young Bull, now one of the most celebrated works in the gallery of The Hague. In 1652 he was induced by Burgomaster Tulk of Amsterdam to remove to that city. The constitution of the painter seems to have been feeble, and his health suffered from the unremitting diligence with which he pursued his art. He died in 1654 at the early age of twenty-nine.

His paintings are generally on a small scale; his animals are designed with a careful accuracy which bears witness to the artist’s close and constant study from nature; while the landscape backgrounds are introduced with spirit and appropriateness. His colour is clear and transparent, his execution firm and finished without being laboured. He executed a series of some twenty etchings, mainly of animals, which are simple and direct in method and handling. Here, as in painting, his precocity was remarkable; his large plate of the Herdsman, produced when he was only eighteen, and that of the Shepherd, which dates from the following year, shoλv him at his best as an accomplished master of the point.
