PRIDEAUX, Humphrey (1648-1724), dean of Norwich, was the third son of Edward Prideaux of Place in Padstow, Cornwall, by his wife Bridget, daughter of John Moyle of Bake in the same county. Both families were of good repute in the west of England, and that of Prideaux was especially influential, as is shown by the elaborate pedigrees in Sir John Maclean’s Deanery of Trigg Minor (ii. 194-242). He was born at Place on 3d May 1648, and received the rudiments of his education at the grammar-schools of Liskeard and Bodmin. In 1665 he was placed at Westminster under Dr Busby, and after staying there for three years was admitted a student at Christ Church, Oxford, taking his degrees in the following order, B.A. in 1672, M.A. 1675, B.D. 1682, and D.D. 1686. It was the rule of that house that its best scholars should, after they had taken their first degree, be employed in editing some classical writer, and Prideaux was accordingly deputed to superintend a new edition of Lucius Florus and to prepare for the press, from a Greek MS. in the Bodleian, a work by Johannes Malalas. The first of these works is now exceedingly scarce, if indeed a copy be in existence, and the second was, on his advice, left in manuscript. The famous Arundel marbles had just been given to the university, and Prideaux was instructed to undertake the task of describing the gift, his transcript of the inscriptions, with a commentary and additions from the Selden marbles, appearing in 1676. In 1679 he was appointed to the rectory of St Clement’s, Oxford, and in the same year became Hebrew lecturer at Christ Church, whereupon he published two Hebrew tracts of Maimonides with a Latin translation and annotations. Prideaux continued tutor at Christ Church until February 1686, holding for the last three years the rectory of Bladon with Woodstock; but in 1686 he exchanged for the benefice of Saham in Norfolk, and took up his residence in that county, with which he had for some time been connected through his appointment in August 1681 to a prebendal stall in Norwich cathedral. The sympathies of Prideaux inclined to Low Churchism in religion and to Whiggism in politics, and during the years which immediately preceded and succeeded the Revolution of 1688 he took an active part in the controversies of the day, publishing in quick succession the following pamphlets— The Validity of the Orders of the Church of England (1688), Letter to a Friend on the Present Convocation (1690), The Case of Clandestine Marriages stated (1691). Prideaux was promoted to the archdeaconry of Suffolk at the close of 1688 and to the deanery of Norwich in June 1702, and it was the wish of some of the members of the episcopal bench that he should have been appointed to the bishopric of Norwich, but their desires were not gratified. In 1694 he was obliged, through ill-health, to resign the rectory of Saham, and after having held the vicarage of Trowse for fourteen years [9:19:724] (1696-1710) he found himself incapacitated, by repeated attacks of stone, from further parochial duty. He died at Norwich on 1st November 1724, and was buried in the cathedral on 4th November. His wife, Bridget, only daughter and sole heir of Anthony Bokenham of Helmingham, Suffolk, died at Norwich in November 1700; they were married on 16th February 1686.

Many of the dean’s writings were of great value, and their popularity continued unimpaired down to the present century. His Life of Mahomet, originally published in 1697, had passed through eight editions by 1723, and his Directions to Churchwardens, first issued in 1701, reached a twelfth edition in 1871. But the favour with which these volumes were received, great as it was, contrasts but badly with the extraordinary success of his account of The Old and New Testament connected in the History of the Jews, a work of great research and learning. This has been many times reissued since the appearance of the first part in 1716, and has been translated into the French, German, and Italian languages. Le Clerc subjected it to a critical examination. A series of remarks upon it is contained in Walter Moyle’s works, and continuations were compiled by Samuel Shuckford and Michael Russell. Prideaux published several small tracts, and many volumes of manuscript collections are in the possession of his descendant at Place. These, with particulars of the dean’s letters in print and in manuscript and with bibliographical details of his numerous publications, are described in the Bibliotheca Comubiensis, ii. 527-533 and iii. 1319. A volume of his letters to John Ellis, some time under-secretary of state, was edited by Mr E. Μ. Thompson for the Camden Society in 1875, and contained a vivid picture of Oxford life after the Restoration; but it will always be regretted that some passages in his correspondence should betray feelings unworthy of the writer. An anonymous life of Dean Prideaux appeared in 1748, but it was mainly compiled from a larger memoir by his son.
