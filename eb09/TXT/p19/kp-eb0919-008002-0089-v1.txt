PICO, Giovanni, of Mirandola (1463-1494), was the youngest son of Giovanni Francesco Pico, prince of Mirandola, a small territory about 30 Italian miles west of Ferrara, afterwards absorbed in the duchy of Modena. The family was illustrious and wealthy, and claimed descent from Constantine. From his childhood Pico was remarkable for his quick and tenacious memory, and gave promise of his future distinction as a scholar. In his fourteenth year he went to Bologna, where he studied for two years, and was much occupied with the Decretals. The traditional studies of the place, however, disgusted him; he was eager to know all the secrets of nature, and devoting himself wholly to speculative learning he spent seven years wandering through all the schools of Italy and France and collecting a precious library. Like most men with brilliant faculties of acquisition and assimilation, Pico was constitutionally an eclectic; and he owes his place in the history of learning and thought to the indefatigable spirit of inquiry which left him dissatisfied with current teaching and drove him to studies then new and strange. Besides Greek and Latin he knew Hebrew, Chaldee, and Arabic; and his Hebrew teachers (Eliah del Medigo, Leo Abarbanel, and Jochanan Aleman—see L. Geiger, Johann Reuchlin [1871], p. 167) introduced him to the Kabbalah, which had great fascinations for one who loved all mystic and theosophic speculation. His learned wanderings ended at Rome, where he set forth for public disputation a list of nine hundred questions and conclusions in all branches of [9:19:81] philosophy and theology. He remained a year in Rome, but the disputation he proposed was never held. He was an object of envy to many for the range of attainments, which earned him the title of the Phoenix of his age, and detractors found it easy to fix on his conclusions a suspicion of heresy. The pope prohibited the little book in which they were contained, and Pico had to defend the impugned theses in an elaborate Apologia. His personal orthodoxy was, however, finally vindicated by a brief of Alexander VI., dated 18th June 1493. The suspected theses included such points as the following :—that Christ descended ad inferos not in his real presence but quoad effectum ; that no image or cross should receive latreia even in the sense allowed by Thomas; that it is more reasonable to regard Origen as saved than as damned; that it is not in a man’s free will to believe or disbelieve an article of faith as he pleases. But perhaps the most startling thesis was that no science gives surer conviction of the divinity of Christ than “magia” (i.e., the knowledge of the secrets of the heavenly bodies) and Kabbalah. Pico was the first to seek in the Kabbalah a proof of the Christian mysteries, and it was by him that Reuchlin was led into the same delusive path.

Pico had been up to this time a gay Italian nobleman; he was tall, handsome, fair-complexioned, with keen grey eyes and yellow hair, and a great favourite with women. But his troubles led him to more serious thoughts; he burned his amorous verses and gave himself wholly to sacred letters, publishing as the first fruits of his studies, in his twenty-eighth year, the Heptaplus, a mystical exposition of the creation. Next he planned a great sevenfold work against the enemies of the church, of which only the section directed against astrology was completed. After leaving Rome he again lived a wandering life, often visiting Florence, to which he was drawn by his friends Politian and Marsilius Ficinus, and where also he came under the influence of Savonarola. It was at Florence that he died in 1494. Three years before his death he parted with his share of the ancestral principality, and gave much of his wealth to the poor. He was now increasingly absorbed in ascetic exercises and religious meditation, and designed, when certain literary plans were completed, to give away all he had and wander barefoot through the world preaching Christ, or perhaps to join the preaching friars. But these plans were cut short by a fever which carried him off just at the time when Charles VIII. was at Florence. Pico’s attainments and the beauty of his character and piety produced a profound impression on his contemporaries, but his works, published by his nephew Giov. Fran. Pico, with a biography, at Bologna in 1496, and more than once reprinted, cannot now be read with much interest. The man himself, however, is still interesting, partly from his influence on Reuchlin and partly from the spectacle of a truly devout mind in the brilliant circle of half-pagan scholars of the Florentine renaissance.
