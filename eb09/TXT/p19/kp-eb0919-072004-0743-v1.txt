PRIBRAM or Przibram, a prosperous mining town of Bohemia, is situated about 32 miles S.W. of Prague. The lead-mines in the vicinity have been worked for several centuries and are especially important on account of the large quantity of silver extracted from the ore. In average years this amounts to 70,000 ft, representing a money value of nearly £300,000. The mines belong to the Government and employ about 5000 persons. One of the shafts, 3350 feet deep, is among the deepest in the world. Besides [9:19:721]

mining, the inhabitants occupy themselves in making glass beads, soap, candles, beer, and liqueurs. The most interesting buildings are the old deanery and church, and the archiépiscopal palace, now converted into a mining academy. At the top of the Heiliger Berg, a hill rising above the town, is a church with a wonder-working image of the Virgin, which attracts numerous pilgrims. The population of Pribram in 1880 was 11,171, or, including the adjacent Birkenberg, where the largest mines are situated, 14,881.
