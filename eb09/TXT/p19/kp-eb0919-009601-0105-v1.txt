PILOT. The English Merchant Shipping Act of 1854 (17 & 18 Vict. c. 104) defines a pilot as being a person duly licensed by any pilotage authority to conduct ships to which he does not belong as one of the crew. Pilots are in fact taken on board to superintend the steering of the vessel, where the navigation is difficult and dangerous, in consequence of their special knowledge of particular waters; and it is to this class alone that the term now applies, whereas in early times the pilot was the steersman, or the individual who conducted the navigation of a ship across the ocean and out of sight of land. The word seems to be of Dutch origin, and to mean primarily a person who conducts a ship by the sounding line (peillood). Cowell (Law Diet.), describing lodemanage, speaks of it as the hire of a pilot for conducting a vessel from one place to another,—a lodesman (Ang. Sax. ldd-man, a leader) being a pilot for harbour and river duty. During the period of his charge the whole responsibility of the safe conduct of the vessel devolves upon the pilot. Most systems of maritime law have made the employment of pilots compulsory, though this does not usually apply to ships of war. One effect of neglect or refusal on the part of the master of a ship to take a pilot is to discharge the insurers from their liability.^[1. In a measure before parliament in 1884, but not passed, it was contemplated to wholly abolish compulsory pilotage, releasing owners or masters of ships not employing pilots from all pilotage dues or rates and from any penalty for not employing a pilot.] Excepting under extraordinary circumstances (such as where it is evident that he is acting rashly or is intoxicated, or is palpably incompetent) a master would not be justified in interfering with the pilot in his proper vocation. In England, societies or corporations have long been established for the appointment and control of pilots in particular localities; and of these the Trinity House, London, owing to the number of the pilots under its control, and the large extent of its jurisdiction, may be deemed the principal. The laws relating to pilotage were consolidated by 48 Geo. III. c. 104 (1808), which was amended by 6 Geo. IV. c. 125 (1825); further regulations were made by 16 & 17 Viet, c. 129 (1853), which incorporated the Cinque Ports with the Trinity House pilots; and all existing regulations on the subject were embodied in the Merchant Shipping Act 17 <fc 18 Vict. c. 104 (1854), already referred to, from which pilotage authorities within the United Kingdom derive their jurisdiction, and which regulates their powers, the licensing of pilots and their rights, privileges, liabilities, and remuneration (Maude and Pollock, Law of Merchant Shipping, 1861).

The laws of pilotage in the United States are regulated by the individual States according to the Acts of Congress.
