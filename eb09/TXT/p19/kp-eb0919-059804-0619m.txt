POTI, a seaport town of Trans-Caucasia in the government of Kutais (Mingrelia), lies at the mouth of the Rhion (Phasis) on the coast of the Black Sea, 193 miles westnorth-west of Tiflis, with which it is connected by a railway [9:19:599] opened (except the tunnel of Suram) in 1872. The white walls of the fortress may be seen at a great distance contrasting with the green trees which surround them, and the lighthouse, 117 feet high, is visible 17 miles. Situated in a low and marshy delta not more than 2âˆ£ feet above the level of the river, Poti is extremely unhealthy, fever and ague prevailing in summer and autumn. Ever since the Russians obtained possession of the place they have laboured to improve the town and port, but with comparatively limited success. The houses are built of wood and supported on piles. After Batoum was transferred to Russia in 1878 it was thought that Poti would be abandoned as a port, but the Commission of Inquiry appointed in 1883 decided in its favour. Works estimated to cost 2,365,000 roubles and to be finished in four years were accordingly undertaken. The population of the town is given as 3112 in the Russian Calendar for 1882.

Poti represents the ancient Phasis, a commercial colony of the people of Miletus. The present fortress was built in 1578 by Amurath III. at the time of the war with Persia. In 1640 it was destroyed by the Imeritians, but it was again restored and enlarged, the ancient ruins in the neighbourhood yielding the necessary material. The town was a great market for the trade in slaves. It was captured by the Russians in 1812, and again in 1829.
