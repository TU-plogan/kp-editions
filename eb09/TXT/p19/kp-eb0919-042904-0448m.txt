POLYXENA, in Greek legend, a daughter of Priam, last king of Troy, and Hecuba. She had been betrothed to Achilles, and after his death and the destruction of Troy the ghost of Achilles appeared to the returning Greeks as they were encamped on the Thracian Chersonese and demanded of them the sacrifice of Polyxena. The Greeks consented and Neoptolemus, son of Achilles, sacrificed Polyxena on his father’s grave. This tragic story is the subject of the Hecuba of Euripides and the Troades of Seneca. Of Sophocles’s tragedy Polyxena a few fragments only remain.
