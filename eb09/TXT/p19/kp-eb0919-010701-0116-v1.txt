PINKERTON, John (1758-1826), archaeologist, numismatist, historian, geographer, and miscellaneous writer in prose and verse, was born at Edinburgh, February 17, 1758. After a brief education at Lanark he was articled as a law clerk in Edinburgh, his earliest work, printed during his clerkship, being an Elegy on Craigmillar Castle (1776). In 1780 he removed to London to devote himself to literary work, publishing in 1781 a volume of Rimes of no great merit, and a professed collection of Scottish Tragic Ballads. These were followed in 1782’by Two Dithyrambic Odes on Enthusiasm and Laughter, and by a series of Tales in Verse. Under the title of Select Scottish Ballads he reissued in 1783 his tragic ballads, with a supplement comprising Ballads of the Comic Kind,— a collection which obtained for him the not wholly appropriate title of “the second Chatterton.” An Essay on Medals in 1784 won him a considerable reputation, which was in some respects unpleasantly maintained by his bold but eccentric Letters on Literature published in 1785 under the pseudonym of Robert Heron—a temporary adoption of his mother’s surname. In the following year he edited the Ancient Scottish Poems from the MS. Collections of Sir Richard Maitland of Lethington,— a genuine reproduction, though his confession in the preface of forgery in the previous collections published by him brought groundless suspicion upon it. It was succeeded in 1787 by a compilation, under the new pseudonym of Bennet, entitled the Treasury of Wit, and by his first important historical work, the Dissertation on the Origin and Progress of the Scythians or Goths, to which Gibbon professed himself indebted. Turning his attention to hagiology, Pinkerton next collected and printed in 1789 certain Vites Sanctorum Scotiae, and, a little later, published his Enquiry into the History of Scotland preceding the Reign of Malcolm III., in which he hoped to settle the ancient history of his country on the solid footing of facts and authorities and “leave nothing in t the μifc horn.” In many quarters his attitude towards the Highlanders excited “violent disgust,” but the Enquiry was twice reprinted, in 1794 and 1814, and is still of value'for the documents embodied in it. His edition of Barbour’s Bruce and a Medallic History of England to the Revolution appeared in 1790; a collection of Scottish Poems reprinted from scarce Editions in 1792; and a series of biographical sketches, the Iconographia Scotica, in the years 1795-97. In the last-mentioned year he published a History of Scotland from the Accession of the House of Stuart to that of Mary, containing valuable material, but almost entirely devoid of literary finish. A new biographical collection, the Gallery of Eminent Persons of Scotland (1799), was succeeded after a short interval by a Modern Geography digested on a New Plan (1802; enlarged, 1807). About this time he left London for Paris, where he chiefly resided until his death on May 10, 1826. His remaining publications were the Recollections of Paris in the years 1802-3- 4-5 (1806); a very useful General Collection of Voyages and Travels (1808-1813); a New Modern Atlas (1809-15); and his Petralogy (1811). An unsuccessful tragedy by him was performed at Edinburgh in 1813.

Pinkerton possessed an exceedingly vigorous and acute mind, but very lacking in high constructive power; and, as he was less patient in the formation of opinion than in research, his best work is marred by imperfect judgments crudely and obstinately asserted. At the same time his writings take no mean rank in the advance towards a scientific treatment of history. Walpole, notes of whose conversations were published at his death by Pinkerton under the title of Walpoliana, regarded his understanding as “one of the strongest, most manly, and clearest he ever knew;” and Gibbon not only praised his faculty of persistent application as herculean and heroic, but wished to secure his co-operation in a scheme for organizing the materials of early English history. The final verdict upon his work must be that of the Earl of Buchan, who endorsed Pinkerton’s statement that he was “a homo umbratilis, of a hypochondriac unsocial disposition,” with the comment “se ipse dixit·, it is his best apology; yet undoubtedly he has been a benefactor to literature.”
