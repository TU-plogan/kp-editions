PODOPHYLLIN, a popular remedy which is much used by those who are averse to the employment of calomel and other mercurial preparations, and hence has been called vegetable mercury. The drug, as used in medicine, is obtained from the rhizome of the American mandrake or May apple, Podophyllum peltatum, L., an herbaceous perennial belonging to the natural order Ber- beridaceae, indigenous in woods in Canada and the United States. The plant is about a foot high, bearing two peltate, deeply-divided leaves, which are about 5 inches in diameter, and bear in the axil a solitary, stalked, white flower about the size and shape of the garden anemone, with six or more petals and twice as many hypogynous stamens. The fruit is ripe in May, and is an oval, yellowish, fleshy berry containing twelve or more arillate seeds. The rhizome, as met with in commerce, occurs in cylindrical pieces two or three inches long and about ⅛ inch in diameter, of a chocolate or purplish brown colour, smooth and slightly enlarged where the juncture of the leafy stem is indicated by a circular scar on the upper and a few broken rootlets on the under side. The odour is heavy and disagreeable, and the taste acrid and bitter.

Podophyllin is a resinous powder obtained by precipitating an alcoholic tincture of the rhizome by means of water acidulated with hydrochloric acid. It varies in colour from greyish to bright yellow or greenish brown, the first-named being the purest. The drug has been the subject of numerous chemical investigations, the most recent of which (Podwyssotzki, in Ztschr. f. Russland, xx. 777) indicates that its activity is due to a definite resinous compound which has been named by its discoverer podophyllotoxin ; another constituent named podophylloquercetin has neither emetic nor purgative properties, but appears to be the cause of the griping pains which sometimes accompany the action of podophyllin; a third substance, podophyllic acid, has no medicinal action. Podophyllotoxin is a bitter amorphous principle soluble in weak alcohol and in hot water, ether, and chloroform, but insoluble in petroleum spirit. It is split up by the action of alkalies into a resin-acid named picropodophyllic acid, which is inert, and a very active substance, picropodophyllin, which crystallizes in delicate silky needles. _ Picropodophyllin is insoluble in water, and almost insoluble in spirit of less than 80 per cent., but is rendered soluble when united to the picropodophyllic acid. Podophylloquercetin crystallizes in short needles of a yellow colour and metallic lustre. It is soluble in etheι∙ and alcohol, and forms a compound with acetate of lead which is soluble in acetic acid and can be sublimed in shining yellow crystals, and which on exposure to the air gradually becomes green. Podophyllic acid is insoluble in water and in ether, but soluble in alcohol. In medicine podophyllin is employed for torpor of the liver and obstinate constipation, arising from sedentary employment, imprudence in diet, and irregularity of habits. In small doses it acts as a slow and gentle laxative, especially if combined with henbane and belladonna, but in large doses it is an irritant hydragogue cathartic, the action of which persists for some time. The usual dose as a laxative and mild hepatic stimulant is about ⅜ of a grain, but the samples met with in commerce vary considerably in strength, and act with varying effect upon different individuals. Specimens having a greenish tint should be avoided, since they probably contain podophylloquercetin and tend to cause severe griping. In large doses it appears to lose its stimulant action on the liver. Podophyllin is official in the pharmacopoeias of Great Britain, India, France, Russia, and the United States.
