PICCINI, or Piccinni, Niccola (1728-1800), musical composer, was born at Bari in 1728, and educated, under Leo and Durante, at the Conservatorio di San Onofrio in Naples. His first opera, Le Donne dispettose, produced in 1754, won him a high reputation, which he maintained creditably until 1760, when he composed, at Rome, the chef cPoeuvre of his early life, La Cecchina, ossia la Buona Figliuola, an opera buff a which attained a European success, little less remarkable than that of Pergolesi’s Serva Padrona. In a very short time this charming piece found its way not only to every theatre in Italy, but to Paris, to London, and to every great city on the Continent. It was even represented by marionettes; and every new fashion was named alia Cecchina. Six years after this Piccini was invited to Paris. He knew nothing of French, but his librettist, Marmontel, assisted him to such good purpose that, after the production of his first French opera, Roland, he was carried home from the theatre in triumph. All his next works were successful; but, unhappily, the directors of the Grand Opéra conceived the mad idea of deliberately opposing him to Gluck, by persuading the two composers to treat the same subject— Iphigénie en Tauride — simultaneously. The Parisian public now divided itself into two rival parties, which, under the names of Gluckists and Piccinists, carried on an unworthy and disgraceful war, equally ruinous to both artists, who would gladly have withdrawn from its violent excesses. That the final victory should be obtained by the Gluckists was inevitable; for Piccini, though a brilliant ornament of the Italian school, was no match for his illustrious antagonist. Gluck’s masterly Iphigénie was first produced on May 18, 1779. Piccini’s Iphigénie followed on January 23, 1781, and, though performed seventeen times, was afterwards consigned to oblivion. The fury of the rival parties continued unabated, even after Gluck’s departure from Paris in 1780; and an attempt was afterwards made to inaugurate a new rivalry with Sacchini. Still, Piccini held a good position, and on the death of Gluck, in 1787, proposed that a public monument should be erected to his memory,—a suggestion which the Gluckists themselves declined to support. On the breaking out of the Revolution in 1789, Piccini returned to Naples, where he was at first well received by King Ferdinand IV.; but the marriage of his daughter to a French democrat brought him into irretrievable disgrace. For nine years after this he maintained a precarious existence in Venice, Naples, and Rome; but, deriving new hope from the declaration of peace, he returned in 1798 to Paris, where the fickle public received him with enthusiasm, but left him to starve. He died at Passy, May 7, 1800.

Fétis gives a complete list of Piccitii’s works, including eighty operas, and much choral music. It is certain that the list of operas is very far from complete.
