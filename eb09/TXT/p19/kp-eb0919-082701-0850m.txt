PROTEUS, a Greek sea-god, spoken of by Homer as the Old Man of the Sea. In the Odyssey he dwells in the sea near Pharos, an island said to be a day’s sail from the mouth of the Nile; in Virgil his home is the Carpathian Sea between Crete and Rhodes. He knew all things past, present, and future, but was very loth to tell what he knew. Those who would consult him had first to surprise and bind him during his noon-day slumber in a cave by the sea, where he was wont to pass the heat of the day surrounded by his seals. Even when caught he would try to escape by assuming all sorts of shapes; now he was a lion, now a serpent, a leopard, a boar, a tree, fire, water. But if his captor held him fast, the god at last returned to his proper shape, gave the wished-for answer, and then plunged into the sea. He was subject to Poseidon, whose finny droves he shepherded under the billows. In post-Homeric times some thought that Proteus was a king of Egypt, at whose court the fair Helen tarried after she had been carried off by Paris, while the Greeks fondly deemed she was in Troy. This is the story followed, with variations, by Herodotus, who got it from Egyptian priests, and by Euripides in his play of Helen.

The fairy tale of Proteus has been interpreted in various fanciful ways. Proteus’s leading features—his knowledge of the future and his power of assuming any shape at pleasure—are characteristic of the “medicine-men” of savages in many parts of the world. As late as the beginning of our era there was a class of wizards at Rhodes who possessed two at least of the chief marks of “medicinemen ”—the powers of transforming themselves and of making rain (Diod. Sic., V. 55). There were rain-makers also at Rome (Festus, s.v. “aquaelicium,” where see commentary).
