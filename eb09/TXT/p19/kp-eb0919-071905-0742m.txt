PRÉVOST D’EXILLES, AntoineFrançois (1697- 1763), more commonly called the abbé Prévost, one of the most important French novelists of the 18th century, was born at Hesdin in Artois on 1st April 1697. His father was of good family, and held legal employments of some importance. Prévost was educated by the Jesuits, first at Hesdin and then at Paris. At the age of sixteen he left the Collège d’Harcourt and enlisted. This was, however, at the close of the War of the Spanish Succession, and he soon returned to the Jesuits, and was almost persuaded to enter the order. According to some accounts he actually did so, but a truant disposition once more came on him and he again joined the army, apparently obtaining some commission. It is, however, not easy to make his statement that he passed five or six years thus tally with the positive assertion that in 1719 he once more sought the cloister, this time joining the famous learned community of the Benedictines of St Maur. He took the vows finally in 1720, and it would appear that for some seven years he devoted himself without repining to study at various houses of the order, preaching, teaching, and writing some part of the Gallia Christiana. In 1727, however, or thereabouts (for the details of Prévost’s life, though unusually interesting, are most vaguely and insufficiently recorded) he once more broke bounds and fled to Holland. It is said that the immediate occasion was nothing more than a wish which he had formed to be transferred to Cluny, and which made him commit some technical misdemeanour. However this may be, he was for six years an exile in Holland and England, and one story even asserts that he contracted a regular or rather irregular marriage during this period. He certainly published the first of his remarkable novels, the Mémoires d ’ un Homme de Qualité, in 1728, and continued them for some years. Besides this he produced much miscellaneous work— Cléve- land, another novel ; Manon Lescaut, his masterpiece (which is a kind of appendix to his first book); and a periodical publication, partly in the style of the Spectator and partly in that of a literary review, called Le Pour et le Contre. All these were begun and most of them were finished before 1735, when he was back in France and produced his last novel of importance, the Doyen de Killérine, in which, as in Cléveland, he made much use of his English sojourn. He returned to France openly and with the royal permission, being allowed to wear the dress of the secular priesthood. Among his patrons the cardinal de Bissy and the prince de Conti are named; the latter made him his chaplain. He lived for nearly thirty years longer, composing, though not for bread, an extraordinary number of books, some of them original, some compilations. Amongst them were an Histoire Générale des Voyages, historical compilations on William the Conqueror and Margaret of Anjou, letters, moral essays, semi-scientific works, translations (including Pamela and Clarissa), and some original pieces. Of all these the novel called Histoire d'une Grecque Moderne (1741) has alone attracted some attention in modern times. Prévost was a facile writer and a fair critic, but except for his first three novels, and especially for Manon Lescaut, he would hardly be remembered save as a man of a curiously eventful and very imperfectly recorded life. His death itself has a kind of legendary character, and some of the circumstances are, it may be hoped, fictitious. He lived in a small cottage (for, despite his immense literary work on subjects which for the most part occupy only writers for money, he seems to have written [9:19:720] purely for love) at Chantilly, and it was his custom to walk much in the woods there. What is agreed is that he was struck with apoplexy during one of these walks, on 23d November 1763, and was found senseless. The legend adds the hideous particular that he was not dead, and that a clumsy village surgeon, heedlessly beginning what he supposed to be a post-mortem examination, at once recalled his patient to life and killed him. Even without this detail there is sufficient romantic interest (without other stories, some of them demonstrably fictitious, such as that he was accidentally the cause of his father’s death) about this life of a man who is at the same time uniformly represented as an indefatigable student and one of a quiet and easygoing temperament.

Prevost’s three chief romances, the Mémoires, Cleveland, and the Doyen de Killérine, are not unremarkable, because they hold a kind of middle place between the incident-romance of Le Sage and Defoe and the sentiment - romance of Marivaux and Richardson; but they all have the defect of intolerable length and of an indefinite fluency. Manon Lescaut, his one masterpiece, and one of the greatest novels of the century, is in both these respects so different that it might seem impossible that the same man should have written it. It is very short, it is entirely free from improbable incident, it is penetrated by the truest and the most cunningly managed feeling, and almost every one of its characters is a triumph of that analytic portraiture which is the secret of the modern novel. The chevalier des Grieux, the hero, is probably the most perfect example of the carrying out of the sentiment “All for love and the world well lost” that exists in fiction (it is curious that Prévost translated Dryden’s play of the name), at least where the circumstances are those of ordinary and probable life. Tiberge, his friend, is hardly inferior in the difficult part of mentor and reasonable man. Lescaut, the heroine’s brother, has vigorous touches as a bully and Bohemian; but the triumph of the book is Manon herself. Animated by a real affection for her lover, and false to him only because her incurable love of splendour, comfort, and luxury prevents her from welcoming privation with him or for him, though in effect she prefers him to all others, perfectly natural and even amiable in her degradation, and yet showing the moral of that degradation more .vividly than a hundred characters drawn with a less complacent pencil could have done, Manon is one of the most remarkable heroines in all fiction. She had no literary ancestress; she seems to have sprung entirely from the imagination, or perhaps the sympathetic observation, of the wandering scholar who drew her. Only the Princesse de Clèves can challenge comparison with her before or near to her own date, and in Manon Lescaut the plot is much more complete and interesting, the sentiments less artificial, and the whole story nearer to actual life than in Madame de la Fayette’s masterpiece. It is not easy to name a novel on the same scale which is more directly and naturally affecting at a first reading, and which on subsequent study approves itself more thoroughly as a work of art, than Manon Lescaut.

There is no complete edition of Prévost’s works. Oeuvres Choisies were published in 1783, and again in 1806. Of Manon Lescaut the editions are very numerous.
