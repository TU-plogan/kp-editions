PLOVER, French Pluvier, Old French Plovier, which doubtless has its origin in the Latin pluvia, rain (as witness the German equivalent Regenpfeifer, Rain-fifer); but the connexion of ideas between the words therein involved, so that the former should have become a bird’s name, is doubtful. Belon (1555) says that the name Pluvier is bestowed “pour ce qu’on le prend mieux en temps pluvieux qu’ en nulle autre saison,” which is not in accordance with modern observation, for in rainy weather Plovers are wilder and harder to approach than in fine. Others have thought it is from the spotted (as though with rain-drops) upper plumage of two of the commonest species of Plovers, to which the name especially belongs—the Charadrius pluvialis of Linnaeus, or Golden Plover, and the Squatarola helvetica of recent ornithologists, or Grey Plover. Both these birds are very similar in general appearance, but the latter is the larger and has an aborted hind-toe on each foot.^[1. But for this really unimportant distinction both birds could doubtless have been kept by ornithologists in the same genus, for they agree in most other structural characters. As it is they have long been sundered. ] 4 Its axillary feathers are also black, while in the Golden Plover they are pure white, and this difference often affords a ready means of distinguishing the two species when on the wing, even at a considerable distance. The Grey Plover is a bird of almost circumpolar range, breeding in the far north of America, Asia, and eastern Europe, frequenting in spring and autumn the coasts of the more temperate parts of each continent, and generally retiring further southward in winter—examples [9:19:228] not unfrequently reaching the Cape Colony, Ceylon, Australia, and even Tasmania. Charadrius pluvialis has a much narrower distribution, though where it occurs it is much more numerous as a species. Its breeding quarters do not extend further than from Iceland to western Siberia, but include the more elevated tracts in the British Islands, whence in autumn it spreads itself, often in immense flocks, over the cultivated districts if the fields be sufficiently open. Here some will remain so long as the absence of frost or snow permits, but the majority make for the Mediterranean basin, or the countries beyond, in which to winter; and, as with the Grey Plover, stragglers find their way to the southern extremity of Africa. The same may be said, mutatis mutandis, of what are usually deemed to be two other cognate forms, C. virginicus and C. fulvus, which respectively represent C. pluvialis in America and eastern Asia, where they are also known by the same English name. The discrimination of these two birds from one another requires a very acute eye, and room is here wanting in which to specify the minute points in which they differ;^[2. Schlegel {Mus. Pays-Bas, Cursores, p. 53) states that in some examples it seems impossible to determine the form to which they belong; but ordinarily American specimens are rather larger and stouter, and have shorter toes than those from Asia. ] bat both are easily distinguished from their European ally by their smaller size, their greyish-brown axillary feathers, and their proportionally longer and more slender legs. All, however,—and the same is the case with the Grey Plover, —undergo precisely the same seasonal change of colour, greatly altering their appearance and equally affecting both sexes. In the course of spring or early summer nearly the whole of the lower plumage from the chin to the vent, which during winter has been nearly pure white, becomes deep black. This is partly due to the growth of new feathers, but partly to some of the old feathers actually changing their colour, though the way in which the alteration is brought about is still uncertain.^[3. It is much to be regretted that ornithologists favourably situated in regard to zoological gardens have not more extensively used opportunities which might thus be accorded to them of conducting useful observations on this subject and others of similar kind. Elsewhere it would be hardly possible to carry on such an investigation, and even under the best circumstances it would not be easy and would require unremitting attention. The results of some partial observations superintended by Yarrell in the gardens of the Zoological Society of London are given in its Transactions (i. pp. 13-19). Little has been done there since of this nature. ] A corresponding alteration is at the same season observable in the upper plumage; but this seems chiefly due (as in many other birds) to the shedding of the lighter-coloured margins of the feathers, and does not produce so complete a transformation of appearance, though the beauty of the wearer is thereby greatly increased.

Though the birds just spoken of are those most emphatically entitled to be called Plovers, the group of Ringed Plovers before mentioned (Killdeer, vol. xiv. p. 76) and the Lapwing (vol. xiv. p. 308), with its allies, have, according to usage, hardly less claim to the name, which is also extended to some other more distant forms that can here have only the briefest notice. Among them one of the most remarkable is the “Zickzack” (so called from its cry)—the τροχίλος of Herodotus (see Humming-Bird, vol. xii. p. 358, n. 3), the Pluvianus or Hyas eegyptius of ornithologists, celebrated for the services it is said to render to the crocodile—a small bird whose plumage of delicate lavender and cream-colour is relieved by markings of black and white. This probably belongs to the small section generally known as Coursers, Cursorius, of which some eight or ten species inhabit the deserts of Africa and India, while one, C. gallicus, occasionally strays to Europe and even to England. Allied to them are the curious Pratincoles (⅛.v.), also peculiar to the Old World, while the genera Thinocoris and Attagis form an outlying group peculiar to South America, that is by some systematists regarded as a separate Family Thinocoridee, near which are often placed the singular Sheath bills {q.v.). By most authorities the Stone-Curlews (Curlew, vol. vi. p. 712), the Oyster-catchers (vol. xviii. p. Ill), and Turnstones {q.vf are also regarded as belonging to the Family Char- adriidae, and some would add the Avocets {Recurvirostra) and Stilts (?.v.), among which the Cavalier, Dromas ardeola — a form that has been bandied about from one Family and even Order to another—should possibly find its resting-place. It frequents the sandy shores of the Indian Ocean and Bay of Bengal from Natal to Aden, and thence to Ceylon, the Malabar coast, and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands,—a white and black bird, mounted on long legs, with webbed feet, and a bill so shaped as to have made some of the best ornithologists lodge it among the Terns (g.v.).

Though the various forms here spoken of as Plovers are almost certainly closely allied, they must be regarded as constituting a very indefinite group, for hardly any strong line of demarcation can be drawn between them and the Sandpipers and Snipes (<pv.'). United, however, with both of the latter, under the name of Limicolae, after the method approved by the most recent systematists, the whole form an assemblage the compactness of which no observant ornithologist can hesitate to admit, even if he be not inclined to treat as its nearest relations the Bustards on the one hand and the Gaviae on the other, as before suggested (Ornithology, vol. xviii. p. 45).
