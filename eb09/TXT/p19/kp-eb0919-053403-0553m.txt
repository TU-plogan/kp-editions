PORTSMOUTH, a municipal and parliamentary borough, seaport, and naval station of Hampshire, England, consists of an aggregate of towns situated in the south-western corner of Portsea Island, opposite the Isle of Wight, 18 miles south by east of Southampton and 74 south-west of London by the London and South-Western Railway. For the general position of Portsmouth, see plate VII. vol. xi. The original town is not now nearly so populous as the suburbs comprised in the general name of Portsea (including Portsea proper) on the north and west, Landport on the north, and Southsea on the east. Portsmouth proper is the barrack and garrison town; at Portsea is situated the great naval dockyard; Landport is occupied chiefly by the houses of artisans; and Southsea, as possessing facilities for bathing, is resided in by the wealthier classes. The old High Street of Portsmouth, which is now continuous with the Commercial Road from the Landport side, forms a spacious and busy central thoroughfare 2 miles in length, with numerous fine buildings, including the new and old post-office, the new offices of the Waterworks Company and Gas Company, the Central or Town Railway station, the new Government House with its pleasuregrounds, the quaint old building occupied by the new free library, and the grammar-school, which was founded in 1732, though the new building was opened in 1879. Since the demolition of the ancient ramparts and unwholesome moats a few years ago there have sprung up a handsome people’s park and recreation grounds for the naval and military forces, and improvements are still being vigorously carried forward. Much of the Government work has been done by convict labour, notably at the north-east of Landport, where 1300 convicts have been engaged in the formation of a new island (Whale Island), on which gunnery experiments are carried out in connexion with the training-ships of the gunnery school. The towns constitute one of the strongest fortresses of the kingdom, being protected by a chain of detached forts, the outer line of which on the land side north of the harbour extends along the Portsdown Ridge, the inner line protecting the approach by Stokes Bay and Gosport on the west side, while eastwards are the Hilsea lines, within which are also the Royal Artillery and cavalry barracks of Hilsea and the powder-magazine of Tipner. On the south side the forts are built in the sea, each being provided with an Artesian well sunk into the seabed, from which a plentiful supply of fresh water can at all times be obtained. The coast to the eastward is lined by the forts of “Cumberland” and “Southsea Castle,” which complete the circle. There are 8 barracks—5 in Portsmouth, 1 in Southsea, and 2 in Portsea—and at Eastney are the extensive buildings which constitute the headquarters of the Royal Marine Artillery; on the Gosport side of the harbour are those of the Portsmouth division of the Royal Marines. In the church of St Thomas a Becket (12th cent.) the chancel and transepts form part of the original structure; the nave and tower were erected in 1698. The garrison chapel near the grand parade, in the Early English style, formed originally a portion of the hospital of St Nicholas (1212), and was restored in 1866. Among more recent buildings may be mentioned the new jail and county lunatic asylum, both situated on the outskirts. In the centre of the town and adjoining the people’s park are the new cathedral and buildings of the Roman Catholic schools, the new Presbyterian church, the seamen and marines orphan schools, the offices of the board of guardians and the borough overseers. At Portsea a new railway station has been [9:19:535] built on piles driven into the harbour bed. Besides these, amongst other public buildings may be mentioned the town-hall, the county court, and the theatre. At Portsea is Aria College, opened in 1874 for the training of Jewish ministers. In the same town is situated the convict prison, which superseded the hulks in 1852. Landport has a freemasons’ hall (1879-80), and a people’s park of eight acres opened in 1878. Southsea, which is only of recent origin, possesses assembly-rooms and baths, a pier (1879), and a fine esplanade 2 miles in length. Southsea Castle, built by Henry VIII., was taken by the Parliamentary forces in 1642 and partly dismantled, but it has now been refortified. The creek which formerly separated Portsmouth and Portsea was filled up in 1876.

The port of Portsmouth extends eastwards 9 miles to Emsworth, and westwards 5 miles to Hill Head at the entrance to Southampton Water. About 3 miles to the south of the harbour is the well-known anchorage of Spithead, protected by the Isle of Wight. The harbour, one of the best in the kingdom, stretches 4 miles inwards to the north-west of the town, with an entrance 220 yards in breadth, permitting access to vessels of the largest tonnage at low tide. There is an anchorage within the basin at low tide of 380 acres, and a portion of the harbour is permanently occupied by dismantled vessels and the reserved fleet of the navy. There is a graving-dock built by the corporation, with 18 feet of water on the blocks, and a patent slip. Extending along the eastern shore are the ordnance gun wharf between Portsmouth and Portsea and to the north of it the great naval Government dockyard, which has lately been much enlarged (see Dockyard, vol. vii. 313). At Gosport (7.v.)are the royal Clarence victualling yard and the Haslar hospital. Portsmouth has a considerable trade in coal, timber, fruits, and agricultural produce. In 1883 the total number of vessels that entered the port from British and foreign possessions and coastwise was 2094 of 210,210 tons burden, the number that cleared 2079 of 216,926 tons. The borough of Portsmouth is governed by a mayor, fourteen aidermen, and forty-two councillors. The area of the borough is 4320 acres, with a population in 1871 of 113,569, and in 1881 of 127,989. Of the latter number 120,022 were included in Portsea.

To the north of Portsmouth harbour is Porchester Castle, a ruined Norman fortress occupying the site of the Portus Magnus of the Romans. The Saxon Chronicle mentions the arrival of Port and his two sons on the coast in 501, but the derivation of the name Portsmouth is too evident to require a mythical invention to explain it. Portsmouth, though a small town soon after the Norman invasion, did not possess a church till 1140. It received its first charter from Richard I. In the beginning of the 13th century it had grown to be a naval station of some importance, and for the accommodation of the king’s galleys the docks were enclosed by a strong wall. A large portion of the town was burned by the French in 1372. Great additions were made to the fortifications by Edward IV., and the works were continued by later sovereigns, especially Elizabeth and James II. Its importance as a naval dockyard commences about 1544. The English fleet assembled at Portsmouth in 1545 before the naval engagement with the French off Spithead. In 1628 Villiers, duke of Buckingham, when on the point of embarking at Portsmouth with the army for the relief of Rochelle, was killed by Felton. The town was taken by the Parliamentary forces in 1642. In 1662 the nuptials of Charles II. with Catherine of Braganza were celebrated at Portsmouth in the chapel of the garrison. In 1782 the “Royal George,” with Admiral Kem-penfeldt on board, having been careened to stop a leak, went down in the harbour. About 1792 Portsea began to be built on the common to the north of the town. Among eminent persons connected with the town mention may be made of Charles Dickens, Jonas Hanway, Sir Isambard Brunel, Sir F. Malden.
