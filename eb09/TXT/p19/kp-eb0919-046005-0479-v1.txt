POOLE, Matthew (1624-1679), author of a learned though now almost wholly antiquated Synopsis Criticorum Biblicorum, was born at York in 1624, was educated at Emmanuel College, Cambridge, and from 1648 till the passing of the Act of Uniformity held the rectory of St Mary le Querne, London. Subsequent troubles led to his withdrawal to Holland. He died at Amsterdam in 1679.

Besides the work with which his name is principally associated (Synopsis Criticorum Biblicorum, 5 vols, fol., 1669-76), he wrote Annotations on the Holy Bible, as far as to Isa. lviii.; the work was subsequently completed by several of his Nonconformist brethren, and published in 2 vols. fol. in 1683. He was also the author of numerous controversial tracts.
