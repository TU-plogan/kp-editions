PROTOGENES, a Greek painter, born in Caunus on the coast of Caria, but resident in Rhodes during the latter half of the 4th century b.c., was celebrated for the minute and laborious finish which he bestowed on his pictures, both in drawing and in colour. Apelles, his great rival, standing astonished in presence of one of these works, could only console himself that he knew when to stop whereas Protogenes did not. So also Petronius (Satyr., 83) experienced a sensation of horror at the too vivid realization of nature in which Protogenes indulged. On one picture, the Ialysus, he spent seven years; on another, the Satyr, he worked continuously during the [9:19:828] siege of Rhodes by Demetrius Poliorcetes (305-4 b.c.) notwithstanding that the garden in which he painted was in the middle of the enemyâ€™s camp. Demetrius unsolicited took measures for his safety; more than that, when told that the Ialysus just mentioned was in a part of the town exposed to assault, Demetrius changed his plan of operations. Possibly the slowness and laboriousness of the work of Protogenes was due partly to a want of training in his youth. .He appears to have been self-taught; some said that he had begun life as a ship-painter, and, though the painting of certain small figures of ships in a picture of his in Athens, however excellent it may have been, can hardly be held to confirm this account of his youth, it does not on the other hand render the account unreliable. It may have been due also to a want of early training that he found so much difficulty in rendering the foam at the mouth of a dog which occurred in the picture of Ialysus. Angry at his many failures, he dashed the sponge wet with the white colour which he had just wiped off at the mouth of the dog. The result was a perfectly successful foam. Ialysus was a local hero, the founder of the town of the same name in the island of Rhodes, and probably he was represented as a huntsman. The picture was still in Rhodes in the time of Cicero, but was afterwards removed to Rome, where it perished in the burning of the temple of Peace. On another occasion Protogenes seems to have used his sponge with a different effect. The picture painted during the siege of Rhodes consisted of a satyr leaning idly against a pillar on which was a figure of a partridge so life-like that ordinary spectators saw nothing but it. Enraged on this account, the painter wiped out the partridge. The Satyr must have been one of his last works. He would then be about seventy years of age, and had enjoyed for about twenty years a reputation next only to that of Apelles, his friend and benefactor. Both were finished colourists so far as the fresco-painting of their day permitted, and both were laborious in the practice of drawing, doubtless with the view to obtaining bold effects of perspective as well as fineness of outline. It was an illustration of this practice when Apelles, finding in the house of Protogenes a large panel ready prepared for a picture,, drew upon it with a brush a very fine line which he said would tell sufficiently who had called. Protogenes on his return home took a brush with a different colour and drew a still finer line along that of Apelles dividing it in two. Apelles called again; and, thus challenged, drew with a third colour another line within that of Protogenes, who then admitted himself surpassed. This panel was seen by Pliny (A r .Zf., xxxv. 83) in Rome, where it was much admired, and where it perished by fire. In the gallery of the Propylaea at Athens was to be seen the panel by Protogenes in which occurred the figures of ships already mentioned. The subject consisted of two figures representing personifications of the coast of Attica, Paralus and Hammonias, to whom the presence of ships would be the more appropriate as the Athenians actually possessed two ships so named. For the council chamber at Athens he painted figures of the Thesmothetae, but in what form or character is not known. Probably these works were executed in Athens, and it may have been then that he met Aristotle, who recommended him to take for subjects the deeds of Alexander the Great. In his Alexander and Pan he may have followed that advice in the idealizing spirit to which he was accustomed. To this spirit must be traced also his Cydippe and Tlepolemus, legendary personages of Rhodes. Among his portraits are mentioned those of the mother of Aristotle, Philiscus the tragic poet, and King Antigonus. But Protogenes was also a sculptor to some extent, and made several bronze statues of athletes, armed figures, huntsmen, and persons in the act of offering sacrifices.
