POLYHISTOR, Cornelius Alexander, a Milesian and disciple of Crates,^[1. From the scholiast on Apoll. Rh., i. 925, it would appear that Polyhistor was a Milesian only by education, for here the Carian Chersonese is named as his birthplace. The dates seem to show that he was not a personal disciple of Crates. ] who through the fortune of war became the slave and afterwards the freedman of Cornelius Lentulus (Suidas). He received the Roman citizenship from Sulla (Servius on Aen. x. 388), and wrote an enormous number of books on historical and geographical subjects, of which more than a hundred and fifty fragments have been collected (MÃ¼ller, Fr. Hist. Gr., iii. 206 sq.~). His account of the doctrines of Pythagoras has been largely drawn from by Diogenes Laertius, but the most interesting of the fragments refer to the history of the Jews, for which Alexander drew on historical and poetical works of Jewish and Samaritan Hellenists. What has been preserved on this subject, mainly by Eusebius in the Praeparatio Evantjelica, is sufficient to throw a good deal of light, not particularly favourable, on the intellectual activity of the Hellenists of the 2d century B.c.

See J. Freudenthal, Hellenistische Studien, i. ii. (Breslau, 1875), in which the subject of the sources of Polyhistor is fully discussed.
