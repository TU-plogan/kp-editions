PRESBYTER. Towards the end of the 2d century the organization of the Christian congregations throughout the Roman empire, at least of all the greater ones, was identical. At the head of each was the bishop, whose function it was to conduct public worship, control the church funds, and keep watch over the manners of his flock. The free prophets and teachers having almost everywhere died out, the duty of religious instruction and edification also fell on him. In conducting the worship and in ministering to the wants of the poor he was assisted by the deacons as his subordinates. The presbyters formed a college, whose business was that of advising the bishop. Of this college he was the president, and as such he was himself a presbyter, and conversely the presbytery, inclusive of the bishop, formed the governing body of the community.^[1. Tertull., Apol., 39: “Praesident probati quique seniores, honorem istum non pretio sed testimonio adepti.”] Outside of »the presbytery the individual presbyter as such had no definite official duties. If he baptized, celebrated the eucharist, preached, or the like, this was only as commissioned and deputed by the bishop.^[2. Tertull., De Bapt., 17: “Baptismi dandi habet jus summus sacerdos, qui est episcopus; dehinc presbyteri . . . non tamen sine episcopi auctoritate.” In the oldest constitution of the Catholic Church which has come down to us relating to presbyters a regular service of some presbyters in public worship is indeed presupposed { ∖ iavbves iκκ ∖ η∙ σιaστ. τ. ày. άττοστόΧοιν, c. 18), but this fact is unique of its kind.] Such deputation was frequently necessary, and therefore the presbyter behoved as far as possible to be qualified to teach. As member of the college, which before everything had to do with jurisdiction and discipline, it was required of him that he should be of blameless life, that he should administer just judgment without respect of persons, and that in private life also he should as occasion offered exhort and admonish the faithful and set before them the law of God. The presbyters, who as a rule were expected to be men of advanced years, were, like the bishop and the deacons, chosen by the congregation. Their number was unrestricted, but there were small communities in which they did not exceed three or even two. In rank they were above the deacons, but below the bishop, yet in such a way that the bishop could call them his “co-presbyters.”^[3. Compare the regulations laid down in the Arabic text of the Canones Hippolyti (c. 4): “At the ordination of a presbyter everything is to be done as in the case of a bishop, save that he does not seat himself upon the throne. The same prayer also shall be said as for a bishop, the name of bishop only being left out. The presbj·ter shall in all things be equal with the bishop save in the matters,of presiding and ordaining, for the power to ordain is not given him.”] As the bishop was not unfrequently chosen from among the deacons, even although in many congregations it may have been the case that the office was invariably bestowed on presbyters, and as the deacons stood in closer personal relation with the bishop than the presbyters, cases of invasion of the rights of the latter by the former began to occur from an early period. There can be no doubt that at the end of the 2d century all presbyters were elected office-bearers, but the way in which Irenaeus speaks makes it quite clear that at an earlier date “presbyter” was also a title of honour borne by worthy and prominent persons in the congregations, who, in virtue of their advanced years, were witnesses for the purity of tradition. Irenaeus, frequently speaking (as he does) of bishops simply as “presbyters/’ also proves that there must have been a time in which the bishop as member of the “synedrium” of the church cannot have held a higher position than the other members of this college.

Tracing the history upwards from Irenaeus, we find in the Epistles of Ignatius, which may be assigned perhaps to about 140, the presbyters holding essentially the same [9:19:675] position as they have at the end of the century. With Ignatius also the presbyters come into account only as a college; according to him they constitute a senate, as it were; he compares them to the college of the apostles, but gives great prominence to their subordination under the bishop, whom he likens to our Lord Himself. Except in the Ignatian Epistles, however, one finds the presbyters holding a different position within the Christian communities of the period from 90 to 140. This is not at all surprising, for there was not at that time any rigid and uniform organization of the congregations at all; as yet no one bishop stood at the head of each congregation, and as yet the church constitution was not determined by the idea of office alone, that of charismata (spiritual gifts) still having wide scope alongside of the other. Church organization was still influenced by a variety of ways of looking at the question—ways which sometimes crossed each other, and from the combination of which it cannot be doubted that a variety of constitutions resulted. We are not in a position to give a complete view of these, the historical material being insufficient, but points of leading importance can be established. Before all it is of consequence to recognize that in the congregations a threefold organization had place. (1) The duty of edifying and of preaching the gospel was not yet attached to an office but to a charisma. “Service in the word” was the business of apostles, prophets, and teachers who had been awakened by the Spirit and by the Spirit endowed. These were the iγγovμevoι in the congregations; they alone in the first instance form the class of persons entitled to honour in Christendom; they never belonged to any one congregation exclusively, but were held to be “organs of the Spirit,” given by God to the whole church. (2) In so far as each local church embraced a system of higher and lower functions—each was indeed a little world to itself—it possessed a governing body (οικονόμοι). For the care of the poor, for worship, for correspondence,—in a word, for its “economy,” in the widest sense of that word, the congregation needed controlling officials. These were the bishop and the deacons,—the former for higher, the latter for inferior services; they owed their official position to the congregation, and in the nature of their offices there was, strictly speaking, nothing which could have laid the foundation of any special rank or exaltation. Many of the functions discharged by them nevertheless had the result of making the post of a bishop a very influential one (charge of the worship, control of the funds), and in so far as their service rested upon a charisma (χάρισμα ττ}ς αpτιλιj∕zι∕'∈ωs) a certain inner relation between them and the teachers endowed with the gift of the Spirit was established. (3) In so far as the individual congregation was an actual organism in which the varieties of age, of sex, of experience, of manner of life, and of ethical culture continued to exist and which had to be admonished, disciplined, and heeded, it from the nature of the case divided itself into leaders and led, a distinction which would assert itself in every sphere of the congregation’s activities. The leaders were, as might be expected, the “elders” (oi πpeσ-βυτepoι), or, so to speak, the patrons; the led were the “younger” members (oi veωτερoι). Out of this distinction arose equally naturally—for it was impossible for all the ‘‘elders” to take part in the conduct of affairs—the separation of an elected ruling college (oi 7rpe<ry0υr∈poι oi πpoισ-τaμevoι) from the πλήθος (plebs, λαό?). Thus an “order” (ordo) arose, placed over the congregation by the congregation itself.^[4. Tertull., De exhort, cast., 7: “Differentiam inter ordinem et plebem constituit ecclesiae auctoritas et honor per ordinis consessum εanctificatus.”] To the presbyters belonged a τιμτ) καθήκουσα, —that is to say, the honour which naturallv came from their position in life. In some congregations it may have been long before the elders were chosen, in others this may have come very soon; in some the sphere of the competency of the presbyters and patrons may have been quite indefinite and in others more precise. In some congregations, lastly, as in those of Asia Minor, the presbyters may have enjoyed particular honour for the special reason that they had known apostles or disciples of apostles personally;^[5. Compare what is said by Papias, Irenaeus, and also by Clement of Alexandria.] in the majority of congregations this was not the case. With the congregational administration, properly so called, in any case, they had nothing to do.

We may call the first-named organization the spiritual, the second the administrative, the third the patriarchal. It is obvious that from the first it was impossible they should coexist side by side without coming into contact. Here two facts are of the highest importance. (1) If in any congregation prophets and teachers were wanting, then the administrative officials charged themselves with their function.^[6. See ∆ιδαχ⅛ των αποστόλων, 15. According to 1 Tim. v. 17 those presbyters are to be counted worthy of special honour ol κoπιωvτes iv λoγ⅛> καί διδασκαλία. But this makes it plain that the presbyters were under no obligation to teach.] (2) The bishops had as such a seat and a voice in the presbyters’ college; every bishop was at the same time a presbyter, whether old or young, but every presbyter was not necessarily also a bishop. In many communities, indeed—as, for example, at Philippi,^[7. Polyc., Ad Philipp., 5, 6, 11.] at Ephesus,^[8. Tim. and Acts xx. 17, 28.] and in Crete^[9. Ep. to Titus.] —all the presbyters may possibly also have been bishops, although this is by no means certain; but in other cases—as, for example, in that of Rome, as we learn from the Pastor of Hermas— all presbyters were not also bishops. Thus it is not the case that originally the bishops were simply identical with the presbyters, and that the one bishop was a gradual development out of the presbyters’ college; on the contrary, the attributes of presbyters and bishops were originally distinct. But, since the bishops had a seat and a voice in the college and exercised special functions of importance besides, they ultimately acquired a higher place.

The office of presbyter was not during the oldest period (90-140) a spiritual one. The apostle,, the prophet, the teacher, in a certain sense also even the old bishop and deacon, had a spiritual character, for they possessed a charisma. It was not so with the presbyters; they had no charisma, and the respect in which they were held arose out of the natural position which they took within the congregations. Hence the newly-discovered Διδαχή των αποστόλων has nothing to say at all about presbyters, but only about apostles, prophets, teachers, bishops, and deacons. The design of that writing was to give those institutions of the apostles which are peculiar to the Christian community. The system of leaders and led is, however, a matter of order; it does not depend upon the special Christian charismata, and therefore does not impart to the Christian community its peculiar character. But, on the other hand, that the community is God’s building is shown by such marks as these, that the apostles spread the gospel by their inspired preaching, that prophets and teachers edify the churches, that everywhere bishops and deacons are found at work in the churches, endowed with the gift of government and of loving service. Other communities also—towns, temples, synagogues, and the like—have presbyters, but they have no persons endowed with the gift of the Spirit. A sure proof of the correctness of the view just given is found in the circumstance that before the time of Domitian we do not [9:19:676] possess in Christian literature a single sure testimony to the existence of presbyters. In the genuine epistles of St Paul and in the Epistle to the Hebrews they are not mentioned. In 1 Cor. xii. 28 Paul says that God has given to the church apostles, prophets, teachers, miracles, gifts of healing, help, government; but of presbyters he has not a word to say. Even from passages where he is speaking of the jurisdiction of the congregation—as, for example, in 1 Cor. v., vi.—the presbyters are absent, while in Phil. i. 1 it is the bishops and deacons that he mentions. In the Epistle of James, in the First Epistle of Peter, in the Acts of the Apostles, and in the pastoral epistles the presbyters certainly occur, but no one is able to show that any of these writings are earlier than the age of Domitian. Even Clement of Rome (Ad Cor., 42, 4) does not say that the apostles had appointed presbyters in the congregation; he speaks only of bishops and deacons. For this very reason is the statement in Acts xiv. 23 to be looked upon with suspicion. It would be much too precipitate to assert that before the time of Domitian there were no presbyters in the Christian churches; on the contrary, it may be assumed that the distinction between “elder” and “younger” would not fail from the very first to assert itself in these communities, organized as they were so largely on the model of the family. But in this there is no reason for assigning any special importance to the distinction. Out of it there grew very gradually a special rank and gradually the presbyters had assigned to them definite functions; or, in other words, the functions which they had exercised from the first, of exhorting, rebuking, superintending, became recognized ecclesiastical duties and privileges. There is accordingly no need for answering the question whether the Christian “elder” is akin to the Jewish or to any kind of heathen “elder.” This, however, can well be affirmed, that the pattern of the civic senates was not without its influence upon the later development of the presbyterate. As for the communities of Jewish Christians, we know nothing certain about their constitution, and are therefore unable to say anything definite about their presbyters.
