PONTUS DE TYARD (c. 1521-1605), one of the famous Pleiade who helped to reform French literature in the 16th century, was the highest in rank and the most affluent in fortune of the seven. He was indeed in some sort an anticipator of Ronsard and Du Bellay, for his Erreurs Amoureuses preceded their work. He was seigneur of Bissy in Burgundy, was born at the seignorial house in [9:19:460] or about 1521, and died at a great age at Bragny on the Saône, another seat of his, on September 25, 1605. He was thus the last survivor as well as one of the eldest of the group. His early poems, the Erreurs Amoureuses, originally published in 1549, were augmented with other works in successive editions till 1573. Pontus de Tyard published Discours Philosophiques in 1587, and appears to have been a man of extensive knowledge and just thought. He was, moreover, a courtier and official of some standing for many years, and, entering the church, was made countbishop of Châlon-sur-Saône. In this high position he bore a character for political and religious moderation. On the whole his poetry is inferior to that of his companions, but he was one of the first to write sonnets in French (the actual priority belongs to Mellin de St Gelais); and one of these, the beautiful Sonnet to Sleep (it has been noted that the poetical name of his mistress in the Erreurs is, oddly enough, Pasithea, the name of the nymph beloved classically by the god of sleep), is a very notable and famous piece. It is also said that Pontus de Tyard introduced the sestine into France, or rather reintroduced it, for it is originally a Provençal invention.
