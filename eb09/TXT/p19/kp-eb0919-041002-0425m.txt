POLTAVA, capital of the above government, stands on the right bank of the Vorskla, 88 miles by rail to the west-south-west of Kharkoff. The town is built on a plateau which descends by steep slopes nearly on all sides; the buildings are separated by large yards and gardens. Several suburbs, inhabited by Cossacks, whose houses are buried amid gardens, and a German colony, surround the town. Water is scarce, and has to be brought a long distance, from the marshy Vorskla. The oldest buildings are the Krestovozdvijenskiy monastery, erected in 1650, and a wooden church visited by Peter I. after the battle of Poltava. There are two lyceums for boys and girls, a “realschule,” a military school for cadets, a theological seminary, and two girls’ colleges, besides Russian, German, and Jewish primary schools. The manufactures are insignificant (£58,000 in 1879); the principal are tobacco works (£27,500) and a [9:19:411]

tannery (£14,400). The trade derives its importance from the four fairs that are held at Poltava. The chief of these, in July (noticed above), is visited by 30,000 to 40,000 people. In 1881 the population was 41,050.

Poltava is mentioned in Russian annals in 1174, under the name of Ltava, but does not again appear in history until 1430, when, together with Glinsk, it was given by Gedymin to the Tartar prince .Leksada. Under Bogdan Khmyelnitzkii it was the chief town of the Poltava “regiment.” Peter I. defeated Charles XII. in the immediate neighbourhood on June 27, 1709.
