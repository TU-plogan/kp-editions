POCHARD, Pocκ Ard, or Poker, ^[1. The derivation of these words, in the first of which the ch is pronounced hard, and the o in all of them generally long, is very uncertain. Cotgrave has Pocheculieτ, which he renders “Shoueler,” now· a-days the name of a kind of Duck, but in his time meaning the bird we commonly call Spoonbill (q.υ.). Littré gives Pochard as a popular French word signifying drunkard. That this word would in the ordinary way become the English Pochard or Poker may be regarded as certain; but then it is not known to be used in French as a bird's name. ] names properly belonging to the male of a species of Duck (the female of which is known as the Dunbird), the Anas ferina of Linnaeus, and Fuligula or Aethyia ferina of later ornithologists—but names very often applied by writers in a general way to most of the group or Subfamily Fuligulinae, commonly called Diving or Sea-Ducks (cf. Duck, vii. p. 505). The Pochard in full plumage is a very handsome bird, with a coppery-red head, on the sides of which sparkle the ruby irides of his eyes, relieved by the greyish-blue of the basal half of his broad bill, and the deep black of his gorget, while his back and flanks appear of a light grey, being really of a dull white closely barred by fine undulating black lines. The tail-coverts both above and below are black, the quill feathers brownish-black, and the lower surface of a dull white. The Dunbird has the head and neck reddish-brown, with ill-defined whitish patches on the cheeks and chin, the back and upper tail-coverts dull brown, and the rest of the plumage, except the lower tail-coverts, which are brownish-grey, much as in the Pochard. This species is very abundant in many parts of Europe, northern Asia, and North America, generally frequenting in winter the larger open waters, and extending its migrations to Barbary and Egypt, but in summer retiring northward and inland to breed, and is one that certainly seems to have profited by the legislative protection lately afforded to it in Britain, for, whereas during many years it had but a single habitual breeding-place left in England, it is now known to have several, to some of which it resorts in no inconsiderable numbers. American examples seem to be slightly larger and somewhat darker in colour, and hence by some writers have been regarded as specifically distinct under the name of Fuligula americana; but America has a perfectly distinct though allied species in the celebrated Canvas-back Duck, F. vallisneriana, a much larger bird, with a longer, higher, and narrower bill, which has no blue at the base, and, though the plumage of both, especially in the females, is very similar, the male Canvas-back has a darker head, and the black lines on the back and flanks are much broken up and further asunder, so that the effect is to give these parts a much lighter colour, and from this has arisen the bird’s common though fanciful name. Its scientific epithet is derived from the freshwater plant, a species of Vallisneria, usually known as “wild celery,” from feeding on which its flesh is believed to acquire the delicate flavour that is held in so great a repute. The Pochard and Dunbird, however, in Europe are in much request for the table (as the German name of the species, Tafelente, testifies), though their quality in this respect depends almost wholly on the food they have been eating, for birds killed on the sea-coast are so rank as to be almost worthless, while those that have been frequenting fresh water are generally well-tasted.^[2. The plant known in some parts of England as “willow-weed — not to be confounded, as is done by some writers, with the willowwort (Epilobiuni)— one of the many species of Polygonum, is especially a favourite food with most kinds of Ducks, and to its effects is attributed much of the fine flavour which distinguishes the birds that have had access to it. ]

Among other species nearly allied to the Pochard that frequent the northern hemisphere may be mentioned the Scaup-Duck, F. marila, with its American representative F. affinis, in both of which the male has the head black, glossed with blue or green; but these are nearly always uneatable from the nature of their food, which is mostly gathered at low tide on the “scaups” or “scalps,”^[3. Cognate with scallop, and the Dutch schelp, a shell. ] —as the banks on which mussels and other marine molluscs grow are in many places termed. Then there are the Tufted Duck, F. cristata — black with a crest and white flanks—and its American equivalent F. collaris, and the White-eyed or Castaneous Duck, F. nyroca, and the Red-crested Duck, F. rτιfina- both peculiar to the Old World, and the last, conspicuous for its red bill and legs, well known in India. In the southern hemisphere the genus is represented by three species, F. capensis, F. australis, and F. novae-zealandioe, whose respective names indicate the country each inhabits, and in South America exists a somewhat divergent form which has been placed in a distinct genus as Metopiana peposaca.

Generally classed with the Fuligidinae is the small group known as the Eiders,^[4. Icelandic, Aedur. ] which differ from them in several respects: the bulb at the base of the trachea in the male, so largely developed in the members of the genus Fuligula, and of conformation so similar in all of them, is here much smaller and wholly of bone; the males take a much longer time, two or even three years, to attain their full plumage, and some of the feathers on the head, when that plumage is completed, are always stiff, glistening, and of a peculiar pale-green colour. This little group of hardly more than half a dozen species may be fairly considered to form a separate genus under the name of Somateria. Many authors indeed have—unjustifiably, as it seems to the present writer—broken it up into three or four genera. The well-known Eider, 8. mollissima, is the largest of this group, and, beautiful as it is, is excelled in beauty by the King-Duck, 8. spectabilis, and the little »S'. stelleri. Space fails here to treat of the rest, but the sad fate which has overtaken one of them, 8. labradoria, has been before mentioned (Birds, vol. iii. p. 735); and only the briefest notice can be taken of a most interesting form generally, but obviously in error, placed among them. This is the Logger-head, Racehorse, or Steamer-Duck, Microptcrus (or more properly Tachycrcs) cinereus of the Falkland Islands and Straits of Magellan—nearly as large as a tame Goose, and subject to the, so far as known, unique peculiarity of losing its power of flight after reaching maturity. Its habits have been well described by Darwin in his Journal of Researches, and its anatomy is the subject of an excellent paper in the Zoological Society’s Transactions (vii., pp. 493-501, pls. IviiL-lxii.) by Prof. R. 0. Cunningham. (A. N.)
