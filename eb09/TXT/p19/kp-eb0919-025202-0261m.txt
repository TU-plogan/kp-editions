POCOCK, Edward (1604-1691), one of the most eminent of English Oriental and Biblical scholars, was born in 1604, the son of a Berkshire clergyman, and received his education up to his fourteenth year at the free school of Tame in Oxfordshire and then at Oxford, where he became scholar of Corpus Christi College in 1620 and fellow in 1628. The foundation of his Eastern learning was laid at Oxford under Matthias Pasor, son of the better [9:19:253] known George Pasor, who had been driven to England by the troubles in the Palatinate, and he subsequently received instruction from the learned W. Bedwell. The first fruit of his studies was an edition from a Bodleian MS. of the four New Testament epistles which were not in the old Syriac canon, and were not contained in European editions of the Peshito. This was published at Leyden at the instigation of G. Vossius in 1630, and in the same year Pocock sailed for Aleppo as chaplain to the English factory. At Aleppo he made himself a profound Arabic scholar and collected many valuable MSS. At this time Laud was busy with the learned collections with which he afterwards enriched his university, and Pocock became known to him as one who could help his schemes. A correspondence ensued, and ultimately Laud resolved to set up an Arabic chair at Oxford and to invite Pocock home to fill it. The invitation was accepted, and the lecturer entered on his duties on August 10, 1636, but next summer sailed again for Constantinople with the archbishop’s consent to prosecute further studies and collect more books, and remained there for about three years. When he returned to England Laud was in the Tower; and, though he had taken the precaution to place the Arabic chair on a permanent footing, a time soon followed in which to have been a protege of the archbishop was a dangerous distinction. Pocock does not seem to have been an extreme churchman or to have meddled actively in politics, but his views were decided enough to make him objectionable to the Parliamentary party, and to bring on him many troubles not only at Oxford but in his parish of Childrey, where he accepted a college living in 1643. On the other hand his rare scholarship and personal qualities raised him up influential friends even among men of the opposite party in church and state, foremost among these being Selden. Through the offices of these friends he was even advanced in 1648 to the chair of Hebrew, though as he could not take the engagement of 1649 he lost the emoluments of the place very soon after, and did not recover them till the Restoration. All these cares seriously hampered Pocock in his studies, as he complains in the preface to his Eutychius; he seems to have felt most deeply the attempts to remove him from Childrey, where he attended to his parochial work with the same modest and diligent zeal that marks him as a scholar. But he continued to work hard; in 1649 he published the Specimen Historiae Arabum, that is, a short account of the origin and manners of the Arabs, taken from Barhebraeus (Abulfaraj), with a mass of learned notes from a vast number of MS. sources which are still highly valuable to the student of Oriental history. This was followed in 1655 by the Porta Mosis, extracts from the Arabic commentary of Maimonides on the Mishna, with translation and very learned notes;^[1. Pocock was justly impressed with the fact that the best parts of Rabbinic literature belong to the Jews who wrote in Arabic. ] and in 1656 by the annals of Eutychius in Arabic and Latin, a work of great value which has not found an editor since. He also gave active assistance to Walton’s polyglott, and the preface to the various readings of the Arabic Pentateuch is from his hand. After the Restoration Pocock’s political and pecuniary troubles were removed, but the reception of his complete edition of the Arabic history of Barhebraeus (Greg. Abulfaragii Historia Dynastiarum), which he dedicated to the king in 1663, showed that the new order of things was not very favourable to profound scholarship. After this his most important works were his English commentaries on Micah (1677), Malachi (1677), Hosea (1685), Joel (1691),—admirable in every way, and still thoroughly worth reading. An Arabic translation of Grotius De Veritate which appeared in 1660 may also be mentioned as a proof of Pocock’s interest in the propagation of Christianity in the East. This was an old plan which he had talked over with Grotius at Paris on his way back from Constantinople.

Pocock married in 1646 and died in 1691. One of his sons, Edward, published several contributions to Arabic literature—a fragment of Abdullatif’s description of Egypt and the Philosophus Autodidactus of Ibn Tofail.

The theological works of Pocock were collected in 2 vols, folio, in 1740, with a tedious but curious account of his life and writings by L. Twells.
