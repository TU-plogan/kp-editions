PRAeNESTE (now Palestrina), a very ancient city of Latium, lies 22 miles east of Rome on a spur of the Apennines facing the Alban Hills. To the natural strength of the place and its commanding situation Praeneste owed in large measure its historical importance. The local tradition (adopted by Virgil) named Caeculus, son of Vulcan, as founder. From the remains of Cyclopean masonry and other indications the foundation of the city has been referred to the 8th century b.c., and objects in metal and ivory discovered in the earliest graves prove that as early as this or the following century Praeneste had reached a considerable degree of civilization and stood in commercial relations not only with Etruria but with the East. At this time the city was probably under the hegemony of Alba Longa, then the head of the Latin League. In 499, according to Livy, Praeneste withdrew from the Latin League and formed an alliance with Rome, but this statement seems irreconcilable with a passage in Dionysius Halicarnensis {Ant. Rom., v. 61). After Rome had been weakened by the Gallic invasion (390), Praeneste joined its foes in a long struggle with Rome. The struggle culminated in the great Latin War (340-338), in which the Romans were victorious, and Praeneste was punished for its share in the war by the loss of part of its territory. It was not, however, like the other Latin cities, embodied in the Roman state, but continued in the position of a city in alliance with Rome down to the Social War, when it, like the rest of Italy, received the Roman franchise (90 or 89). As an allied city it furnished contingents to the Roman army and possessed the right of exile {jus exilii), i.e., persons banished from Rome were allowed to reside at Praeneste. To judge from the works of art and inscriptions of this period (338 to 90 b.c.), it must have been for the place a time of prosperity and even luxury. The nuts of Praeneste were famous and its roses were amongst the finest in Italy. The Latin spoken at Praeneste was somewhat peculiar.^[1. Thus the Praenestines shortened some words: they said conia for ciconia, tammodo for tantummodo (Plaut., Truc., iii. 2, 23; Id., Trinum.., iii. 1, 8; cp. Comment, on Festus, p. 731, ed. Lindemann), and inscriptions exhibit the forms Acmemeno and Tondrus for Aga memno and Tyndarus. They said nefrones for nefrendes in the sense of testiculi, and tongitio for notio (Festus, s.v. “nefrendes” and “tongere”). Cp. Quintilian, Instit., i. 5, 56. ] In the civil wars of Sulla the voumrer

Marius was blockaded in the town by the Sullans (82 b.c. ); and on its capture Marius slew himself, the male inhabitants were massacred in cold blood, and a military colony was settled on part of its territory. It was probably about this time that the city was extended from the hill to the plain and that the temple of Fortune was enlarged so as to include much of the space occupied by the ancient city. Under the empire Praeneste, from its elevated situation and cool salubrious air, became a favourite summer resort of the wealthy Romans, whose villas studded the neighbourhood. Horace ranked it with Tibur and Baiae, the Bath and Brighton of Rome. Augustus resorted thither; here Tiberius recovered from a dangerous illness, and here Hadrian built himself a villa. Antoninus erected a palace to the east of the town. Amongst private persons who owned villas at Praeneste were Pliny the younger and Symmachus.

But Praeneste was chiefly famed for its great temple of Fortune and for its oracle, in connexion with the temple, known as the “Praenestine lots” {sortes Praenestinae). As extended by Sulla the sanctuary of Fortune occupied a series of six vast terraces, which, resting on gigantic substructions of masonry and connected with each other by grand staircases, rose one above the other on the hill in the form of the side of a pyramid, crowned on the highest terrace by the round temple of Fortune proper. This immense edifice, probably by far the largest sanctuary in Italy, must have presented a most imposing aspect, visible as it was from a great part of Latium, from Rome, and even from the sea. The goddess Fortuna here went by the name of Primigenia (First-Born, but perhaps in an active sense First-Bearer); she was represented suckling two babes, said to be Jupiter and Juno, and she was especially worshipped by matrons.^[2. Hence Fernique {Étude sur Préneste') ingeniously conjectures that Fortuna was originally a goddess of maternity, and that the view of her functions as a goddess of chance was later, being due to the influence of Greek mythology, in which Chance (Tι'χ^) was a goddess. Fortuna contains the same root us ferre, “ to bear.” Fernique observes that the worship of Fortuna was often associated with that of Feronia. Statuettes in terra-cotta representing a woman with a child at her breast have been found at Praeneste. These are supposed by Fernique to be votive offerings, representing not the goddess but the mothers who offered them at the shrine in fulfilment of vows. Fortuna was sometimes represented in the form of two (or possibly more) females, so at Antium (Macrobius, Sat., i. 23, 13; Sueton., Cal., 57), and perhaps at Praeneste (Statius, Sylυ., i. 3, 80); in one of the Roman temples of Fortuna there was a mysterious veiled figure. Analogous to Fortuna in her double capacity as prophetess and patron of mothers was Carmenta, and she too was sometimes represented in double form (Ovid, Fasti, i. 617 sq. ; Aulus Gellius, xvi. 16). ] The oracle of the Praenestine lots was very ancient and continued to be consulted down to Christian times. Constantine and Theodosius forbade the practice and closed the temple. In 1297 the Colonna family who then owned Praeneste (Palestrina) revolted from the pope, but in the following year the town was taken and razed to the ground. In 1437 the city, which had been rebuilt, was captured by the papal general Cardinal Vitelleschi and once more utterly destroyed. It was rebuilt and fortified by Stefano Colonna in 1448. In 1630 it passed by purchase into the Barberini family. Praeneste was the native town of Aelian and in modern times of the great composer Palestrina.

The modern town of Palestrina, a collection of narrow and filthy alleys, stands on the terraces once occupied by the temple of Fortune. On the summit of the hill (2546 feet), nearly a mile from the town, stood the ancient citadel, the site of which is now occupied by a few poor houses (Castel San Pietro) and a ruined mediaeval castle of the Colonnas. The magnificent view embraces Soracte, Rome, the Alban Hills, and the Campagna as far as the sea. Considerable portions of the southern wall of the ancient citadel, built in very massive polygonal (Cyclopean) blocks of limestone, are still to be seen; and the two walls, also polygonal, which formerly united the citadel with the lower town, can still be traced. The ruins of the villa of Hadrian stand in the plain near the church of S. Maria [9:19:655] della Villa, about three-quarters of a mile from the town. Here was discovered the well-known statue of Antinous, now in the Vatican. Not far off was found in 1773 the calendar which, as Suetonius tells us, was set up by the grammarian Μ. Verrius Flaccus in the forum of Praeneste. Excavations made, especially since 1855, in the ancient necropolis, which lay on a plateau surrounded by valleys at the foot of the hill and of the town, have yielded important results for the history of the art and manufactures of Praeneste. Of the objects found in the oldest graves, and supposed to date from about the 7th century b,c., the cups of silver and silver gilt and most of the gold and amber jewellery are Phoenician (possibly Carthaginian), or at least made on Phoenician models; but the bronzes and some of the ivory articles seem to be Etruscan. No objects have been discovered belonging to the period intermediate between the 7th and 3d centuries B.c.; but the graves of the 3d and 2d centuries have yielded many precious relics, bronze caskets (cisiae), convex metal mirrors, strigils, &c. Among these is the famous Ficoroni casket, engraved with pictures of the arrival of the Argonauts in Bithynia and the victory of Pollux over Amycus. It was found in 1774. The inscriptions on the caskets are all Latin; those on the mirrors are mostly Etruscan; those on the strigils are Latin, Greek, and Etruscan. The Latin inscriptions seem to belong to the 3d century. On the whole it appears that between the 3d and 2d centuries there existed at Praeneste a native Latin art, which was, however, beginning to be affected by Greek art. Most of the objects discovered in the necropolis are preserved in the Roman collections, especially the Kircher Museum (which possesses the Ficoroni casket) and the Barberini Library. Besides these there is preserved in the Barberini Palace at Palestrina a large mosaic, considered one of the most important in existence. It was found on the site of the temple of Fortune and probably dates from the age of Augustus or Tiberius. It represents scenes from the Nile, with animals and figures in Egyptian and Greek costume.
