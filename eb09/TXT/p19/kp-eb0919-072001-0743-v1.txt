PRÉVOST-PARADOL, Lucien Anatole (1829*1870), a writer whose career, except in its unhappy end, was typical of the importance of journalism in France, was born at Paris on the 8th of August 1829. His mother was an actress; little is said of his father. He was educated at the Collège Bourbon, showed great brilliancy and precocity, and entered the École Normale. In 1855 he was appointed professor of French literature at Aix. He held the post, however, barely a year, resigning it to take up the pen of a leader-writer on the Journal des Débats. He also wrote in the Courrier du Dimanche, and for a very short time in the Presse. Even before his appointment at Aix he had produced a book, Revue de V Histoire Universelle (1854), and he continued to publish at short invervals, his chief work being a collection of essays on politics and literature, which appeared between 1859 and 1866, and some Essais sur les Moralistes Français (1864). He was, however, rather a journalist than a writer of books, and was one of the chief opponents of the empire on the side of moderate liberalism. He underwent the usual and popular difficulties of a journalist under that régime, and was once imprisoned. In 1865, at the extraordinarily early age of thirty-five, he was elected an Academician. He was twice a candidate for election to the Chamber, but failed each time. Three years later he visited England and was publicly entertained at Edinburgh, an entertainment which was the occasion of some rather undignified and very foolish contrasts drawn in the English press between the position of journalists in the two countries. The accession of Émile Ollivier to power was fatal to Prévost-Paradol. There is no reason for doubting that, in common with some of the best men in France, he believed in the possibility of a liberal empire, and he accepted the appointment of envoy to the United States. This was the signal for the most unmeasured attacks on him from the republican party. He had scarcely installed himself in his post before the outbreak of war between France and Prussia occurred. Either an exaggerated feeling of patriotism, or the disappointment of his hopes in the combined wisdom of Μ. Ollivier and the emperor, or (as his enemies said) remorse at having betrayed his party for nothing, or more probably the action of startling news on an excitable temperament and a mind weakened and irritated by the personal invectives to which he had been subject, threw his intellect and will out of gear. He committed suicide at New York on 20th July 1870. Prévost-Paradol was not in any sense a strong man, and, except for his tragic end, his name is not very likely to live either in literature or politics. His style was light and facile, but at the same time flimsy, and his thoughts were rarely profound. But he had for a time “l’esprit de tout le monde” in France, and the personal system of journalism forced him into unnatural prominence and productiveness.
