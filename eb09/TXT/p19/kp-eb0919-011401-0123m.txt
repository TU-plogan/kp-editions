PIPPIN, or Pepin, a name borne by several members of the Carlovingian family. (1) Pippin of Landen, or Pippin the Old, mayor of the palace, died 639. (2) His grandson, Pippin of Heristal, the father of Charles Martel, died 714. (3) Martel’s son, Pippin the Short, king of the Franks, died 768. See, for these three, France, vol. ix. p. 530 sq. (4) Pippin, son of Charles the Great (776-810), was his father’s deputy in Italy, and as such was anointed “king for Italy” by Pope Adrian I. in 781. (5) Pippin, second son of Louis the Pious, appointed king of Aquitaine by his father in 817, died in 838 after a reign spent in the family conflicts of the period. (6) The son of the last-named Pippin was called to the throne by the Aquitanians on his father’s death, and maintained himself with varying fortunes against Charles the Bald, to whom Louis had given the vacant throne, till in 864 he was taken by treachery and soon died in confinement.
