POLA, the principal naval harbour and arsenal of the Austrian-Hungarian monarchy, is picturesquely situated at the south extremity of the peninsula of Istria, 55 miles to the south of Trieste. Its safe and commodious harbour is almost completely landlocked, and there is also a good roadstead between its mouth and the Brionian Islands. The harbour is divided into two basins by a chain of three small islands, and the inner basin is subdivided into the naval and the commercial harbour by the Scoglio Olivi, a larger island connected with the mainland by an aqueduct. The hills enclosing the harbour are defended by forts and batteries. The town proper lies opposite the Scoglio Olivi, round the base of a hill formerly crowned by the Roman capitol and now by a castle of the 17th century. Besides the castle the chief mediaeval and modern buildings are the cathedral (15th century), the Franciscan convent (13th century), the Government and municipal offices, the huge infantry barracks, and the theatre. To the southwest, along the coast, extends the marine arsenal, a vast and well-planned establishment employing about 2000 workmen and possessing all the requisites for the equipment of a large fleet. It contains an interesting naval museum, and is supplemented by the docks and wharfs of the Scoglio Olivi. The artillery laboratory and the powder magazine are on the north bank of the harbour. Behind the arsenal lies the suburb of San Policarpo, almost exclusively occupied by the naval population and containing large naval barracks and hospitals. In the middle of it is a pleasant park, with a handsome monument to the emperor Maximilian of Mexico, who had been a rear-admiral in the Austrian navy. To the north, between San Policarpo and the town proper, rises the Monte Zarro, surmounted by an observatory and a statue of Admiral Tegetthoff. Pola has no manufactures outside of its naval stores, but its shipping trade is now considerable, the exports consisting of fish, timber, and quartz sand used in making Venetian glass, and the imports of manufactured and colonial wares. The population has increased from 600 at the close of last century and 5000 in 1857 to 25,175 in 1880, including a garrison of 5000 men. To many people, however, the chief interest of Pola centres in its fine Roman remains. The most extensive of these is the amphitheatre, which is 400 feet long and 320 feet wide, and could accommodate 20,000 spectators. It is remarkable as the only Roman amphitheatre of which the outer walls have been preserved intact; the interior, however, is now completely bare, â€” though the arrangements for the naumachiae, or naval contests, can still be traced. The oldest Roman relic is the fine triumphal arch of the Sergii, erected soon after the battle of Actium; and of not much later date is the elegant and well-preserved temple of Augustus and Roma. Among the other antiquities are three of the old town-gates and a fragment of a temple of Diana.

The foundation of Pola is usually carried back to the mythic period, and ascribed to the Colchian pursuers of Jason and the Argonauts. In all probability it was a Thracian colony, but its verifiable history begins with its capture by the Romans in 178 b.c. It was destroyed by Augustus on account of its espousal of the cause of Pompey, but was rebuilt on the intercession of his daughter Julia, and received (according to Pliny) the name of Pietas Julia. It seems to have attained its greatest prosperity about the time of the emperor Septimius Severus (193- 211 A.D.), when it was an important war harbour and contained 35,000 to 50,000 inhabitants. At a later period Pola became the capital of the margraves of Istria, and was more than once captured and plundered by the Venetians, who finally made themselves masters of the peninsula. In 1379 the Genoese, after defeating the Venetians in a great naval battle off the coast, took and destroyed Pola, which disappears from history for the next four hundred and -fifty years. It remained under Venetian supremacy down to 1797, and has been permanently united with Austria since 1815. In 1848 a new era began for Pola in its being selected as the principal naval harbour of Austria, and since then its progress has been constant.
