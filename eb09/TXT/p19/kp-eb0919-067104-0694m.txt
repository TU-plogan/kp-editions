PRELLER, Ludwig (1809-1861), author of well-known works on Greek and Roman mythology, was born at Hamburg on 15th September 1809. He studied philology at Leipsic under Gottfried Hermann, at Berlin under Böckh, and at Göttingen under O. Müller, graduating at the last-named university in 1832. After “habilitating” as privatdocent in Kiel, he was called in 1838 to an ordinary professorship at Dorpat, which, however, he speedily resigned along with several other German professors in consequence of misunderstandings with the Russian governing body. He afterwards spent some time in Italy, but settled in Jena in 1844, where he became professor in 1846. In the same year he removed to Weimar as head librarian and hofrath. In 1852 he travelled in Greece and Asia Minor. His death occurred at Weimar on 21st June 1861.

Preller’s chief works are— Demeter u. Persephone (1837), Griechische Mythologie (1854-55; 3d ed., 1872-75), and Römische Mythologie (1858; 3d ed., 1878). He also co-operated with H. Ritter in the preparation of a useful Historia philosophise graecae et romanae [9:19:672] ex fontium locis contexta (1838; 4th ed., 1869), and contributed extensively to Erseh and Gruber’s Allgem.
