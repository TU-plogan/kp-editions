POONA, a district in the Deccan, Bombay, situated between 17° 54' and 19° 23' N. lat., and 73° 24' and 75° 13' E. long. It has an area of 5347 square miles, and is bounded on the N. by the districts of Nasik and Ahmednagar, on the E. by those of Ahmednagar and Sholapur, on the S. by the Nira river, separating it from Satara and Phaltan, and on the W. by the Bhor state and Sahyadri Hills. Towards the west the country is extremely undulating, and numerous spurs from the hills enter the district. To the east it opens out into plains; but a considerable area is now being put under forest. Poona is watered by many streams which, rising in the Sahyadri range, flow eastwards until they join the Bhima, a river which intersects the district from north to south. The Great Indian Peninsula Railway runs through it, and affords an outlet for its produce through the Bhor Ghat to Bombay; another railway is about to be commenced which will put the district into communication with the southern Mahratta country. The Khadakvasla Canal, about 10 miles south-west of Poona, which it supplies with water, is one of its most important works. Although the district is not rich in minerals, trap rock suitable for road-making and stone for building purposes are found. Only in the west are wild animals met with, chiefly tigers, leopards, bears, and sambhar deer. The climate is dry and invigorating; the average annual rainfall is about 30 inches.

The population of the district in 1881 was 900,621 (455,101 males and 445,520 females), of whom 834,843 were Hindus, 42,036 Mohammedans, 1574 Parsis, 10,880 Jains, 9500 Christians, and 1788 of other religions. The only towns with a population exceeding 10,000 are Poona (g.v.), Poona cantonment (30,129), and Junnar (10,373).

Agriculture supports about half the population. Of a total area [9:19:462] of Government culturable land of 1,924,630 acres, 1,775,583 were cultivated during 1882-83. Of these 181,395 acres were fallow land and occupied waste, leaving 1,594,188 acres under actual cultivation, of which 28,035 were twice cropped. The chief products are cereals (chiefly jowari and bajri) and pulse, and the principal manufactures of the district are silk robes, coarse cotton cloth, and blankets; its brass and silver work is much admired. The gross revenue in 1882-83 was £180,736, of which the land tax yielded £111,740, stamps £18,790, and excise £31,160.

^ History. —The district passed from the last Hindu dynasty which reigned at Deogiri to the Mohammedans between 1294 and 1312, and under the Bahmani kings the Ghat country was thoroughly subdued. On the disruption of the Bahmani kingdom after the revolt of the governors of the provinces, the district fell to the share of the Ahmednagar kings and from them it passed to the Moguls, when the Nizamshahi dynasty finally came to an end in 1637. The country north of the Bhima, including Junnar, was annexed to the Mogul territory, and that south of it was made over to Bijapur. The power of the latter was, however, declining, and gave an opportunity to the Mahratta chiefs to unite and assert themselves, and ended in their establishing a Mahratta kingdom at Satara. Intrigues at the palace led to the supremacy of the peshwas and the removal of the capital to Poona, where many stirring scenes in Mahratta history have been enacted. Holkar defeated the peshwa under its walls, and his flight to Bassein led to the treaty by which he put himself under British protection; he was reinstated iιi 1802, but, unable to maintain friendly relations, he attacked the British at Kirkee in 1817, and his kingdom passed from him.
