PORTLAND, Isle of, a small island or peninsula of England, in the English Channel, 4j miles south of Weymouth, Dorsetshire, connected with the mainland by a long narrow ridge of shingle called the Chesil Bank. There is communication with Weymouth both by rail and steamer. The island is 4 j miles long by 1∣ broad, the area being 2890 acres. The coast-line is wild and precipitous, and Portland is inaccessible from the sea on all sides except the south. The highest elevation is 490 feet. Numerous caverns have been excavated by the action of the waves, and off Portland Bill, the southern extremity of the island, is a bank called the Shambles, between which and the land there flows a dangerous current called the Race of Portland. The substratum of the island is Kimmeridge clay, above which rest beds of sands and strata of Oolitic limestone, widely famed as a building stone. The extensive quarries have supplied the materials for St Paul’s Cathedral and many other important public buildings in London and elsewhere, about 70,000 tons of stone being now exported annually. In the “dirt-bed” resting upon the Oolitic strata numerous specimens of petrified wood are found, some of them of great size. The soil, though shallow, is fertile, and mutton fed on the grass has a peculiarly rich flavour. Agriculture, fishing, and especially quarrying give employment to the inhabitants, who are tall and handsome, and retain some singular customs, among which may be mentioned that of conveying land by “church gift” (see Real Estate). By the construction of a breakwater 2 1 miles in length, the building of which occupied twenty-three years, from 1849 to 1872, a harbour of refuge 2100 acres in extent has been formed, affording a safe and convenient anchorage for a very large fleet of vessels. It is defended by two forts of great strength, mounted with heavy ordnance. A convict prison, erected on Portland in 1848, has cells for 1500 prisoners.

Portland Castle, built by Henry VIII. in 1520, is generally occupied by the commander of the engineers or of the regiment stationed on the island. On the east side of the island are the remains of a more ancient fortress, ascribed to William Rufus. The Isle of Portland is not mentioned in the time of the Romans. In 837 it was the scene of an action against the Danes, and in 1052 it was plundered by Earl Godwine. In 1643 the Parliamentary party made themselves masters of the island and castle, but shortly afterwards these were regained by the Royalists through a clever stratagem, and not recovered again by the forces of the Parliament till 1646. The island is under the government of a local board of health. The population in 1871 was 9907, and in 1881 it was 10,061, including 550 on board vessels, 861 in Verne Citadel barracks, and 1620 in the convict prison.
