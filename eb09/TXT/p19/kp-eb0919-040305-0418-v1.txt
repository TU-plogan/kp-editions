POLLUX, Julius, of Naucratis in Egypt, a Greek sophist of the 2d century. His education was begun by his father, a man of literary culture, and was continued by one Hadrian, but he is said neither to have attained to the excellencies nor fallen into the defects of his master. He taught at Athens, where, according to Philostratus, he was appointed to the professorship by the emperor Commodus on account of his melodious voice. He died at the age of fifty-eight, leaving a son behind him. Suidas gives a list of his rhetorical works, none of which have survived. Philostratus (Fit. Soph., ii. 12) recognizes his natural abilities, but speaks of his rhetoric in very moderate terms. He was ridiculed by Athenodorus, a contemporary teacher at Athens. It is a disputed point whether or not he is the butt of Lucian’s scathing satire in the Lexiphanes and Teacher of Rhetoric. In the Teacher of Rhetoric Lucian lashes a vile and ignorant person who gains a reputation as an orator by sheer effrontery; the application of this—probably grossly exaggerated—portrait to Pollux derives some colour from the remark of Philostratus that the speeches of Pollux were more remarkable for boldness than art. The Lexiphanes, a satire upon the use of obscure and obsolete words, may conceivably have been directed against. Pollux as the author of the Onomasticon. This work, which we still possess, is a Greek dictionary in ten books dedicated to Commodus, and arranged not alphabetically but according to subject-matter. Though mainly a dictionary of synonyms and phrases, it supplies much rare and valuable information on many points of classical antiquity. It also contains numerous fragments of writers now lost.

The first book treats of the gods and their worship, kings, speed and slowness, dyeing, traders and artisans, fertility and barrenness, times and seasons, houses, ships, war, horses, agriculture, the parts of the plough and the waggon, bees. Book ii. treats of the ages and names of man, the parts of his body, his mind and soul, &c.; book iii. of kinship, marriage, citizenship, friendship, love, the relation of master and slave, mines, journeying, rivers, health, sickness, wealth, poverty, &c.; book iv. of the sciences and arts; book v. of the chase, animals, compound words, love and hate, blame, fair greetings, inscriptions, &c.; book vi. of feasts, wine, food, the talkative man, the flatterer, the passionate man, crimes, words compounded with t>μo, συv, <⅛c., gifts, laughter and weeping, &c.; book vii. of trades; book viii. of law and justice, magistrates, popular assemblies, &c.; book ix. of cities, coins, games, synonyms of likeness and unlikeness, &c., compounds in eυ; book x. of vessels, instruments, and tools. The chief editions of Pollux’s Onomasticon are those of Aldus (Venice, 1502); J. H. Lederlin and Tib. Hemsterhuis (Amsterdam, 1706); W. Dindorf (Leipsic, 1824), containing the notes of previous commentators; Im. Bekker (Berlin, 1846), containing the Greek text only.
