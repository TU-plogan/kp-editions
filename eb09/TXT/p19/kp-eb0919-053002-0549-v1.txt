PORTLAND, William Bentinck, first Earl of (d. 1709), was descended from an ancient and noble family of Guelderland, and became page of honour to William, prince of Orange, from which he was advanced to be gentleman of the bedchamber. In this capacity he accompanied the prince to England in 1670, and along with him was created doctor of civil law by the university of Oxford. Afterwards he became a colonel in a Dutch regiment of guards. When the prince of Orange was attacked with smallpox he, in accordance with a suggestion of the physicians, volunteered to lie in bed with him, that the heat of his body might check and expel the disease. This remarkable act of self-sacrifice secured him throughout life the special friendship of the prince, and by his prudence and ability, no less than by his devotedness, he fully justified the confidence that was placed in him. In 1677 he was sent by the prince to England to solicit the hand of the princess Mary, eldest daughter of James, then duke of York. At the Revolution he was the chief medium of communication between the prince and the English nobility, and in the delicate negotiations his practical shrewdness greatly facilitated the arrival at a proper understanding. After superintending the arrangements in connexion with the prince’s expedition, he accompanied him to England, and was made groom of the stole, privy purse, first gentleman of the royal bedchamber, and first commissioner on the list of privy councillors. On 9th April 1689 he was created Baron Cirencester, Viscount Woodstock, and earl of Portland. With the rank of lieutenant-general he distinguished himself in command of the Dutch cavalry at the battle of the Boyne in 1690, and he was also present at the battle of Landen in 1693, and at the siege of Namur in 1695. Along with marshal de Bouflers he prepared the terms of the peace of Ryswick in 1697, and shortly afterwards was appointed ambassador-extraordinary to Paris. Notwithstanding his diplomatic skill, his grave and cold manner rendered him unpopular with the English nobility, and his brusque honesty caused him to be sometimes wanting in outward respect to the king. Gradually his influence at the court was supplanted by that of the earl of Albemarle, who was more skilled in the arts of popularity; and in 1700, notwithstanding the efforts of the king to soothe his wounded vanity, he resigned his offices and retired to his seat at Bulstrode, Bucks, where he occupied his leisure in gardening and in works of charity. For receiving grants of land in Ireland, and for his share in the partition treaty, he was impeached by parliament, but the prosecution did not succeed. He died 23d November 1709, and was buried in Westminster Abbey.
