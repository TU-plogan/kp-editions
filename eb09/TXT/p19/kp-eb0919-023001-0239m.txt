PLUM(Prunus). Our cultivated plums are supposed to have originated from one or other of the species P. domestica or P. insititia. The young shoots of P. domestica are glabrous, and the fruit oblong; in P. insititia the young shoots are pubescent, and the fruit more or less globose. A third species, the common sloe or blackthorn, P. spinosa, has stout spines; its flowers expand before the leaves; and its fruit is very rough to the taste, in which particulars it differs from the two preceding. These distinctions, however, are not maintained with much constancy. P. domestica is a native of Anatolia and the Caucasus, and is considered to be only naturalized in Europe. P. insititia, on the other hand, is wild in southern Europe, in Armenia, and along the shores of the Caspian. In the Swiss lake-dwellings stones of the P. insititia as well as of P. spinosa have been found, but not those of P. domestica. Nevertheless, the Romans cultivated large numbers of plums. The cultivated forms are now extremely numerous, some of the groups, such as the green gages, the damsons, and the egg plums being very distinct, and. even reproducing themselves from seed. This, however, cannot be depended on, and hence the choice varieties are propagated by budding or by layers. The colour of the fruit varies from green, pale yellow, red, up to deep purple, the size from that of a small cherry to that of a walnut; the form is oblong acute or obtuse at both ends or globular; the stones or kernels vary in like manner; and the flavour, season of ripening, and duration are all subject to variation. From its hardihood the plum is one of the most valuable fruit trees for the farmer, as it is not particular as to soil, and the crop is less likely to be destroyed by spring frosts. Prunes and French plums are merely plums dried in the sun. Their preparation is carried on on a large scale' in Bosnia and Servia, as well as in Spain, Portugal, and southern France. The cherry plum, Prunus myrobalana, is employed chiefly as a stock for grafting upon, and for the sake of its ornamental flowers. See also Horticulture, vol. xii. p. 275.
