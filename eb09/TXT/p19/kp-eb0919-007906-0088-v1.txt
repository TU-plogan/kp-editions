PICHEGRU, Charles (1761-1804), the conqueror of Holland, was born at Arbois in the Jura on February 16, 1761. His father was only a labourer, but the friars who managed the college of Arbois gave the boy a good education, and one of his masters, the Père Patrault, took him to the military school of Brienne. In 1783 he entered the first regiment of artillery, where he rapidly rose to the rank of adjutant-sub-lieutenant. When the Revolution began he at once became leader of the extreme revolutionary party in Besançon, where he was stationed; and, when a regiment of volunteers of the department of the Gard marched through the city, the popular society recommended him for the rank of lieutenant-colonel, to which he was at once elected. The fine condition of his regiment was soon remarked in the army of the Rhine, to which it was attached, and his organizing ability was made use of by an appointment on the staff, and finally by his promotion to the rank of general of brigade. In 1793, when Dumouriez had deserted, and all generals of noble birth had been superseded, Carnot and Saint Just were sent to find roturier generals who could be successful; Carnot discovered Jourdan, and Saint Just discovered Hoche and Pichegru. In co-operation with Hoche and the army of the Moselle, Pichegni, now general of division and in command of the army of the Rhine, had to reconquer Alsace and reorganize the disheartened troops of the republic. They succeeded; Pichegru, instead of fighting great battles, made use of the élan of his soldiers to win innumerable small engagements, and with Hoche forced the lines of Haguenau, and relieved Landau. In December 1793 he superseded Hoche, became commander-in-chief of the united armies of the Rhine and Moselle, whence he was summoned to succeed Jourdan in the army of the North in February 1794. It was now that he fought his three great campaigns of one year. The English and Austrians held a strong position along the Sambre to the sea. After vainly attempting to break the Austrian centre, Pichegru suddenly turned their left, and defeated Clerfayt at Cassel, Menin, and Courtrai, while Moreau, his second in command, defeated Coburg at Turcoing in May 1794; then after a pause, during which [9:19:80] Piclιegru feigned to besiege Ypres, he again dashed at Clerfayt and defeated him at Rousselaer and Hooglede, while Jourdan came up with the new army of the Sambre and Meuse, and utterly routed the Austrians at Fleurus on June 27, 1794. After a pause Pichegru began his second campaign by crossing the Meuse on October 18, and after taking Nimeguen drove the Austrians beyond the Rhine. Instead of going into winter-quarters, he prepared his army for a winter campaign. On December 28th he crossed the Meuse on ,the ice, and stormed the island of Bommel, then crossed the Waal in the same manner, and, driving the English before him, entered Utrecht on January 19, and Amsterdam on January 20, and soon occupied the whole of Holland. This grand feat of arms was marked by many points of interest, such as the capture of the Dutch ships which were frozen in the Helder by the French hussars, and the splendid discipline of the ragged battalions in Amsterdam, who, with the richest city of the Continent to sack, yet behaved with perfect self-restraint. This conquest aroused a storm of admiration in France. The former friend of Saint Just now offered his services to the Thermidorians, and after receiving from the Convention the title of Sauveur de la Patrie, subdued the sans-culottes of Paris, when they rose in insurrection against the Convention on 12 Germinal (1 April). Honoured by the republicans, and with the greatest military reputation in France, Pichegru then took command of the armies of the North, the Sambre and Meuse, and the Rhine, and crossing the Rhine in force took Mannheim in May 1795. When his fame was thus at its height he became a traitor, and for the promise of a marshal’s baton, the governorship of Alsace, the castle of Chambord, 1,000,000 francs in cash, and 200,000 francs a year, sold his army and his country. He allowed Jourdan to be beaten before Mannheim, and betrayed all his plans to the enemy. His intrigues were suspected, and when he offered his resignation to the Directory in October 1795 it was to his surprise promptly accepted. He retired in disgrace, but hoped to serve the royalist cause by securing his election to the Council of Five Hundred in May 1797. He was there the royalist leader, and planned a coup d’etat, but on the 18th Fructidor he was arrested, and with fourteen others deported to Cayenne in 1797. Escaping, he reached London in 1798, and served in the archduke Charles’s staff in the campaign of .1799. He went to Paris in August 1803 with Georges Cadoudal to head a royalist rising against Napoleon; but, betrayed by a friend, he was arrested on February 28, 1804, and on April 15th was found strangled in prison. It has often been asserted, but without a shadow of probability, as he was certain to have been condemned if brought to trial, that he was murdered by the orders of Napoleon.

Pichegru’s campaigns of 1794 are marked by traits of an audacious genius which would not have disgraced Napoleon; like him, he perceived the intrinsic fitness of the French soldiers for strokes of daring rather than for sustained battles. But a more thorough traitor never commanded an army. He flattered in turn Saint Just and the Terrorists, the Thermidorians and the Directors, and seemed altogether unmoved by considerations of loyalty or patriotism.

There is no really good life of Pichegru; perhaps the best is Gassier’s Vie du général Pichegru, Paris, 1814. For his treason, trial, and death consult M<>nt-gaillard’s Mémoires concernant la trahison de Pichegru, 1804; Fauche-Bon l's Mémoires , Savary, Mémoires sur la Mort de Pichegru, Pari-, 1825; and G. Pierret, Pichegru, son Procès et son Mort, 1826.
