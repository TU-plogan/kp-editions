PLUSH (French Peluche), a textile fabric having a cut nap or pile the same as fustian or velvet. Originally the pile of plush consisted of mohair or worsted yarn, but now silk by itself or with a cotton backing is used for plush, the distinction from velvet being found in the longer and less dense pile of plush. The material is largely used for upholstery and furniture purposes, and is also much employed in dress and millinery. The most distinctive form of plush is that which has taken the place of the napped beaver felt in the dress hats of gentlemen, which are now consequently known as “silk” hats. That plush, a considerable manufacture, is principally made in Lyons.
