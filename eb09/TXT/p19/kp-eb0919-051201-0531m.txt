POPLIN, or Tabinet, is a mixed textile fabric consisting of a silk warp with a weft of worsted yarn. As the weft is in the form of a stout cord, the fabric has a ridged structure, like rep, which gives depth and softness to the lustre of the silky surface. Poplins are used for dress purposes, and for rich upholstery work. The manufacture is of French origin; but it was brought to England by the Huguenots, and has long been specially associated with Ireland. The French manufacturers distinguish between popelines unies or plain poplins and popelines Ã  dispositions or Ecossaises, equivalent to Scotch tartans, in both of which a large trade is done with the United States from Lyons.
