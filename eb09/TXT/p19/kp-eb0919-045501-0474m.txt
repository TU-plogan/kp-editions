PONTEVEDRA, a maritime province of Spain, is bounded on the N. by Coruna, on the E. by Lugo and Orense, on the S. by Portugal (Entre Douro e Minho), and on the W. by the Atlantic, and has an area of 1739 square miles. The general character of the province is hilly, with a deeply indented coast; its products are those common to all Galicia (ç.v.), of which historical province it formed a part. The population in 1877 was 451,946, the municipalities with a population over 10,000 being La Estrada (23,528), Lalin (16,217), Lavadores (13,658), Pontevedra (noticed below), Puentearêas (14,566), Redon-dela (10,073), Silleda (13,346), Tomino ( 11,150), Tuy (11,710), and Vigo (13,416). Vigo is connected by rail with Tuy and Orense, and the line from Santiago to Vigo is open as far as to Carril.
