PLAYFAIR, John (1748-1819), mathematician and physicist, was born at Benvie, Forfarshire, where his father was parish minister, on March 10, 1748. He was educated at home until the age of fourteen, when he entered the university of St Andrews. Ability for scientific studies must have appeared very early with him, for while yet a student he was selected to teach natural philosophy during the occasional absence of the professor. In 1766, when only eighteen, he was candidate for the chair of mathematics in Marischal College, Aberdeen, and, although he was unsuccessful, his claims were admitted to be high. Six years later he made application for the chair of natural philosophy in his own university, but again without success, and in 1773 he was offered and accepted the living of the united parishes of Liff and Benvie, vacant by the death of his father. He continued, however, to carry on his mathematical and physical studies, and in 1782 he resigned his charge in order to become the tutor of Ferguson of Raith. By this arrangement he was able to be frequently in Edinburgh, and to cultivate the literary and scientific society for which it was at that time specially distinguished; and through Maskelyne, whose acquaintance he had first made in the course of the celebrated Schiehallion experiments in 1774, he also gained access to the scientific circles of London. In 1785 when Dugald Stewart succeeded Ferguson in the Edinburgh chair of moral philosophy, Playfair succeeded the former in that of mathematics. In 1802 he published a volume entitled Illustrations of the Huttonian Theory of the Earth, and in 1805 he exchanged the chair of mathematics for that of natural philosophy in succession to Robison, whom also he succeeded as general secretary to the Royal Society of Edinburgh. He took a prominent part, on the liberal side, in the ecclesiastical controversy which arose in connexion with Leslie’s appointment to the post he had vacated, and published a satirical Letter (1806) which was greatly admired by his friends. His election as a fellow of the Royal Society took place in 1807. In 1815, after the establishment of a European peace, he made a journey through France and Switzerland to Italy, and remained abroad for nearly eighteen months, interesting himself chiefly in the geology and mineralogy of the districts he visited. After a few years of gradually failing health he died on July 19, 1819.

A collected edition of Playfair’s works, with a memoir by James G. Playfair, appeared at Edinburgh in 4 vols. 8vo. His waitings include a number of essays contributed to the Edinburgh Review from 1804 onwards, various papers in the Phil. Trans, (including his earliest publication “On the Arithmetic of Impossible Quantities,” 1779, and an “Account of the Lithological Survey of Schehallion” 1811) and in the Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh (“On the Causes which affect the Accuracy of Barometrical Measurement,” &c.), also the articles “Aepinus” and “Physical Astronomy,” and a “Dissertation on the Progress of’Mathematical and Physical Science since the Revival of Learning in Europe,” in the Encyclopaedia Britannica (Supplement to fourth, fifth, and sixth editions). His Elements of Geometry first appeared in 1795 and have passed through many editions; his Outlines of Natural Philosophy (2 vols., 1812-16) consist of the propositions and formulae which were the basis of his class lectures. Playfair’s contributions to pure mathematics were not considerable, his paper “On the Arithmetic of Impossible Quantities,” that “On the Causes which affect the Accuracy of Barometrical Measurements,” and his Elements of Geometry, all already referred to, being the most important. As a mathematician simply he was far inferior to the first two Gregorys, to Colin Maclaurin, and even to Matthew Stewart. He was, however, a man of great general ability and was conspicuous for a calm intellect. His scientific style was a model of clearness, and his Illustrations of the Huttonian Theory of the Earth attained great popularity through its literary merits. His lives of Matthew Stewart, Hutton, Robison, many of his reviews, and above all his. “Dissertation” are of the utmost value. The English mathematicians of his day professed unlimited admiration of Newton, but few of them were found able to wield his weapons, and the majority had come simply to rest under the shadow of that great man; to Playfair belongs the credit of having been one of the first to diffuse among his countrymen a knowledge of the substantial progress which the infinitesimal calculus had been making in the hands of the Continental analysts.
