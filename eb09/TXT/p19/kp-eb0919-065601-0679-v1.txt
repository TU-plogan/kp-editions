PRAeTORIANS (praetoriani) was the name borne by the body-guards of the Roman emperors. The name was derived from the praetorian cohort, a picked body of troops who in the time of the republic formed the guard of a general in command of an army, the old Latin name for a general being praetor and his quarters in the camp being known as the praetorium. As the emperor was commanderin-chief the headquarters (praetorium) were established at Rome, and one of the earliest measures of Augustus was the new organization of the guard. The command of the praetorians rested legally with the emperor, but after 2 b.c. it was practically exercised by one or more colonels chosen by the emperor with the title of “praetorian praefects” (praefecti praetorio, see Pr.efect). The praetorians were divided into cohorts of 1000 men each, horse and foot, and hence they are often referred to as the praetorian cohorts.

Augustus raised nine corps, of which he quartered three in different parts of Rome and the rest in neighbouring cities. One cohort kept guard in the palace. Under Tiberius the crafty and energetic praetorian praefect Sejanus collected the praetorians into a permanent fortified camp outside the Viminalian Gate of Rome. Thus united they acquired and exercised the power of making and unmaking emperors. The number of the cohorts was raised temporarily by Vitellius to sixteen; from 112 a.d. to the end of the 3d century, and probably to the time of Constantine, the number was ten. At first they were recruited exclusively from Italy, but afterwards from the Romanized provinces also of Spain, Noricum, and Macedonia. Their pay was nominally double, but really more than double, that of the legionaries;^[1. The legionaries received 10 asses daily, or 3600 asses ( = 225 denarii) annually; the praetorians received twenty asses daily, or 7200 asses annually. But, whereas in paying the legionaries the as was reckoned at its current value of 16 to the denarius, in paying the praetorians it was reckoned at its old and higher value of 10 to the denarius, and hence the 7200 asses of a praetorian were equal to 11,520 asses at the current rate, or 720 denarii. This is Mommsen’s highly ingenious and probable explanation of the apparent discrepancy between the statements of Dio Cassius (liii. 11, 55) and Tacitus (Ann., i. 17). See Marquardt’s Römische Staatsveτvmltung, ii. p. 480. Pliny (N. H., xxxiii. 45) states that after the value of the as was lowered it continued to be reckoned at its old value in the payment of soldiers. But by combining the statements of Suetonius (Ctes., 26, and Dom.it., 7) we see that Julius Caesar, while he nominally and really raised the pay of the soldiers, paid it in asses of the current value, and hence after his time it was only the praetorians who retained the privilege of having their pay reckoned in asses of the old value (see Marquardt, op. cit., p. 95).] their period of service was shorter, being sixteen years instead of at least twenty; and from the time of Claudius it was the custom of the emperors on their succession to the throne to purchase the favour of their powerful guards by a liberal donative. But the sense of their own power, to which these special privileges bore λvitness, fostered the pride, while the luxurious life of the capital relaxed the discipline, of the praetorians. Their insolence culminated when they murdered the virtuous Pertinax, put the empire up to auction, and knocked it down to the highest bidder (193). In the same year they were disgraced and disbanded by Severus, only, however, to be replaced by a still more numerous corps,^[2. According to Herodian (iii. 13, 4) Severus increased the troops in Rome fourfold.] which was now recruited indifferently from all parts of the empire. Diocletian reduced their numbers, and they were finally suppressed by Constantine in 312.
