POZZO DI BORGO, Carlo Andrea (1764-1842), Russian diplomatist, was descended from an old Corsican family, and was born at Alata near Ajaccio on 8th March 1764. After completing his legal studies at Pisa he became advocate at Ajaccio, where in 1790 he joined the party of PaoliJ to whom the Buonaparte family was strongly opposed. In his early years he had been on terms of the closest intimacy with Napoleon, but from this time a feeling of enmity sprang up between them, which on the part of Pozzo di Borgo increased as the career of Napoleon [9:19:651] developed, until it became the ruling passion of his life. Ultimately his hatred of Napoleon knew no bounds, and, regarding him as the a scourge of the world,” he sought to compass his ruin with a pertinacity which discouragements and difficulties served only to whet and kindle into redoubled ardour. In 1794 he was chosen president of the Board of Council, under the English viceroy, and when the British were expelled from the island in 1797 he went to London, where he carried on a secret mission on behalf of the Bourbons. At Vienna in 1798 he assisted in effecting a coalition between Austria and Russia against France, and in 1803 he entered the Russian service, where he became councillor of state, and was employed by the czar in all his most important diplomatic negotiations. He attempted in vain to form a new coalition after the battle of Jena, and retired, first to Austria, then to England. Recalled to Russia in 1812, he exerted all his influence to urge a continuance of the war with France till the power of Napoleon should be broken. In addition to this he secured the alliance of the Swedish crown prince Bernadotte, and also went to London to secure the active cooperation of England. He it was who counselled the allies to bring matters to a crisis by marching on Paris, and it was he who penned the famous declaration that they waged war against Napoleon, not against the French people. He gave warning to the congress of Vienna of the possibility of Napoleon returning from Elba, was present at the battle of Waterloo, where the power of Napoleon was finally crushed, and on 20th November 1815 enjoyed the supreme satisfaction of signing the treaty of Paris as Russian ambassador. In 1826 he was appointed to represent Russia at Paris. He retired from public life in 1835, and died at Paris on 15th February 1842.
