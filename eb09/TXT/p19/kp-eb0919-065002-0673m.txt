POWAN, or Po wen(Coregonus chψeoides), a species of the Salmonoid genus Coregonus, which seems to be peculiar to Loch Lomond in Scotland, the great lakes of Cumberland, where it is called “schelly,” and Lake Bala in Wales, the Welsh name of the fish being “gwyniad.” It is not found in other European waters; but of the numerous Continental species of this genus the lavaret of the Swiss lakes resembles it most. Powan, or, as they are sometimes called, freshwater herrings, live in the deepest parts of the lakes mentioned and come to the surface only occasionally, either in the winter time in order to spawn, or at certain times of the day during summer, approaching, it is said, the shores in search of food. Large numbers may then be taken with nets, and are mostly consumed on the spot. The powan rarely exceeds a length of 14 inches; it has been fully described and figured by Parnell (Annals of Natural History, 1838, vol. i. p. 162) under the names of Coregonus lacepedei and Coregonus nιicroceρkalus ; the specimens to which the latter name was given are, however, not specifically different from the typical powan.
