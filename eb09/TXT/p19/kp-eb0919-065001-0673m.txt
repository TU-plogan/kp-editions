POUT, also Whiting-Pout or Bib (Gadus luscus), a small species of cod-fish locally abundant on the coasts of northern and western Europe, but less so in the Mediterranean. It is distinguished from other species of the genus Gadus by having a deep short body; a short and obtuse snout, not longer than the eye; the upper jaw the longer; and a long barbel at the chin. The three dorsal fins are composed of respectively twelve, twenty or twenty-two, and nineteen or twenty rays, the two anal fins of from twenty-nine to thirty-two and nineteen or twenty. A black spot occupies the upper part of the base of the pectoral fin. Pout affect certain localities of limited extent, where a number may be caught with hook and line. They are excellent food, but must be eaten soon after capture, and do not bear carriage. A pout of 5 B) is considered a very large specimen.
