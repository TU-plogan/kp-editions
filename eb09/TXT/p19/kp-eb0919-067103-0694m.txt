PRELLER, Friedrich (1804-1878), German landscape-painter, was born at Eisenach on 25th April 1804. After studying drawing at Weimar, he went in 1821, on Goethe’s advice, to Dresden, where he made such progress that in 1824 he was invited to accompany the grand-duke of Weimar to Belgium, where he became a pupil in the academy at Antwerp. From 1827 to 1831 he studied in Italy, and in the last-named year he received an appointment in the Weimar school of art. In 1834-36 he executed in tempera six pictures on subjects taken from the Odyssey in the “Roman House” at Leipsic, in 1836-37 the landscapes with scenes from Oberon in the Wieland room in the grand-ducal palace at Weimar, and in 1836- 48 six frescos in Thuringian subjects commissioned by the grand-duchess. In 1840 he visited Norway and produced a number of easel works, some of which are preserved at Weimar. In 1859 he revisited Italy, and on his return in 1861 he completed for the grand-ducal museum the landscapes illustrative of the Odyssey, which are held to constitute his chief claim to fame, entitling him to rank with Poussin and Claude Lorraine in the hierarchy of painters. Preller, who was also a successful etcher, died at Weimar on 23d April 1878.
