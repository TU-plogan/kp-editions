PRÉVOST, Pierre (1751-1839), son of a Protestant clergyman in Geneva, was born in that city on 3d March 1751, and was educated for a clerical career. But he forsook it for law, and this too he quickly deserted to devote himself to education and to travelling. He became intimate with J. J. Rousseau, and, a little later, with Dugald Stewart, having previously distinguished himself as a translator of and commentator on Euripides. Frederick II. of Prussia secured him in 1780 as professor of philosophy, and made him member of the Academy of Sciences in Berlin. He there became acquainted with Lagrange, and was thus led to turn his attention to science. After some years spent on political economy (as in Adam Smith’s Wealth of Nations) and on the principles of the fine arts (in connexion with which he wrote, for the Berlin Memoirs, a remarkable dissertation on poetry) he returned to Geneva and commenced his works on magnetism and on heat. Interrupted occasionally in his studies by political duties, in which he was often called to the front, he remained professor of philosophy at Geneva till he was called in 1810 to the chair of physics. He died at Geneva on 8th April 1839. Prévost published much on philology, philosophy, and political economy; but he will be remembered mainly on two accounts—(1) his having published, with additions of his own, the posthumous memoirs of the ingenious Le Sage (see Atom, vol. iii. p. 46, and Attraction); and (2) his having hrst enunciated the theory of exchanges (see Radiation), on which has been based one of the grandest experimental methods of modem times. He was distinguished as much for his moderation, precision, and truthfulness as for his extraordinary versatility.
