PORPHYRY, a name originally applied to a reddish or purple rock (τropφυpeoς, purple) found in Upper Egypt, principally at Jebel Dokhan, and much used by the ancients as a decorative stone. This porphyry, the porfido rosso antico of Italian antiquaries, consists of a dark crimson or chocolate-coloured felsitic base, with disseminated crystals of white felspar, probably oligoclase. It was a favourite material with Roman sculptors under the lower empire, and notwithstanding its excessive hardness was worked into large sarcophagi and other objects, ornamented in some cases in elaborate relief. This porphyry was also ingeniously used for the lower part of the busts of Roman emperors, the head being executed in another material, while the porphyry was used for the drapery, the colour of the stone suggesting that of the imperial purple. The antique red porphyry is often confounded with the rosso antico, which, being merely a red marble, is a much softer stone.

The term “porphyry” has been gradually extended to a variety of rocks which contain distinct crystals of any mineral sprinkled through a fine-grained ground. Among the best known of the ancient porphyries is the porfido verde antico, or lapis Lacedaemonius, a beautiful rock with pale-green crystals of labrador-felspar, found at Mount Taygetus in the Morea. The meaning of the word ‘ ‘ porphyry” has become so vague, in consequence of its application to many rocks widely differing from each other in composition, that there is a tendency among modern petrologists to abandon its use as a substantive, and merely to retain the adjective “porphyritic” as a convenient designation for all rocks which exhibit a structure like that of the ancient porphyry. Any rock, whatever its mineralogical composition, may therefore become porphyritic by containing isolated crystals developed in a compact or micro-crystalline matrix. Among the finest rocks of this class in

Britain are the porphyritic granites of Cornwall and of Shap in Westmoreland; the el vans, or quartz-porphyries (see vol. x. p. 233), which occur as dykes cutting through the slates and granites of Cornwall; the peculiar rock termed “luxullianite” (see vol. xi. p. 49); and the green and red porphyritic felstones of Cumberland. A beautiful brown porphyritic felstone occurs at Buchan Ness, on the coast of Aberdeenshire; while a rock closely resembling the antique green porphyry is found on Lambay Island, near Dublin. For a description of porphyrite, see vol. x. p. 234.
