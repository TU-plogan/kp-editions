+====================================================================+


PIOZZI, Hester Lynch (1741-1821), the daughter of John Salisbury of Bod ville, Carnarvonshire, was born there, as it would appear from a protracted dispute between Croker and Macaulay, 27th January 1741. After an education which extended considerably beyond that given to most ladies of her period—for she was acquainted with the learned languages as well as with French, Italian, and Spanish—she was married in 1763 to Henry Thrale, a brewer of Southwark, whose house was at Streatham on the south-east corner of Tooting Beck Common. In this retreat she drew around her many of the most distinguished men of letters of the age. She was introduced to Johnson by Arthur Murphy in the year after her marriage, and for nearly twenty years the sage remained on the closest intimacy with her. He travelled with them in Wales in 1774, and visited France in their company in 1775. Boswell’s first visit to Streatham took place in October 1769. Madame D’Arblay was first received there in August 1778. In spite of this intercourse with the principal writers of the day troubles grew upon her in her married life. Her talents were not appreciated by her husband; he was always ill and frequently in pecuniary anxiety; and when children were born to her they often succumbed to sickness. After some years’ illness Mr Thrale died on April 4, 1781, and, as the brewery in the borough sold for .£135,000, the widow found herself amply provided for. At the time of Mr Thrale’s death Dr Johnson was in declining health, and he soon began to think himself slighted, nor was his indignation abated at the announcement in the spring of 1783 of her engagement to Piozzi, an Italian musician. For a time the engagement was broken off, but it was quickly resumed, and on the 25th of July 1784 they were married. The union provoked the resentment of her children, and the undying denunciations of Dr Johnson; but, when her husband was found to be a man of quiet and inoffensive manners and a careful guardian of his wife’s resources, her children acquiesced in the marriage and most of her friends returned to her. Baretti, always her enemy, abused her, and Boswell ridiculed her, but her character has survived the insinuations of the one and the open malevolence of the other, as well as the satiric attacks of Peter Pindar. Piozzi died of gout at Brynbella, March 1809, and from that time his widow’s life was chiefly spent in the social circles of Bath and Clifton or in the retirement of Penzance. When long past seventy she took a fancy to William Augustus Conway the actor, and the “love letters” which she wrote to him have been published with a catchpenny title. She died at Clifton, 2d May 1821.

Mrs Piozzi was bright and witty, and possessed of manners which, if not refined, never failed to attract. Several of her literary publications have long since perished from want of vitality, but her little poem of “The Three Warnings” forms a part of most selections of English poetry. Her Anecdotes of Dr Johnson, now a scarce book, are contained, “as she herself gave them to the world,” in the concluding volume of Napier’s Johnson (1884), and her notes to Wraxall’s Historical Memoirs are reprinted in the 1884 edition of that work. The Anecdotes and the Letters to and from Dr Johnson are inferior in interest only to the work of Boswell. Two editions of the Autobiography of Mrs Piozzi, under the editorship of Abraham Hayward, have been issued, and the Rev. Edward Mangin published in 1833, under the disguise of “by a friend,” a thin volume of Piozziana. Her features are reproduced in the lady’s countenance in Hogarth’s picture of the Lady’s Last Stake.
