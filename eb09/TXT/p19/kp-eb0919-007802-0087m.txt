PIATRA, a town of Roumania (Moldavia) at the head of the department of Neamtsu, on the left bank of the Bistritza, an affluent of the Sereth. It is about 45 miles [9:19:79] by road from Roman, a station on the railway from Galatz and Czernowitz. The population of the prefecture in 1878 was 25,383 (9887 Jews). It contained seven Orthodox churches,—the most remarkable being St John’s, or the Prince’s Monastery, founded by Stephen the Great in 1497. There are five annual fairs, and a large trade is done in grain and timber—the latter being rafted down the Bistritza from the mountains to Galatz.
