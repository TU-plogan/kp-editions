PISANO, Andrea. Andrea da Pontadera (c. 1270- 1348), generally known as Andrea Pisano, the chief pupil of Giovanni Pisano (q.v.), was born about 1270, and first learned the trade of a goldsmith, as did many other afterwards celebrated artists. This early training was of the greatest value to him in his works in bronze, to which the manipulation of the precious metals gave precision of design and refinement of execution. He became a pupil of Giovanni Pisano about 1300, and worked with him on the sculpture for S. Maria della Spina at Pisa and elsewhere. But it is at Florence that his chief works were executed, and the formation of his mature style was due rather to Giotto than to his earlier master. Of the three world-famed bronze doors of the Florentine baptistery, the earliest one —that on the south side—was the work of Andrea; he spent many years on it; and it was finally set up in 1336.^[1. The date on the door, 1330, refers to the completion of the wax model, not of the casting, which was at first unsuccessful, and had to be done over again by Andrea himself. ] This marvellous piece of bronze work, in many respects perhaps the finest the world has ever seen, has all the breadth of a sculptor’s modelling, with the finish of a piece of gold jewellery. It consists of a number of small quatrefoil panels—the lower eight containing single figures of the Virtues (see the figure), and the rest scenes from the life of the Baptist. In design the panels owe much to Giotto: the composition of each is simple and harmonious, kept strictly within the due limits of the plastic art, no attempt at pictorial effects and varied planes being made,— in this very unlike the perhaps more magnificent but less truly artistic reliefs on the third door, that last executed by Ghiberti. Andrea Pisano, while living in Florence, also produced many important works of marble sculpture, all of which show strongly Giotto’s influence. In some cases probably they were actually designed by that artist, as, for instance, the double band of beautiful panel-reliefs which Andrea executed for the great campanile. The subjects of these are the Four Great Prophets, the Seven Virtues, the Seven Sacraments, the Seven Works of Mercy, and the Seven Planets. The duomo contains the chief of Andrea’s other Florentine works in marble. In 1347 he was appointed architect to the duomo of Orvieto, which had already been designed and begun by Lorenzo Maitani. The exact date of his death is not known, but it must have been shortly before the year 1349.

Andrea Pisano had two sons, Nino and Tommaso,—both, especially the former, sculptors of considerable ability. Nino was very successful in his statues of the Madonna and Child, which are full of human feeling and soft loveliness,—a perfect embodiment of the Catholic ideal of the Divine Mother. Andrea’s chief pupil was Andrea di Cione, better known as Orcagna (j.v.). Balduccio di Pisa, another, and in one branch (that of sculpture) equally gifted pupil, executed the wonderful shrine of S. Eustorgio at Milan—a most magnificent mass of sculptured figures and reliefs.
