PIPE (see Music, vol. xvii. p. 77; and Organ, ib. p. 829). Strutt, in his Sports and Pastimes of the People of England, gives representations of the pipe and tabor as used in England in the 14th century to accompany a dancing-dog, a cock on stilts, a horse rearing, &c. From the drawings we cannot ascertain the nature of the pipe represented. We may, however, suppose it to have been similar to the galoubet used in France, along with the tabor, from a very remote period. This galoubet is a small instrument of the flageolet kind. Its use for more than the last two centuries has been confined to Provence. It has only three finger-holes, and is played with the left hand, whilst the right beats the tabor, which is attached to the performer. The compass of the galoubet is two octaves and a tone from D on the third line of the treble clef up to E in altissimo. Great skill is required to bring out all the sounds of its compass. Some of the players on this small and imperfect instrument are said to be so dexterous as to be able to perform upon it very difficult pieces of music composed for other instruments, such as the violin, &c. It is always accompanied by the tabor, which is a small drum of a cylindrical form, and rather longer and narrower in its relative proportions than the common drum. In the last century several books of instruction were published at Paris by distinguished performers on the galoubet.
