POPOCATEPETL (Aztec popocani, “smoking,” tepetl, “mountain”), a burning mountain in Mexico, in 18° 59' 47" N. lat. and 98° 33' 1" W. long., which along with the neighbouring and somewhat lower summit of Ixtaccihuatl (Aztec “White Woman ”) forms the south-eastern limit of the great valley in which the capital is built. As it lies in the province of Puebla, and is the great feature in the view from that city, it is also called the Puebla Volcano. With the single exception of Mount Elias in Alaska, Popocatepetl appears to be the highest peak in North America, rising as it does in a regular snow-covered cone to an altitude of 17,853 feet. The main mass of the mountain consists of andesite, but porphyry, obsidian, trachyte, basalt, and other similar rocks are also represented. Between the pine forest (Pinus occidentalis'), which ceases at a height of 12,544 feet, and the snow limit, 14,960 feet, there lies a tract of loose sand, largely composed of grains of sulphur, which renders the ascent tedious and at times dangerous, though the first 1600 feet can be accomplished on horseback. On the summit is an enormous crater measuring 5000 feet across and with a sheer depth of 2000 feet. The vapours rising from the solfataras, the mixture of sulphur yellow and ash grey in the caldron, the dazzling snow on the edges of the crater walls, and the deep blue of the sky above produce the most indescribable effects of colour. The highest point of the mountain is a softly rounded eminence about 30 feet only from the rim. Sulphur from the crater is regularly worked by a number of Indians who have their huts at the foot of the cone, at a height of 12,000 feet. The material is shot down a slide for a distance of between 2000 and 3000 feet, and the workmen also avail themselves of this means of descent. At the foot of the east slope of Popocatepetl stretches a vast lava field—the Malpays of Atlachayacatl, which gives birth to the Rio Atlaco. According to Humboldt, it rises from 60 to 80 feet above the plain, and extends 18,000 feet from east to west with a breadth of 6000 feet. The date of its formation [9:19:513] must be of great antiquity. There have been only two or three moderate eruptions during the last 300 years, though smoke continually issues from the crater, and from time to time vast showers of cinders and stones are shot up.

In 1519 Cortes sent a party of ten men to climb a smoking mountain which was evidently Popocatepetl; and in 1522 Francisco Montano not only reached the summit but had himself let down into the crater a depth of 400 or 500 feet. No second ascent of the mountain is recorded till April (see Brantz Mayer, Mexico, vol. ii. ) and November 1827’. Other ascents have been made in 1834, 1848, and subsequent years.
