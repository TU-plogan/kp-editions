PONTEVEDRA, capital of the above province, and an episcopal see, is a picturesque old granite-built town, pleasantly situated at the head of the Ria de Pontevedra, where the Lerez is spanned by the old Roman bridge (whence the nameâ€” pons vetus). The inhabitants engage in agriculture, sardine fishing, and the manufacture of cloth and hats. The population of the municipality in 1877 was 19,857.
