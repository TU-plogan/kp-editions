POWERS, Hiram (1807-1873), American sculptor, was the son of a farmer, and was born at Woodstock, Vermont, on 29th June 1807. In 1819 his father removed to a farm in Ohio, about six miles from Cincinnati, where the son attended school for about a year, staying meanwhile with his brother, a lawyer in Cincinnati. After leaving school he found employment in superintending a reading-room in connexion with the chief hotel of the town, but, being, in his own words i “forced at last to leave that place as his clothes and shoes were fast leaving him,” he became a clerk in a general store. His second employer in this line of business having invested his capital in a clock and organ factory, Powers set himself to master the construction of the instruments, displaying an aptitude which in a short time enabled him to become the first mechanic in the factory. In 1826 he began to frequent the studio of Mr Eckstein, and at once conceived a strong passion for the art of sculpture. His proficiency in modelling secured him the situation of general assistant and artist of the Western Museum, kept by a Frenchman, Μ. Dorfeuille, where his ingenious representation of the infernal regions to illustrate the more striking scenes in the poem of Dante met with extraordinary success. After studying thoroughly the art of modelling and casting, he in the end of 1834 went to Washington, and a friend having secured for him as sitters the president and some of the leading statesmen his remarkable gifts soon awakened general attention. In 1837 he settled in Florence, where he remained till his death. While from pecuniary considerations he found it necessary to devote the greater part of his time to busts, his best efforts were bestowed on ideal work. In 1838 his statue of Eve excited the warm admiration of Thorwaldsen, and in 1839 he produced his celebrated Greek Slave, which at once gave him a place among the greatest sculptors of his time. Among the best known of his other ideal statues are the Fisher Boy, Il Penseroso, Proserpine, California, America (modelled for the Crystal Palace, Sydenham), and the Last of his Tribe. Among the eminent men whose busts he modelled are many of the leading contemporary statesmen of America. His genius was strikingly realistic and unconventional, a quality doubtless in some degree attributable to the nature of his early training, but it was the close and thorough study of the works of the great masters which finally disciplined his powers to their highest perfection of purity and refinement. He died on 27th June 1873.

Among various obituary notices of Powers one of the most interesting is that by his intimate friend T. A. Trollope in Lqψincott's Magazine for February 1875.
