PORUS, the name of the Indian king who withstood Alexander the Great on the banks of the Hydaspes (Jhelum). He was afterwards confirmed in his kingdom by the conqueror, and still held the position of a Macedonian satrap when assassinated some time between 321 and 315 b.c. See India, vol. xii. pp. 786, 787, and Persia, vol. xviii. p. 586. His cousin, also named Porus, with whom he was on bad terms, ruled over Gandaris beyond the Hydraotes (Ravi), and was subdued by Hephaestion.
