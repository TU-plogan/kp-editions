POLYZOA is the name applied by J. Vaughan Thompson in 1830 (1)^[1. These numbers refer to the bibliography at the end of the article. ] to a group of minute polyp-like organisms which were subsequently (1834) termed “Bryozoa” by Ehrenberg (2). The forms included in this group were stated by Thompson to be “in a general way the whole of the Flustraceae, in many of which I have clearly ascertained the animals to be Polyzoae,” they having been previously considered by zoologists to be allied to the Hydralike polyps. These organisms had previously been known by the hard corneous “cells” or chambers which are formed by the animals on the surface of their bodies, and build up, in consequence of the formation of dense colonies by budding, complex aggregates known as “sea mats” and “sea mosses.” Thompson expressly stated the opinion that the organization of the animals detected by him led to the conclusion that “they must be considered as a new type of the Mollusca Acephala.”

Subsequently (1844) Henri Milne-Edwards (3) pointed out the relationship of Thompson’s Polyzoa to the Brachiopoda, and, adopting the latter’s view as to their Molluscan affinities, proposed to unite these two classes with the Tunicata in a group to be called “Molluscoidea.” Recent researches have entirely separated the Tunicata from this association, and have demonstrated that they belong to the great phylum of Vertebrata. On the other hand the association of the Polyzoa with the Brachiopoda appears at present to be confirmed, though the relationship of these two classes to the Mollusca has been shown to rest on mistaken identification of parts; see, however, Harmer (18).

The Polyzoa appear to be related to the Sipunculoid Gephyraean worms (Gephyraea inermia) more nearly than to any other class of the animal kingdom. The study and interpretation of the facts of their ontogeny (growth from the egg) presents such extreme difficulty that in the present state of our knowledge it is necessary to regard them [9:19:430] ad interim as forming with the Brachiopoda and Sipunculoids an isolated group, to which the name “Podaxonia” may be applied, pending the decision of their affinities by the increase of our knowledge of the embryology of important members of the group.^[2. The research of Harmer (18) on Loxosoma is published too late for due notice in this article. It tends to the conclusion that the Eupolyzoa are after all degraded Mollusca, and have no connexion with the Vermiformia, Pterobranchia, Brachiopoda, and Sipunculoidea. The reader is referred to Mr Harmer’s memoir. ]

The forms included at the present day in Thompson’s class of “Polyzoa” may then be thus classified:
[table]

We shall most readily arrive at a conception ot the essential structure of a Polyzoon, and of the variations to which that essential structure is subject within the class, by first examining one member of the group in detail and subsequently reviewing the characters presented by the divergent sub-classes, orders, &c., above indicated.

The most convenient form for our purpose is Paludicella Ehrenbergii (fig. 2, A), belonging to the typical section of the class (the Eupolyzoa) and to the order Gymnolaema. The organism occurs as minute trec-like growths (figs. 2, A and 1, E) attached to stones in freshwater streams and canals. The branches of the little tree are rarely more than an inch in length, and are regularly swollen and jointed at intervals. Each of the very numerous joints is about one-fifth of an inch long, and is in reality a tubular horny box attached above and below to the preceding and succeeding joints, and having on one side of it a spout-like aperture from which a crown of tentacles can be protruded. Each joint is thus inhabited by a distinct animal which is more or less completely shut off from the one in front of it and the one behind it, although it originated from the hinder and has given rise to the fore-lying individual by a process of budding, and retains a continuity of substance with both. A single cell or joint with its contained animal is represented in fig. 2, A.

Paludicella produces an arboriform colony, the main trunk or stolon being adherent to some stone or piece of wood. The substance of the wall of the cells is formed by a chemical body allied to chitin. Other Polyzoa may form mat-like expansions—the cells being placed in one plane, side by side (fig. 1, C, D, F, G), as well as in linear series; others again form solid masses, whilst many agree with Paludicella in the simple linear arrangement of their units. Phoronis and Loxosoma, on the other hand, do not form colonies at all—the former because it does not bud, the latter because the buds become detached from their parent as soon as formed, as do the buds of the Hydrozoon Hydra.

On the whole Paludicella presents us with a very simple form of Polyzoon-colony (technically termed a “zoarium”), in which the aggregate of budded persons, each of which is called a “polypide,” does not exhibit any marked individuation, but is irregular and tree-like. But, just as in the Hydrozoa we find the Siphonophora presenting us with a very definite shape and individuality of the aggregate or colonv. so in the Polvzoa we find instances of high indι- [9:19:431]

viduation of the zoarium of a similar kind. The most remarkable example is afforded by the locomotive zoarium or colony of Cristatella (fig. 3); and another very striking instance is that of the stalked zoaria of Kinetoskias (fig. 14) and Adeona.

The horny consistence of the cells which are produced by Paludicella is very usual in other Polyzoa; but we find frequently that the substance which forms the cells is gelatinous and soft instead of being horny, or again may be strongly calcareous. The term coenoeciunι is applied to the mass of cells belonging to a colony or zoarium when considered apart from the living polyp ides which form it. Often such coenoecia are found retaining form and structure when the soft living polypides have decomposed and disappeared. A single cell of the coenoecium, corresponding to a single polypide, is called by the special students of the Polyzoa a zooecium.

If we examine a single cell or zooecium of Paludicella more carefully whilst its polypide is alive, we discover that the horny cell is nothing more than the cuticle of the polypide itself, to which it is absolutely adherent. At the so-called “mouth” or spout of the cell the cuticle suddenly changes its character and becomes a very delicate and soft pellicle instead of being thickandhorny. There is no real discontinuity of the cuticle at this region, but merely a change in its qualities. This gives to that portion of the body of the polypide which lies beyond the spout a mobility and capacity for folding and pleating which is entirely denied to that part where the cuticle is more dense (fig. 2, A). Accordingly we find that the anterior portion of the body of the polypide can be pulled into the hinder part as the finger of a glove may be tucked into the hand. It is, in fact, an “introvert” (for the use of this term see Mollusca, vol. xvi. p. 652). This arrangement is universal in the Ectoproctous Eupolyzoa, but does not obtain either in the Entoprocta, the Pterobranchia, or the Vermiformia. In Phoronis, Rhabdopleura, and Cephalodiscus the anterior part of the body can not be tucked or telescoped into the hinder part as it can in typical Eupolyzoa. On the other hand it is very important to note that the Sipunculoid Gephyraeans are all pre-eminently characterized by possessing identically this arrangement. The introversion is effected in Paludicella (as in other Eupolyzoa) by a series of long detached retractor muscles of considerable power (fig. 2, A, mr, r', m) ; the same is true of Sipunculus.

The view has been advanced by Allman (4) that the retractile part of the polypide is to be considered as a distinct individual budded from the basal portion, which is regarded as an equivalent individual. It does not appear to the present writer that such a theoretical conception tends to facilitate the understanding of the structure and relations of these animals.

An “ectocyst" and “endocyst” have also been distinguished in former treatises, and these terms form part of a special “polyzoarial” nomenclature, but do not appear to be any longer needful. Equally undesirable is the misapplied term “endosarc” lately introduced by Jolliet (5) to denote a certain portion of the Polyzoon structure which will not be referred to here by that name.

The retractile or introversible portion of the body of the polypide of Paludicella is terminated by a crown of sixteen stiff non-contractile tentacles (fig. 2, A, br) which form a circle around a central aperture—the animal’s mouth. These tentacles are hollow and beset with vibratile cilia. The beating of the cilia causes a powerful current in the water by which food is brought to the animal’s mouth. Each tentacle is also muscular, and can be bent and straightened at will. The tentacles not only serve to bring food into the mouth, but they are efficient as gillfilaments, being possibly homologous with (as well as functionally similar to) the gill-filaments of Lamellibranch Molluscs. They also serve as delicate tactile organs, and are the only sense organs possessed by the Eupolyzoa.

In Paludicella the platform around the mouth from which the tentacles arise, or lophophore, as it is termed, is circular. This is the case in all members of the large group of Gymnolaema and in the Entoprocta. But in the Phylactolaema the lophophore is drawn out on each side, right and left, so as to present a horse-shoe shape (fig. 2, B), and in some forms, notably Lophopus and Alcyonella, the two arms or diverging rami of the horseshoe are very strongly developed.

In the Pterobranchia the tentacles are confined in one genus (Rhabdopleura) to the two arm-like outgrowths of the lophophore, and are not simply hollow but contain a well-developed cartilaginoid skeleton (fig. 7). In the allied genus Cephalodiscus there are not merely a single pair of such arm-like processes, each bearing two rows of tentacles, but the lophophore is developed into twelve arm-like processes (fig. 9), which form a dense tuft of filaments around the anterior extremity of the animal.

In the Vermiformia (Phoronis) we again meet with a very perfect horse-shoe-shaped lophophore (fig. 4). The tentacles upon the crescentic or otherwise lobed circumoral region of the Sipunculoids are the representatives of the tentacles of the Polyzoa; whilst the tentaculiferous “arms” of the Brachiopoda appear to be the equivalents of the Polyzoon’s lophophore much drawn out and in most cases spirally rolled.

Just below the circular crown of tentacles in Paludicella we find an aperture which the study of internal anatomy proves to be the anus. In all Polyzoa the anus has this position near the mouth; and in this respect we again note an agreement with Sipunculus and the other so-called Gephyraea inermia. In one division of the Polyzoa alone is there any noteworthy variation in the position of the anus, namely, in the Entoprocta (sub-class of the section Eupolyzoa). In these forms the anus, instead of lying just below the lophophore or platform from which the tentacles spring, is included like the mouth within its area (fig. 15, C).

Passing now to the deeper structure of Paludicella, we find that it is a Coelomate animal; that is to say, there [9:19:432] exists between the body-wall and the wall of the alimentary tract a distinct space termed “perigastric space,” body-cavity,” or “coelom.” This is true of all Polyzoa, though it has been erroneously stated by G. O. Sars that Rhabdopleura does not possess such a coelom. In Eupolyzoa (excepting the Entoprocta) the coelom is very capacious; it is occupied by a coagulable haemolymph in which float cellular corpuscles, and also the generative products, detached, as is usual in Coelomata, from definite “gonads” developed on its lining membrane (fig. 2, A, o, t). This lining membrane or “coelomic epithelium” is ciliated in the Phylactohema, but its characters appear not to have been definitely determined in other Eupolyzoa. The coelomic space and the tissues bounding it are continuous throughout the colony or zoarium of a Polyzoon—either directly without any constriction marking off one polypide from another, or through perforate septum-like structures as in Paludicella (see right-hand upper process of fig. 2, A), which form incomplete barriers between juxtaposed zooecia, and are termed “rosette-plates” or “communication-plates.” The coelomic cavity is continued in Paludicella and probably in all Polyzoa into the tentacles, so that these organs expose the haemolymph fluid to a respiratory action, and hence may be called branchial.

The body-wall of Paludicella consists, alike in the anterior introversible region and in the posterior region, of an outer cuticle which has already been spoken of as thickened around the base of the polypide so as to become there the hard tube-like zooecium. Beneath this is the delicate layer of living epidermic cells which are the mother-cells or matrix of that cuticle. Beneath this again are a few scattered annuli of muscular fibre-cells arranged ring - wise around the cylindrical body; more deeply placed than these are five large bundles of longitudinally placed muscular fibre-cells which are attached at three different levels to the soft introversible portion of the body, and by their retraction pull it in three folds or telescopic joints into the capacious hinder part of the body. In some Polyzoa the muscular fibre-cells present transverse striations. These folds are shown in fig. 2, A; but when the longitudinal muscles are completely contracted the tentacular crown would be pulled down far out of sight into the midst of the body by the great longitudinal muscle mr. Deeper than the longitudinal muscles, and clothing them and everything else which projects into the coelom, is the coelomic epithelium, not easily observed, and sufficiently known only in the Phylactohema. Part of it gives rise to the generative products (fig. 2 A, o, t). Other Eupolyzoa have a similar but not identical arrangement of the longitudinal muscles—acting essentially as retractors of the “introvert” or soft anterior region of the body—and a similar structure of the body-wall which is in essential features identical with that of the Sipunculoid worms, the Chaetopod worms, and other typical Coelomate animals.

The alimentary canal of Paludicella forms a closely compressed U-shaped loop depending from the closely approximated mouth and anus into the capacious coelom. It is clothed on its coelomic surface (in Phylactolaema at any rate) with coelomic epithelium, and beneath this are extremely delicate muscular layers. Within it is lined, except in the immediate region of the mouth (which is lined by the in-pushed outer cell-layer), by the enteric celllayer— the digestive cells derived from the archenteron of the embryo. We can distinguish in Paludicella a contractile pharyngo-oesophagus (fig. 2, A, oe), a digestive stomach V (the lining cells of which have a yellow colour), and an intestine which forms that arm of the loop connected with the anus. This simple form of alimentary canal is uniformly present in Polyzoa. In Boτverbankia and its allies a muscular gizzard with horny teeth is interposed between oesophagus and digestive stomach.

The alimentary canal of Paludicella does not hang quite freely in the coelomic cavity, but, as is usually the case in other classes where the coelom is large, mesenteries are present in the form of fibrous (muscular Î) bands clothed with coelomic epithelium and suspending the gut to the body-wall. In Paludicella there are two of these mesenteries, an anterior (√) and a posterior (x). The presence of two mesenteric bands is exceptional. Usually in the Eupolyzoa we find one such mesentery only, corresponding to the hinder of the two in Paludicella. The special name funiculus (Huxley) is applied to this mesenteric band, and it is noteworthy that the cells of the coelomic epithelium, either upon its surface or at its point of insertion into the body-wall, are modified as reproductive elements, forming either the testis or ovary; in the Phylactolaema they form here also special asexual reproductive bodies, the statoblasts. The nervous tissue and organs of Paludicella have not been specially investigated, but in many Eùpolyzoa an oval mass of nerve-ganglion cells is found lying between the mouth and anus, and there is no doubt that it is present in this case. In Plumatella nerve-fibres have been traced from this ganglion to the tentacles and other parts around the mouth (fig. 11, w, x i y). A “colonial nervous system” was described some years ago by Fr. Müller in Serialaria; but modern histologists do not admit that the tissue so named by Müller is nerve-tissue. The ganglion above mentioned is the only nervous tissue at present known in Polyzoa (but see fig. 17, x).

No heart or blood-vessels of any kind exist in Paludicella nor in any of the Eupolyzoa or Pterobranchia. On the other hand the isolated vermiform genus Phoronis presents a closed contractile system of longitudinal vessels (dorsal and ventral) which contain nucleated corpuscles coloured red by haemoglobin (figs. 4, 5).

No excretory organs (nephridia) or genital ducts have been observed in Paludicella, nor have such organs been detected in the majority of the Polyzoa which have been studied. In the Entoprocta, however, a pair of minute ciliated canals are found in the nearly obliterated bodycavity opening to the exterior near the tentacular crown in both Pedicellina and Loxosoma, which represent the cephalic nephridia of worms. A definite pair of nephridia occur in Phoronis. A similar significance is perhaps to be attributed to the “intertentacular organ” of Farre—a ciliated passage opening between two tentacles of the lophophore in Membranipora, Alcyonidium, and other forms—through which Hincks has observed the spermatozoa to escape in large numbers. This organ occurs equally in female specimens of Membranipora, and is not therefore simply a spermatic duct.
[9:19:433]

Paludicella, as we have seen, develops both ova and spermatozoa in one and the same polypide. The details of impregnation and development have not been followed in this instance, but in some of the marine Eupolyzoa (Gymnolaema) remarkable bud-like structures termed o<xcia are developed for the special reception of the ova, and in these organs fertilization takes place. In the Entoprocta there is a peculiar brood-pouch. The spermatozoa of one polypide probably in all cases fertilize the ova of another, but we have not yet in many cases a knowledge of how the spermatozoa get to the eggs, or how the eggs escape from the body-cavity of the parent. In the hippocrepian freshwater Polyzoa (Phylactolaema) the ova appear to be fertilized and undergo the early stages of development within the body-cavity of the parent or in a hernia-like protrusion of it. Probably in such cases the embryos escape by the death of the parent and rupture of the parental tissues, as do also the peculiar asexual internal buds or statoblasts of these forms.

The embryo Polyzoon or “larva” swims freely in its early condition by means of cilia, and is in this condition a single polypide or “person.” The forms assumed by these ciliated larvae in different Polyzoa are very various and exceedingly difficult of interpretation. We shall have more to say with regard to them below (see figs. 19, 20, 21). The ciliated larva then fixes itself and commences to produce polypides by a process of budding, the buds remaining not merely in contact but in organic continuity, and increasing continually in number so as to form a large colony or zoarium. In Paludicella we have seen that this colony has a simple tree-like form. The new buds form as wart-like growths, usually one, sometimes two in number, at the free end of a cell or zooecium near the spout-like process from which the tentacular crown is everted. In Paludicella all the polypides of a colony are alike; there is no differentiation of form or distribution of function amongst the members of the colony. In many Eupolyzoa this simplicity is by no means maintained, but a great variety of form and function is assumed by various members of the aggregate. The only approach to a differentiation of the polypides in Paludicella is in the arrest of growth of some of the buds of a colony in autumn, which, instead of advancing to maturity, become conical and invested with a dark-coloured cuticle. They are termed hybernacula. Should the rest of the polypides die down in winter, these arrested buds survive and go on to complete development on the return of spring.

In Paludicella we have thus seen a fairly simple and central example of Polyzoon structure and life-history. The variations upon this theme presented in different groups of Polyzoa have been to some small extent noted in the preceding account, but we shall now be able to indicate them more precisely by considering the various groups of Polyzoa in succession. The limit assigned to this article necessitates very large omissions. The reader who wishes to have the fullest information on the many difficult and uncertain matters connected with this subject is referred to Allman, Freshwater Polyzoa (Ray Society, 1856); Hincks, British Marine Polyzoa (Van Voorst, 1880); Haddon, “Budding in Polyzoa,” Quart. Joum. Mier. Sei., 1883; Balfour, Embryology, vol. i. p. 242; and the original memoirs cited by these writers.

THE VERMIFORMIA.

The first section of the Polyzoa comprises but a single genus, Phoronis. It differs from all other Polyzoa first in its greater size (species 2 inches long are known) and elaboration of organization, and correlatively with that in the fact that it does not produce buds. Further, it does not produce a closely adherent cuticular zooecium as do Paludicella and the Eupolyzoa generally, but a leathery tube in which the animal freely moves, resembling that of some Chaetopods (Sabella). Like some Sabellae, Phoronis forms closely packed aggregates of individuals not brought together by any process of budding, but each separately developed from an egg. Phoronis has an elongate, wormlike, unsegmented body, with a conical posterior termination (like Sipunculus), and anteriorly provided with a horse - shoe - shaped crown of tentacles surrounding the mouth (figs. 4, 5). There is an intertentacular “web” between the bases of the tentacles as in the Phylactolaema. Caldwell (6) has recently shown that the tentacles are supported by a mesoblastic skeleton, as is also the case in Rhabdopleura, but apparently not the case in any other Polyzoa. Close to the mouth, as in all Polyzoa, is placed the anus, outside the horse-shoe-shaped lophophore or tentacular platform (fig.

11, i). The tentacular crown is not intro versible; in this point Phoronis differs from Paludicella and the Ectoproctous Eupolyzoa, and agrees with the Entoprocta and the Pterobranchia. Overhanging the mouth is a small praeoral lobe or “epistome” (figs. 4, 5, c). This organ is aborted in Paludicella, and indeed in all the Gymnolaema, but is present in the other Polyzoa, and is especially large and well developed in Rhabdopleura and Cephalodiscus. It has been compared to the Molluscan foot, but undoubtedly in Phoronis it is the persistent representative of the prae-oral [9:19:434] lobe of the larva (fig. 6), and therefore cannot be compared to the Molluscan foot. If we are right in associating Phoronis with the Polyzoa, this fact is sufficient to show that the epistome of the Phylactolaema (fig. 11, e) and the buccal shield of Rhabdopleura (fig. 7, <Z) and of Cephalodiscus (fig. 9, ό) are also cephalic in nature, and cannot rightly be identified with the post-oral and ventral muscular lobe known as the foot in Mollusca. A circum-oral nerve ring occurs at the base of the tentacles and sends off a cord which runs along the left side of the body. The alimentary canal presents the same general form and regions as in Paludicella. It hangs in the body-cavity, to the walls of which it is suspended by definite mesenteries.Phoronis presents a closed contractile vascular system containing red-coloured blood-corpuscles (figs. 4, 5, f, g, h). A pair of ciliated canals acting as genital pores is found near the anus; these have been shown by Caldwell to be typical nephridia.The development of Phoronis is remarkable. The egg gives rise (after the usual phases of cleavage and gastrulation) to the larval form knoλvn as Actinotrocha (fig. 6). This larva possesses a hood-like region overhanging the mouth and a number of ciliated post-oral processes or tentacles. The anus is placed at the extremity of the elongate body opposite to that bearing the mouth and prae-oral hood. The prae-oral hood becomes the epistome, and the tentacles, by further development (new tentacles replacing the larval ones), become the horse-shoe-shaped group of tentacles of the adult. A very curious process of growth changes the long axis of the body and results in the anus assuming its permanent position near the mouth. An invagination appears on the ventral face of the larva between the anus and mouth, and attains considerable size. At a definite moment in the course of growth this invagination is suddenly everted, carrying with it in its cavity the intestine in the form of a loop. Thus a new long axis is suddenly established at right angles to the original oro-anal axis, and continues to develop as the main portion of the body. The short area extending from the prae-oral hood to the anus is thus the true dorsal surface of Phoronis, whilst the elongated body is an outgrowth of the ventral surface perpendicular to the primary oro-anal axis, as conversely in many Mollusca we find a short ventral area (the foot) between mouth and anus, and an outgrowth of the dorsal surface (the visceral hump) perpendicular to the primary oro-anal axis, forming the chief body of the animal. In these relations Phoronis (and with it the other Polyzoa) agrees with Sipunculus. On the other hand Echiurus, the Chaetopods, Nemertine worms, and some other groups which start from a simple larval form not unlike that of Phoronis, present a continual elongation of the original oro-anal axis, and no transference of the long axis by the perpendicular or angular growth of either the ventral or the dorsal surface of the larva.

Phoronis was discovered originally in the Firth of Forth by Dr Strethill Wright. It occurs in the Mediterranean and in Australian seas (Port Jackson).

THE PTEROBRANCHIA.

This section of the Polyzoa also comprises forms which differ very widely from Paludicella. Inasmuch as their development from the egg is at present quite unknown, it may possibly prove that they have other affinities. Only two genera are known, Rhabdopleura (Allman) and Cephalodiscus (MTntosh), the former dredged by Dr Norman in deep water off the Shetlands (and subsequently in Norway), the latter taken by the “Challenger” expedition in 250 fathoms off the coast of Patagonia.

The Pterobranchia have the mouth and anus closely approximated, and immediately below the mouth are given off a series of ciliated tentacles, but these do not form a complete circle as in Paludicella, nor is the lophophore (the platform of their origin) horse-shoe-shaped as in Phoronis. The lophophore is drawn out into a right and a left arm in Rhabdopleura (fig. 7), upon each of which are two rows of ciliated tentacles; no tentacles are developed centrally in the region between the two arms, so that the mouth is not completely surrounded by these processes. The horseshoe-shaped lophophore of Phoronis could be modified so as to represent the tentaculiferous arms of Rhabdopleura by suppressing both rows of tentacles at the curve of the horse-shoe, and leaving only those which occur on the arms or rami of the horse shoe (see fig. 4). The lophophore of Cephalodiscus presents us with twelve processes, each carrying two rows of ciliated tentacles; in fact we have six pairs of tantaculiferous arms instead of a single pair, and each of these arms is precisely similar to one of the arms of Rhabdopleura (fig. 9), excepting that it terminates in a knob instead of tapering. There is no arrangement for introverting the anterior portion of the body into the hinder portion in the Pterobranchia.

The little epistome or prae-oral lobe of Phoronis is represented in the Pterobranchia by a large muscular shield or disk-like structure (fig. 7, d and fig. 9, δ) which overhangs the mouth and has an actively secreting glandular [9:19:435] surface by which the tube or case (tubarium) in which the polypide is enclosed is secreted.Both Rhabdopleura and Cephalodiscus produce colonies by budding; but the colonies of the former are large, definite, and arborescent, whilst those of Cephalodiscus are remarkable for the fact that the buds do not remain long in organic continuity with their parent, but become detached and nevertheless continue to be enclosed by the same common envelope or secretion. The bud-formation of Rhabdopleura recalls that of Paludicella in the fact that it leads to the formation of continuous arboriform communities. That of Cephalodiscus resembles the budding of Loxosoma, since no two fully-formed individuals remain in organic continuity. Both Rhabdopleura and Cephalodiscus (like Phoronis) produce cases or investments in which they dwell. These are free secretions of the organism, and are not, like the coenoecia of Eupolyzoa, cuticular structures adherent to and part of the polypide’s integument. The dwelling of Rhabdopleura is a branched system of annulated tubes of a delicate membranous consistency, each tube corresponding to a single polypide, the rings of which it is built being successively produced at the termination of the tube by the secreting activity of the prae-oral disk (fig. 7, E). The polypides freely ascend and descend in these tubes owing to the contractility of their stalks. On the other hand the dwelling of Cephalodiscus is a gelatinous, irregularly branched, and fimbriated mass (fig. 8), excavated by numerous cavities which communicate with the exterior. In these cavities are found the numerous detached small colonies of Cephalodiscus (fig. 9), or we should rather say the isolated budding polypides. The remaining important feature in the organization of the Pterobranchia, namely, the parts connected with the formation of buds, are best understood by first examining Cephalodiscus. The body of Cephalodiscus is seen (fig. 9) to be an oval sac; in this is suspended the U-shaped alimentary canal, and from the walls of its cavity (coelom) the ova and the spermatozoa are developed. Projecting from the ventral face of this oval sac is a muscular cylindrical stalk, into which the viscera do not pass, though the coelom is continued into it (fig. 9, c). This stalk is merely the outdrawn termination of the body. It is about as long as the whole of the rest of the animal, and it is from its extremity that the buds are produced (fig.

9, a). Before the buds have attained half the size of their parent they become detached, but continue to occupy some portion of the common gelatinous dwelling.

Turning to Rhabdopleura, we find that each polypide has a body of similar shape and character to that described for Cephalodiscus, and a similar ventrally developed u stalk ' ’ (fig. 7, A, c). But, inasmuch as the buds developed[9:19:436] on the stalk of a Rhabdopleura polypide do not detach themselves, we find that we can trace the stalk of each polypide of a colony into connexion with the stalk of the polypide from which it was originally budded, which may now be considered as a “branch” bearing manystalked polypides upon its greatly extended length, and such a “branch-stalk” may be further traced to its junction with the “stem-stalk” of the whole colony. The stem-stalk was at one time the simple terminal stalk of a single polypide, but by lateral budding it gave rise to other polypides, and so became a gemmiferous “branch”; and further, when some of these in their turn budded and became branches, it became the main “stem” of a copious colony.

A serious error has been made in comparing the contractile stalk of the Pterobranchiate polypide to the “funiculus ” or cord-like mesentery of Eupolyzoa. With this it has morphologically nothing in common, since it is not an internal organ, but simply the elongated termination or stalk of the body, comparable to the stalk of Pedicellina (fig. 15) and Loxosomι (fig. 16), or to the hydrocaulus of such a Hydrozoon colony as Cordylophora. The stalk where it bears only very young buds, or none at all,⅛s is always its condition in Cephalodiscus and in many polypides of a Rhabdopleura colony, may be called a “gymnocaulus”; when once its buds have developed into full grown polypides, and it has elongated proportionally with their growth, it becomes a “pectocaulus”; that is to say, it is to that part of it which bears such polypides that this term may be conveniently applied. The pectocaulus of Rhabdopleura, both in the form of branch and stem, undergoes remarkable change of appearance as compared with the gymnocaulus. It loses its contractility, shrinks, and develops on its surface a hard, dark, horny cuticle (whence its name), comparable precisely in its nature to the hardened cuticle which forms the zooecia of Eupolyzoa. It now has the appearance of a black cord or rod-like body lying within and adherent to the inner face of the much wider tubular stem, and branches formed by the gradual building up and arborescent extension of the annotated tubarium secreted by the individual polypides. It has been regarded both by Allman and by Sars as a special structure, and called by the former “the chitinous rod” or “blastophore,” by the latter “the axial cord.”

In reality it is the black-coloured pectocaulus of Rhabdopleura which corresponds to the coenoecium of an ordinary Polyzoon; whilst the term “coenoecium” is totally inapplicable morphologically to the annulated branched tube in which the Rhabdopleura colony lives, this having absolutely no parallel in the Eupolyzoa.

A sac-like testis has been discovered in Rhabdopleura opening by the side of the anus (Lankester, 7); but the ova have not yet been seen, nor is anything known of its development. Similarly the eggs of Cephalodiscus are observed within the body of the parent in the “Challenger” specimens, but nothing further is known of its life-history.

A body-cavity is present (Lankester), though its existence has been denied by Sars and by M*Intosh. Nephridia and nerve ganglia are not described. Cephalodiscus has two remarkable eye spots dorsal to the cephalic disk (fig. 10, y).

THE EUPOLYZOA.

Whilst it is necessary to include in the group Polyzoa the forms we have already noticed as Vermiformia and Pterobranchia, there can be no doubt that those organisms to which we assign the name Eupolyzoa are primarily those upon which naturalists have framed their conception of the group, and that they constitute a very consistent assemblage, held together by well-defined characters, and yet presenting an immense number of varied forms showing a wide range of modifications.

All the Eupolyzoa have closely approximated mouth and anus, and, like Paludicella, a complete range of hollow ciliate tentacles, describing either a circle or a horse shoe, surrounding the mouth. The anus as well as the mouth is included in this area in a few exceptional forms (the Entoprocta); it lies near but outside the lophophore (as the area is termed) in the vast majority (the Ectoprocta). Except in the Entoprocta, where the movement is limited, the whole anterior portion of the body bearing the lophophore can be invaginated into the hinder part (as described above for the typical Eupolyzoon Paludicella). This character distinguishes the Eupolyzoa from both Vermiformia and Pterobranchia. The polypides of all the Eupolyzoa are minute, but all produce buds which remain in organic continuity with their parent (except in Loxosoma) and build up very considerable and sometimes massive colonies.

In all Eupolyzoa the cuticle of the hinder part of each polypide is thick and dense, thus forming a hard-walled sac, the zooecium. This is peculiar to and universal in the Eupolyzoa (except Loxosoma), and is not to be confounded with the non-adherent tubes of Phoronis and Rhabdopleura or the jelly-house of Cephalodiscus. The connected zooecia of a colony of Eupolyzoa constitute a coenoecium. A simple nerve ganglion between mouth and anus, a large body-cavity (except in Entoprocta), simple gonads without accessory glands or ducts, usually testis and ovary in the same polypide, absence of a blood-vascular system, of any but the most rudimentary nephridia, and of eyes, otocysts, or other special sense-organs, are features characterizing all adult Eupolyzoa.

The section Eupolyzoa, with its vast number of species and genera, requires a somewhat elaborate classification. The forms in which the anus is enclosed within the tentacular circle are very few, and are peculiar in other respects. We follow Nitsche (8) in separating them as the sub-class Entoprocta from the majority of Eupolyzoa forming the sub-class Ectoprocta.

Sub-class 1. Ectoprocta, Nitsche.

Eupolyzoa with the anus not included within the area of the lophophore. Anterior portion of the body of the normal polypide introversible. Tentacles not individually capable of being coiled or flexed.

Order 1. Phylactolaema, Allman.

Ectoproctous Eupolyzoa in which the polypide possesses a prae-oral lobe or epistome, similar to that of Phoronis, and comparable to the more highly developed buccal shield or disk of the Pterobranchia. Lophophore (except in Fredericella, where it is nearly circular) horse-shoe-shaped (hippocrepian). Polypides of a colony equi-formal, that is, not differentiated in structure and function. Neighbouring zooecia are in free and open communication, the bud never becoming shut off by a perforated cuticular plate from its parent. Cuticle of the zooecia either gelatinous or horny, forming massive or else arborescent coenoecia, in one genus [9:19:437] (Cristatella) having the form of a plano-convex ellipse and locomotive (fig. 3). In addition to the multiplication of polypides in a colony by budding, and to the annual production of new individuals from fertilized eggs which initiate new colonies, a reproduction by internal buds called “statoblasts,” comparable to the gemmae of Spongilla, has been observed in all the genera (fig. 3, δ). The statoblasts are developed from the funiculus (mesentery), and are enclosed in ornate lenticular capsules of chitinous substance, characteristic in form in each species.

The fertilized egg of the Phylactolaema does not give rise to a zonociliate larva, but to a uniformly ciliate cystlike diblastula, which develops directly and produces polypides by budding. The Phylactolaema are all inhabitants of fresh water (lacustrine).

The Phylactolaema include the genera Lophopus, Cristatella, Alcyonella, Plumatelia, and Fredericella, which have been beautifully figured and described in Allman’s classical Freshwater Polyzoa, Bay Society, 1856. The colonies of Lophopus are small, consisting of half a dozen polypides embedded in a massive glass-like coenoecium. Cristatella (fig. 3) is remarkable amongst all Polyzoa for its locomotive zoarium. Alcyonella forms massive coenoecia of many hundred polypides, as large as a man’s fist. Plumatella and Fredericella are delicate arborescent forms commonly encrusting stones and the leaves of water-plants. All the genera known are British.

The Phylactolaema furnish a remarkable instance of a well-marked zoological group being confined to fresh water. Their reproduction by statoblasts (not known in the marine Polyzoa) appears to be related to the special conditions of lacustrine life, since it is also observed under· the same exceptional conditions in the single freshwater genus of another great group of animals, viz., Spongilla. Also related to their non-marine conditions of life is the development of the fertilized egg, which, as in so many similar-cases, does not produce the remarkable banded forms of locomotive larvae which are characteristic of their marine congeners.

Order 2. Gymnolaema, Allman.

Ectoproctous Eupolyzoa in which the polypide is devoid of any trace of the prae-oral lobe or epistome, whilst the lophophore is perfectly circular. The polypides of a colony are frequently highly differentiated as avicularia, vibracu laria, ocecia (egg-receptacles), and even as root and stem segments. The neighbouring polypides of a colony communicate (?) with one another by “rosette-plates” or “communication-plates ”—perforated areas in the walls of contiguous zocecia. The greatest variety in the character of the cuticle forming the zooecia (gelatinous, horny, calcareous) and in the grouping of the polypides, as well as in the shape of their zocecia, is observed in different sub-orders and families. In addition to the ordinary sexual reproduction, there are various modifications of the process of budding, the full exposition of which would necessitate more space than is here allotted, and is not yet indeed within the possibilities of present knowledge. The fertilized egg of the Gymnolaema gives rise to remarkable ciliate larvae of various forms (figs. 19, 20, 21), from which the first polypide of a colony is developed by an extraordinary and unexplained series of changes. The Gymnolaema are, with the single exception of the genus Paludicella, inhabitants of the sea.

The Gymnolaema are divided, according to the system of Busk, into three sub-orders characterized by the shape of their zooecia, and the nature of the mouth-like margin which it presents when the exsertile portion of the polypide is withdrawn within it. The Cyclostoma have long tubular zocecia, often of large size and often calcified, placed side by side in cylindrical bundles, or in other definite grouping; the mouth of the zooecium is circular and devoid of processes. There is little or no differentiation of the polypides constituting a colony. Most of this group are fossil, and the living genera belong mostly to southern seas. The genera Crisia (fig. 13, A), Diastopora, Tubulipora, and Hornera are typical. The Ctenostoma have usually a soft zooecium; its orifice is closed by the folds of the retracted polypide or by a circlet of bristles which surround it. Alcyonidium gelatinosum is the commonest representative of this group on the British coasts. Bowerbankia (fig. 1, A) and Paludicella (fig. 1, E) also belong here. The Chilostoma form the largest and most varied suborder of Gymnolaema. The zooecia are horny or calcified; their orifices can be closed by a projecting lip in the form of an operculum. The operculum is a separable plate developed on the cuticle of the retractile part of the polypide, and has muscles attached to it (fig. 13, B, C, D). The surface of the zooecia is frequently sculptured, and its orifice provided with processes and spines (fig. 1, C, F). Very usually some of the polypides of a colony are modified asavicularia, vibracula ria, radical fibres, and ocecia. The avicularium is a polypide reduced to a simple muscular apparatus working upon the modified operculum and zooecium so as to cause these hard parts to act as a snapping apparatus comparable to a bird’s head (fig. 12, o). They are frequently found regularly distributed among the normal cells of a colony, and probably have a cleansing function similar to that attributed to the Pedicellariae of the Echinoderms. “Vibracularia” are even more simplified polypides, being little more than motile filaments, probably tactile in function. The opercula of zocecia, ocecia, and avicularia have recently been used by Busk in characterizing genera and species, in a systematic way. Stem-building and root-forming polypides are frequently found, being closed polypides which subserve anchoring or supporting functions for the benefit of the whole colony. The stem of Kinetoskias (fig. 14) is produced [9:19:438] in this way. The Chilostonm include a large series of genera arranged in the sections Cellularina, Flustrina, Escharina, and

Celleporina. For the systematic description of the highly complex and very varied colonial skeletons or coenoecia of the Gymnolaema, the reader is referred to the works of Busk (9), Hincks (10), Smitt (11), and Heller (12). See also Ehlers (13) on Hypophorella.

Sub-class 2. Entoprocta, Nitsche.

Eupolyzoa in which the anal aperture lies close to the mouth within the tentacular area or lophophore. Lophophore sunk within a shallow basin formed by the inversion of the broad truncated extremity of the cup-shaped body. Tentacular crown not further introversible, the individual tentacles (as in the Pterobranchia and unlike the Ectoprocta) capable of being flexed and partially rolled up so as to overhang the mouth (see fig. 15, B and C). Bodycavity (ccelom) almost completely obliterated. The anti-tentacular region of the polypide’s body is drawn out to form a stalk similar to the gymnocaulus of the Pterobranchia. The extremity of this stalk is provided with a cement gland in the young condition which persists in the adult of some species (Loxosoma neapolitanum, fig. 16, sks). Cuticular investment (zooecium) of the polypides feebly developed. A pair of small nephridia are present.

The Entoprocta consist of the marine genera Pedicellina (fig. 15), Loxosoma (fig. 16), and probably the insufficiently known freshwater American genus Urnatelia of Leidy. To these must be added Busk’s new genus Ascopodaria, as yet undescribed, based on a specimen dredged by the “Challenger,” showing a number of Pedicellina-like polypides, carried as an umbel on a common stalk of very peculiar structure. Pedicellina is found attached to algae, shells, zoophytes, <fcc., and to the integument of some Gephyraean worms (Sipunculus punctatus) and Annelids (Aphrodite); Loxosoma occurs on various worms, &c. Whilst the buds of Pedicellina remain connected so as to constitute a colony, those produced by Loxosoma are continually detached, so that the polypide is solitary. Further, the cup-like body of Pedicellina is deciduous, and frequently falls from the stalk and is replaced by new growth. There is less distinction between body and stalk in Loxosoma, and the former does not become detached. Apparently a very important feature in the structure of the Entoprocta is the absence of a body-cavity. This is, however, more, apparent than real. The Entoprocta are true Coelomata, but the ccelom is partially obliterated by the growth of mesoblastic tissue. The nephridia presumably lie in a space which, small as it is, represents the coelom. See Harmer (18) for details.
[9:19:439]

Genealogical Relationships of the Groups of Polyzoa.

It is necessary that we should try to form some opinion as to which of the various groups of Polyzoa are most like the ancestral form from which they have all sprung, and what are the probable lines of descent within the group. Any attempt of the kind is speculative, but it is absolutely needful since zoology has become a science—that is to say, an investigation of causes and not merely a record of unexplained observations—to enter upon such questions. Colonial organisms have necessarily descended from solitary ancestors, and it is probable that the ancestral form of Polyzoa was not only solitary, as are Phoronis and Loxosoma at the present day, but of relatively large size and more elaborately organized than the majority of living Polyzoa. Whilst the polypides have dwindled in size and lost some of their internal organs, the mcdern Polyzoa have developed pari passu with this degeneration an elaborate system of bud-production and colony-formation. The new individuality (the tertiary aggregate) attains a high degree of development (Cristatella, Kinetoskias) in proportion as the constituent units merged in this new individuality have suffered a degeneration. The prae-oral lobe (epistome, buccal disk) present in all Polyzoa except the most minute and most elaborately colonial forms— namely, the Gymnolaema—is to be regarded as an ancestral structure which has been lost by the Gymnolaema. The horse-shoe-shaped lophophore, such as we see it in Phoronis and in Lophopus, is probably the ancestral form, and has given rise to the two other extreme forms of lophophore,— namely, the “pterobranchiate,” associated -with a great development of the epistome, and the “circular,” associated with a complete suppression of the epistome. The ento-proctous lophophore is a special modification of the horseshoe-shaped, as shown in the diagram fig. 15, C. The formation of zooecia, and so of an elaborate colonial skeleton, was not a primary feature of the Polyzoa. Even after budding and colony-formation had been established zooecia were not at once produced, but possibly dwellings of another kind (Pterobranchia). We are thus led to look upon the Gymnolaema as the extreme modification of the Polyzoon type. Starting with an organism similar to Phoronis, we may suppose the following branchings in the pedigree to have occurred.
[table]

Distinctive Characters of the Polyzoa.

From all that has preceded it appears that the really distinctive characters common to all the Polyzoa may be summed up as follows :—

Coelomata with closely approximated mouth and anus, the bulk of the body forming a more or less elongate growth at right angles to the original (ancestral) oro-anal axis, and starting from the original ventral (i.e., oral) surface. A variously modified group of ciliated tentacles is disposed around the mouth, being essentially the development by digitiform upgrowth of a post-oral ciliated band.
[9:19:440]

As negative characters it is important to note the absence of all trace of metameric segmentation, of setae, and of paired lateral (parapodia of Appendiculata) or median ventral (podium of Mollusca) outgrowths of the body-wall.

Larval Forms of Polyzoa.

In the consideration of the probable pedigree and affinities of the Polyzoa, we are not at present able to make use of the facts of development from the egg, on account of the extreme difficulty which the study of the young stages of these organisms presents. In the case of Phoronis we have the only readily intelligible history. The larva, to start with, is of that form known as an archi-troch (see Lankester, “Notes on Embryology and Classification,” Quart. Journ. Mier. Sci., 1876), having a prae-oral ciliated area (velum or cephalotroch) continuous with a post-oral ciliated band (the branchiotroch), which latter becomes developed into the tentacular crown of the adult.

The actinotrocha (Phoronis) larva is readily comparable with the trochosphere larvae of Echinoderms, Chaetopods, Gephyraeans, and Molluscs. Its special character consists in the strong development of the post-oral ciliated band, whereas the prae-oral ciliated band is in most other classes (the. Sipunculoids excepted) the predominant one. The Phoronis larva exhibits first of all an oro-anal long axis, and this is suddenly abandoned for a new long axis by the growth of the ventral surface of the larva at right angles to the primary axis (hence the term Podaxonia).

In the other Polyzoa we do not at present know of any larva which retains even in its earliest phases the original oro-anal long axis. They all appear to start at once with the peculiar and secondary long axis of the adult Phoronis, so that Balfour has diagrammatically represented the Polyzoon larva by the sketch given in fig. 19. This diagram applies, however, more especially to the Entoprocta, since the anus is represented as included in the area of the post-oral ciliated ring. The development of Pedicellina has been very carefully followed by Hatschek, and may be said to be the only instance among the Eupolyzoa in which the growth of the different organs and the consequent relation of the form of the larva to the form of the adult is understood (see figs. 17 and 18).

In the other Polyzoa, in spite of the painstaking and minute studies of Barrois (14), the fact is that we do not know what face of the larva corresponds to the tentacular area, what to the stalk or anti-tentacular extremity, what to the anterior and what to the posterior surface. The conversion of the larva into the first polypide has not been observed in the case of these free-swimming forms, and it is even probable that no such conversion ever takes place, but that the first polypide forms as a bud upon the bodywall of the larva.

Two of the most remarkable forms of free-swimming larvae of Gymnolaema are represented in figs. 20 and 21. In both, in addition to the chief post-oral ciliated band, a smaller ciliated ring is observed, which is identified by Balfour with that which is found at the anti-tentacular extremity (base of the stalk) in the Pedicellina larva.

It does not seem justifiable, in the face of the existing uncertainties as to identification of parts, and in view of the high probability that the Gymnolaema are extremely modified and degenerate forms (a consideration which applies in some respects even more strongly to the Entoprocta), to assume that the larval form schematized in fig. 19 represents an ancestral condition of the Polyzoa. Professor Balfour (15) was, however, led to entertain such a view; and, assuming that the chief ciliated band (drawn as a broad black line) corresponds to the single prae-oral ciliated band of the trochosphere larva of Eehiurus, Polygordius, Chaetopods, and Mollusca, he pointed out that in both cases the ciliated girdle divides the larva into a hemisphere in which mouth and anus lie and a hemisphere which is the complement of this; in most classes the first hemisphere elongates and forms the bulk of the body, whilst the second hemisphere forms the prostomium or prae-oral lobe. But, according to Balfour’s theory, in Polyzoa it is the second hemisphere which enlarges and becomes the stalk-like body of the adult, whilst the first hemisphere remains small and insignificant. Thus the Polyzoa would fix themselves in later growth by what corresponds to the head or prostomium of other animals, as do the Barnacles and the Ascidians. Ingenious as this speculation is, we must remember that it takes no account of the facts known as to Phoronis, nor of the Pterobranchia, and that it is confessedly based upon the assumption that the larvae of extremely degenerate and peculiar members of the group are not adaptive and modified, but retain primary and archaic characters. Further, it is to be distinctly borne in mind that the interpretation of parts upon which this speculation rests is, except in the case of Pedicellina, altogether hypothetical.

Relations of the Polyzoa to the Brachiopoda.

The Polyzoa were first associated with the Brachiopoda by H. Milne-Edwards. The investigation of the development of Terebratulina by Morse (16) led to a further perception of the points of agreement in structure between these two groups. Lastly, Caldwell (6) has shown that the mesenteries of Phoronis have precisely similar relations to the lophophore, the nephridia, and the termination of the intestine as have the gastro-parietal and ilio-ρarietal bands or mesenteries of the Terebratulidae. The young Terebratulina (fig. 22) may be readily compared with Loxosoma (fig. 16),—the peduncle with its cement glands in the former being identical with the stalk and basal gland of the latter. The form of the alimentary canal [9:19:441] and the disposition of the tentacular arms (fig. 23) is the same in Brachiopoda and Polyzoa. The nephridia (oviducts) of Terebratula have a position and relations similar to those of the nephridia (genital ducts) of Phoronis. The chief difference between Polyzoa and Brachiopoda consists in the special development of the margin of the cupped end of the body, into which the lophophore is sunk, as in Pedicellina (see fig. 15, B, c). This up-standing margin is enormously increased in the Brachiopoda, so as to form a voluminous hood or collar, which surrounds the large tentacular arms, and forms a protective chamber for them. It is notched right and left so as to be divided into two lobes, and on its surface is developed a horny or a calcareous shell in two corresponding moieties. Until recently it was held (see Lankester, 17) that both Brachiopoda and Polyzoa were modifications of the Molluscan type, and the Brachiopods’ collar was identified with the palliai fold of Mollusca. The resemblance of the two structures must now be considered as purely homoplastic, and not as having any real morphological (homogenetic) significance.

The larvae of the Brachiopoda (figs. 24, 25) are as exceptional and difficult of interpretation as those of Polyzoa, but no attempt has been yet made to show that the one can be reduced to a common form with the other. The three segments presented by some Brachiopod larvae (fig. 25) have been compared to the segments of Chaetopod worms by some writers; and these, together with the presence of setae, have been regarded as indicative of affinity between the Brachiopoda and Chaetopoda (Morse). But it is sufficient, in order to dispose of this suggestion, to point out that the segments of the Chaetopoda follow one another along the primary oro-anal axis, whilst those of Brachiopoda are developed along an axis at right angles to this (Caldwell).

The Brachiopoda must be classified together with the Polyzoa and Sipunculoidea in a phylum (Podaxonia) characterized by the development of this secondary axis.
