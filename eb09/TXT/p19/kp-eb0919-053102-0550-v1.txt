PORTO ALEGRE, a city and seaport of Brazil, the capital of the province of Rio Grande do Sul, lies in 30° 2' S. lat. and 51° 12' W. long, at the northern extremity of the Lagoa dos Patos (Duck Lagoon), where it receives the waters of the Jacuhi, Sino, Cahi, and Gravatahi, whose confluence opposite the city is sometimes distinguished by the name of Lagôa Viamâo. Like the other towns on this lagoon, Rio Grande do Sul and Pelotas, Porto Alegre is the seat of a very considerable trade, but it is impossible to say precisely what share belongs to each of the three. (See Rio Grande do Sül.) Its harbour is accessible to vessels drawing 10 to 12 feet; it is the terminus of a railway running by Sao Leopoldo to Neuhamburg; and it serves as a centre for the various German colonies in the province. A cathedral, a seminary, a lyceum, a provincial library, government offices, a theatre, a large hospital, and a market-house are among the public buildings. The population is about 25,000.

Porto Alegre was founded in 1743 by immigrants from the Azores, and was at first known as Porto dos Cazaes. In 1770 it was chosen by José Marcellino de Figuereido as his residence and obtained its present name. Three years later it had 5000 inhabitants. The title of “town” with the full name Sâo José de Porto Alegre was bestowed in 1808, and in 1812 Sâo José became the governor’s residence for the comarca, which till 1821 comprised both Rio Grande do Sul and Santa Catharina. In 1822 it was raised to the rank of a city, and in 1841, as a reward for its loyalty, was distinguished with the epithets “leal y valorosa.”
