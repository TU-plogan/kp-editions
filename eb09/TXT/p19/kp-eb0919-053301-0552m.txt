PORT ROYAL, a town and naval station of Jamaica, occupies the outer end of a narrow strip of land called the “Palisades,” which, projecting westward for about 9 miles, forms the natural breakwater of the noble bay on which Kingston, the present capital of the island, is built. As a town Port Royal (though in the 17 th century it was reputed the finest in the West Indies) is now a wretched place of 1205 inhabitants (1881), with narrow and extremely dirty streets, and contains no buildings of note except a hospital (200 patients) and the spacious admiralty house, which is surrounded by beautiful gardens; but as a naval station it is still of very considerable importance, has well-equipped machine-shops, and is defended by a number of forts and batteries partly of quite modern erection.

The first great blow struck at the prosperity of Port Royal was the earthquake of 1692, which swallowed up whole streets and forts and sunk a considerable part of the site into the sea, where remains of buildings are still visible under water in clear weather. In 1703 the whole town, except the royal forts and magazines, was reduced to ashes; on 22d August 1722 most of the houses were swept into the sea by a hurricane; in 1815 another conflagration proved nearly as destructive as the first; and in 1880 another hurricane did grievous damage.
