PONTIFEX. The principal college of priests in ancient Rome consisted of the pontifices, the rex sacrorum, and the famines, under the headship of the pontifex maximus. The rex sacrorum was the functionary who under the republic succeeded to the sacrificial duties which in old time had been performed by the king; the fiamines were sacrificial priests of particular gods, the most important being the flamen Dialis, or priest of Jupiter, whose wife, the flaminica Dialis, was priestess of Juno. The pontifices on the other hand were not assigned to the service of particular gods, but performed general functions of the state religion; and their head, the pontifex maximus, was the highest religious authority in the state. For, while the rex sacrorum succeeded to the liturgical functions of the king, it was the pontifex maximus who inherited the substance of power in sacred things; the other members of the college were his counsellors and helpers, but no more. It is probable that there was no supreme pontifex under the kings, but that in accordance with the general rule that sacred officers went in threes, following the number of the old tribes, the king sat as sixth and chief among the five pontifices whom Numa is said to have instituted. The functions of pontifex maximus were indeed too weighty to be discharged by a subject in a monarchical government, and from Augustus to Gratian (382 a.d.) this supreme priesthood was held by the emperors in person. The original idea of the pontificate is as obscure as the name; it is by no means certain that pontifex means bridge-maker (as the commonest etymology has it) with reference to the duty of maintenance of the sacred Sublician bridge, for there were pontifices from of old in other parts of Italy. Marquardt conjectures that the name originally denoted atoning functions, from the same root as appears in purus, poena. In historical times the pontifices had a very extended sphere of duties, and claimed to possess professional “knowledge of things human and divine.” The supreme pontiff was in the religion of the state what the father was in the religion of the family. His dwelling was in the regia close to the altar of Vesta, the sacred hearth of the state; and the most sacred objects of national worship, the penates publici and the mysterious palladia of Roman sovereignty, were his special care. The flamens and vestal virgins were appointed by him and stood under his paternal power, and the stated service of their cults, as well as those exercises of public religion for which no special priests were provided, were under his charge or that of the college in which he presided. The pontiffs, moreover, supplied technical guidance and help in those religious functions in which the senate or magistrates had the first part; while the charge of the calendar with its complicated intercalation and system of feast days gave them an important influence on affairs of civil life. The control of the calendar is closely connected with the duties pertaining to the pontifical archives, which, besides a mass of ritual directions and the like, embraced the calendars of past years (including the fasti consulares) and the annales maximi or annual chronicle of public events. Further the pontiffs had the weighty function of [9:19:456] declaring and interpreting the laws of religion, which involved such important social matters as marriage and testamentary dispositions; but this function was declaratory and not magisterial; the state gave no executive power to the pontiffs, save only that the pontifex maximus exercised disciplinary authority over those priestly persons who stood under his paternal power. The pontiffs, who held office for life, originally filled up the vacancies in their number by cooptation, but as early as 212 b.c. the head of their college was named by the voice of the people, and in 104 b.c. the choice of the members of the priestly colleges was also transferred to comitia of a peculiar constitution. The number of pontifices was gradually enlarged, first to nine and then, under Sulla, to fifteen, and the emperors exercised the right of adding supernumeraries at will.
