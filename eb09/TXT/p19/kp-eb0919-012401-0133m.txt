PISANO, Vittore (c. 1380-1456), commonly called Pisanello, the greatest of Italian medallists, was a native of San Vigilio sul Lago in the territory of Verona. Specimens of his work as a painter are still extant in Rome, Venice, Verona, and Pistoia, and entitle him to a place of some distinction in the history of that art. The National Gallery in London possesses a very fine specimen of Pisanello’s work—a panel painted with miniature-like delicacy. For his pre-eminent position as a medallist, see Numismatics, vol. xvii. p. 657. During the latter portion of his life he lived in Rome, where he enjoyed great repute.
