INDIA INDIA is a grbat empire of Asia, composed of twelve provinces under direct British administration, and about one hundred and fifty feudatory states and principalities, which equally with the British provinces acknowledge the paramount sovereignty of the British crown. The whole empire contains close on 1⅛ million square miles, and 240 millions of inhabitants. The area, therefore, is almost equal to, and the population is just equal to, the area and population of all Europe, less Russia. The people exactly double Gibbon’s estimate of 120 millions for all the races and nations which obeyed Imperial Rome.

The Name.— The natives of India can scarcely be said to have a word of their own by which to express their common country. In Sanskrit, it would be called “Bhârata-varsha,” from Bharata, a legendary monarch of the Lunar line; but Sanskrit is no more the vernacular of India than Latin is of Europe. The name “Hindustân,” which was at one time adopted by European geographers, is of Persian origin, meaning “the land of the Hindus,” as Afghanistan means “the laud of the Afghans.” According to native usage, however, “Hindustân” is limited either to that portion of the peninsula lying north of the Vindhyâ mountains, or yet more strictly to the upper basin of the Ganges where Hindi is the spoken language. The “East Indies,” as opposed to the “West Indies,” is an old-fashioned and inaccurate phrase, dating from the dawn of maritime discovery, and still lingering in certain parliamentary papers. “India,” the abstract form of a word derived through the Greeks from the Persicized form of the Sanskrit sindhu i a “river,” pre-eminently the Indus, has become familiar since the British acquired the country, and is now officially recognized in the imperial title of the sovereign.

The Country. General Outline.— India, as thus defined, is the middle of the three irregularly shaped peninsulas which jut out southwards from the mainland of Asia, thus corresponding roughly to the peninsula of Italy in the map of Europe. Its form is that of a great triangle, with its base resting upon the Himâlayan range, and its apex running far into the ocean. The chief part of its western side is washed by the Arabian Sea, and the chief part of its eastern side by the Bay of Bengal. It extends from the 8th to the 35th degree of north latitude, that is to say, from the hottest regions of the equator to far within the temperate zone. The capital, Calcutta, lies in 88° E. long.; so that when the sun sets at six o’clock there, it is just past mid-day in England, and early morning in New York. The length of India from north to south, and its greatest breadth from east to west, are both about 1900 miles; but the triangle tapers with a pear-shaped curve to a point at Cape Comorin, its southern extremity. To this compact dominion the English have added, under the name of British Burmah, the strip of country on the eastern shores of the Bay of Bengal. But on the other hand, the adjacent island of Ceylon has been artificially severed, and placed under the colonial office. Two groups of islands in the Bay of Bengal, the Andamans and the Nicobars; one group in the Arabian sea, the Laccadives; and the outlying station of Aden at the mouth of the Red Sea, are all politically included within the Indian empire; while dots on the shore of the peninsula itself, representing Portuguese and French settlements, break at intervals the continuous line of British territory.

India is shut off from the rest of Asia on the north by a vast mountainous region, known in the aggregate as the Himâlayas, amid which lie the independent states of Bhutân and Nepâl, with the great table-land of Tibet behind. The native principality of Kashmir occupies the north-western angle of India, with Eastern Turkestân stretching to the north beyond it. At this north-western angle (in 35° N. lat., 74° E. long.) the mountains curve southwards, and India is separated by the well-marked ranges of the Sufed Koh and Sulâimân from Afghânistân; and by a southern continuation of lower hills (the Hâlas,&c.) from Baluchistân. The last part of the western land frontier of India is formed by the river Hab, and the boundary ends at Cape Monze, at the mouth of its estuary, in 24° 50' N. lat., 66° 38' E. long. Still farther southwards, India is bounded along the W. and S.W. by the Arabian Sea and Indian Ocean. Turning northwards from the southern extremity at Cape Comorin (8° 4' 20" N. lat., 77° 35' 35" E. long.), the long sea-line of the Bay of Bengal forms the main part of its eastern boundary. But on the north-east, as on the northwest, India has again a land frontier. The Himâlayan ranges at the north-eastern angle (in about 28° N. lat., 97° E. long.) throw off spurs and chains to the south-east. These spurs, which have been but imperfectly explored, and may possibly constitute an independent mountain system, separate the British provinces of Assam and Eastern Bengal from Independent Burmah. They are known successively as the Abar, Nâgà, Patkoi, and Barel ranges. Turning almost due south in 25° lat., they culminate in the Blue Mountain (7100 feet), in 22° 37' N. lat., 93° 10' E. long., and then stretch southwards under the name of the Arakan Yomas, separating British Burmah from Independent Burmah, until they again rise into the mountain of Myeng-mateng (4700 feet), in 19⅜° of N. lat. Up to this point, the eastern frontier follows, generally speaking, the watershed which divides the river systems of the Brahmaputra, Meghna, Kuladan (Koladyne), <fcc., in Bengal and British Burmah, from the Irawadi basin in Independent Burmah. But from near the base of the Myeng-mateng Mountain, in about 19^ o lat., the British frontier stretches almost due east, in an artificial line which divides the lower districts and delta of the Irawadi in British Burmah from the middle and upper districts of that river in Independent Burmah. Stretching south-eastwards from the delta of the Irawadi, a confused succession of little explored ranges separates the British province of Tenasserim from the native kingdom of Siam. The boundary line runs down to Point Victoria at the extremity of Tenasserim (9° 59' N. lat., 98° 32' E. long.), following in a somewhat rough manner the watershed between the rivers of the British territory on the west and of Siam on the east.

The empire included within these boundaries is rich in varieties of scenery and climate, from the highest mountains in the world to vast river deltas raised only a few inches above the level of the sea. It forms a continent rather than a country. But if we could look down on the whole from a balloon, we should find that India consists of three separate and well-defined tracts. The first includes the lofty Himâlaya mountains, which shut it out from the rest of Asia; and which, although for the most part beyond the British frontier, form an overruling factor in the physical geography of northern India. The second region stretches southwards from the base of the Himâlayas, and comprises the plains of the great rivers which issue from them. The third region slopes upward again from the edge of the river plains, and consists of a high three-sided table-land, supported by the Vindhyâ mountains on the north, and by the [9:12:732] Eastern and Western Ghâts, which run down the coast on either side till they meet at a point near Cape Comorin. The interior three-sided table-land thus enclosed is broken by peaks and ranges, interspersed with broad expanses of level uplands, and covers the whole southern half of the peninsula.

The first of the three regions is the Himalaya mountains and their offshoots to the southward. The Himalayas— literally, the “Dwelling-place of Snow,” from the Sanskrit hima, frost (Latin, hiems, winter), and dlaya, a house— comprise a system of stupendous ranges, the loftiest in the world. They are the Emodus of Ptolemy (among other names), and extend in the shape of a scimitar, with its edge facing southwards, for a distance of 1500 miles along the northern frontier of India. At the north-eastern angle of that frontier, the Dihang river, the connecting link between the Tsan-pu (Sangpu) of Tibet and the Brahmaputra of Assam, bursts through the main axis of the range. At the opposite or north-western angle, the Indus in like manner pierces the Himälayas, and turns southwards on its course through the Punjab. The Himâlayan region has been fully described in a separate article, vol. xi. p. 821.

This wild region is in many parts impenetrable to man, and nowhere yields a passage for a modern army. It should be mentioned, however, that the Chinese outposts extend as far as a point only 6000 feet above the Gangetic plain, north of Khatmandu. Indeed, Chinese armies have seriously threatened Khatmandu itself; and Sir David Ochterlony’s advance from the plains of Bengal to that city in 1816 is a matter of history. Ancient and well-known trade routes exist, by means of which merchandise from the Punjab finds its way over heights of 18,000 feet into Eastern Turkestan and Tibet. The Muztagh (Snowy Mountain), the Karakoram (Black Mountain), and the Changchenmo are the most famous of these passes.

The Himälayas not only form a double wall along the north of India, but at both their eastern and western extremities send out ranges to the south, which protect its north-eastern and north-western frontiers. On the north-east, those offshoots, under the name of the Nâgâ and Patkoi mountains, &c., form a barrier between the civilized British districts and the wild tribes of Upper Burmah. The southern continuations of these ranges, known as the Yornas, separate British from Independent Burmah, and are crossed by pa ses, the most historic of which, the Aeng or An, rises to 4668 (formerly given at 4517) feet, with gradients of 472 feet to the mile.

On the opposite or north-western frontier of India, the mountainous offshoots run down the entire length of the British boundaries from the Himälayas to the sea. As they proceed southwards, their best marked ranges are in turn known as the Sufed Koh, the Sulâimân, and the Hâla mountains. These massive barriers have peaks of great height, culminating in the Takht-i-Sulâimân or Throne of Solomon, 11,317 feet above the level of the sea. But the mountain wall is pierced at the corner where it strikes southwards from the Himalayas by an opening through which the Kâbul (Cabul) river flows into India. An adjacent opening, the Khyber Pass (rising to 3373 feet), the Kuram Pass to the south of it, the Gwalari Pass near Derâ Ismâil Khân, the Tâl Pass debouching near Derâ Ghâzi Khân, and the famous Bolân Pass (5800 feet at top) still farther south, furnish the gateways between India and Afghanistan. The Hâla, Brahui, and Pab mountains form the southern hilly offshoots between India and Baluchistân, and have a much less elevation.

The wide plains watered by the Himâlayan rivers form the second of the three regions into which we have divided India. They extend from the Bay of Bengal on the east to the Afghân frontier and the Arabian Sea on the west, and contain the richest and most densely crowded provinces of the empire. One set of invaders after another has from prehistoric times entered by the passes at their eastern and north-western frontiers. They followed the courses of the rivers, and pushed the earlier comers southwards before them towards the sea. About 150 millions of people now live on and around these river plains, in the provinces known as the lieutenant-governorship of Bengal, Assam, the North-Western Provinces and Oudh, the Punjab, Sind, Râjputâna, and other native states.

The vast level tract which thus covers northern India is watered by three distinct river systems. One of these systems takes its rise in the hollow trough beyond the Himälayas, and issues through their western ranges upon the Punjab as the Sutlej and Indus. The second of the three river systems also takes its rise beyond the double wall of the Himälayas, not very far from the sources of the Indus and the Sutlej. It turns, however, almost due east instead of west, enters India at the eastern extremity of the Himälayas, and becomes the Brahmaputra of Assam and Eastern Bengal. These rivers collect the drainage of the northern slopes of the Himalayas, and convey it, by long and tortuous although opposite routes, into India. Indeed, the special feature of the Himalayas is that they send down the rainfall from their northern as well as from their southern slopes to the Indian plains. Of the three great rivers of northern India, the two longest, namely the Indus with its feeder the Sutlej and the Brahmaputra, take their rise in the trough on the north of the Himalayas. The third river system of northern India receives the drainage of their southern slopes, and eventually unites into the mighty stream of the Ganges. In this way the rainfall, alike from the northern and southern slopes of the Himälayas, pours down into the river plains of Bengal.

Throughout the river plains of northern India, two harvests, and in some provinces three, are reaped each year. These crops are not necessarily taken from the same land; but in many districts the best fields have to yield two harvests within the twelve months. In Lower Bengal, pease, pulses, oil-seeds, and green crops of various sorts are reaped in spring; the early rice crops in September; the great rice harvest of the year, and other grains, in November and December. Before these last have been gathered in, it is time to prepare the ground for the spring crops, and the Bengal husbandman knows no rest except during the hot weeks of May, when he is anxiously waiting for the rains. But it should always be remembered that rice is the staple crop in only a limited area of India, and that it forms the everyday food of only a comparatively small proportion of the population. It has been estimated that, in the absence of irrigation, the rice crop requires an annual rainfall of at least 36 inches; and an Indian province requires an average fall of not less than 50 or 60 inches in order to grow rice as its staple crop. A line might almost be drawn across Behar, to the north of which the food of the people ceases to be rice and becomes wheat and millets, &c. There are, indeed, great rice-growing tracts in irrigated or low-lying districts of north-western India, but their produce is consumed by the richer classes or exported.

A detailed account of the most important products will be found under the heading of “Agriculture,” fartheron in the present article. They are here alluded to only so far as is necessary to give a general idea of the scenery of the river plains. In the northern and drier regions along the upper courses of the rivers, the country rises gently from their channels in fertile undulations, dotted with mud villages and adorned with noble trees. Mango groves scent the air with their blossom in spring, and yield their abundant fruit [9:12:733] in summer. The spreading banyan, with its colonnades of hanging roots; the stately pipal, with its green masses of foliage; the leafless wild cotton-tree, glowing with heavy crimson flowers; the tall, feathery tamarind, and the quick-growing babul, rear their heads above the fields. As the rivers approach the coast, the palms begin to take possession of the scene. The ordinary landscape in the delta is a flat stretch of rice-fields, fringed round with evergreen masses of bamboos, cocoa-nuts, date-trees, areca, and other coronetted palms. This densely peopled tract seems at first sight bare of villages, for each hamlet is hidden away amid its own grove of plantains and wealthgiving trees. The bamboo and cocoa-nut play a conspicuous part in the industrial life of the people; and the number of products derived from them, including rope, oil, food, and timber, has been dwelt on with admiration by many writers.

The crops also change as we sail down the rivers. In the north, the principal grains are wheat, barley, Indian corn, and a variety of millets, such as joär {Holcus Sorghum) and bdjra (Holcus spicatus). In the delta, on the other hand, rice is the staple crop and the universal diet. In a single district, Rangpur, 295 separate kinds of rice are known to the peasant, who has learned to grow his favourite crop in every locality, from the solid field, which yields the ciman harvest, to the swamps 12 feet deep, on the surface of whose waters the rice ears may be seen struggling upwards for air. Sugar-cane, oil-seeds, flax, mustard, sesamum, palma-christi, cotton, tobacco, indigo, safflower, turmeric, ginger, coriander, capsicum, cummin, and many precious spices and dyes are grown both in the North-Western or Upper Provinces, and in the moister valleys and delta of Lower Bengal. A whole pharmacopoeia of native medicines, from the well-known aloe and castoroil to obscure but valuable febrifuges, is derived from shrubs, herbs, and roots. Resins, gums, varnishes, scents, and a hundred articles of commerce or luxury are collected in the fields or forests. Vegetables of many sorts, both indigenous and imported from Europe, form a large part of the food of the people. The melon and huge yellow pumpkin spread themselves over the thatched roofs; fields of potatoes, yams, and brinjal are attached to the homesteads. The tea-plant is reared on the hilly ranges that skirt the plains both in the north-west and in Assam; the opium poppy about half down the Ganges, around Benares and Patnâ; the silk-worm mulberry still farther down in Lower Bengal; while the jute fibre is essentially a crop of the delta, and would exhaust any soil not fertilized by river floods. Even the jungles yield the costly lac dye and iasar silk cocoons. The mahua, also a product of the jungle, produces the fleshy flowers which form a staple article of food among the hill tribes, and when distilled supply a cheap spirit. The säl, sissu, tun, and many other indigenous trees yield excellent timber. Flowering creepers, of gigantic size and gorgeous colours, festoon the jungle; while each tank bears its own beautiful crop of the lotus and water-lilies. Nearly every vegetable product that feeds and clothes a people, or enables it to trade with foreign countries, abounds.

We come now to the third division of India, namely the three-sided table-land which covers the southern half or more strictly peninsular portion of India. This tract, known in ancient times as the Deccan (Dakshin), literally “the right hand or south,” comprises the Central Provinces, Berar, Madras, Bombay, Mysore, and the native territories of the nizâm, Sindhia, Holkar, and other feudatory states. It had in 1872 an aggregate population of over 90 millions. For the sake of easy remembrance, therefore, we may take the inhabitants of the river plains in the north to be now nearly 150 millions, and those of the southern three-sided table-land at nearly 100 millions. The Deccan, in its local acceptation, is restricted to the high tract between the Narbadâ (Nerbudda) and the Kistnâ rivers; but it is popularly understood to include the whole country south of the Vindhyâs as far as Cape Comorin. It slopes up from the southern edge of the Gangetic plains. Three ranges of hills support its northern, its eastern, and its western side; and the last two meet at a sharp angle near Cape Comorin.

The northern side rests on confused ranges, running with a general direction of east to west, and known in the aggregate as the Vindhyâ mountains. The Vindhyâs, however, are made up of several distinct hill systems. Two sacred peaks guard the flanks in the extreme east and west, with a succession of ranges stretching 800 miles between. At the western extremity, Mount Abu, famous for its exquisite Jain temples, rises, as a solitary outpost of the Aravalli hills, 5650 feet above the Râjputâna plain, like an island out of the sea. Beyond the southern limits of that plain, the Vindhyâ range of modern geography runs almost due east from Guzerat, forming the northern wall of the Narbadâ valley. The Sâtpura mountains stretch also east and west to the south of that river, and form the watershed between it and the Tâpti. Towards the heart of India the eastern extremities of these two converge in the highlands of the Central Provinces and their lofty level plains. Passing still farther east, the hill system finds a continuation in the Kâimur range and its congeners, which eventually end in the outlying peaks and spurs that form the western boundary of Lower Bengal, and abut on the old course of the Ganges under the name of the Râjraahâl hills. On the extreme east, Mount Pârasnâth—like Mount Abu on the extreme west, sacred to Jain rites— rises to 4400 feet above the level of the Gangetic plains. The various ranges of the Vindhyâs, from 1500 to over 4000 feet high, form, as it were, the northern wall and buttresses which support the central table-land. Though now pierced by road and railway, they stood in former times as a barrier of mountain and jungle between northern and southern India, and formed one of the main obstructions to welding the whole into an empire. They consist of vast masses of forests, ridges, and peaks, broken by cultivated valleys and broad high-lying plains.

The other two sides of the elevated southern triangle are known as the Eastern and Western Ghâts (Ghauts). These start southwards from the eastern and western extremities of the Vindhyâ system, and run along the eastern and western coasts of India. The Eastern Ghâts stretch in fragmentary spurs and ranges down the Madras Presidency, here and there receding inland and leaving broad level tracts between their base and the coast. The Western Ghâts form the great sea-wall of the Bombay Presidency, with only a narrow strip between them and the shore. In many parts they rise in magnificent precipices and headlands out of the ocean, and truly look like colossal “passes or landingstairs” (ghdts) from the sea. The Eastern Ghâts have an average elevation of 1500 feet. The Western Ghâts ascend more abruptly from the sea to an average height of about 3000 feet, with peaks up to 4700, along the Bombay coast, rising to 7000 and even 8760 in the upheaved angle which they unite to form with the Eastern Ghâts, towards their southern extremity.

The inner triangular plateau thus enclosed lies from 1000 to 3000 feet above the level of the sea. But it is dotted with peaks and seamed with ranges exceeding 4000 feet in height. Its best known hills are the Nilgiris (Neilgherries), with the summer capital of Madras, Utakamand, 7000 feet above the sea. The highest point is Dodâbetta Peak (8760 feet), at the upheaved southern angle. The interior plateau is approached by several [9:12:734] famous passes from the level coast-strip on the western side. The Bor-Ghât, for example, ascends a tremendous ravine about 40 miles south-east of Bombay city, to a height of 1798 feet. In ancient times this pass was regarded as the key of the Deccan, and could be held by a small band against any army attempting to penetrate from the coast. A celebrated military road was constructed by the British up the Bor-Ghât, and practically gave the command of the interior to the then rising port of Bombay. A railway line has now been carried up the pass, twisting round the shoulders of mountains, tunnelling through intervening crags, and clinging by a narrow ledge to the face of the precipices. At one point the zigzag is so sharp as to render a circuitous turn impossible, and the trains have to stop and reverse their direction on a levelled terrace. The Thall Ghât, to the north of Bombay, has in like manner been scaled both by road and railway. Another celebrated pass, farther down the coast, connects the military centre of Belgâum with the little port of Vingurla. These “landing-stairs” from the sea to the interior present scenes of rugged grandeur. The trap rocks stand out, after ages of denudation, like circular fortresses flanked by round towers, from the mass of hills behind,—natural fastnesses, which in the Marhattâ times were rendered impregnable to Oriental warfare. To the south of Bombay, the passes climb up from the sea through thick forests, the haunt of the tiger and the stately bison. Still farther down the coast, the western mountain wall dips down into the Palghât valley, a remarkable gap, 25 miles broad, and leading by an easy route, only 1500 feet above the sea at its highest point, from the sea-board to the interior. A railway now extends by this passage from Beypur across the peninsula to Madras.

On the eastern side of India, the Ghâts form a series of spurs and buttresses for the elevated inner plateau, rather than a continuous mountain wall. They are traversed by a number of broad and easy passages from the Madras coast. Through these openings the rainfall of the southern half of the inner plateau reaches the sea. The drainage from the northern or Vindhyân edge of the three-sided table-land falls into the Ganges. The Narbadâ (Nerbudda) and Tâpti carry the rainfall of the southern slopes of the Vindhyâs and of the Sâtpura hills, in almost parallel lines, into the Gulf of Cambay. But from Surat, in 21° 9' lat., to Cape Comorin, in 8° 4' lat., no large river succeeds in reaching the western coast from the interior table-land. The Western Ghâts form, in fact, a lofty unbroken barrier between the waters of the central plateau and the Indian Ocean. The drainage has therefore to make its way across India to the eastwards, now turning sharply round projecting ranges, now tumbling down ravines, or rushing along the valleys, until the rain which the Bombay sea-breeze has dropped upon the Western Ghâts finally falls into the Bay of Bengal. In this way the three great rivers of the Madras Presidency, viz., the Godâvari, the Krishna, and the Kâveri (Cauvery), rise in the mountains overhanging the western coast, and traverse the whole breadth of the central table-land before they reach the sea on the eastern shores of India.

The physical geography and the political destiny of the two sides of the Indian peninsula have been determined by the characteristics of the mountain ranges on either coast. On the east, the country is comparatively open, and was everywhere accessible to the spread of civilization. On the east, therefore, the ancient dynasties of southern India fixed their capitals. Along the west, only a narrow strip of lowland intervenes between the barrier range and the seaboard. The inhabitants of those tracts remained apart from the civilization of the eastern coast. To this day one of their ruling races, the Nairs, retain land-tenures and social customs, such as polyandry, which mark a much ruder stage of human advancement than Hinduism, and in other parts of India only linger among isolated hill tribes. On the other hand, the people of the western coast enjoy a bountiful rainfall, unknown in the inner plateau and the east. The monsoon dashes its rain-laden clouds against the Western Ghâts, and pours from 250 to 100 inches of rain upon their maritime slopes from Khândesh down to Malabar. By the time that the monsoon has crossed the Western Ghâts, it has dropped the greater part of its aqueous burden, and central districts, such as Bangalore, obtain only about 35 inches. The eastern coast also receives a monsoon of its own; but, except in the neighbourhood of the sea, the rainfall throughout the Madras presidency is scanty, seldom exceeding 40 inches in the year. The deltas of the three great rivers along the Madras coast form, of course, tracts of inexhaustible fertility; and much is done by irrigation on the thirsty inland plateau to husband and utilize both the local rainfall and the accumulated waters which the rivers bring down.

In the valleys, and upon the' elevated plains of the central plateau, tillage has driven back the jungle to the hilly recesses, and fields of rice and many kinds of smaller grain or millets, tobacco, cotton, sugar-cane, and pulses spread over the open country. The black soil of the Deccan is proverbial for its fertility; and the level strip between the Western Ghats and the sea rivals even Lower Bengal in its fruit-bearing palms, rice harvests, and rich succession of crops. The deltas on the eastern side have from time immemorial been celebrated as rice-bearing tracts. The interior of the table-land, as may be inferred from the scanty rainfall, is liable to drought. The people contend against the calamities of nature by varied systems of irrigation,—drawing their water-supply in some districts from wells, in others from tanks and reservoirs, or from large artificial lakes formed by damming up the ends of river valleys. They thus store the rain brought during a few months by the monsoon, and husband it for use throughout the whole year. The food of the common people consists chiefly of small grains, such as joâr, bdjra, and rdgi. The great export is cotton, with wheat from the northern districts of Bombay. The pepper trade with Malabar dates far beyond the age of Sindbad the Sailor, and probably reaches back to Roman times. Cardamoms, spices' of various sorts, dyes, and many medicinal drugs are also grown.

It is on the three-sided table-land, and among the hilly spurs which project from it, that the mineral wealth of India lies hid. Coal-mining now forms a great industry on the north-eastern side of the table-land, in Bengal, and also in the Central Provinces. The commercial aspects of this and similar undertakings will be dealt with in a later section of the present article. Beds of ironore and limestone have been worked in several places, and hold out a possibility of a new era of enterprise to India in the future. Many districts are rich in building stone, marbles and the easily worked laterite. Copper and other metals exist in small quantities. Gold dust has from very ancient times been washed out of the river-beds, and gold-mining is being attempted on scientific principles in Madras and Mysore.

Of the three regions of India, now briefly surveyed, the first, or the Hirnâlayas, lies for the most part beyond, the British frontier, but a knowledge of it supplies the key to the ethnology and history of India. The second region, or the great river plains in the north, formed the theatre of the ancient race-movements which shaped the civilization and the political destinies of the whole Indian peninsula. The third region, or the triangular table-land in the south, has a character quite distinct from either of the other two divisions, and a population which is now working out a separate development of its own. Broadly speaking, the Hirnâlayas are peopled by Turanian tribes; the great river plains of Hindustan are still the home of the Aryan race; the triangular table-land has formed an arena for a long struggle between that gifted race from the north and what is known as the Dravidian stock in the south.

To this vast empire the English have added British Burmah, consisting of the lower valley of the Irawadi (Irrawaddy) with its delta, and a long flat strip stretching down the eastern side of the Bay of Bengal. Between the [9:12:735] narrow maritime tract and the Irawadi runs a backbone of lofty ranges. These ranges, known as the Yoma (Roma) mountains, are covered with dense forests, and both historically and geographically separate the Irawadi valley from the strip of coast. The Yoma (Roma) ranges have peaks exceeding 4000 feet, and culminate in the Blue Mountain (7100 feet). They are crossed bypasses, one of which, the An or Aeng, rises to 4668 feet above the sealevel. A thousand creeks indent the seaboard; and the whole of the level country, both on the coast and in the Irawadi valley, forms one vast rice-field. The river floats down an abundant supply of teak and bamboos from the north. Tobacco, of an excellent quality, supplies the little cigars which all Burmese (men, women, and children) smoke. Arakan and Pegu, or the provinces of the coast strip and the Irawadi valley, contain mineral oil-springs. Tenasserim forms a long narrow maritime province, which runs from the mouths of the Irawadi southward to Point Victoria, where the British territory adjoins Siam. It is rich in tin mines, and contains iron-ores equal to the finest Swedish, besides gold and copper in smaller quantities, and a very pure limestone. Rice and timber form the staple exports of Burmah; and rice is also the universal food of the people. British Burmah, with Tenasserim, has an area of 88,556 square miles, and had a population, in 1876, of just under 3 millions of persons.

Geology.

For geological purposes India may be mapped out into the three geographical divisions of the Himalayan region, the Indo-Gangetic plain, and Peninsular India.

The Himalayan Region.— The geology of this district is far more complex and less fully known than that of the Peninsular area. Until the ground has been carefully gone over by the Geological Survey, many points must remain doubtful; probably even then the problems will not be fully solved, as large areas of the Himâlayas (Nepâl and Bhutân) are at present inaccessible to Europeans. The oldest rock of the Himalayas is gneiss, but its age is quite unknown. It generally differs in character from the gneiss of the Peninsula, and also from that of Assam and Burmah. The Himâlayan gneiss is usually white and grey, its felspars being orthoclase and albite; it contains much mica and mica schist, and is generally much more uniform in character than the gneiss of the Peninsula. The latter is usually pink, its felspar being orthoclase and oligoclase; it contains little mica schist, but often has quartzite and hornblendic rock. Hornblende occurs in the syenitic gneiss of the Northern HimMayan (or Ladâkh) range. The Central Himalayan region may be roughly described as consisting of two gneissic axes, with a trough or synclinal valley between them, in which fossiliferous beds have been deposited and are now preserved. The gneiss of the southern or main axis (the “central gneiss” of Dr Stoliczka) is the oldest; that of the northern or Ladâkh axis comes next in age. The gneiss of the Ladâkh axis is generally syenitic, or is that variety of the Himâlayan gneiss already described as containing hornblende. It is probably an extremely altered condition of ordinary marine sediment. The gneiss of the central axis is the ordinary kind; it is penetrated by granite, which ranges along some of the highest peaks. Between these two gneissic axes occurs the basin-shaped valley, or the Hundes and Zanskar synclinal. In this valley fossiliferous rocks are preserved, giving representatives of the Silurian, Carboniferous, Triassic, Jurassic, and Cretaceous formations. All these seem there to have followed each other without important breaks or unconformities; but after the deposition of the Cretaceous rocks of the Himâlayan region, there appear to have been important changes in physical geography. The Nummulitic (Eocene) strata were laid down on the eroded edges of some of the older beds, and in a long trough within the Silurian gneiss of the Ladâkh axis. On the south of this true Himâlayan region there is a band of country known as the Lower Himâlaya, in which the beds are often greatly disturbed, and even completely inverted, over great areas, the old gneiss apparently overlying the sedimentary rocks. This Lower Himâlayan region is about 50 miles wide, and consists of irregular ridges, varying from 5000 to 8000 feet in height, and sometimes reaching 12,000 feet.

Resting upon the gneiss, but often through inversion apparently underlying it, in the neighbourhood of Simla, is a series of unfossiliferous beds (schists, quartzites, sandstones, shales, limestones, &c.) known in descending order as the Krôl, Infra-Kr01, Blaini, and Infra-Blaini beds. In the Krôl beds is a massive limestone (Krôl limestone) probably representing the limestone of the Pir Panjâl range, which is most likely of Carboniferous age, The Blaini and Infra-Blaini beds are probably Silurian. The Lower Himâlayan range ends at the Sutlej valley, west of which the continuation of the central range is followed immediately by the third or Sub-Himâlayan range. This occurs almost always on the south of the Lower Himâlayas; it is composed of later Tertiary rocks (Siwâliks, &c.), which range parallel with the main chain. Generally the Sub-Himâlayas consist of two ranges, separated by a broad flat valley (“dùn” or “doon ”); the southern slope, overlooking the great Indo-Gangetic plain, is usually the steepest. Below Nâini Tâl and Dârjiling (Darjeeling), the sub-Himâlayan range is wanting; on the Bhutân frontier the whole range is occasionally absent, and then the great plain slopes up to the base of the Lower Himâlayan region. It is within the Sub-Himâlayan range that the famous Siwâlik beds occur, long since known for their vast stores of extinct mammalia. Of about the same age are the Manchhar beds of Sind, which also contain a rich mammalian fauna. The Lower Manchhars probably correspond to the Nâhan beds, the lowest of the Siwâliks; they rest upon the Gaj beds, which are probably Upper Miocene. From this it would seem that the lowest Siwâliks are not older than Upper Miocene. The higher Siwâlik beds are considered by Mr W. T. Blanford to be Pliocene, and to this later period he also refers the mammalian beds of Pikermi in Greece. These have a large number of fossils in common with the Siwâliks; but they contain, at their base, a marine band with Pliocene shells. The Manchhar and Siwâlik beds are chiefly of freshwater origin.

The Salt Range in the north-west of the Punjab has, in addition to its economic value, a special geological importance; and from that point of view it is one of the most interesting districts in India. Representatives of most of the great European formations of Silurian and later epochs are found there; and throughout all the vast length of time represented by these formations there is here no direct evidence of any important break in succession, or unconformity. The lowest beds (salt marl, probably Silurian) and the highest (Siwâliks) are found throughout the range. But the others cannot all be traced continuously throughout; some occur well developed in one place, some in another. All the principal fossiliferous beds of the Jurassic, Triassic, and Carboniferous formations are confined to the western part of the range.

The Indo-Gangetic Plain covers an area of about 300,000 square miles, and varies in width from 90 to nearly 300 miles. It rises very gradually from the sea at either end; the lowest point of the watershed between the Punjab rivers and the Ganges is about 924 feet above the sea. This point, by a line measured down the valley, but not following[9:12:736] the winding of the river, is about 1050 miles from the mouth of the Ganges and 850 miles from the mouth of the Indus, so that the average inclination of the plain, from the central watershed to the sea, is only about 1 foot per mile. It is less near the sea, where for long distances there is no fall at all. It is generally more near the watershed; but there is here no ridge of high ground between the Indus and the Ganges, and a very trifling change of level would often turn the upper waters of one river into the other. It is not unlikely that such changes have in past time occurred; and if so an explanation is afforded of the occurrence of allied forms of freshwater dolphins {Platanista) and of many other animals in the two rivers and in the Brahmaputra.

There is no evidence that the Indo-Gangetic plain existed as such in Pre-Tertiary times. It is highly probable that the Jurassic and Cretaceous coast-line ran across the northern part of the Bay of Bengal, and that most of the area now occupied by the Gangetic plain was then above the sea. Probably the Jurassic traps of the Râjmahâl hills, west of the delta of the Ganges, were continuous with those of Sylhet, east of the delta. Marine Jurassic and Cretaceous beds are absent from the margins of the true Gangetic plain; so too are marine Eocene beds. In Eocene times the sea spread up the Punjab; but that too was land only in Miocene times.

The alluvial deposits of the plain, as made known by the boring at Calcutta, prove a gradual depression of the area through the later Tertiary times. There are peat and forest beds, which must have grown quietly at the surface, alternating with deposits of gravel, sand, and clay. The thickness of the delta deposit is unknown; 481 feet was proved at the bore hole, but probably this represents only a very small part of the deposit. Outside the delta, in the Bay of Bengal, is a deep depression known as the “swatch of no ground”; all around it the soundings are only of 5 to 10 fathoms, but they very rapidly deepen to over 300 fathoms. Mr J. Ferguson has shown that the sediment is carried away from this area by the set of the currents; probably then it has remained free from sediment whilst the neighbouring sea bottom has gradually been filled up. If so, the thickness of the alluvium is at least 1800 feet, and may be much more.

The Indo-Gangetic plain dates back to Eocene times; the origin of the Himalayas may be referred to the same period. Numerous minor disturbances occurred in the area which is now northern India during Palaeozoic and Secondary times, but the great disturbance which has resulted in the formation of the existing chain of the Himalayas took place after the deposition of the Eocene beds. Disturbances even greater in amount occurred after the deposition of the Pliocene beds. The Eocenes of the Sub-Himâlayan range were deposited upon uncontorted Palaeozoic rocks, but the whole has since been violently contorted and disturbed. There are some indications that the disturbing forces were more severe to the eastward during middle Tertiary times, and that the main action to the westward was of later date. It seems highly probable that the elevation of the mountain ranges and the depression of the Indo-Gangetic plain were closely related. This view gains some support from a glance at the map, where we see that the curves of the great mountain chains are strictly followed by those of the great alluvial plain. Probably both are due to almost contemporary movements of the earth’s crust; these movements, though now of vastly diminished intensity, have not wholly ceased. The alluvial deposits prove depression in quite recent geological times; and within the Himâlayan region earthquakes are still common, whilst in Peninsular India they are rare.

Peninsular India.— The oldest rocks of this area consist of gneiss, which occurs in three districts :—a very large part of Bengal and Madras, extending to Ceylon; the Aravalli; and Bundelkhand. Of these formations, the gneiss of Bundelkhand is known to be the oldest, because the oldest Transition rocks rest upon it; whereas the same Transition rocks are altered and intersected by granitic dykes which proceed from the gneiss of the other districts. The Transition rocks are of great but unknown age. The Vindhyan rocks which succeed them are of very old Palaeozoic age, perhaps Pre-Silurian. But long before the earliest Vindhyan rocks were laid down the Transition rocks had been altered and contorted. The great movements of the earth’s crust which produced that contortion are the latest which have taken place to any great extent in the Indian Peninsula. In more recent times there have been local disturbances, and large faults have in places been found; but the greater part of the Peninsula rocks are only slightly disturbed, and the most recent of the great and wide spread earth movements of this region date back to Pre-Vindhyan times. The Vindhyan series are generally sharply marked off from older rocks; but in the Godâvari valley there is no well-defined line between these and the Transition rocks. The Vindhyan beds are divided into two groups. The lower, with an estimated thickness of only 2000 feet, or slightly more, cover a large area,—extending, with but little change of character, from the Son valley in one direction to Cuddapah, and in a diverging line to near Bijâpur—in each case a distance of over 700 miles. The upper Vindhyans cover a much smaller area, but attain a thickness of about 12,000 feet. The Vindhyans are well stratified beds of sandstone and shale, with some limestones. As yet they have yielded no trace of fossils, and their exact age is consequently unknown. So far as the evidence goes, it appears probable that they are of very ancient Palaeozoic age, perhaps Pre-Silurian. The total absence of fossils is a remarkable fact, and one for which it is difficult to account, as the beds are for the most part quite unaltered. Even if they are entirely of freshwater origin, we should expect that some traces of life from the waters or neighbouring land would be found.

The Gondwâna series is in many respects the most interesting and important series of the Indian Peninsula. The beds are almost entirely of freshwater origin. Many subdivisions have been made, but here we need only note the main division into two great groups :—Lower Gondwânas, 13,000 feet thick; Upper Gondwânas, 11,000 feet thick. The series is mainly confined to the area of country between the Narbadâ and the Son on the north and the Krishna on the south; but the western part of this region is in great part covered by newer beds. The lowest Gondwânas are very constant in character, wherever they are found; the upper numbers of the lower division show more variation, and this divergence of character in different districts becomes more marked in the L τ pper Gondwâna series. Disturbances have occurred in the lower series before the formation of the upper.

The Gondwâna beds contain fossils which are of very great interest. In large part these consist of plants which grew near the margins of the old rivers, and which were carried down by floods, and deposited in the alluvial plains, deltas, and estuarine areas of the old Gondwâna period. So vast was the time occupied by the deposition of the Gondwâna beds that great changes in physical geography and in the vegetation repeatedly occurred. The plants of the Lower Gondwânas consist chiefly of acrogens (Eqwisetaceoe and ferns) and gymnogens (cycads and conifers), the former being the more abundant. The same classes of plants occur in the Upper Gondwânas; but there the proportions are reversed, the conifers, and still [9:12:737] more the cycads, being more numerous than the ferns, whilst the Equisetaceae are but sparingly found. But even within the limits of the Lower Gondwâna series there are great diversities of vegetation, three distinct floras occurring in the three great divisions of that formation. In many respects the flora of the highest of these three divisions (the Pânchet group) is more nearly related to that of the Upper Gondwânas than it is to the other Lower Gondwâna floras.

One of the most interesting facts in the history of the Gondwâna series is the occurrence near the base (in the Tâlcher group) of large striated boulders in a fine mud or silt, the boulders in one place resting upon rock (of Vindhyan age) which is also striated. There seems good reason for believing that these beds are the result of iceaction. They probably nearly coincide in age with the Permian beds of Western Europe, in which Professor Ramsay long since discovered evidence of glaciation. But the remarkable fact is that this old ice-action occurred within the tropics, and probably at no very great height above the sea.

The Dâmodar series, the middle division of the Lower Gondwanas, is the chief source of coal in Peninsular India, yielding more of that mineral than all other formations taken together. The Karharbâri group is the only other coal-bearing formation of any value. The Dâmodars are 8400 feet thick in theRâniganj coal-field, and about 10,000 feet thick in the Sâtpura basin. They consist of three divisions; coal occurs in the upper and lower, ironstone (without coal) in the middle division. The Râniganj coalfield is the most important in India. So far as is yet known, it covers au area of about 500 square miles, extending about 18 miles from north to south and about 39 miles from east to west; but it extends further to the east under the laterite and alluvium. It is traversed by the Dâmodar river, along which run the road from Calcutta to Benares and the East Indian Railway. From its situation and importance this coal-field is better known than any other in India. Much has been learnt concerning it since the last examination by the Geological Survey, and our remarks are in great part based on recent reports by Mr H. Bauerman. The upper or Râniganj series (stated by the Geological Survey to be 5000 feet thick) contains eleven seams, having a total thickness of 120 feet, in the eastern district, and thirteen seams, 100 feet thick, in the western district. The average thickness of the seams worked is from 12 to 18 feet, but occasionally a seam acquires a great thickness— 20 to 80 feet. The lower or Barâkhar series (2000 feet thick) contains four seams, of a total thickness of 69 feet. Compared with English coals those of this coal-field are of but poor quality; they contain much ash, and are generally non-coking. The seams of the lower series are the best, and some of these at Sânktoria, near the Barâkhar river, are fairly good for coke and gas. The best coal in India is in the small coal-field at Karharbâri. The beds there are lower in the series than those of the Râniganj field; they belong to the upper part of the Tâlcher group, the lowest of the Gondwâna series. The coal-bearing beds cover an area of only about 11 square miles; there are three seams, varying from 9 to 33 feet thick. The lowest seam is the best, and this is as good as English steam coal. This coalfield, now largely worked, is the property of the East Indian Railway, which is thus supplied with fuel at a cheaper rate than any other railway in the world. Indian coal usually contains phosphoric acid; which greatly lessens its value for iron-smelting.

The Dâmodar series, which, as we have seen, is the chief source of coal in India, is also one of the most important sources of iron. The ore occurs in the middle division, coal in the highest and lowest. The ore is partly a clay ironstone, like that occurring in the Coal-measures of England, partly an oxide of iron or haematite. It generally contains phosphorus, which prevents its use in the preparation of the finer qualities of steel. A similar difficulty attends the use of the Cleveland ore of North Yorkshire. Experiments have been in progress for years in search of a process which shall, in an economical manner, obtain iron from Cleveland ore free from phosphorus, latterly, it is hoped, with some success. If this be so, India will be a great gainer. Excellent iron-ore occurs in the Metamorphic rocks south of the Dâmodar river. Laterite (see below) is sometimes used as ore. It is very earthy and of a low percentage; but it contains only a comparatively small proportion of phosphorus.

The want of limestone for flux, within easy reach, is generally a great drawback as regards iron-smelting in India. Kankar or ghutin (concretionary carbonate of lime) is collected for this purpose from the river beds and alluvial deposits. It sometimes contains as much as 70 percent, of carbonate of lime; but generally the amount is much less and the fluxing value proportionally diminished. The real difficulty in India is to find the ore, the fuel, and the flux in sufficiently close proximity to yield a profit.

The enormous mass of basaltic rock known as the Deccan trap is of great importance in the geological structure of the Indian Peninsula. It now covers an area of about 200,000 square miles, and probably formerly extended over a much wider area. Where thickest, the traps are at least 6000 feet thick. They form the most striking physical features of the country, many of the most prominent hill ranges being the denuded edges of the basaltic flows. The great volcanic outbursts which produced this trap commenced in the Cretaceous period and lasted on into the Eocene period.

Laterite is a ferruginous and argillaceous rock, varying from 30 to 200 feet thick, which often occurs over the trap area, but is also found in other districts. As a rule it makes rather barren land; it is highly porous, and the rain rapidly sinks into it. Laterite may be roughly divided into two kinds, high-level and low-level laterites. The former, which covers a large area of the high basaltic plains, is believed by Mr R. B. Foote to be very frequently the product of decomposition of the trap, and to have been thus formed in the place in which it is now-found. Sometimes the high-level laterite overlies gneiss or other rocks; and in these cases it has probably been transported. The low-level laterite is generally more sandy in character, and is often associated with gravels. In most cases this has clearly been carried down to its present position, probably largely by subaerial action, aided by rains and streams. Possibly in some cases it has been spread out along the coasts by marine action. The low-level laterite fringes the coast of the Peninsular more or less from near Bombay on the west and Orissa on the east to Cape Comorin. It is not continuous throughout these districts; and it is of very varying width and elevation. The age of the high-level laterite is unknown. Its formation probably extended throughout a long period of time, much of which must be of very ancient date; for the laterite, together with the underlying basalt, has suffered extensive denudation.

The mercantile aspects of the coal, iron, and other mineral products of India will be fully treated of under a subsequent section (pp. 764-66). The geologist comes in this matter to the same conclusion as the economist, viz., that the mineral wealth of India, as represented by its precious stones, was the product of forced labour, and that the search for them in our days can scarcely repay the working expenses.

Meteorology.

The great peninsula of India, with its lofty mountain ranges behind and its extensive seaboard exposed to the first violence of the winds of two oceans, forms an exceptionally valuable and interesting field for the study of meteorological phenomena. But only within the last few years have trustworthy statistics been obtained for some of its most important registration stations.

Meteorological Geography.— After the general description of the country which has been given at the beginning of this article, it is only necessary here to sketch very briefly the meteorological geography of the peninsula. The following sentences are condensed from an interesting account in the first Report on the Meteorology of India (for 1875), by Mr H. F. Blanford. From the gorge of the Indus to that of the Dihong (Brahmaputra), a distance of 1400 miles, the Himalayas form an unbroken watershed, the northern flank of which is drained by the upper valleys of these two rivers; while the Sutlej (Satlaj), starting from the southern foot of the Kailas Peak, breaks through the watershed, dividing it into two very unequal portions, that to the north-west being the smaller. The average elevation of the Himâlaya crest may be taken at not less than 19,000 feet, and therefore equal to the height of the lower half of the atmosphere; and indeed few of the passes are under 16,000 or 17,000 feet. Across this mountain barrier there appears to be a constant flow of air, more active in the day-time than at night, northwards to the arid plateau of Tibet. There is no reason to believe that any transfer of air takes place across the Himalayas in a southerly direction, unless, indeed, in those most elevated regions of the atmosphere which lie beyond the range of observation; but a nocturnal flow of cooled air, from the southern slopes, is felt as a strong wind where the rivers debouch on the plains, more especially in the early morning hours; and this probably contributes in some degree to lower the mean temperature of that belt of the plains which fringes the mountain zone.

At the foot of the great mountain barrier, and separating it from the more ancient land which now forms the highlands of the peninsula, a broad plain, for the most part alluvial, stretches from sea to sea. On the west, in the dry region, this is occupied partly by the alluvial deposits of the Indus and its tributaries and the saline swamps of Kahhch (Cutch), partly by the rolling sands and rocky surface of the desert of Jâisalmir and Bikanir, and the more fertile tracts to the eastward watered by the Lûnai. Over the greater part of this region rain is of rare occurrence; and not infrequently more than a year passes without a drop falling on the parched surface. On its eastern margin, however, in the neighbourhood of the Aravalli hills, and again on the northern Punjab, rain is more frequent, occurring both in the south-west monsoon, and also at the opposite season in the cold weather. As far south as Sirsa and Mùltân (Mooltan), the average rainfall does not much exceed 7 inches.

The alluvial plain of the Punjab passes into that of the Gangetic valley without visible interruption. Up or down this plain, at opposite seasons, sweep the monsoon winds, in a direction at right angles to that of their nominal course; and thus vapour which has been brought by winds from the Bay of Bengal is discharged as snow and rain on the peaks and hillsides of the Western Himalayas. Nearly the whole surface is under cultivation, and it ranks among the most productive as well as the most densely populated regions of the world. The rainfall diminishes from 100 inches in the south-east corner of the Gangetic delta to less than 30 inches at Agra and Delhi, and there is an average difference of from 15 to 25 inches between the northern and southern borders of the plain.

Eastward from the Bengal delta, two alluvial plains stretch up between the hills which connect the Himälayan system with that of the Burmese peninsula. The first, or the valley of Assam and the Brahmaputra, is long and narrow, bordered on the north by the Himalayas, on the south by the lower plateau of the Gâro, Khâsi, and Nâgâ hills. The other, short and broad, and in great part occupied by swamps and fhils, separates the Gâro, Khâsi, and Nâgâ hills from those of Tipperah and the Lushâi country. The climate of these plains is damp' and equable, and the rainfall is prolonged and generally heavy, especially on the southern slopes of the hills. A meteorological peculiarity of some interest has been noticed, more especially at the stations of Sibsâgar and Silchâr, viz., the great range of the diurnal variation of barometric pressure during the afternoon hours,—which is the more striking, since at Rürki (Roorkee), Lahore, and other stations near the foot of the Western Himâlayas, this range is less than in the open plains.

The highlands of the peninsula, which are cut off from the encircling ranges by the broad Indo-Gangetic plain, are divided into two unequal parts, by an almost continuous chain of hills running across the country from west by south to east by north, just south of the Tropic of Cancer. This chain may be regarded as a single geographical feature, forming one of the principal watersheds of the peninsula, the waters to the north draining chiefly into the Narbadâ and the Ganges, those to the south into the Tâpti, the Godâvari, the Mahânadi, and some smaller streams. In a meteorological point of view it is of considerable importance. Together with the two parallel valleys of the Narbadâ (Nerbudda) and Tâpti (Taptee), which drain the flanks of its western half, it gives, at opposite seasons of the year, a decided easterly and westerly direction to the winds of this part of India, and condenses a tolerably copious rainfall during the south-west monsoon.

Separated from this chain by the valley of the Narbadâ on the west, and that of the Son on the east, the plateau of Mâlwâ and Baghelkhand occupies the space intervening between these valleys and the Gangetic plain. On the western edge of the plateau are the Aravalli hills, which run from near Ahmadâbâd up to the neighbourhood of Delhi, and include one hill, Mount Abu, over 5000 feet in height. This range exerts an important influence on the direction of the wind, and also on the rainfall. At Ajmir (Ajmere), an old meteorological station at the eastern foot of the range, the wind is predominantly south-west, and there and at Mount Abu the south-west monsoon rains are a regularly recurrent phenomenon,—which can hardly be said of the region of scanty and uncertain rainfall that extends from the western foot of the range and merges in the Bikanir desert.

The peninsula south of the Sâtpura range consists chiefly of the triangular plateau of the Deccan, terminating abruptly on the west in the Sahyâdri range (Western Ghâts), and shelving to the east (Eastern Ghâts). This plateau is swept by the south-west monsoon, but not until it has surmounted the western barrier of the Ghâts; and hence the rainfall is, as a rule, light at Poona and places similarly situated under the lee of the range, and but moderate over the more easterly parts of the plateau. The rains, however, are prolonged some three or four weeks later than in tracts to the north of the Sâtpuras, since they are also brought by the easterly winds which blow from the Bay of Bengal in October and the early part of November, when the recurved southerly wind ceases to blow up the Gangetic valley, and sets towards the south-east coast. This was formerly thought to be a north-east monsoon, and is still so spoken of by certain writers; but the rainy wind is really a diversion of the south-west monsoon.
[9:12:739]

At the junction of the Eastern and Western Ghâts rises the bold triangular plateau of the Nilgiris, and to the south of them come the Anamalais, the Palnis (Pulneys), and the hills of Travancore. These ranges are separated from the Nilgiris by a broad depression or pass known as the Pâlghât Gap, some 25 miles wide, the highest point of which is only 1500 feet above the sea. This gap affords a passage to the winds which elsewhere are barred by the hills of the Ghât chain. The country to the east of the gap receives the rainfall of the south-west monsoon; and during the north-east monsoon ships passing Bey pur meet with a stronger wind from the land than is felt elsewhere on the Malabar coast. According to Captain Newbold, this gap “affords an outlet to those furious storms from the eastward which sweep the Bay of Bengal, and, after traversing the peninsula, burst forth through it to the neighbouring sea.”

In the strip of low country that fringes the peninsula below the Gluιts, the rainfall is heavy and the climate warm and damp, the vegetation being dense and characteristically tropical, and the steep slopes of the Ghàts, where they have not been artificially cleared, thickly clothed with forest.

In Burmah, the country around Ava, as well as the hill country to the north, has suffered from severe earthquakes, one of which destroyed Ava in 1839. The general meri-dianal direction of the ranges and valleys determines the direction of the prevailing surface winds, this being, however, subject to many local modifications. But it would appear, from Dr Anderson’s observations of the movement of the upper clouds, that throughout the year there is, with but slight interruption, a steady upper current from the south-west, such as has been already noticed over the Himalayas. The rainfall in the lower part of the Ira wadi valley, viz., the delta and the neighbouring part of the province of Pegu, is very heavy; and the climate is very mild and equable at all seasons. But higher up the valley, and especially north of the Pegu frontier, the country is drier, and is characterized by a less luxuriant vegetation, and a retarded and more scanty rainfall.

Observatories.— Meteorological observatories have been established at one hundred and three stations in India (including British Burmah and the Andamans). These observatories are situated at all elevations, from the highest, Leh (11,538 feet above mean sea-level) and Chakrâta (7051 feet), to Negapatam (15 feet) and Sâgar Island, the lowest, which is only 6 feet above mean sea-level.

Temperature of the Air.— From the average annual mean temperatures of 83 stations (derived from the means of three or more years) the following figures are taken. In the following four stations in this list, the average mean yearly temperature was over 82° F.: —Trichinopoli, 82-8°; Vizagapatam, 827°; Madras, 82’4°; and Madura, 82 - 2.° All of these stations are in the Madras Presidency. The next highest means are returned by Negapatam (also in Madras), 81 ’ 9 j ; Cuttack and Port Blair, each 80'5; False Point, 80-20°; Goa, 79 9°; Cochin, 79-8°; Sagar Island, 79'5°; Deesa, 79’4°; and Calcutta, 79’2°. The mean annual temperature of Bombay is 78’8°, so that it is the coolest of the three presidency towns. The lowest means are obtained at the hill stations of Darjiling, 53’9°; Simla, 54‘4°; Murree, 55-8°; and Chakrata, 56'1°. Between these and the next coolest stations is a great gap, Ranikhet following with 60 ’ 4°, Pachmarhi with 687°, and Rawal Pindi with a yeaπy mean of 69’4°. The highest mean monthly temperatures given are 95° at Multan, in June; 94’3° at Delhi, in June; 94 Ί at Jhansi, in May; 93 - 6° at Lucknow, in June. The lowest monthly means are returned by the four coldest hill stations mentioned above, the figures being :—Murree—January 377°, February 39 4°; Simla—January 39’6°, February 41'1°; Chakrâta—January 40∙8°, February 42-9°; Darjiling—January 407°, February 43'2°. The mean temperature at Leh in Januariis 17 - 6°, and in December 24 - 4°.

Atmospheric Pressure.— The meteorological report for 1877 contains a table showing the annual mean pressure at 72 stations, corrected (except in the case of Madras) to the Calcutta standard, which reads 0 011 inch higher than that of Kew. From that table the following figures are obtained. The mean yearly pressure at the highest stations is—23'274 at Chakrata, 23 371 at Darjiling, 24'058 at Ranikhet, 26'416 at Pachmarhi, and 26 , 932 at Bangalore. The greatest annual mean pressures returned are—29’862 at Negapatam, 29'856 at Madras, 29 ’ 822 at Bombay, and 29‘821 at False Point.

Rainfall. — The average annual rainfall at 294 stations is recorded in the 1877 meteorological report, from which the following figures have been obtained :—

In the Punjab the highest average fall (123’21 inches) is at Dharmsiila, which is situated on the face of the hills, and exposed to the full force of the monsoon; the next highest recorded is little more than half that amount, or 68 ’61 inches at Simla. The lowest average falls in the Punjab are—6’16 inches at Muzaffargarb, 6’93 at Multan, 7 - 35 at Dera, Ghazi Khan, and 8'23 at Derâ Ismail Khan. All these stations are protected by the Sulâimân range from the monsoon. f.

In Rajputana and Central India the maximum average is 20’27 at Jaipur (Jeypore), and the minimum, 60 85 at Mount Abu, the highest point in this part of India.

In the North-Western Provinces the heaviest average falls are at Naini Tai (94 ’ 17 inches) and Dehra (70’06), both of which lie high; the minimum average fall is 24’32 at Aligarh, the next lowest figures being 26 Ί8 at Muttra (Mathura), 26’46 at Agra, and 26 74 at Etah—all stations on the plains.

In Oudh the maximum rainfall is at Sultânpur, 4672 inches; and the minimum at Rai Bareli, 39 ’99 inches.

The following stations of Bengal have an average rainfall of more than 100inches :—Jalpâiguri, 122’16; Darjiling, 119’25; and Kuch Behâr, 119'05—all at the base of the hills; Noâkhâli, 107’52, and Chittagong, 105'61, both on the north east coast of the Bay of Bengal. The lowest averages are returned by Chapra, 37 '06 inches; Patna, 38 ’ 21; and Gâyâ, 41 '38. The average rainfall for Bengal is 67 inches.

Assam possesses in Cherra Poonjee (Chârâ Punji) the station with the largest recorded rainfall in the world. The registered fall during the three years ending 1876 averaged 368 ‘41 inches. A total fall of 805 inches was reported in 1861, of which 366 were assigned to the single month of July. In 1850 Dr Hooker registered 30 inches in twenty-four hours, and returned the fall from June to November of that year at 530 inches. In the four days 9th to 12th September 1877, 56 - 19 inches were registered. The following stations in Assam have also a very high rainfall :—Silchâr, 121Ό7; Sylhet, 153’80; Dibrugarh, 116 - 43; andTura, 11576. The lowest recorded averages in Assam are at Samaguting (52’58 inches) and Gauhâti (69’23 inches), both on the northern side of the hills separating Cachar from Assam.

In the Central Provinces the highest average falls are at Pachmarhi (82'20 inches) and Balaghat (64’11 inches); lowest averages, Khandwa, 32 , 26 inches, and Bednιir, 41 - 21 inches.

In Bombay, three stations on the Ghats are recorded as having an average rainfall of over 250 inches, viz. :—Matheran, 25675 inches; Malcolmpet (Mahableshwar), 252’25; and Baura (Fort), 251’80. The lowest average rainfalls recorded in Bombay are—12’99 inches at Mandargi; 17 ’25 at Dhulia; and 19 ’93 at Gokak. The average rainfall for Bombay is 67 inches.

In Sind the average rainfall is very low, varying from 16’31 inches at Nagar, and 1178 at Umarkot, to 5Ό9 at Shikârpur, and 4’28 at Jacobabad.

In Madras the highest averages recorded are—135’60 inches at Cannanore; 131’91 at Mangalore; 125’63 at Tellicherri; 113’62 at Calicut; and 112Ί5 at Cochin—all on the west coast. The lowest falls recorded are—at Bellary, 16Ό6; Tuticorin (sheltered by the Ghats), 18’50; Guti (Gooty), 20’85; and Coimbatore, 20’90. All these stations lie low. The average fall at the stations on the east coast is about 41 inches. The average rainfall for Madras is 44 inches.

The rainfall along the coast of British Burmah is heavy, as might be expected, the following averages being recorded :—Sandoway, 218’58 inches; Tavoy, 195’47; Maulmain, 191’34; Akyab, 189’23; Khyouk-hpyu, 17076. The smallest rainfall is at Thayet-myo (51’04) and Prome (59 ’ 46), sheltered by the Yoma range.

The rainfall at Port Blair, in the Andamans, is also naturally heavy, the average being returned as 116'25 inches.

Sun-spot Cycles.— The conclusions arrived at by the Indian meteorological department on the subject of the sun-spot cycles, which have been engaging the attention of scientific men, are thus summed up in the 1877 report :—“In conclusion, the following are the more important inferences that the meteorology of India in the years 1877 and 1878 appear to suggest, if not to establish. There is a tendency at the minimum sun-spot periods to prolonged excessive pressure over India, to an unusual development of the winter rains, and to the occurrence of abnormally heavy snowfall over the Himalayan region (to a greater extent probably in the western than the eastern Himalayas). This appears also to be usually accompanied by a weak [9:12:740] south-west monsoon. The characteristics of a weak monsoon are—great irregularity in the distribution of the rainfall over the whole of India, and the occurrence of heavy local rainfalls, which tend, by a law of rainfall and of air-motion, to recur over the same limited areas. The irregularity of rainfall distribution is often shown by the persistent and prolonged absence of rain over considerable areas. These areas of drought and famine are partly marked off by nature, depending to a certain extent on the geographical features and position of the district. Thus the rains are more likely to fall below the amount necessary for cultivation in the dry region of the Deccan or in Upper India, than over the Malabar coast area or the province of Bengal.”

Flora.

Unlike many other large geographical areas, India is remarkable for having no distinctive botanical features peculiar to itself. It differs conspicuously in this respect from such countries as Australia or South Africa. Its vegetation is in point of fact of a composite character, and is constituted by the meeting and more or less blending of adjoining floras,—of those of Persia and the south-eastern Mediterranean area to the north-west, of Siberia to the north, of China to the east, and of Malaya to the south-east.

Our space does not admit of any minute discussion of the local features peculiar to separate districts, but regarded broadly, four tolerably distinct types present themselves.

Himalayan.— The base of the Himalayas is occupied by a narrow belt forming an extreme north-western extension of the Malayan type described below. Above that there is a rich temperate flora which in the eastern chain may be regarded as forming an extension of that of northern China, gradually assuming westwards more and more of a European facies. Magnolia, Aucuba, Abelia, and Shimmia may be mentioned as examples of Chinese genera found in the eastern Himalayas, and the tea-tree grows wild in Assam. The same coniferous trees are common to both parts of the range. Pinus longifolia extends to the Hindu-Kush; P. excelsa is found universally except in Sikkim, and has its European analogue in P. Peuce, found in the mountains of Greece. Abies smithiana extends into Afghanistan; Abies webbiana forms dense forests at altitudes of 8000 to 12,000 feet, and ranges from Bhutân to Kashmir; several junipers and the common yew (Taxus baccata) also occur. The deodar (Cedrus Deodara), which is indigenous to the mountains of Afghanistan and the north-west Himalaya, is nearly allied to the Atlantic cedar and to the cedar of Lebanon, a form of which has recently been found in Cyprus. A notable further instance of the connexion of the western Himâlayan flora with that of Europe is the holm oak (Quercus Ilex), which is characteristic of the Mediterranean region.

The upper levels of the Himalayas slope northwards gradually to the Tibetan uplands, over which the Siberian temperate vegetation ranges. This is part of the great temperate flora which, with locally individualized species, but often with identical genera, ranges over the whole of the temperate zone of the northern hemisphere. In the western Himâlayas this upland flora is marked by a strong admixture of European species, such as the columbine (Aguilegia) and hawthorn (Cratoegus Oxyacantha). These disappear rapidly eastward, and are scarcely found beyond Kumâun.

North-Western.— This is best marked in Sind and the Punjab, where the climate is very dry (the rainfall averaging less than 15 inches), and where the soil, though fertile, is wholly dependent on irrigation for its cultivation. The flora is a poor one in number of species, and is essentially identical with that of Persia, southern Arabia, and Egypt. The low scattered jungle contains such characteristic species as Capparis aphylla, Acacia arabica (babùl), Populus euphratica (the “willows” of Ps. cxxxvii. 2), Salvadora persica (erroneously identified by Royle with the mustard of Matt, xiii. 31), tamarisk, Zizyphus, Lotus, &c. More than nine-tehths of the Sind vegetation is estimated to be indigenous to Africa. The dry flora extends somewhat in a southeast direction, and then blends insensibly with that of the western peninsula; some species representing it are found in the upper Gangetic plain, and a few are widely distributed in dry parts of the country.

Malayan.— This Sir Joseph Hooker describes as forming “the bulk of the flora of the perennially humid regions of India, as of the whole Malayan peninsula, the Upper Assam valley, the Khâsi mountains, the forests of the base of the Himalaya from the Brahmaputra to Nep41, of the Malabar coast, and of Ceylon.” It is not of course intended that over this wide and disjointed area there is an actual identity of species; but the affinities and general agreement of facies are sufficiently close to leave no doubt that they belong essentially to one and the same flora. A few illustrations must suffice :—pitcher-plants (Nepenthes), so richly developed in Borneo, occur at Singapore, on the Khâsï mountains, and in Ceylon, while they are absent from the western peninsula; wood-oil trees (Diptcrocarpeoe), which abound in the forests of the Malayan archipelago, are well represented by species individualized by isolation in the Malayan peninsula, Ceylon, and southern India; the gamboge of Singapore is scarcely distinguishable botanically from the Ceylon species; rubber-yielding trees are characteristic, such are the climbing Apocynaceoe found in the Malayan peninsula and Borneo, and the well-known Picus elastica, indigenous to Assam and Java; numerous palms and several species of Cycas also distinguish this flora from that of the western peninsula. Teak (Tectona grandis), which is indigenous to the Malayan archipelago, is native to both peninsulas as far as 25° N. lat., and is more tolerant of a dry climate than most of its associates.

Western Peninsula.— This type is difficult to characterize, and is in many respects intermediate between the two just preceding. It occupies a comparatively dry area, with a rainfall under 75 inches. In respect to positive affinities, Sir Joseph Hooker has pointed out· some relations with the flora of tropical Africa as evidenced by the prevalence of such genera as Grewia and Impatiens, and the absence, common to both countries, of oaks and pines which abound in the Malayan archipelago. The annual vegetation which springs up in the rainy season includes numerous genera, such as Sida and Indigofera, which are largely represented both in Africa and Hindustân. Palms also in both countries are scanty, the most notable in southern India being the wild date (Phoenix sylvestris) ; Borassus and the cocoa-nut are cultivated. The forests, though occasionally very dense, as in the western Ghâts, are usually drier and more open than those of the Malayan type, and are often scrubby. The most important timber trees are the toon (Cedrela Toona), sâl (Shorea robusta), the present area of which forms two belts separated by the Gangetic plain, satin wood (Chloroxylon Swieteηia), common in the drier parts of the peninsula, sandalwood, especially characteristic of Mysore, iron-wood (Mesτια ferrea), and teak, which has already been alluded to.^[1. For a general sketch of the flora of India recourse must still he had to the introductory essay to the Flora Indica, published by Hooker and Thomson in 1855. The Flora of British India, the preparation of which is (1881) in progress at Kew, will comprise brief descriptions of all the species known to science up to the date of publication. But although no complete analysis of the vegetation is yet possible, its general features are now tolerably well understood. [For the above section on the Flora we are indebted to Mr W. T. T. Dyer of Kew.]]
[9:12:741]

Wild Animals. Mammals.— First among the wild animals of India must be mentioned the lion (Felis led), which is known to have been not uncommon within historical times in Hindustan Proper and the Punjab. At present, the lion is supposed to be confined to the sandy deserts of Guzerat. A peculiar variety is there found, marked by the absence of a mane; but whether this variety deserves to be classed as a distinct species naturalists are not yet determined. The former extent of the lion’s range, or at least the degree to which its presence impressed the imagination, may be inferred from the common personal names, Sinh or Sing, Sher, and Hyder, which all signify “lion.” The characteristic beast of prey in India is the tiger (F. tigris), which is found in every part of the country from the slopes of the Himalayas to the Sundarban swamps. Sir Joseph Fayrer, the highest living authority on this subject, believes that 12 feet is the maximum length of the tiger, when measured from nose to tip of tail immediately after death. The advance of cultivation, even more than the incessant attacks of sportsmen, has gradually caused the tiger to become a rare animal in large tracts of country; but it is scarcely probable that he will ever be exterminated from India. The malarious tardi fringing the Himalâyas, the uninhabitable swamps of the Gangetic delta, and the wide jungles of the central plateau, are at present the chief home of the tiger. His favourite food appears to be deer, antelope, and wild hog. When these abound he will disregard domestic cattle. Indeed, the natives are disposed to consider him as in some sort their protector, as he saves their crops from destruction by the wild animals on which he feeds. But when once he develops a taste for human blood, then the slaughter he works becomes truly formidable. The confirmed man-eater, which is generally an old beast, disabled from overtaking his usual prey, seems to accumulate his tale of victims in sheer cruelty rather than for food. A single tiger is known to have killed 108 people in the course of three years. Another killed an average of about 80 persons per annum. A third caused thirteen villages to be abandoned, and 250 square miles of land to be thrown out of cultivation. A fourth, so late as 1869, killed 127 people, and stopped a public road for many weeks, until the opportune arrival of an English sportsman, who at last killed him. Such cases are, of course, exceptional, and generally refer to a period long past, but they explain and justify the superstitious awe with which the tiger is regarded by the natives. The favourite mode of shooting the tiger is from the back of elephants, or from elevated platforms (machdnd) of boughs in the jungle. In Central India they are shot on foot. In Assam they are sometimes speared from boats, and in the Himalayas they are said to be ensnared by bird-lime. Rewards are given by Government to native shikaris for the heads of tigers, varying in time and place according to the need. In 1877, 819 persons and 16,137 cattle were reported to have been killed by tigers; on the other side of the account, 1579 tigers were reported slain, and £3777 was paid in rewards. The leopard or panther (F. pardud) is far more common than the tiger in all parts of India, and at least equally destructive to life and property. The greatest length of the leopard is about 7 feet 6 inches. A black variety, as beautiful as it is rare, is sometimes found in the extreme south of the peninsula, and also in Java. The cheetah or hunting leopard (Gueparda jubata) must be carefully distinguished from the leopard proper. This animal appears to be a native only of the Deccan, where it is trained for hunting the antelope. In some respects it approaches the dog more nearly than the cat tribe. Its limbs are long, its hair rough, and its claws blunt and only partially retractile. The speed with which it bounds upon its prey, when loosed from the cart, exceeds the swiftness of any other mammal If it misses its first attack, it scarcely ever attempts to follow, but returns to its master. Among other species of the family Felidae found in India may be mentioned the ounce or snow leopard (#. uncia), the clouded tiger (F. macroscelid), the marbled tiger cat (F. marmorata), the jungle cat (P∙ chaud) and the common viverrine cat (F. viverrind).

Wolves (Canis lupus) abound throughout the open country, but are rare in the wooded districts. Their favourite prey is sheep, but they are also said to run down antelopes and hares, or rather catch them by lying iu ambush. Instances of their attacking man are not uncommon. In 1827 upwards of thirty children were carried off by wolves in a single pargand; and the story of Romulus and Remus has had its counterpart in India within recent times. The Indian wolf has a dingy reddish-white fur, some of the hairs being tipped with black. By some naturalists it is regarded as a distinct species, under the name of Canis ρallipes. Three distinct varieties, the white, the red, and the black wolf, are found in the Tibetan Himâlayas. The Indian fox (Vulpes bengalensid) is comparatively rare, but the jackal (C. aureus) abounds everywhere, making night hideous by its never-to-be-forgotten yells. The jackal, and not the fox, is usually the animal hunted by the packs of hounds occasionally kept by Europeans. The wild dog or dhole (C. dhola) is found in all the wilder jungles of India, including Assam and British Burmah. Its characteristic is that it hunts in packs, sometimes containing thirty dogs, and does not give tongue. W’hen once a pack of wild dogs has put up any animal, whether deer or tiger, that animal’s doom is sealed. They do not leave it for days, and finally bring it to bay, or run it down exhausted. These wild dogs have sometimes been half domesticated, and trained to hunt for the use of man. A peculiar variety of wild dog exists in the Karen hills of Burmah, thus described from a specimen in confinement. It was black and white, as hairy as a skye-terrier, and as large as a medium-sized spaniel. It had an invariable habit of digging a hole in the ground, into which it crawled backwards, remaining there all day with only its nose and ferrety eyes visible. Among other dogs of India are the pariah, which is merely a mongrel, run wild and half starved; the poligar dog, an immense creature peculiar to the south; the grey-hound, used for coursing; and the mastiff of Tibet and Bhutan. The striped hyaena (Hyoena striata) is common, being found wherever the wolf is absent. Like the wolf, it is very destructive both to the flocks and to children.

Of bears, the common black or sloth bear (Ursus labiatιιs) is common throughout India wherever rocky hills and forests occur. It is distinguished by a white horse-shoe mark on its breast. Its food consists of ants, honey, and fruit. When disturbed it will attack man, and it is a dangerous antagonist, for it always strikes at the face. The Hiπtalayan or Tibetan sun bear (U. tibetaηus) is found along the north, from the Punjab to Assam. During the summer it remains high up in the mountains, near the limit of snow, but in the winter it descends to 5000 feet and even lower. Its congener, the Malayan sun bear (Helarctos malayanud), is found in British Burmah, where also there is a smaller species (H. euryspil·ud), and a very large animal reported to be as big as the American grizzly.

The elephant (Elephas indiens) is found in many parts of India, though not in the north-west. Contrary to what might be anticipated from its size and from the habits of its African cousin, the Indian elephant is now, at any rate, an inhabitant, not of the plains, but of the hills; and even on the hills it is usually found among the higherridges and plateaus, and not in the valleys. From the peninsula of [9:12:742] India the elephant has been gradually exterminated, being only found now in the primaeval forests of Cυorg, Mysore, and Travancore, and in the tributary states of Orissa. It still exists in considerable number along the tardi or submontane fringe of the Himâlayas. The main source of supply at the present time is the confused mass of hills which forms the north-east boundary of British India, from Assam to Burmah. Two varieties are there distinguished, the gunda or tusker, and the makna or hine, which has no tusks. The reports of the height of the elephant, like those of its intelligence, seem to be exaggerated. The maximum is probably 12 feet. If hunted, the elephant must be attacked on foot, and the sport is therefore dangerous, especially as the animal has but few parts vulnerable to a bullet. The regular mode of catching elephants is by means of a kheda or gigantic stockade, into which a wild herd is driven, then starved into submission, and tamed by animals already domesticated. The practice of capturing them in pitfalls is discouraged as cruel and wasteful. Elephants now form a Government monopoly everywhere in India. The shooting of them is prohibited, except when they become dangerous to man or destructive to the crops; and the right of capturing them is only leased out upon conditions. A special law, under the title of “The Elephants Preservation Act” (No. VI. of 1879), regulates this licensing system. Whoever kills, captures, or injures an elephant, or attempts to do so, without a licence, is punishable by a fine of 500 rupees for the first offence; and a similar fine, together with six months’ imprisonment, for a second offence. In the year 1877-78 a total of two hundred and sixty-four elephants were captured in the province of Assam, yielding to Government a revenue of £3600. In the season of 1873-74 no less than fifty-three were captured at one time by Mr Sanderson, the superintendent of the Kheda Department in Mysore, who has made a special study of the Indian elephant, as Sir S. Baker has of the same animal in Ceylon. Though the supply is decreasing, elephants continue to be in great demand. Their chief use is in the timber trade, and for Government transport. They are also bought up by native chiefs at high prices for purposes of ostentation. Of the rhinoceros, four distinct varieties are enumerated, two with a single and two with a double horn. The most familiar is the Rhinoceros unicornis, commonly found in the Brahmaputra valley and in the Sundarbans. It has but one horn, and is covered with massive folds of naked skin. It sometimes attains a height of 6 feet; its horn, which is much prized by the natives for medicinal purposes, seldom exceeds 14 inches in length. It frequents swampy, shady spots, and wallows in mud like a pig. The inveterate antipathy of the rhinoceros to the elephant seems to be mythical. The Javan rhinoceros (J?, sondaicus) is found in the same localities. It also has but one horn, and mainly differs from the foregoing in being smaller, and having less prominent “shields.” The Sumatran rhinoceros (R. sumatrensis) is found from Chittagong southwards through Burmah. It has two horns and a bristly coat. The hairy-eared rhinoceros (R. lasiotis) is only known from a specimen captured at Chittagong.

The wild hog (Sus scrofa, var. indica) is well known as affording the most exciting sport in the world—“pigsticking.” It frequents cultivated situations, and is the most mischievous enemy of the villager. A rare animal, called the pigmy hog (Porculia salviania), exists in the tardi of Nepâl and Sikkim, and has been shot in Assam. Its height is only 10 inches, and its weight does not exceed 12 lb.

The wild ass (Λsιzms onager) is confined to the sandy deserts of Sind and Kachhch (Cutch), where, from its speed and timidity, it is almost unapproachable.

Many wild species of the sheep and goat tribe are to be found in the Himâlayan ranges. The Ovis ammon and O. poli are Tibetan rather than Indian species. The urial and the shapu are kindred species of wild sheep, found respectively in Ladâkh and the Sulâimân range. The former comes down to 2000 feet above the sea, the latter is never seen at altitudes lower than 12,000 feet. The barhal, or blue wild sheep, and the markhur and tahr (both wild goats) also inhabit the Himâlayas. A variety of the ibex is also found there, as well as in the highest ranges of southern India. The sarau (Nemorhaedus rubida), allied to the chamois, has a wide range in the mountains of the north, from the Himâlayas to Assam and Burmah.

The antelope tribe is represented by comparatively few species, as compared with the great number peculiar to Africa. The antelope proper (Antilope bezoartica), the “black buck” of sportsmen, is very generally distributed. Its special habitat is salt plains, as on the coast-line of Guzerat and Orissa, where herds of fifty does may be seen, accompanied by a single buck. The doe is of a light fawn colour, and has no horns. The colour of the buck is a deep brown-black above, sharply marked off from the white of the belly. His spiral horns, twisted for three or four turns like a corkscrew, often reach the length of 30 inches. The flesh is dry and unsavoury, but is permitted meat for Hindus, even of the Brâhman caste. The nilgai or blue cow (Portax picta) is also widely distributed, but specially abounds in Hindustan Proper and Guzerat. As with the antelope, the male alone has the dark blue colour. The nilgai is held peculiarly sacred by Hindus, from its fancied kinship to the cow, and on this account its destructive inroads upon the crops are tolerated. The four-horned antelope (Tetraceros quadricornis) and the gazelle (Gazella bennetti) are also found in India. The chiru (Pantholops hodgsoni) is confined to the Himâlayan plateaus.

The king of the deer tribe is the sdmbhar or gerau (Rusa amstotelis), erroneously called “elk” by sportsmen. It is found on the forest-clad hills in all parts of the country. It is of a deep-brown colour, with hair on its neck almost like a mane; and it stands nearly 5 feet high, with spreading antlers nearly 3 feet in length. Next in size is the swamp deer or bara-singha, signifying “twelve points” (Rucervus duvaucelli), which is common in Lower Bengal, and Assam. The chitdl or spotted deer (Axis maculata) is generally admitted to be the most beautiful inhabitant of the Indian jungles. Other species include the hog deer (Cervus porcinus), the barking deer or muntjac (Cervulus vaginalis), and the mouse deer (Meminna indica). The musk deer (Moschus moschiferus) is confined to Tibet.

The ox tribe is represented in India by some of its 1 noblest species. The gaur (Bibos gau/rus), the “bison” of sportsmen, is found in all the hill jungles of the country, in the Western Ghâts, in Central India, in Assam, and in British Burmah. This animal sometimes attains the height of 20 hands (close on 7 feet), measuring from the hump above the shoulder. Its short curved horns and skull are enormously massive. Its colour is dark chestnut, or coffeebrown. From the difficult nature of its habitat, and from the ferocity with which it charges an enemy, the pursuit of the bison is no less dangerous and no less exciting than that of the tiger or the elephant. Akin to the gaur, though not identical, are the gaydl or mithan (B. frontalis), confined to the hills of the north-east frontier, where it is domesticated for sacrificial purposes by the aboriginal tribes, and the tsine or banting (B. soηdaicus), found in Burmah. The wild buffalo (Bubal·us arni) differs from the tame 1 buffalo only in being larger and more fierce. The finest specimens come from Assam and Burmah. The horns of the bull are thicker than those of the cow, but the horns of the cow are larger. A head has been known to measure 13 feet 6 inches in circumference, and 6 feet 6 inches [9:12:743] between the tips. The greatest height is G feet. The colour is a slaty black; the hide is immensely thick, with scanty hairs. Alone perhaps of all wild animals in India, the buffalo will charge unprovoked. Even tame buffaloes seem to have an inveterate dislike to Europeans.

The rat and mouse family is only too numerous. Conspicuous in it is the loathsome bandicoot (Hus bandicota), which sometimes measures 2 feet in length, including its tail, and weighs 3 lb. It burrows under houses, and is very destructive to plants, fruit, and even poultry. More interesting is the tree rat (H. arboreus), a native of Bengal, about 7 inches long, which makes its nest in cocoa-nut palms and bamboos. The voles or field mice (genus Arvicola) occasionally multiply so exceedingly as to diminish the out-turn of the local harvest, and to require special measures to be organized for their suppression.

Birds.— The ornithology of India, though it is not considered so rich in specimens of gorgeous and variegated plumage as that of other tropical regions, contains many splendid and curious varieties. Some are clothed in nature’s gay attire, others distinguished by strength, size, and fierceness. The parrot tribe is the most remarkable for beauty. So various are the species that we cannot even enumerate them, and must refer for details to the scientific works on the subject.^[2. See especially Jerdon and Gould.] ' Among birds of prey, four vultures are found, including the common scavengers (Gyps indicus and G. bengalensis). The eagles comprise many species, but none to surpass the golden eagle of Europe. Of falcons, there are the peregrine (F. peregrinus), the shain (F. peregrinator), and the lagar (F. jugger), which are all trained by the natives for hawking; of hawks, the shikara (Astur badius), the sparrow hawk (Accipiter nisus), and the crested goshawk (Astur trivir-gatus). Kingfishers of various kinds, and herons are sought for their plumage. No bird is more popular with natives than the maina (Acridotheres tristis), a member of the starling family, which lives contentedly in a cage, and can be taught to pronounce the name of Krishna. Water-fowl are especially numerous. Of gamebirds, the floriken (Sypheotides auritus) is valued as much for its rarity as for the delicacy of its flesh. Snipe (Gallinago scolopacina) abound at certain seasons, in such numbers that one gun has been known to make a bag of eighty brace in a day. Pigeons, partridges, quail, plover, duck, teal, sheldrake, widgeon—all of many varieties— complete the list of small game. The red jungle fowl (Gallus ferruginesis), supposed to be the ancestor of our own poultry, is not good eating; and the same may be said of the peacock (Pavo cristatus), except when young. The pheasant does not occur in India Proper, though a white variety is found in Burmah.

Reptiles. — The serpent tribe in India is numerous; they - swarm in all the gardens, and intrude into the dwellings of the inhabitants, especially in the rainy season. Most are comparatively harmless, but the bite of others is speedily fatal.^[3. See Sir J, Fayrcr , s Thαηαtοphidiα] The cobra di capello (Naga tripudians) — the name given to it by the Portuguese, from the appearance of a hood which it produces by the expanded skin about the neck—is the most dreaded. It seldom exceeds

3 or 4 feet in length, and is about an inch and a quarter thick, with a small head, covered on the forepart with large smooth scales; it is of a pale brown colour above, and the belly is of a bluish-white tinged with pale brown or yellow. The Russelian snake (Daboia russellii), about

4 feet in length, is of a pale yellowish-brown, beautifully variegated with large oval spots of deep brown, with a white edging. Its bite is extremely fatal. Itinerant showmen carry about these serpents, and cause them to assume a dancing motion for the amusement of the spectators. They also give out that they render snakes harmless by the use of charms or music,—in reality it is by extracting the venomous fangs. But, judging from the frequent accidents which occur, they sometimes dispense with this precaution. All the salt-water snakes in India are poisonous, while the freshwater forms are wholly innocuous. Sir J. Fayrer has demonstrated that there is no cure for the bite of the cobra, if the snake is full-grown, and if its poison fang is full and is not interfered with by clothing. The most hopeful remedy in all cases of snake bite is the injection of ammonia. The loss of life from this cause in India is painful to contemplate, nor does any means of diminishing the evil seem feasible. It is impossible to exterminate poisonous snakes altogether, even in England. In India the impossibility is yet more evident, from the greater number of the snakes, the character of the country, and the scruples of the people. Something, however, is being effected by the offer of rewards. In 1877 a total of 16,777 persons are reported to have been killed by snakes, as compared with only 819 by tigers. In the same year, rewards to the amount of £811 were given for the destruction of 127,295 snakes.

The other reptiles include two varieties of crocodile (C. ρorosus and C. biporcatus) and the gavial (Gavialis gangeticus). These are more ugly in appearance than destructive to human life. Scorpions also abound.

Fishes.— All the waters of India—the sea, the rivers, and the tanks—swarm with a great variety of fishes, which are caught in every conceivable way, and furnish a considerable proportion of the food of the poorer classes. They are eaten fresh, or as nearly fresh as may.be, for the art of curing them is not generally practised, owing to the exigencies of the salt monopoly. In Burmah'the favourite relish of nga-ρi is prepared from fish; and at Goâlandâ, at the junction of the Brahmaputra with the Ganges, an important station has recently been established for salting fish in bond. The indiscriminate slaughter of fry, and the obstacles opposed by irrigation dams to breeding fish, are said to be causing a sensible diminution in the supply in certain rivers. Measures of conservancy have been suggested, but their execution would be almost impracticable. Among Indian fishes, the Cyprinidoe or carp family and the Siluridoe or cat-fishes are best represented. From the angler’s point of view, by far the finest fish is the mahsir, found in all hill streams, whether in Assam, the Punjab, or the South. One has been caught weighing 60 fib, which gave play for more than seven hours. Though called the salmon of India, the rnahsir is really a species of barbel. The most recent authority on Indian fishes and their economic aspects is Dr Francis Day.

In this connexion may be mentioned the susu or Gangetic dolphin (Platanista gangetica), which is often erroneously called a porpoise. Both the structure and habits of this animal are very singular. It measures from 6 to 12 feet in length, and in colour is sooty-black. Its head is globular, with a long, narrow, spoon-shaped snout. Its eyes are rudimentary, like those of the mole; and its ear-orifices are no bigger than pin-holes. Its dentition, also, is altogether abnormal. It frequents the Ganges and Indus from their mouths right up to their tributaries within the hills. A specimen has been taken at least 1000 miles above Calcutta. Ordinarily its movements are slow, for it wallows in the muddy bed of the river, and but rarely comes to the surface to blow. The susu belongs to the order Cetacea; and inquiries have recently been directed to the point whether its blubber might not be utilized in commerce.

Insects.— The insect tribes in India may be truly said to be innumerable; nor has anything like a complete classification been given of them in the most scientific treatises.
[9:12:744]

The heat and the rains give incredible activity to noxious or troublesome insects, and to others of a more showy class, whose large wings surpass in brilliancy the most splendid colours of art. Stinging musquitoes are innumerable, and moths and ants of the most destructive kind, as well as others equally noxious and disagreeable. Amongst those which are useful are the bee, the silk-worm, and the insect that produces lac. - Clouds of locusts occasionally appear, which leave no trace of green behind them, and give the country over which they pass the appearance of a desert. Dr Buchanan saw a mass of these insects in his journey from Madras to the Mysore territory, about 3 miles in length, like a long narrow red cloud near the horizon, and making a noise somewhat resembling that of a cataract. Their size was about that of a man’s finger, and their colour reddish. They are swept north by the wind till they strike upon the outer ranges of the Himalayas, The People.

The population of India, with. British Burmah, amounts to 240 millions, or, as already mentioned, exactly double the number which Gibbon estimated for the Roman empire in the height of its power. But the English Government, like the Roman, has respected the rights of native chiefs who are willing to govern peaceably and well, and one-third of the country still remains in the hands of hereditary rulers. Their subjects (including Mysore) make up 54 millions, or over one-fifth of the whole Indian people. The British territories (including Mysore, temporarily under British administration), therefore comprise only two-thirds of the area of India, and less than four-fifths, or 191 millions, of its inhabitants.

For the first time in the history of India an attempt was made in the· years 1871-72 to ascertain the population of the country by actual counting. The results obtained on that occasion, though in certain points they leave much to be desired, may be accepted generally as a tolerable approximation to the truth. Prior to this census, occasional enumerations had been made, with varying degrees of accuracy, in some of the provinces; while in others mere conjectural estimates had been allowed to pass uncriticized. In Bengal, for example, where statistical inquiry was in a backward state, the Government had year by year accepted a loose estimate of 42 millions for the population under its control, and based upon this all its calculations for legislation and finance. The census of 1872 disclosed a total of nearly 67 millions for Bengal and Assam, being an increase upon the estimate of more than one-half. In Berar, or the Assigned Districts of Hyderabad, a census had been taken in 1867, in the Punjab in 1868, and in Oudh in 1869. In these provinces, therefore, it was considered impolitic to trouble the people by a fresh enumeration. Throughout all the rest of India under British administration, including the native state of Mysore, a general census was effected on uniform principles, which may be said to have begun in November 1871 and ended in August 1872. So far as possible, the work was done in a single night; but in certain remote and uncivilized tracts it was of necessity prolonged over several months. Considering the absolute novelty of the undertaking, at least in some provinces, and the scanty means at the disposal of the authorities, the general accuracy of the results may be regarded with not a little satisfaction. Subsequent local investigations tend to show that the numbers were under rather than overstated. In a few cases paid enumerators were engaged; but generally the Work was left to the ordinary staff of each district, assisted by the police, the landlords, and their agents. The total expenditure throughout all British India was only £82,203, being at the rate of less than half a farthing per head. The suspicions of the ignorant villagers were naturally aroused by the counting, which they imagined to be preliminary to some fresh exaction by the Sarkâr or Government. Only in two or three cases was any real opposition offered; and there is little reason to believe thatany material evasion was accomplished.

The total population of British India was ascertained to amount to 191,096,603 persons, on an area of 898,381 square miles, being an average of 212 persons per square mile. Deducting the frontier province of Assam and British Burmah beyond the sea, the average is 243 persons per square mile. The population of the several native states is returned, partly from actual énumération and partly from mere guessing, at 49,155,746 persons, on an area of 575,265 square miles, being an average of 85 persons to the square mile. The French possessions have an area of 178 square miles and a population of 271,460 persons; the Portuguese possessions, 1086 square miles and 407,712 persons. The aggregate figures for all India, therefore, are 1,474,910 square miles and 240,931,521 persons, or an average of 163 persons per square mile.

The following tables exhibit the results of the census of 1872 in a tabular form, arranged according to provinces and aggregates of native states, as presented to Parliament in 1879 in the Statistical Abstract for British India, No. XIII. for 1877-78. For certain details the Memorandum on the Census of 1872 presented to Parliament in 1875 has been used. No really important changes in the returns will be made till the next census, but slight alterations or adjustments are from time to time effected.

According to the report of the registrar-general upon the English census of 1871, “any density of a large country approaching 200 to a square mile implies mines, manufactures, or the industry of cities.” But in India a density of thrice this limit, or 600 to the square mile, is often attained throughout large districts which are entirely dependent upon agriculture. Sâran, for example, in North Behar, with an area of 2654 square miles and no town exceeding 50,000 inhabitants, has an average density of 778 to the square mile, with a maximum of 984 in the purely agricultural thana or police circle of Mashrak. Taking the valley of the Ganges as a whole, from Sahâranpur down to Calcutta, the average density is about 500 to the square mile, or nearly double that of the United Kingdom.

This high density is obtained without the presence of many large towns or centres of manufacturing life. Of the total number of 493,444 towns and villages in British India, only 44 are returned as having more than 50,000 inhabitants, 374 as having from 10,000 to 50,000, and 1070 as having from 5000 to 10,000. The 44 towns with more than 50,000 inhabitants have an aggregate urban population of a little more than 5⅜ millions, or less than 3 per cent, of the total population of British India; whereas the 34 towns in England and Wales exceeding the same limit have an aggregate urban population of nearly 7⅜ millions, or 32 per cent, of the total. Taking a lower limit, there are 139 towns in British India with more than 20,000 inhabitants, having an aggregate of 8,484,066, or less than 4 J per cent, of the total.

Towns with more than 100,000 Inhabitants.
[table]

The total number of inhabited houses enumerated in British India is 37,041,259. The average number of houses per square mile is 41, ranging from 102 in Oudn to 6 in British Burmah. The average number of persons per house is 5'15, being pretty uniform throughout. Contrary to the experience of the United Kingdom it is found that the number of inmates to each house is lower in the towns than in the country, the reason assigned being that the shopkeepers do not bring their families into the towns with them. The houses are grouped into a total of 493,444 villages or townships, giving an average of 75 houses and 386 persons to each. The average area of each village or township is ’ 55 of a square mile. The villages seem to be largest in Bombay, with 614 inhabitants each, and smallest in British Burmah, with 195 inhabitants.

Out of the total of 191,096,603 persons in British India, 98,055,381 are returned as males and 92,580,886 as females, leaving 460,336 of whom the sex was unspecified. The proportion of males to females is thus as 100 to 94. In England the females outnumber the males in the proportion of 105 to 100, an excess attributed mainly to emigration. In India, whence there is practically no emigration, it might be expected that this excess of females would disappear, and the two sexes be found on an equality. In the two great provinces of Bengal and Madras this is practically the case, the excess of females being not greater than 1 per cent., and the proportion being maintained uniformly throughout the districts. But in Oudh the excess of males is 7 per cent., in Bombay 8 per cent., in the North-Western Provinces 12 per cent., and in the Punjab as high as 16 per cent. We have no reason to suppose that the approximate equality of boys and girls does not hold good in the births throughout India, as in other countries; and therefore this great excess of males can only be assigned to two causes—(1) defective registration of females, especially of girls, and (2) female infanticide formerly, and carelessness of infant female life at the present day. Of the existence of these causes we possess independent testimony. In 1870 an act of the legislature was passed applying special regulations to villages or tracts suspected of infanticide, which is the besetting sin of certain high caste tribes of Rajputs. In one tribe of Meerut district only 8 girls under 12 were found to 80 boys. The act is put in force wherever there are less than 54 girls to 100 boys, but the exact limit is at the discretion of Government. The crime is now almost stamped out.

The returns according to age throw some light upon this question. Children under 12 number altogether 66,969,764, and adults above 12 number 123,200,022, leaving 926,817 unspecified. The proportion of children to adults is, therefore, as 54 to 100, the corresponding proportion in England being 41 to 100. The highest proportion of children (62 to 100) is found in the Central Provinces, where the aboriginal tribes are strongest; and the lowest proportion (50 to 100) in the North-Western Provinces. An examination of the Bengal returns, district by district, also leads to the conclusion that the aboriginal tribes are more prolific than the Hindus proper. Subdividing these returns according to sex, we discover an extraordinary disparity. Of the adults, 62,022,461 are males and 61,197,561 are females. The proportion of male adults to females is, therefore, about 100 to 99, as compared with 100 males to 94 females in the general population. But on turning to the children under 12, we findas many as 35,787,564 boys to only 31,182,200 girls, or 100 boys to only 87 girls. This arises from the defective registration of girls, females under 12 being often returned as women.

The following table shows the population of British India as roughly subdivided according to religion. Broadly speaking, it may be said that at least nineteen out of every twenty people in India are either Hindus or Mahometans, and that there are seven of the former to two of the latter.

Population according to Religion in British India.
[table]

The schedules of the census fail entirely to give a satisfactory classification of the races among which the vast population of India is divided. Using language as our criterion, the people might perhaps be arranged in five classes :—(1) The old races of the south, known as the Dravidian stock, which includes, not only the great peoples using the literary languages of Tamil, Telugu, Malayâlam, and Kanarese, but also scattered tribes speaking dialects of the same family, who are found as far north as the hills of Chutià Nâgpur; (2) the hill tribes of Central India, from the Bhils of Bombay to the Santâls of Bengal, whose physical characteristics are negroid, and whose family of languages has received the name of Kolarian; (3) the tribes of Indo-Chinese origin, who inhabit the southern slopes of the Himalayas, the greater part of the Assam valley, and the whole of Burmah;—it seems probable that the semi-Hinduized low castes of Northern Bengal also belong to this stock; (4) high-caste Hindus, or that offshoot of the august Aryan race which has imposed its language, its religion, and its name upon the greater part of the country; (5) successive waves of Mahometan conquerors, Arab, Afghân, Mughal, and Persian, who form in the aggregate but an infinitesimal element in the general population. Whether pure Aryans are now to be traced in any other class than that of the Brâhmans [9:12:746] may perhaps be disputed. Even the so-called Ràjputs have probably a considerable admixture of Scythic blood. The Vaisya or third caste of Manu’s system is admitted to be almost extinct, while his Sιidras are to be found in the pre-existing non-Aryan population.

Principal Divisions of the Population.
[table]

Among Mahometans, who number in all 40,227,552, four classes are commonly distinguished. Mughals., or the descendants of the last conquering race, number only 219,755, of whom nearly half are to be found in the Punjab. Afghdns or Pathdns on the other hand, from their proximity to the frontier, are much more strongly represented, numbering 1,841,693 in all, chiefly in the Punjab and in the Rohilkhand division of the North-West. Sayyids, who claim to be lineally descended from the prophet, number 790,984; and Shaikhs, 4,700,320. The remainder are unspecified, but the following tribes or classes among Indian Musalmàns are worthy of notice. In Bengal the vast majority of the Mahometans manifestly belong to the same race as the lowest castes of Hindus. They are themselves subdivided into many classes, which in their devotion to hereditary occupations are scarcely to be distinguished from Hindu castes. Of late years a reforming spirit has arisen, leading them to abandon the polytheistic customs and festivals which they shared with their Hindu fellow-villagers. In the Punjab, besides the Pathân immigrants from across the frontier, Islam has taken a strong hold of the native population. The census returned upwards of 1,300,000 Jâts, 700,000 Ràjputs, and 424,000 Gujars among the Musalmàns. Here, again, the Mahometans are not strongly distinguished from their Hindu brethren. Baluchis from beyond the frontier number 235,000 in the Punjab, and 145,000 in Sind. Bombay possesses three peculiar classes of Musalmàns, each of which is specially devoted to maritime trade,—the Memons, numbering 49,000, chiefly in Sind; the Borahs, 86,000, mainly in Guzerat; the Khojahs, nearly 18,000, of whom half live in the island of Bombay. In southern India the majority are known as Dakhani Musalmàns, being descendants of the armies led by the kings and nawàbs of the Deccan. But the two peculiar races of the south are the Moplas (613,000) and the Labbays (312,000), both of which are seated along the coast and follow a seafaring life. They are descended from the Arab traders who settled there in very early times, and have been recruited partly by voluntary adhesions and partly by forcible conversions during the persecutions of Hyder All and Tipù Sultân. The Moplas of Malabar are notorious for repeated outbreaks of bloody fanaticism.

The Mahometans are most numerous, as might be expected, along the valley of the Indus, from Karàchi (Kurrachee) to Peshàwar. In the Bombay province of Sind they number 78 per cent, of the total population. In the Punjab generally the proportion is 53 per cent., rising to 93 per cent, in the frontier district of Peshàwar. In the North-Western Provinces and also in Oudh the proportion of Mahometans nowhere exceeds 23 per cent., though that part of the country was the seat of successive Musalmân empires for many centuries. In Lower Bengal, on the other hand, the faith of Islam has exercised a more permanent effect upon the population, especially in the valley of the Brahmaputra. The average of Mahometans in the whole province is 33 per cent., rising to 80 per cent, in the deltaic districts of Bogrà and Râjshâbi. Here, again, it is found that the Mahometans are not most numerous in the neighbourhood of the great Musalmân capitals, Gaur, Râjmahàl, Dacca, and Murshidàbâd, but in the densely populated agricultural tracts, where the semi-aboriginal tribes appear to have willingly embraced Islam in preference to remaining outcasts beyond the exclusive pale of Hinduism.

The Sikhs are almost entirely confined to the Punjab, where they number only 6'50 per cent, of the population. Their stronghold is the country between the rivers Râvi and Sutlej (Satlaj), including the historical cities of Lahore, Amritsar, Ambàla (Umballa), and Jalandhar. In no district do they form more than 17 per cent.

Of the total number of 897,682 Christians, about 250,000 are believed to be Europeans or to have European blood in their veins. The south of India is the only part where the exertions of the missionaries can be said to be visible in the statistics of population. In the Madras presidency generally, Christians number 533,760, or 1 - 71 per cent, of the total. Of these, about 416,000 are returned as Roman Catholics, and about 118,000 as Protestants. Nearly one-fifth of all the Christians are found in the single district of Tinnevelli, and they are numerically next strongest in Madura, Tanjore, Trichinopoli, South Kànara, and Malabar. Christianity has been known in southern India for many centuries. A Pehlevi inscription in the ancient church of the St Thomas’ Mount near Madras city indicates a settlement of Manichaeans or Persian Christians on the eastern coast, as well as on the west; and tradition speaks of the preaching of the apostle St Thomas in Madras, Tinnevelli, and Malabar. The adherents of the Syrian church in Malabar, Travancore, and Cochin are the most ancient Christian community in the south. After these come the Roman Catholics, who trace their origin to the teaching of St Xavier and the Madura Jesuits. The Protestant churches date only from about the beginning of the present century, but their progress since that time has been considerable. In Bombay there are 126,063 Christians, of whom nearly 83,000, chiefly Indo-Portuguese, are returned as Roman Catholics. In Bengal the Christians number only 90,763, but since the date of the census missionary effort has been very successful among the hill tribes of Chutiâ Nàgpur. In the North-Western Provinces there are 22,196 Christians, in the Punjab 22,154, in the Central Provinces 10,477, in Mysore 25,676, in Coorg 2410, and the remainder are scattered over Assam, Berar, and Ajmir. In British Burmah the Christians are proportionately more numerous than in any other province, amounting to 52,299, or 1 ’ 90 per cent., chiefly converts from the hill tribe of Karens. It should be remembered that the above figures are exclusive of the native states, in which the Christians amount to about 700,000, making a total in round numbers of 1J millions for all India.

An attempt was made at the time of the census to ascertain the professions and occupations of the male adults, but the results cannot be accepted as even approximately accurate. The totals, [9:12:747] however, are here given for what they may be worth. Out of a classified total of about 62,000,000 adult males, 2,232,000, or 3 - 6 per cent., were returned as professional or in Government service; 3,844,000, or 6 - 2 per cent., as in domestic service; 34,844,000, or 56 2 per cent., as agricultural; 3,224,000, or 5'2 per cent., as commercial; 8,122,000, or 13’1 per cent., as industrial; 7,626,000, or 12'3 per cent., as labourers; and 2,108,000, or 3 , 4 per cent., as independent and non-productive.

An attempt was also made to collect statistics of persons afflicted with certain specific infirmities, but here again the results possess little value. The number of insane persons and idiots was returned at 67,000, or 1 in 2700 of the population, being less than ∣th of the rate prevailing in England. The deaf and dumb numbered 134,000, or 1 in 1340, a proportion about half as great again as in England; the blind numbered 354,000, or rather less than 1 in 500, which is double the English rate; the lepers numbered 96,000, or 1 in 1875.

Returns of both births and deaths are now regularly collected over almost the entire area under British administration. In towns the returns are furnished through the municipalities, while in the rural tracts the agency employed is the police. The figures thus obtained are for the most part so evidently inadequate that it would only be misleading to reproduce them in this place. Suffice it to say that the sanitary commissioner accepts as approximately correct a calculation which estimates the average duration of life in India at thirty years and eight months, which is equivalent to an annual death-rate of 32 - 57 per thousand. During 1877, the year of famine, the ascertained death-rate in Madras rose to 53 - 2, while the ascertained birth-rate fell to 16 ’ 3 per thousand. Both these rates are, of course, mere approximations to the truth, but they serve to indicate how famine attacks a people from two sides. In 1877 the death-rate among European troops in India was 12'71 per thousand, being the lowest ever recorded; among native troops, 13’38 per thousand; and in the public jails, 61'95 per thousand, rising to 176Ό1 per thousand in the jails of Madras.

Agriculture.

The cultivation of the soil is the occupation of the Indian people, in a sense which is difficult to realize in England, and which cannot be adequately expressed by figures. As the land tax forms the mainstay of the imperial revenue, so the rdyat or cultivator constitutes the unit of the social system. The organized village community contains many other members besides the cultivators, but they all exist for his benefit, and all alike are directly maintained from the produce of the village fields. Even in considerable towns, the traders and handicraftsmen almost always possess plots of land of their own, on which they raise sufficient grain to supply their families with food. The operations of rural life are familiar to every class. They are enveloped in a cloud of religious sanctions, and serve to mark out by their recurring periods the annual round of common life. According to the returns of the general census of 1872, the number of adult males engaged in agriculture amounts to nearly 35 millions, or 56 ’ 2 per cent, of the total. To these ought to be added almost all the labourers, an additional 7⅛ millions, or 12 ’ 3 per cent.,— thus raising the grand total of persons directly supported by the land to more than two-thirds of the entire number of adult males, besides those indirectly or incidentally connected with it.

But though agriculture thus forms the staple industry of the country, its practice is pursued in different provinces with infinite variety of detail. Everywhere the same perpetual assiduity is found, but the inherited experience of generations has taught the cultivators to adapt their simple methods to differing circumstances. For irrigation, native patience and ingenuity have devised means which compare favourably with the colossal projects of Government. Manure is copiously applied to the more valuable crops whenever manure is available, its use being limited by poverty and not by ignorance. The rotation of crops is not adopted as a principle of cultivation; but in practice it is well known that a succession of exhausting crops cannot be taken in consecutive seasons from the same field, and the advantage of fallows is widely recognized. The periodicity of the seasons usually allows two, and sometimes three, harvests in the year, but not necessarily, nor indeed usually, on the same fields. For inexhaustible fertility, and for retentiveness of moisture in a dry year, no soil in the world can surpass the regar or “black cotton-soil” of the Deccan. In the broad river basins, the inundations deposit annually a fresh top-dressing of silt, thus superseding the necessity of manures.

The name of rice has from time immemorial been so closely associated with Indian agriculture, that it is difficult to realize how comparatively small an area is planted with this crop. If we except the deltas of the great rivers and the long strip of land fringing the western coast, rice may be called an occasional crop throughout the remainder of the peninsula. But where rice is grown, it is grown to the exclusion of all other crops. In British Burmah, out of a total cultivated area of 2,833,520 acres in 1877-78, as many as 2,554,853 acres, or 90 per cent., were under rice. Independent Burmah, on the other hand, grows no rice, but imports largely from British territory. For Bengal, unfortunately, no general statistics are available. But taking Rangpur as a typical district, it was there found that 1∣ million acres, out of a classified total of a little over 1∣ million acres, or 88 per cent., were devoted to rice. Similar proportions hold good for the province of Orissa, the deltas of the Godâvari, Kistna, and Kâveri (Cauvery), and the lowlands of Travancore, Malabar, Kanara, and the Concan. For the North-Western Provinces and Oudh, again, no agricultural statistics are available; but though rice, grown in damp localities, or with the help of irrigation, forms a favourite food for the upper classes, the local supply requires to be supplemented by importation from Bengal. Throughout the remainder of the country, except in Assam, which is agriculturally a continuation of the Bengal delta, the cultivation of rice occupies but a subordinate place. The average out-turn per acre in Bengal has been estimated at 15 maunds, or 1200 lb, of cleaned rice. In the years 1877-78, when famine was raging in southern India, the total exports of rice from Calcutta amounted to more than 16 million cwts. In British Burmah there is but a single rice harvest in the year, corresponding to the drnaη of Bengal. The grain is reddish in colour and of a coarse quality; but the out-turn is much higher than in Bengal, reaching in some places an average of 2000 and 2500 lb per acre. The annual exports of rice from Burmah amount to about 12 million cwts. Besides being practically the sole crop grown in the deltaic swamps, rice is raised in patches in all the hill-valleys, from Coorg to the Himalayas.

Wheat is grown to some extent in almost every district; but, broadly speaking, it may be said that wheat does not thrive where rice does, nor, indeed, anywhere south of the Deccan. The great wheat-growing tract of India is the Punjab, where, in 1877-78, nearly 7 million acres, or 37 per cent, of the total cultivated area, were under this crop. For the North-Western Provinces and Oudh, in default of actual statistics, it has been estimated that the total area under wheat is as large as in the Punjab, though the relative proportion is less. Wheat is also grown in Behar and in the districts of Bengal that lie south of the Ganges. In the Central Provinces, in 1877-78, wheat was grown on 23 per cent, of the cultivated area, being the chief crop in the districts of Hoshangàbâd, Narsinhpur, and Siigar. In Bombay the corresponding proportion was less than 5 per cent., and in Sind 12 per cent. It has been conjectured that the total area under wheat in India is equal to the area under the same crop in the United States. Nor is the general out-turn contemptible, averaging about 13 bushels per acre in the Punjab, as compared with an average of 15⅜ bushels for the whole of France. The quality, also, of the grain is high enough to satisfy the demands of English millers; and “Calcutta Club No. 1” commands a price in Mark Lane not much below that of the [9:12:748] finest Australian or Californian produce. Unfortunately, when a prosperous trade with Europe seemed on the point of establishing itself, the terrible year 1877-78 supervened, and India will now have to fight against the position of vantage occupied by the United States. According to the system of classification in Upper India, wheat ranks as a rabi or spring crop, being reaped at the close of the cold weather in April and May. Wherever possible, it is irrigated; and the extension of canals through the Gangetic Doab has largely contributed to the substitution of wheat for inferior cereals.

Taking India as a whole, it may be affirmed that the staple food grain is neither rice nor wheat, but millet, which is probably the most prolific grain in the world, and the best adapted to the vicissitudes of a tropical climate. Excluding the special rice-growing tracts, varieties of millet are grown more extensively than any other crop from Madras, in the south, at least as far as Râjputâna, in the north. The two most common kinds are great millet (Holcus Sorghum or Sorghum vulgare), known as joar or jaινdri in the languages derived from the Sanskrit, as jοnna in Telugu, and as clιolam in Tamil; and spiked millet (Holcus spicatus vel Penicillaria spicata), called bajra in the north and kambu in the south. In Mysore and the neighbouring districts rdgi (Pleusine coracand), called ηdchani in Bombay, takes the first place. According to the Madras system of classification, these millets all rank as “dry crops,” being watered only by the local rainfall, and sown under either monsoon; farther north, they are classed with the kharif or autumn harvest, as opposed to wheat. Indian corn is cultivated to a limited extent in all parts of the country; barley, in the upper valley of the Ganges, throughout the Punjab, and in Himalayan valleys; oats, only as an experimental crop by Europeans. Joär and ragî, but not bajra, are invaluable as fodder for cattle.

Oil-seeds also form an important crop in all parts of the country, being perhaps more universally grown than any other, as oil is necessary, according to native customs, for application to the person, for food, and for burning in lamps. In recent years the cultivation of oil-seeds has received an extraordinary stimulus owing to the demand for export to Europe, especially to France; but as they can be grown after rice, &c., as a second crop, this increase has hardly at all tended to diminish the production of food grains. The four chief varieties grown are mustard or rape seed, linseed, til or gingelly (sesamum), and castor-oil. Bengal and the North-Western Provinces are at present the chief sources of supply for the foreign demand, but gingelly is largely exported from Madras, and, to a smaller extent, from Burmah.

Vegetables are everywhere cultivated in garden plots for household use, and also on a larger scale in the neighbourhood of great towns. Among favourite native vegetables, the following may be mentioned :—the egg-plant, called brinjal or baigan (Solanum Melong end), potatoes, cabbages, cauliflower, radishes, onions, garlic, turnips, yams, and a great variety of cucurbitaceous plants, including Cucumis sativus, Cucurbita maxima, Lagenaria vulgaris, Trichos-antlies di<jica, and Benincasa cerifera. Of these, potatoes, cabbages, and turnips are of recent introduction. Almost all English vegetables can be raised by a careful gardener. Potatoes thrive best on the higher elevations, such as the Khâsi hills, the Nilgiris, the Mysore uplands, and the slopes of the Himâlayas; but they are also grown even in lowland districts. They were first introduced into the Khâsi hills in 1830, and they now constitute the principal crop, the annual export to the Calcutta market being more than 7000 tons, valued at £50,000.

Among cultivated fruits are the following:—Mango (Hangifera indicd), plantain (A/usa ρaradisiacd), pine-apple (Ananassa sativa), pomegranate (Punica Granatum), guava (Psidium pomiferum et P. pgτiferum), tamarind (Tama· rindus indica), jack (Artocarpus integrifolid), custard-apple (Anoua squamosa), papaw (Carica Papaya), shaddock (Citrus decumana), and several varieties of fig, melon, orange, lime, and citron. According to the universal verdict of Europeans, no native fruits can compare with those of England. But the mangoes of Bombay, of Mùltân, and of Maldah in Bengal, and the oranges of the Khâsi hills, enjoy a high reputation; while the guavas of Madras are made into an excellent preserve.

Among spices, for the preparation of curry and other hot dishes, turmeric and chillies hold the first place, being very generally cultivated. Next in importance come ginger, coriander, aniseed, black cummin, and fenugreek. Pepper proper is confined to the Malabar coast, from Kanara to Travancore. Cardamoms are a valuable crop in the same locality, and also in the Nepâlese Himalayas. Pan or betel-leaf is grown by a special caste in most parts of the country. Its cultivation requires constant care, but is highly remunerative. Betel-nut or areca is chiefly grown in certain favoured localities, such as the deltaic districts of Bengal and the highlands of southern India.

Besides betel-nut (Areca Catechu), the palms of India include the cocoa-nut (Cocos ηuciferd), the bastard date (Phoenix sylvestris), the palmyra (Borassus flabelliformis), and the true date (Phoenix dactyliferd). The cocoa-nut, which loves a sandy soil and a moist climate, is found in greatest perfection along the strip of coast-line that fringes the west of the peninsula, where it ranks next to rice as the staple product. The bastard date, grown chiefly in the country round Calcutta and in the northeast of the Madras presidency, supplies both the jaggery sugar of commerce and intoxicating liquors for local consumption. Spirit is also distilled from the palmyra, especially in the neighbourhood of Bombay and in the southeast of Madras. The true date is almost confined to Sind.

Sugar is manufactured both from the sugar-cane and from the bastard date-palm, but the total production is inadequate to the local demand. The best cane is grown in the North-Western Provinces, on irrigated land. It is an expensive crop, requiring much attention, and not yielding a return within the year; but the profits are proportionately large. In Bengal the manufacture of sugar for exportation has declined during the century; but in Jessor district the preparation of date-sugar is a thriving and popular industry. The manufacture of sugar is everywhere in the hands of natives, except in the case of the Aska factory in the Madras district of Ganjâm, and the Ashtagram factory in Mysore. Both these factories, which use sugarcane and not date, have received honourable notice at exhibitions in Europe.

Cotton holds the first place among agricultural products grown for export. From the earliest times, cotton has been grown in sufficient quantities to meet the local demand, and even in the last century there was some slight export which was carefully fostered by the East India Company. But the present importance of the crop dates only from the crisis in Lancashire caused by the American War. Prior to 1860 the exports of raw cotton from India used to average less than 3 millions sterling a year; but after that date they rose by leaps, until in 1866 they reached the enormous total of 37 millions. Then came the crash, caused by the restoration of peace in the United States, and the exports fell, until they now average little more than 8 millions a year. The fact is that Indian cotton has a short staple, and cannot compete with the best American cotton for spinning the finer qualities of yarn. But while the cotton famine was at its height, the cultivators were intelligent enough to make the most of their [9:12:749] opportunity. The area under cotton increased enormously, and the growers managed to retain in their own hands a fair share of the profit.

The principal cotton -growing tracts are the plains of Guzerat and Kathiawar, whence Indian cotton has received in the Liverpool market the historic name of Surat; the highlands of the Deccan; and the deep valleys of the Central Provinces and Berar. The best native varieties are found in the Central Provinces and Berar, passing under the trade names of Hin ganghat and Amrâoti. These varieties have been successfully introduced into the Bombay district of Khândesh. Experiments with seed from New Orleans have been conducted for several years past on the Government farms in many parts of India; but it cannot be said that they have resulted in success except in the Bombay district of Dhârwâr, where exotic cotton has now generally supplanted the indigenous staple. In 1875-76 the total area under cotton in the Bombay presidency, including Sind and the native states, amounted to 4,516,587 acres, with a yield of 2,142,835 cwts. Of this total, 583,854 acres, or 13 per cent., were sown with exotic cotton, including that from the Central Provinces and also that from New Orleans, with a yield of 248,767 cwts. The average yield was about 53 lb of cleaned cotton per acre, the highest being in Sind and Guzerat, and the lowest in the southern Marhattâ country. In the same year the total exports were 3,887,808 cwts., valued at £10,673,761. In 1877-78 the area under cotton in the Central Provinces was 837,083 acres, or 5 per cent, of the total cultivated area, chiefly in the districts of Wardha, Nâgpur, and Raipur. The average yield was about 59 lb per acre. The total exports to Bombay, including re-exports from Berar, were about 300,000 cwts., chiefly in compressed bales, valued at £672,000. In the same year the area under cotton in Berar was 2,078,273 acres, or 32 per cent, of the total cultivated area, chiefly in the two districts of Akola and Amraoti. The average yield was as high as 67 lb of cleaned cotton per acre. The total export was valued at £2,354,946, almost entirely railway-borne. In Madras the average area under cotton is about 1,500,000 acres, chiefly in the upland districts of Bellary and Karnùl, and the low plains of Kistna and Tinnevelli. The total exports in 1875-76 were 733,420 cwts., valued at £1,652,849. In Bengal the cultivation of cotton is on the decline. The local demand is satisfied by imports from the North-Western Provinces and from the bordering hill tracts, where a very short-stapled variety of cotton is extensively cultivated. The total area under cotton in Bengal is estimated at only 162,000 acres, yielding 138,000 cwts. of cleaned cotton. Of this, 31,000 acres were in Sâran, 28,000 in the Chittagong hill tracts, and 20,000 in Cuttack. Throughout the North-Western Provinces, and also the Punjab, sufficient cotton is grown to meet the wants of the village weavers. The total exports of raw cotton from Indian ports in 1878-79 were 2,966,569 cwts., valued at £7,914,091,besides cotton twist and yarn to the value of £937,698, and cotton manufactures valued at £1,644,125.

Jute ranks next after cotton as a fibre crop. The extension of its cultivation has been equally rapid, and it is yet more limited in its area, being confined to northern and eastern Bengal. In this tract, which extends from Purniah to Goâlpârâ, north of the Ganges for the most part, and along both banks of the Brahmaputra, jute is grown on almost every variety of soil. The chief characteristic of the cultivation is that it remains entirely under the control of the cultivator. Practically a peasant proprietor, he increases or diminishes his cultivation according to the state of the market, and keeps the profits in his own hands. The demand for jute in Europe has contributed more than any administrative reform to raise the average standard of comfort throughout eastern Bengal. In 1872, when speculation was briskest, it is estimated that about 1 million acres were under jute, distributed over sixteen districts, which had a total cultivable area of 23 million acres. The total export from Calcutta in that year was about 7 million cwts., valued at £4,142,548. Both quantities and prices have since somewhat declined, but the business remains on a stable footing. In 1878-79 the total export of raw jute from India was 6,021,382 cwts., valued at £3,800,426, besides jute manufactures to the value of £1,098,434.

Indigo, though relatively of less importance than formerly, is still the foremost staple grown by European capital. In Bengal Proper its cultivation has greatly declined since the early years of this century. English planters have abandoned the districts of Hιigli (Hooghly),the Twenty-four Parganàs, Dacca, Faridpur, Rangpur, and Pabnâ, which are dotted with the sites of ruined factories. In Nadiyâ, Jessor, Murshidâbâd, and Maldah, the industry is still carried on, but it has not recovered from the depression caused by the indigo riots of 1860, and the emancipation of the peasantry by the Land Act of 1859. Dye of superior quality is manufactured in Midnapur, along the frontier of the hill tracts. But indigo cultivation on the old scale still flourishes in North Behar, from which is derived one-half of the total exports from Calcutta. No accurate statistics of area are available; but in Tirhut alone there are fifty-six principal concerns, with seventy outworks, producing annually about 20,000 maunds of dye; in Sâran, thirty principal concerns and twenty-five outworks, producing about 12,000 maunds ; in Champâran, seven large concerns, producing also 12,000 mauηds. ^[13. The factory rnαund of indigo weighs 74 lb 10 oz.] x It has been estimated that the total amount of money annually distributed by the planters of North Behar cannot be less than 1 million sterling. Across the border, in the North-Western Provinces, indigo is grown and manufactured to a considerable extent by native cultivators. In the Punjab, also, indigo is an important crop, especially in the districts of Mùltân, Muzaffargarh, and Derâ Ghazi Khân. In Madras, where it is grown and manufactured entirely by the natives, the total area under indigo is about 300,000 acres, chiefly in the north-east of the presidency, extending along the coast from Kistna to South Arcot, and inland to Karnùl and Cuddapah. The exports of indigo from all India in 1878-79 amounted to 105,051 cwts., of the value of £2,960,463.

The opium of commerce is grown and manufactured in two special tracts,—(1) the valley of the Ganges round Patnâ and Benares, and. (2) a fertile table-land in Central India, corresponding to the old kingdom of Mâlwâ, for the most part still under the rule of native chiefs, among whom Sindhia and Holkar rank first. In the latter of these two regions the cultivation of poppy is free, and the duty is levied as the opium passes through the British presidency of Bombay; in the former, the cultivation is a strict Government monopoly. Opium is also grown for local consumption throughout Râjputâna, and to a very limited extent in the Punjab and the Central Provinces. Throughout the rest of India it is absolutely prohibited. In the Ganges valley, the cultivation is supervised from two agencies, with their headquarters at Patnâ and Ghâzipur, at which two towns alone the manufacture is conducted. In 1872 the total area under poppy was 560,000 acres; the number of chests of opium sold was 42,675; and the sum realized was £6,067,701, giving a net revenue of £4,259,376. The whole of this was exported from Calcutta to China and the Straits Settlements. The amount of opium grown in native states and exported from Bombay is about equal, thus raising the average exports of opium to about 12 millions sterling, of which about 7⅜ millions represent net profit to Government. In 1878-79, 91,200 chests of opium were exported, of the value of £12,993,985, of which £7,700,000 represented the net profit to Government.

Under the Bengal system annual engagements are entered into by the cultivators to sow a certain quantity of land with poppy; and it is a fundamental principle that they may agree or refuse to engage as they please. As with most other Indian industries, a pecuniary advance is made to the cultivator before he commences operations, which is balanced when he delivers over the opium at the subordinate agencies. He is compelled to deliver his whole produce, being paid at a fixed rate according to quality. In the beginning of April the cultivators bring in their opium to the subordinate Government agencies, where it is examined and weighed, and the accounts are settled. The final process of preparing the drug in balls for the Chinese market is conducted at the two central Government agencies at Patna and Ghazipur. This generally lasts until the end of July, but the balls are not dry enough to be packed in chests until October.

Tobacco is grown in every district of India for local consumption. The soil and climate are favourable; but up to the present time the quality of native-cured tobacco is so inferior that it finds no market in Europe. The principal tobacco-growing tracts are Rangpur and Tirhut in Bengal, Kaira in Bombay, and the delta of the Godâvari and Coimbatore and Madura districts in Madras. The two last-mentioned districts supply the raw material for the well-known “Trichinopoli cheroot,” almost the only form of Indian tobacco that finds any favour with Europeans; the produce of the laιιkds or alluvial islands in the Godâvari is manufactured into “coconadas.” The tobacco of northern Bengal is largely exported to British Burmah, for the Burmese, who are great smokers, do not grow sufficient for their own needs. In the year 1876-77 the total registered imports of tobacco into Calcutta were 400,000 cwt., valued at £261,000, of which more than half came from the single district of Rangpur. Tobacco is also grown for export in the hill tracts of Chittagong. The tobacco of Tirhut is chiefly exported towards the west. The total area under tobacco in that district is estimated at 40,000 acres, the best quality being grown in pargand Saressa of the Tâjpur subdivision.

Since 1875 a private firm of capitalists, backed by Government support, has begun to grow tobacco and manufacture it for the European market. The scene of operations is two abandoned studfarms at Gh⅛zipur in the North-Western Provinces, and at Pusa in the Bengal district of Tirhut. In the year 1878-79 about 240 acres in all were cultivated with tobacco, and the total crop was about 160,000 lb. No less than five English or American curers were employed. Some of the produce was exported to England as ‘ ‘ cured leaf”; but the larger part was put upon the Indian market in the form of “manufactured smoking mixture.” This mixture is in demand at regimental messes and canteens, and has already found its way to Australia. The enterprise may now be said to have passed beyond the stage of experiment, and has probably opened a new sphere alike for Indian agriculture and European capital. The one essential condition of success is skilled supervision in the delicate processes of tobacco-curing. Tobacco to the value of £128,239 was exported from India in 1878—79.

The cultivation of coffee is confined to southern India, though attempts have been made to introduce the plant both into British Burmah and into the Bengal district of Chittagong. The coffee tract may be roughly defined as a section of the landward slope of the Western Ghâts, extending from Kânara in the north to Travancore in the extreme south. That tract includes almost the whole of Coorg, the districts of Kâdur and Hassan in Mysore, and the Nilgiri hills, enlarged by the recent annexation of the Wainâd. Within the last few years the cultivation has extended to the Shevaroy hills in Salem district, and to the Palni hills in Madura.

Unlike tea, coffee was not introduced into India by European enterprise; and even to the present day its cultivation is largely followed by the natives. The Malabar coast has always enjoyed a direct commerce with Arabia, and at an early date gave many converts to Islam. One of these converts, Baba Budan by name, is said to have gone on a pilgrimage to Mecca and to have brought back with him the coffee berry, which he planted on the hill range in Mysore still called after him. According to local tradition this happened about two centuries ago. The shrubs thus sown lived on, but the cultivation did not spread until the beginning of the present century. The state of Mysore and the Baba Budan range also witnessed the first opening of a coffee-garden by an English planter about 1840. The success of this experiment led to the extension of coffee cultivation into the neighbouring tract of Manjarâ-bad, also in Mysore, and into the Wainad subdivision of the Madras district of Malabar. From 1840 to 1860 the enterprise made slow progress; but since the latter date it has spread with great rapidity along the whole line of the Western Ghats, clearing away the primaeval forest, and opening a new era of prosperity to the labouring classes. The following statistics show the area under coffee for the year 1877-78 :—in Mysore, 128,438 acres, almost confined to the two districts of Hassan and Kâdur; in Madras, 58,988 acres, chiefly in Malabar, the Nilgiris, and Salem; in Coorg, 45,150 acres; total, 232,576 acres, exclusive of Travancore. The average rate of produce is estimated at about 3 cwts. per acre of mature plant. The total export of coffee in 1878-79 was 342,268 cwts . valued at £1,548,481.

The cultivation of tea in India commenced within the memory of men still living in 1881, and the industry now rivals indigo as a field for European capital. Unlike coffeeplanting the enterprise owes its origin to the initiation of Government, and has never attracted the attention of the natives. Early travellers reported that the tea-plant was indigenous to the southern valleys of the Himalayas; but they were mistaken in the identity of the shrub, which was the O syris ηepalensis. The real tea(7‰α viridis), a plant akin to the camellia, grows wild in Assam, being commonly found throughout the hilly tract between the valleys of the Brahmaputra and the Bârak. There it sometimes attains the dimensions of a large tree; and from that, as well as from other indications, it has been plausibly inferred that Assam is the original home of the plant, which was thence introduced at a prehistoric date into China. The real progress of tea-planting in Assam dates from about 1851, and was greatly assisted by the promulgation of the Waste-land Rules of 1854. By 1859 there were already fifty-one gardens in existence, owned by private individuals; and the enterprise had extended from its original headquarters in Lakhimpur and Sibsâgar as far down the Brahmaputra as Kâmrùp. In 1856 the tea-plant was discovered wild in the district of Câchâr in the Bârak valley, and European capital was at once directed to that quarter. At about the same time tea-planting was introduced into the neighbourhood of the sanatorium of Dârjiling (Darjeeling), among the Sikkim Himalayas. The success of these undertakings engendered a wild spirit of speculation in tea companies both in India and at home, which reached its climax in 1865. The industry recovered but slowly from the effects of this disastrous crisis, and did not again reach a stable position until 1869. Since that date it has rapidly but steadily progressed, and has been ever opening new fields of enterprise. At the head of the Bay of Bengal in Chittagong district, side by side with coffee on the Nilgiri hills, on the forest-clad slopes of Chutiâ Nâgpur, amid the low-lying jungle of the Bhutàn Dwars, and even in Arakan, the energetic pioneers of tea-planting have established their industry. Different degrees of success may have rewarded them, but in no case have they abandoned the struggle. The market for Indian tea is practically inexhaustible. There is no reason to suppose that all the suitable localities for its growth have yet been tried; and we may look forward to the day when India shall not only rival but supersede China in her staple product.

The following statistics, unless it is otherwise stated, refer to the year 1877-78 :—

The total area taken up for tea cultivation in Assam, including both the Brahmaputra and the Barak valleys, was 736,082 acres, of which 538,961 acres were fit for cultivation; the total number of separate estates was 1718; the total out-tura was 23,352,298 lb, at the average rate of 286 lb per acre under mature plant. In Bengal, the area taken up was 62,642 acres, of which 20,462 acres were under mature plant, including 18,120 acres in the single district of Darjiling; the number of gardens was 221; the out-turn was 5,768,654 lb, at the rate of 282 lb per acre under mature plant. In the North-Western Provinces, there were, in 1876, 25 estates in the districts of Kumâun and Garhwal, with an out-turn of 578,000 lb, of which 350,000 lb were sold in India to Central Asia merchants; and in 1871, 19 estates in Dehra Dùn, with 2024 acres under tea, and an out-turn of 297,828 lb. In the Punjab, there were 10,046 acres under tea, almost entirely confined to Kangrâ district, with an out-turn of 1,113,106 lb, or 111 lb per acre. In Madras, the area under tea on the Nilgiris was 3160 acres; the exports from the presidency were 183,178 lb, valued at £19,308. Excluding the figures just given for Madras, the whole of the Indian tea is shipped from the port of Calcutta, and almost the whole is sent to the United Kingdom. The total exports for 1878-79 were 34,800,027 lb, valued at £3,170,118. Of the total supply, about 26,000,000 lb came from Assam, about 8,000,000 lb from Bengal, 787,000 lb from the North-Western Provinces, and 684,000 lb from the Punjab. In the previous year the exports of tea from the Punjab to Central Asia were returned at 1,217,840 lb, valued at £181,634, beinga considerable decrease on the year before.

The introduction of the quinine-yielding cinchona into India is a remarkable example of success rewarding the indefatigable exertions of a single man. When Mr Clements Markham undertook the task of transporting the seedlings from South America in 1860, cinchona had never before been reared artificially. But the novel experiment in arboriculture has not only been successfully conducted, but has proved remunerative from a pecuniary point of view. A cheap febrifuge has been provided, in the form of the mixed cinchona alkaloids, for the fever-stricken population of the Indian plains, while the surplus bark sold in Europe more than repays interest upon the capital expended. These results have been produced from an expenditure of about <£100,000. The headquarters of cinchona cultivation are on the Nilgiri hills, where Government owns several plantations covering an aggregate of about 1000 acres, with about 570,000 full-grown plants. From the Government plantations cinchona seeds and plants are annually distributed to the public in large quantities; and there are now several private plantations rivalling the Government estates in area, and understood to be very valuable properties. The varieties of cinchona most commonly cultivated are C. officinalis and C. succirubra ; but experiments are being conducted with C. Calisaya, C. pubescens, C. lαnceolata, and C. ρitayensis. When the success of the enterprise was secure, Government somewhat curtailed the extent of its own operations. No fresh land was taken up, but the plantations were kept free from weeds. The quinologist’s department was abolished, and the bark sold in its raw state. From the central establishment on the Nilgiris cinchona has been introduced into the Palni hills in Madura district, into the Wainâd, and into the state of Travancore. Plantations have also been successfully opened by Government near Merkara in Coorg, on the Bâba Budan hills in Mysore, and in Sitang district in British Burmah. Failure has attended the experiments made at Mahâbaleshwar in the Bombay presidency, and at Nongklao in the Khâsi hills, Assam. But the success of the Government plantation at Dâijiling, in northern Bengal, rivals that of the original plantation on the Nilgiris. The area has been gradually extended to more than 2000 acres, and the bark is manufactured into quinine on the spot by a Government quinologist. The species mostly grown is C. succirubra, which supplies a red-coloured bark, rich in its total yield of alkaloids but comparatively poor in quinine proper. Efforts are being made to increase the cultivation of C. Calisaya, which yields the more valuable bark, but is difficult to propagate.

The following are the financial results of the two Government plantations in 1877-78. On the Nilgiris the crop was 138,808 ft, of which 132,951 ft were shipped to England, and the rest supplied to the Madras and Bombay medical departments. The total receipts were £35,875, and the total expenditure £6977, thus showing a net profit of £28,898. At Darjiling the crop amounted to 344,225 ft of Dark, which was all handed over to the quinologist, and yielded 5162 ft of the febrifuge. The total receipts were £9707, of which £6188 represents the amount debited to Government departments for the sale of febrifuge and bark, while £3519 was derived from sales to the public. The total expenditure was £8554, of which £5790 was expended upon the plantation, and £2764 on the quinologist’s department. The net profit, therefore, was £1153, which is expected shortly to rise to £4000 a year, as more of the young plants come into bearing.

Silk.— Sericulture in India is a stationary, if not a declining, industry. The large production in China, Japan, and the Mediterranean countries controls the European markets, and on an average of years the imports of raw silk into India now exceed the exports. The East India Company from the first took great pains to foster the production of silk. As early as 1767, two years after the grant of the financial administration of Bengal had been conferred upon the Company, we find the governor, Mr Vereist, personally urging the zaminddrs, gathered at Murshidâbâd for the ceremony of the puηyd, “to give all possible encouragement to the cultivation of mulberry.” In 1769 a colony of reelers was brought from Italy to teach the system followed in the filatures at Novi. The first silk prepared in the Italian method reached England in 1772, and Bengal silk soon became an important article of export. Similar efforts started at Madras in 1793 were abandoned after a trial of five years. Sericulture is said to have been introduced into Mysore by Tipù Sultân, and for many years continued to prosper. But recently the worms have been afflicted by a mysterious epidemic; and despite the enterprise of an Italian gentleman who imported fresh broods from Japan, the business has dwindled to insignificance. Bengal has always been the chief seat of mulberry cultivation. When the trading operations of the Company ceased in 1833, they owned eleven head factories in that province, each supplied by numerous filatures to which the cultivators brought in their cocoons. The annual export of raw silk from Calcutta was then about 1 million lb. But in those days the weaving of silk formed a large portion of the business of the factories. In 1779 Rennel wrote that at Kasimbâzâr (Cossimbazar) alone about 400,000 δ> were consumed in the several European factories. In 1802 Lord Valentia describes Jangipur as “the greatest silk station of the Company, with 600 furnaces, and giving employment to 3000 persons.”

When the Company abandoned trade on its own account, sericulture was forthwith taken up by private enterprise, and it still clings to its old headquarters. At the present time the cultivation of the mulberry is mainly confined to the Râjshâhi and Bardwân divisions of Lower Bengal. That branch of agriculture, together with the rearing of the silk-worms, is conducted by the peasantry themselves, who are free to follow or abandon the business. The destination of the cocoons is twofold. They may either be sent to small native filatures, where the silk is roughly wound before being consumed in the hand-looms of the country; or they may be brought to the great European factories, which generally use steam machinery and consign their produce direct to Europe.

The cultivation of the mulberry is chiefly carried on in the districts of Râjshâhi, Bogrâ, Maldah, Murshidâbâd, Birbhùm, Bardwân, and Midnapur. No accurate statistics are available, but in Râjshâhi alone the area under mulberry is estimated at 80,000 acres. The variety [9:12:752] grown as food for the silk-worms is not the fruit-tree that is common in England, but a comparatively small shrub.

Besides the silk-worm proper (Bombyx mori), fed upon the mulberry, several other species of silk-yielding worms abound in the jungles of India, and are utilized, and in some cases domesticated, by the natives. Throughout Assam especially, an inferior silk, produced in this λvay, has from time immemorial furnished the common dress of the people. These “wild silks” are known to commerce under the generic name of tasar or tusser, but they are really the produce of several distinct varieties of worm, fed on many different trees. The worm that yields tasar silk in Chutia Nagpur has been identified as the caterpillar of Antheroea paphia. When wild, it feeds indiscriminately upon the sdl (Shorea robusta), baer (Zizyphus Jujuba) , and other forest trees; but in a state of semi-domestication it is exclusively reared upon the dsan (Terminalia alata), which grows conveniently in clumps. The cocoons are sometimes collected in the jungle, but more frequently bred from an earlier generation of jungle cocoons. The worms require constant attention while feeding to protect them from crows and other birds. They give three crops in the year—in August, November, and May—of which the second is by far the most important. The tasar silk-worm is also found and utilized throughout the Central Provinces, in the hills of the Bombay presidency, and along the southern slope of the Himalayas. During the past twenty years repeated attempts have been made to raise this industry out of its precarious condition, and to introduce tasar silk into the European market. That the raw material abounds is certain, but the great difficulty is to obtain it in a state that will be acceptable to European manufacturers. Native spun silk is only fit for native hand-looms. In Assam two distinct qualities of silk are made, known as erid and mugd. The former is obtained from the cocoons of Phaloena cynthia, and the worm is fed, as the native name implies, upon the leaves of the castor-oil plant (Ricinus communis). This variety may be said to be entirely domesticated, being reared indoors. Mugd silk is obtained from the cocoons of Saturnia assamungis. The moth, which is remarkable for its size, is found wild in the jungle, but the breed is so far domesticated that cocoons are brought from one part of the province to another, and the sum tree is artificially propagated to supply the worms with food. Raw silk was exported in 1878—79 to the extent of 1,534,715 lb, valued at £623,871, besides manufactured silk of the value of £195,897.

The collection of lac is in a somewhat similar position to that of tasar silk. The lac insect abounds on certain jungle trees in every part of the country, and from time immemorial it has been collected by the wild tribes in order to be worked up into lacquered ware. European enterprise has tried, with small success, to place the industry upon a stable and remunerative basis. Though lac is to be found everywhere, the foreign exports are almost entirely confined to Calcutta, which draws its supplies from the hills of Chutiâ Nâgpur, and to a less degree from Assam and Mirzâpur in the North-Western Provinces. Lac is known to commerce both as a gum (shellac) and as a dye. The total exports in 1879 were 91,983 cwts., valued at £300,072.

Farming.— The efforts of Government to improve the native methods of agriculture, by the establishment of model farms under skilled European supervision, have not been generally successful.^[14. Model farms have been abandoned in Bengal, in Assam, and in the Punjab. In the North-Western Provinces valuable experiments are prosecuted. In Bombay there are three model farms, and in the Central Provinces one, on which the common crops of the country are raised at a loss. The Saidapet farm, near the city of Madras, is the only establishment at which important experiments have been conducted on a scale and with a perseverance sufficient to yield results of value Tins farm was started by the governor, Sir William Denison, in 1865, and has been for the past nine years under the management of Mr Robertson. It now (1881) covers an area of 250 acres in a ring fence. Many important experiments have been made, of which some have produced encouraging results, indicating the general direction in which improvements may be effected in the agricultural practice of the presidency. It has been proved that many of the common “dry crops” can be profitably cultivated for fodder at all seasons of the year. Those most strongly recommended are yellow cholam (Sorghum vulgäre), guinea grass (Panicum jumentaceum), and horse-gram (Dolichus uni/lorus). Sugar-cane and rice also yield excellent fodder when cut green. Attention has also been given to subsoil drainage, deep ploughing, the fertilizing powers of various manures, and the proper utilization of irrigation water. It has been decided to establish a school of agriculture at Saidapet in connexion with the model farm, with subordinate branches in the districts, so as to diffuse as widely as possible the agricultural lessons that have been already learned. In the year 1877-78 the total expenditure at Saidapet on both farm and school of agriculture was about £6000.] Stock.— Throughout the whole of India, except in Sind and the western districts of the Punjab, horned cattle are the only beasts used for ploughing. The well-known humped breed of cattle predominates everywhere, being divided into many varieties. Owing partly to unfavourable conditions of climate and soil, partly to the insufficiency of grazing ground, and partly to the want of selection in breeding, the general condition of the cattle is miserably poor. As cultivation advances, the area of waste land available for grazing steadily diminishes, and the prospects of the poor beasts are becoming worse rather than better. Their only hope lies in the introduction of fodder crops as a regular stage in the agricultural course. There are, however, some fine breeds in existence. In Mysore the amrit mahdl, a breed said to have been introduced by Hyder All for military purposes, is still kept up by Government. In the Madras districts of Nellore and Karnùl the indigenous breed has been greatly improved under the stimulus of cattle shows and prizes, founded by British officials. In the Central Provinces there is a peculiar breed of trotting bullocks which is in great demand for wheeled carriages. The large and handsome oxen of Guzerat in Bombay and of Hariânâ in the Punjab are excellently adapted for drawing heavy loads in a sandy soil. The worst cattle are to be found always in the deltaic tracts, but there their place is to a large extent taken by buffaloes. These last are: more hardy than ordinary cattle; their, character is maintained by crossing the cows with wild bulls, and their milk yields the best ghi, or clarified butter. In British-Burmah, the returns show that the total number of buffaloes is just equal to that of cows and bullocks, being about 700,000. Along the valley of the Indus, and in the sandy desert which stretches into Râjputâna, camels supersede cattle for agricultural operations. In the Punjab, the total estimated number of camels is 170,000. The breed of: horses has generally deteriorated since the demand for military purposes has declined with the establishment of British supremacy. In Bengal Proper, and also in Madras, it may be broadly said that horses are not bred. The chief breeds in Bombay are those of the Deccan and of Kâthiâwâr, in both of which provinces Government maintains establishments of stallions. The Punjab, however, is the chief source of remounts for the cavalry regiments, the total number of horses in that province being returned at 80,000, in addition to 50,000 ponies. About the beginning of the present century, a stud department was organized to breed horses for the use of the Bengal army, but this system was abolished as extravagant and inefficient under the governor-generalship of Lord Mayo. Remounts are now obtained in the open market; but the Government of the Punjab still maintains about 130 stallions, including 60 imported from England and 40 Arabs. The best horses are bred by the Baluchi tribes along the western frontier. The best ponies come from Burmah, Manipur (the original home of the now well-known game of polo), and Bhutân. Four great horse fairs are held in the year—at Râwal Pindi, Derâ Ghâzi Khân, Jhang, and Derâ Ismâil Khân—at which about 4500 horses were exhibited in 1877-78, and a total sum of about £1300 was awarded in prizes; the average price given for native cavalry remounts was only £17. In recent years much attention has been paid in the Punjab to the breeding of mules for military purposes; and the value of these animals was conspicuously proved in the course of [9:12:753] the operations in Afghanistan in 1879-80. Government maintains about fifty donkey stallions, of which four were imported from Spain, twenty-eight from Arabia, and twelve from Bokhara. Some of the mules bred reach the height of 15 hands. The catching of elephants is now a Government monopoly or under Government supervision, except in Malabar and Travancore where the old proprietors retain the right. The chief source of supply is the north-east frontier, especially the range of hills running between the valleys of the Brahmaputra and the Bârak (see ante, p. 742). Sheep and goats are commonly reared in the wilder parts of the country for the sake of their wool. Both their weight for the butcher and their yield of wool are exceedingly low. In Mysore, and with considerable success at the Saidapet farm, attempts have been made to improve the breed of sheep by crossing with merino rams. Pigs of great size and most repulsive appearance are reared, and eaten by the lowest of out-castes.

The forests of India, both as a source of natural wealth and as a department of the administration, are beginning to receive their proper share of attention. Up to a recent date the destruction of forests by timber cutters, by charcoal burners, and above all by nomadic cultivation, was allowed to go on everywhere unchecked. The extension of cultivation was considered as the chief care of Government, and no regard was paid to the improvident waste going on on all sides. But as the pressure of population on the soil became more dense, and the construction of railways increased the demand for fuel, the question of forest conservation forced itself into notice. It was recognized that the inheritance of future generations was being recklessly sacrificed to satisfy the immoderate desire for profit. And at the same time the importance of forests as affecting the general meteorology of a country was being learned from bitter experience in Europe. On many grounds, therefore, it became necessary to preserve what remained of the forests in India, and to repair the mischief of previous neglect even at considerable expense. In 1844 and 1847 the subject was actively taken up by the Governments of Bombay and Madras. In 1864 Dr Brandis was appointed inspector-general of forests to the Government of India, and in the following year an act of the legislature was passed (No. VII. of 1865). The regular training of candidates for the Forest Department in the schools of France and Germany dates from 1867. In the short interval that has since elapsed, sound principles of forest administration have been gradually extended. Indiscriminate timber-cutting has been prohibited, the burning of the jungle by the hill tribes has been confined within bounds, large areas have been surveyed and demarcated, plantations have been laid out, and, generally, forest conservation has become a reality.

From the point of view of adjninistration, the forests are classified as “reserved” or “open.” The reserved forests are those under the immediate control of officers of the Forest Department; they are managed as the property of the state, with a single eye to conservancy and their future development as a source of national wealth. Their limits are demarcated after survey, nomadic cultivation by the hill tribes is prohibited, cattle are excluded from grazing, destructive creepers are cut down, and the hewing of timber, if permitted at all, is placed under stringent regulations. The open forests are less carefully guarded; but in them also certain kinds of timber-trees are preserved. A third class of forest lands consists of plantations, on which large sums of money are spent annually. It is impossible to present in a single view the entire result of the labours of the Forest Department. In 1872-73 the total area of reserved forests in India was estimated at more than 6,000,000 acres; and the area has probably been doubled since that date. In the same year the total forest revenue was £477,000, as compared with an expenditure of £295,000, thus showing a surplus of £182,000. By 1877-78 the revenue had increased to £664,102, of which £160,308 was derived from British Burmah, and £126,163 from Bombay. The forest exports in that year included—teak, valued at £406,652; lac and lac-dye, £362,008; caoutchouc, £89,381; and gums, £183,685. But no figures that can be given exhibit adequately the labour and the benefits of the Forest Department, which is gradually winning back for the country the fee-simple of her forest wealth, when it was on the point of being squandered beyond possibility of redemption.

The practice of nomadic cultivation by the hill tribes may conveniently be described in connexion with forest conservation, of which it is the most formidable enemy. In all the great virgin forests of India, in Arakan, on the north-east frontier of Assam and Chittagong, throughout the Central Provinces, and along the line of the Western Ghâts, the aboriginal tribes raise their crops of rice, cotton, <fcc., in this manner. A similar system has been found to prevail in Madagascar; and indeed, from its simplicity and its appropriateness it may fairly be called the most primitive mode of agriculture known to the human race. Known as toungya in Burmah, fam on the north-east frontier, dαhya in Central India, kil in the Himâlayas, and kumdri in the Western Ghâts, it is practised, without any material differences, by tribes of the most diverse origin. Its essential features are the burning down of a patch of forest, and sowing the crop with little or no tillage on the clearing thus formed. The tribes of the western coast break up the cleared soil with a sort of hoe-pick and spade or even with the plough; in other parts the soil is merely scratched with a knife, or the seed is scattered on its surface without any cultivation at all. In some cases a crop, is taken off the same clearing for two or even three years in succession, but more usually the tribe moves off every year to a fresh field of operations. To these nomad cultivators the words rhetorically used by Tacitus of the primitive Germans are strictly applicable— Arνa per annos mutant; et superest ager. The wanton destruction thus wrought in the forests is simply incalculable. In addition to the timber-trees deliberately burned down to clear the soil, the fire thus started not unfrequently runs wild through the forest, and devastates many square miles. Wherever timber has any value from the proximity of a market, the first care of the Forest Department is to prohibit[9:12:754] these fires, and to assign heavy penalties for any infringement of its rules. The success of a year’s operations is mainly estimated by the degree in which the reserves have been saved from the flame.

But vast tracts of country yet remain in which it would be equally useless and impossible to place restraint upon nomad cultivation, which is admitted to yield a larger profit than ordinary cultivation with the plough. A virgin soil, manured many inches deep with ashes and watered by the full burst of a tropical rainfall, returns forty and fifty-fold of rice, which is the staple grain thus raised. In addition to rice, Indian corn, millet, oil-seeds, and cotton are sometimes grown in the same clearing, the seeds being all thrown into the ground together, and each crop ripening in succession at its own season. Except to the eyes of a forest officer, a patch of jum cultivation is a very picturesque sight Men, women, and children all work together with a will, for the trees must be felled and burned, and the seed sown, before the monsoon breaks.

Irrigation is everywhere dependent upon the two supreme considerations of water supply and land level. The sandy desert that extends from the hills of Ràjputâna to the basin of the Indus is more absolutely closed to irrigation than the confused system of hill and valley in Central India. Farther west, in the Indus valley, irrigation becomes possible, and in no part of India has it been conducted with greater perseverance and success. The entire province of Sind, and hardly less the lower districts of the Punjab, are absolutely dependent upon the floods of the Indus. Sind has been compared to Egypt, and the Indus to the Nile; but, in truth, the case of the Indian province is the less favourable of the two. In Sind the average rainfall is barely 10 inches in the year, the soil is a thirsty sand, and, above all, the river does not run in confined banks, but wanders at its will over a wide valley. The rising of the Nile is a beneficent phenomenon, whose effects can be calculated with tolerable precision, and which the industry of countless generations has brought under control for the purposes of cultivation. In Sind the inundation is an uncontrolled torrent, which oftentimes does as much harm as good. Broadly speaking, no crop can be grown in Sind except under irrigation, and therefore the total cultivated area of about 3 million acres may be regarded as entirely dependent upon artificial water-supply. The supply is derived from the river by two main classes of canals —(1) inundation channels, which only fill when the Indus is in flood, and (2) perennial channels, which carry off water by means of dams at all seasons of the year. The former are for the most part the work of ancient rulers of the country, or of the cultivators themselves; the latter have been constructed since the British conquest. In both cases care has been taken to utilize abandoned channels of the river. It is impossible to present a complete view of the results of irrigation, for in some provinces, as in Sind, it is treated as a department of land administration, while in others it is almost entirely conducted by private enterprise.

In 1876-77 about 900,000 acres in Sind were returned as irrigated from works for which, capital and revenue accounts are kept, the chief being the Ghâr, Eastern and Western Nara, Sakhar (Sukkur), Phuleli, and Pinyari; the total receipts were about £190,000, almost entirely credited under the head of land revenue. In the same year about 445,000 acres were irrigated from works of which revenue accounts only are kept, yielding about £75,000 in land revenue. Throughout the remainder of the Bombay presidency irrigation is conducted on a comparatively small scale, and mainly by private enterprise. In the Concan, along the coast, the heavy local rainfall and the annual flooding of the numerous small creeks permit rice to be grown without artificial aid. In Guzerat the supply is drawn from wells, and in the Deccan from tanks; but both these are liable to fail in years of deficient rainfall. Government has now undertaken a few comprehensive schemes of irrigation, which mostly conform to a common type—damming up the end of a hill valley so as to form an immense reservoir, and then conducting the water over the fields by channels, which are in some cases of considerable length. In 1876—77 the total area in Bombay (excluding Sind) irrigated from Government works was about 180,000 acres, yielding a revenue of about £42,000. In the same year the total expenditure on irrigation (inclusive of Sind) was £235,000,—£65,000 under the head of extraordinary and £170,000 of ordinary outlay.

In some parts of the Punjab irrigation is only one degree less necessary than in Sind, but the sources of supply are more numerous. In the northern tract, under the Himalayas, and in the upper valleys of the rivers, water can be obtained by digging wells from 10 to 30 feet below the surface. In the south, towards Sind, inundation channels are usual; while the upland tracts that rise between the basins of the main rivers are now in course of being supplied by the perennial canals of the Government. According to the returns for 1877-78, out of a grand total of 22,640,894 acres under cultivation, 5,000,481 were irrigated by private individuals and 1,618,854 by public channels, giving a total under irrigation of 6,619,335 acres, or 29 per cent of the cultivated area. The principal Government works are the Western Jumna canal, the Bari Doâb canal, and the Sirhind, the last of which, with the largest expenditure of all, is still incomplete. Up to the close of 1877-78 the total outlay had been £3,645,189; the total income in that year was £263,053, of which £171,504 was classified as direct and £91,549 as indirect; the total revenue charges on works in operation were £224,316, of which £146,419 was for maintenance and £77,897 for interest, thus showing a surplus of £38,737. On the Western Jumna canal alone the net profit was £83,112.

The North-Western Provinces present in the great doâb, or high land between the Ganges and the Jumna, a continuation of the physical features to be found in the Upper Punjab. The local rainfall, indeed, is higher, but before the days of artificial irrigation occasional deficiency repeatedly resulted in terrible famines. It is in this tract that the British Government has been perhaps most successful in averting the calamity of drought. In Sind irrigation is an absolute necessity; in Lower Bengal it may be regarded almost as a luxury; but in the great river basins of Upper India it serves the twofold object of saving the population from the vicissitudes of the season and of introducing more valuable crops and a higher stage of agriculture. Concerning private irrigation from wells in the North-Western Provinces no information is available. The great Government works are the Ganges canal, the Eastern Jumna canal, the Agra canals, and the Lower Ganges canal, the last of which is not yet complete. Up to the close of 1877-78 the total outlay had been £5,673,401. The gross income in that year was £438,136, of which £337,842 was derived from water rates and £100,294 from enhanced land revenue; the working expenses amounted to £143,984, leaving £294,152 for surplus profits, or 6.77 per cent, on the total capital expended on works in operation. The total area irrigated was 1,461,428 acres, of which more than two-thirds were supplied by the Ganges canal. Of the total area, 415,659 acres were under wheat and 139,374 under sugar-cane.

Into Oudh no irrigation works have yet been introduced by Government. A tolerable local rainfall, the annual overflow of the rivers, and an abundance of low-lying swamps combine to furnish a water supply that is ample in all ordinary years. According to the settlement returns, out of a total cultivated area of 8,276,174 acres, 2,957,397 acres, or nearly 36 per cent., are irrigated by private individuals; but this figure must include low lands watered by natural overflow.

Throughout the greater part of Bengal there is no demand for artificial irrigation, but the solicitude of Government has undertaken to construct works in those exceptional tracts where experience has shown that occasional drought is to be feared. In the lower valleys of the Ganges and the Brahmaputra, and along the deltaic seaboard, flood is a more formidable enemy than drought, and embankments there take the place of canals. The Public Works Department has altogether about 2800 miles of embankments under its charge, upon which £79,105 was expended in 1877-78, either as direct outlay or in advances to landowners. The broad strip of northern Bengal and Behar, stretching between the Himalayas and the Ganges, is also rarely visited by drought; though, when drought does come, the excessive density of the population brings the danger of famine very near. In Saran alone it has been found necessary to carry out a comparatively small scheme for utilizing the discharge of the river Gandak. The great irrigation works in Bengal are two in number, and belong to two different types. (1.) In the delta of Orissa an extensive system of canals has been constructed on the pattern of those lower down on the Coromandel coast, which are intended to avert the danger of both drought and flood, and alsβ to be useful for navigation. In average seasons, i.e., in five yean out of six, the local rainfall is sufficient for the rice crop, which is there the sole staple of cultivation; and therefore it is not to be expected that these canals will be directly remunerative. But on the other hand, if they save the province from a repetition of the disastrous year 1865-66, the money will not have been expended in vain. (2. ) In South Behar the flood discharge of the Son has been intercepted, after the system of engineering followed in the North-West, so as to irrigate a comparatively thirsty strip of land extending along the south bank of the Ganges, where distress has ere now been severely felt. In this case also, the expenditure [9:12:755] must be regarded rather as an insurance fund against famine than as reproductive outlay. The works are not yet complete, but the experience already gained proves that irrigation is wanted even in ordinary seasons. Up to the close of 1877-78 the total expenditure on capital account for all the irrigation works in Bengal was £4,653,903; the gross income for the year was £49,477; the working expenses were £70,286; and the estimated interest on capital, at 4⅛ per cent., amounted to £203,971, thus showing a net deficit of £224,780. The area irrigated was about 400,000 acres.

In the Madras presidency, and generally throughout southern India, facilities for irrigation assume a decisive importance in determining the character of agriculture. Crops dependent on the rainfall are distinguished as “dry crops,” comprehending the large class of millets. Rice can only be grown on “wet land,” which means land capable of being irrigated. Except on the Malabar or western coast, the local rainfall is nowhere sufficiently ample or sufficiently steady to secure an adequate water supply. Everywhere else water has to be brought to the fields from rivers, from tanks, or from wells. Out of the total cultivated area of Madras, only 15 per cent, is classified as “wet land ;” the rest is at the mercy of the monsoons. From time immemorial an industrious population has made use of all the means available to store up the rainfall and direct the river floods over their fields. The upland areas are studded with tanks, which sometimes cover square miles of ground; the rivers are crossed by innumerable anicuts, or dams by which the floods are diverted into long aqueducts. Most of these works are now the property of Government, which annually expends large sums of money in maintenance and repairs, looking for remuneration only to the augmented land revenue. The average rate of assessment is 9s. 6d. per acre on irrigated land, as compared with only2s. 3d. per acre on unirrigated land. It is, therefore, not only the duty but the manifest advantage of Government to extend the facilities for irrigation wherever the physical aspect of the country will permit. The deltas of the Godavari, the Kistna, and the Kâveri (Cauvery) have within recent years been traversed by a network of canals and thus guaranteed against any risk of famine. Smaller works of a similar nature have been carried out in other places; while a private company, with a Government guarantee, has undertaken the more difficult task of utilizing on a grand scale the waters of the Tungabhadra amid the hills and vales of the interior. According to the latest statistics, the total irrigated area of the presidency is about 5 million acres, yielding a land revenue of about 2 millions sterling. Of this total, 1,680,178 acres, with a revenue of £739,778, are iιτigated by eight great systems, for which revenue and capital accounts are kept. The minor works consist of about 35,000 tanks and irrigation canals, and about 1140 anicuts or dams across streams.

_ In Mysore, tanks, anicuts, and wells dug in the dry beds of rivers afford the means of irrigation, but wet cultivation is there even rarer than in Madras. After the disastrous famine of 1876-78 some comprehensive schemes of throwing embankments across river valleys were undertaken by Government. In the Central Provinces irrigation still remains a matter of private enterprise. According to the settlement returns, out of a total cultivated area of 13,610,503 acres, 804,370 acres, or 6 per cent., are irrigated by private individuals. The only Government work is a tank in the district of Nimar. In British Burmah, as in Lower Bengal, embankments take the place of canals, being classed as ‘ ‘ irrigation works” in the annual reports. Within the last few years Government has spent about £318,000 under this heading, in order to save the low rice-fields along the Irawadi from destructive inundation.

The following figures, applying to India as a whole, partially show how the Government has performed its duty as a landlord in undertaking productive public works. During the ten years ending March 1878 a total sum of £10,457,702 was expended on irrigation under the budget heading of “extraordinary,” as compared with £18,636,321 expended on state railways in the same period. In the twelve months ending at the same date irrigation yielded a gross income of £495,142, as compared with £548,528 derived from state railways; while £370,747 was charged to revenue account against irrigation and £420,754 against state railways.

Internal Communication. Railways.— The existing system of railway communica tion in India dates from the administration of Lord Dalhousie, who brought to bear upon this question an experience gained at the Board of Trade when railway speculation in England was at its height. The first Indian line was projected in 1843 by Sir Macdonald Stephenson, who was afterwards active in forming the East India Railway Company; but that premature scheme was blighted by the financial panic that followed soon afterwards in England. Bombay, the city that has most benefited by railway enterprise, saw the first sod turned in 1850, and the first line of 3 miles to Thânâ (Tanna) opened in 1853. The elaborate minute drawn up by Lord Dalhousie in the latter year still faithfully represents the railway map of India at the present day, though modified in detail by Lord Mayo’s reform of 1869. Lord Dalhousie’s scheme consisted of a few trunk lines, traversing the length and breadth of the peninsula, and connecting all the great cities and military cantonments. These trunk lines were to be constructed by private companies, to whom Government should guarantee a minimum of 5 per cent, interest on their capital expended, and from whom it should demand in return a certain measure of subordination. The system thus sketched out was promptly carried into execution, and by 1871 Bombay was put into direct railway communication with the sister presidencies of Calcutta and Madras. The task Lord Mayo had to undertake was the development of traffic by means of feeders which should tap the districts of production and thus open up the entire country. The means he determined to adopt was the construction of minor lines by the direct agency of the state, on a narrower gauge, and therefore at a cheaper rate, than the existing guaranteed railways.

The guaranteed lines, including the East Indian, which was transferred to Government in 1879 in accordance with terms applicable to all alike, comprise the following :—the East Indian, running up the valley of the Ganges from Calcutta (Howrah) as far as Delhi, with a branch to Jabalpur; the Great Indian Peninsular, which starts from Bombay and sends one arm north-east to Jabalpur, with a branch to Nagpur, and another south-east to the frontier of Madras; the Madras line, with its terminus similarly at Madras city, and two arms running respectively to the Great Indian Peninsular junction at Râichur and to Beypur on the opposite coast, with branches to Bangalore and Bellary; the Oudh and Rohilkhand, connecting Lucknow and Moradâbâd with Cawnpur and Benares; the Bombay, Baroda, and Central India, which runs due north from Bombay through the fertile plain of Guzerat, and is destined ultimately to be extended across Rajputana to Delhi; the Sind, Punjab, and Delhi, consisting of three sections, one in Lower Sind, another from Delhi to Lahore, and the third from Lahore to Mùltân; the South Indian (the only one on the narrow gauge), in the extreme south, from Cape Comorin to Madras city; and the Eastern Bengal, traversing the richest portion of the Gangetic delta. The state lines are too numerous to be described singly. They include the extension from Lahore to Peshawar on the north-west frontier, which at present stops short at Jhelum; the “missing link,” from Mùltân to Hyderabad, thus bringing the Punjab into direct connexion with its natural seaport at Karachi (opened throughout in 1878); the line up the valley of the Irawadi from Rangoon to Prome; and several short lines which have been constructed entirely at the expense of native states.

Statistics of Indian Railways for 1878.
[table]

These figures show 1 mile of railway to every 109 square miles of the area of British India, or to every 179 square miles of the area of the entire peninsula. The average cost of construction per mile is almost exactly £14,000. The guaranteed railways, embracing the great trunk lines throughout India, are on the “broad gauge” of 5 feet 6 inches; the state lines follow as a rule the narrow or metre gauge of 3 ’ 281 feet.

Roads.— As the railway system of India approaches its completion, the relative importance of the roads naturally [9:12:756] diminishes. From a military point of view, rapid communication by rail has now superseded the old marching routes as completely as in any European country. Like Portsmouth in England, Bombay in India has become the national harbour for the embarkation and debarkation of troops. On landing at Bombay, all troops proceed for a short rest to the healthy station of Deolâli on the plateau of the Deccan, whence they can reach their ultimate destinations, however remote, by easy railway stages. The Grand Trunk Road, running up the valley of the Ganges from Calcutta to the north-west frontier, which was first planned in the 16th century by the Afghan emperor Sher Shâh and was brought to completion under the administration of Lord George Bentinck, is now for the most part untrodden by troops. But though the railway system occupies the first place for military and commercial purposes, the actual mileage and economic importance of roads have greatly increased. They do not figure in the imperial balance-sheet, nor do they strike the popular imagination, but their construction and repair constitute two of the most important duties of the district official. A few lines, such as the continuation of the Grand Trunk Road in the Punjab, are still substitutes for the railways of the future. Others, which climb the passes of the Himâlayas, the Western Ghâts, or the Nilgiris, will probably never be superseded. The great majority, however, are works of local utility, serving to promote that ease and regularity of communication upon which the existence of civilization so largely depends. The substitution of the post-cart for the naked runner, and that of wheeled traffic for the pack-bullock, are silent revolutions effected under British rule.

The more important roads are all carefully metalled, the material employed in most provinces being kankar or calcareous limestone. In Lower Bengal and other deltaic tracts, where no kind of stone exists, bricks are roughly burnt and then broken up to supply metal for the roads. The minor streams are crossed by permanent bridges, with foundations of stone, and not unfrequently iron girders. The larger rivers have temporary bridges of boats thrown across them during the dry season, which give place to ferries in time of flood. Avenues of trees afford shade and material for timber. Most of these main lines are under the charge of the Public Works Department. The burden of maintaining the minor roads has, by a recent administrative reform, been thrown upon the local authorities, who depend for their pecuniary resources upon district committees and are often compelled to act as their own engineers. No statistics are available to show the total mileage of roads in British India, or the total sum expended on their maintenance.

Inland navigation is almost confined to the four great rivers, the Ganges, the Brahmaputra, the Indus, and the Irawadi. These all flow through broad valleys, and from time immemorial have been the chief means of conveying the produce of the interior to the sea. South of the Gangetic basin there is not a single river that can be called navigable. Most of the streams in that tract, though mighty torrents in the rainy season, dwindle away to mere threads of water and stagnant pools during the rest of the year. The Godâvari and the Narbadâ, whose volume of water is ample, are both obstructed by rocky rapids which engineering skill has hitherto been unable to overcome. A total sum of 1∣ millions sterling has been in vain expended upon the former river. Indeed, it may be doubted whether water carriage is able to compete, as regards the more valuable staples, with communication by rail. After the East Indian Railway was opened, steamers ceased to ply upon the Ganges; and the steam flotilla on the Indus similarly shrank to insignificance when through communication by rail became possible between Mùltân and Karâchi. On the Brahmaputra and its tributary the Bârak, and on the Irawadi, steamers still run secure from competition. But it is in the Gangetic delta that river navigation attains its highest development. There the population may be regarded as half amphibious. Every village can be reached by water in the rainy season, and every family keeps its boat. The main channels of the Ganges and Brahmaputra and their larger tributaries are navigable all the year through. During the rainy months road-carriage is altogether superseded. All the minor streams are swollen by the rainfall on the hills, and the loeal downpour; while fleets of boats sail down with the produce that has accumulated in warehouses on the river banks. The statistics of this subject belong rather to the department of internal trade, but it may be mentioned here that the number of laden boats registered at certain of the river-stations in Bengal in the year 1877-78 was 401,729.

The great majority of the Bengal rivers require no attention from Government, but the system known as the three Nadiyâ rivers is only kept open for traffic by close supervision. A staff of engineers is constantly employed to watch the shifting bed, to assist the scouring action of the current, and to advertize the trading community of the depth of water from time to time. In the year 1877-78 a total sum of £9522 was expended on this account, while an income of £32,494 was derived from tolls.

The artificial water channels of India may be divided into two classes—(1) those confined to navigation, and (2) those primarily constructed for purposes of irrigation. Of the former class the most important examples are to be found in the south of the peninsula. On both the Malabar and the Coromandel coasts the strip of lowland lying between the mountains and the sea affords natural facilities for the construction of an inland canal running parallel to the shore. In Malabar the salt-water lagoons or lakes, which form such a prominent feature in the local geography, merely required to be supplemented by a few cuttings to supply continuous water communication from the port of Calicut to Cape Comorin. On the east coast, the Buckingham canal, running north from Madras city as far as the delta of the Kistna, has been completed without any great engineering difficulties. In Bengal there are a few artificial canals of old date, but of no great magnitude, in the neighbourhood of Calcutta. The principal of these form the system known as the Calcutta and Eastern eanals, which consist for the most part of natural channels, artificially deepened in order to afford a safe boat route through the Sundarbans. Up to the close of the year 1877-78 a capital sum of £360,332 had been expended by Government on these canals, and the gross income in that year was £44,120; after deducting cost of repairs, &c., charged to revenue account, and interest at the rate of 4⅜ per cent., a net profit was left amounting to £8748. The Hijilf tidal canal in Midnapur district, which cuts off a difficult corner of the Hùgli (Hooghly) river, yielded a net revenue of £3171 in the same year.

Most of the great irrigation works, both in northern and southern India, have been so constructed as to be available also for navigation. The general features of these works have been already described. The works of the Madras Irrigation Company on the Tungabhadra were not made available for navigation until 1879. A scheme is now under the consideration of the Bengal Government for joining the Midnapur and Orissa canal systems, and extending the line of water communication farther southward through the Chilkà Lake as far as Ganjam, 400 miles from Calcutta.

Commerce.

The trade of India may be considered under four heads: —(1) sea-borne trade with foreign countries; (2) coasting trade; (3) frontier trade, chiefly across the northern mountains; (4) internal traffic within the limits of the empire.

Sea-borne Trade. —With an extensive seaboard, India has but few ports. Calcutta monopolizes the commerce, not only of Lower Bengal, but of the entire basins of the Ganges and the Brahmaputra. Bombay is the sole outlet for the agricultural wealth of Guzerat, the Deccan, and the Central Provinces; while Karâchi (Kurrachee) performs a similar office for the Indus, and Rangoon for the Irawadi. The natural value of these four ports has been permanently confirmed by the construction of the main lines of railway communication. In the south of India only is sea-borne [9:12:757] trade distributed along the coast. The western side has a succession of tolerable harbours, from Goa to Cochin. On the east there is not a single safe roadstead nor a navigable river, but ships anchor some distance off the shore at Madras, and at other points, generally near the mouths of the rivers. Of the total foreign trade of India, Calcutta and Bombay control about 40 per cent, each; Madras has 6 per cent., Rangoon 4 per cent., and Karachi 2 per cent., leaving a balance of only 8 per cent, for all the remaining ports of the country. Calcutta and Bombay may be called the two centres of collection and distribution, to a degree without a parallel in other countries; and the growth of their prosperity is identical with the development of Indian commerce.

Foreign Trade of India for Forty Years, classified according to Quinquennial Periods, in Millions Sterling.
[table]

The preceding table, which has been compiled from materials furnished by the Parliamentary Abstract for 1879, demands a few words of explanation. The average of quinquennial periods has been taken in order to conn · teract, as far as possible, accidental fluctuations. The two columns giving the imports of treasure and the exports of raw cotton both show exceptional increases between 1855 and 1869, due mainly to the effects of the Mutiny and of the American War. Far more instructive are the three columns giving the imports of cotton manufactures and of total merchandise and the exports of total merchandise. Each of these three, without exception, exhibits a progressive increase in every one of the eight quinquennial periods. In the full period of forty years the value of cotton goods imported has multiplied sixfold; the value of total merchandise imported has multiplied fivefold; and the value of total merchandise exported has multiplied more than fourfold.

Before examining in detail the history of some of the chief staples of trade, it may be convenient to give in this place the statistics of a single year,—1877-1878, which was a year of inflation, despite the incidence of famine in southern India. In 1877-78 the aggregate volume of foreign sea-borne trade exceeded 126 millions sterling in value. The transactions of Government show an import of £2,138,182 and an export of £36,615. The imports of merchandise were £39,336,003, and of treasure £17,355,460; total imports, £56,691,463. The exports of merchandise were £65,185,713, and of treasure £2,155,136; total exports, £67,340,849. These figures show an excess of exports over imports (including treasure) amounting to £8,494,250, and an excess of treasure imported to the amount of £15,200,324. The total number of vessels that entered and cleared was 12,537, with an aggregate of 5,754,379 tons, or an average of 459 tons each. Of the total tonnage 76 per cent, was British, 7 per cent. British Indian, 4 per cent, native, and 13 per cent, foreign,—American, Italian, and French being best represented in the latter class. There was also a land-borne frontier trade estimated at 7f millions—imports into India 4} millions, exports 3⅛ millions. The grand total of the land-borne and sea-borne foreign trade of India in 1878, was 134 millions.

The following tables give the principal items, together with the totals, of import and export for 1877-78, showing the quantities wherever possible, as well as the values :—

Foreign Trade of British India in 1877-78.

Imports.
[table]

Exports.
[table]

As regards the imports, the first thing to notice is the enormous predominance of two items—cotton goods and treasure. On an average of the last forty years, cotton goods form 33 per cent., or exactly one-third of the total, and treasure an additional 30 per cent. Next in order come metals (copper, which is largely used by native smiths, slightly exceeding iron); Government stores, including munitions of war, boots, liquor, and clothing for soldiers, and railway plant; liquors, entirely for European consumption; coal, for the use of the railways and mills; railway plant for the guaranteed companies; provisions, [9:12:758] machinery and mill-work, and manufactured silk. It will thus be seen that, with the single exception of Manchester goods, no articles of European manufacture are in demand for native consumption, but only for the needs of the civilized administration, and no raw produce, except copper, iron, and salt.

Considering that England’s export trade with India thus mainly depends upon piece-goods, it is curious to recollect the history of cotton manufacture. In the beginning of the 17th century the industry had not been introduced into England, and whatever demand there was for cotton in that country was satisfied by circuitous importations from India itself, where cotton-weaving is an immémorial industry. In 1641 “Manchester cottons,” in imitation of Indian calicoes and chintzes, were still made of wool. Cotton is said to have been first manufactured in England in 1676. To foster the nascent industry, a succession of statutes were passed prohibiting the wear of imported cottons; and it was not until after the inventions of Arkwright and others and the application of steam as a motive power had secured to Manchester the advantage of cheap production that these protective measures were entirely removed. In the present century Lancashire has rapidly distanced her instructors. During the five years 1840-45 the annual import of cotton manufactures into India averaged a little over £3,000,000 sterling. In each subsequent quinquennial period there has been a steady increase, until in the year 1877-78 the import reached the unprecedented total of £20,000,000 sterling, or an increase of more than sixfold in less than forty years.

The importation of treasure is perhaps still more extraordinary, when we bear in mind that it is not consumed in the using, but remains permanently in the country. During the same period of forty years the net import of treasure, deducting export, has reached the enormous aggregate of just 319 millions sterling, or more than £1, 6s. 6d. per head of the 240 million inhabitants of the peninsula. Of course, by far the larger portion of this was silver, but the figures for gold are by no means inconsiderable. During the ten years ending with 1875, when the normal value of silver in terms of gold was but little disturbed, the total net imports of treasure into India amounted to just 99 millions; of this total 62J millions were in silver and 36⅜ millions in gold, the proportion of the latter metal being thus considerably more than one-third of the whole. On separating the re-exports from the imports, the attraction of gold to India appears yet more marked. Of the total imports of gold only 7 per cent, was re-exported, while for silver the corresponding proportion was 19 per cent. Roughly speaking, it may be concluded that India then absorbed about £3,000,000 sterling of gold a year. The supply is drawn chiefly from China, Ceylon, Great Britain, and Australia. The depreciation of silver that has since taken place has caused an enormous increase in the import of silver and a corresponding increase in the export of gold. The figures since 1876 do not show the normal state of things. But even in 1877-78, when the value of silver was at its lowest, though India drew upon its hoards of gold for export to the amount of more than 1 million sterling, it yet imported more than 1∣ millions, showing a net import of half a million of gold. It has been estimated that the gold circulation of India amounts to about 1,620,000 gold mohars, as compared with £158,000,000 of silver and £2,960,000 of copper. In addition, 10 million . sovereigns are said to be hoarded in India, mainly in the Bombay presidency, where the impression of St George and the Dragon is valued on religious grounds.

When we turn to the exports, the changes that have taken place in relative magnitude demand notice.

In 1877-78 raw cotton for the first time for many years falls into the second place, being surpassed by the aggregate total of food grains; oil-seeds show as a formidable competitor to cotton; jute surpasses indigo, and tea comes close behind; while cotton manufactures are nearly as valuable as coffee. The imports of sugar, in value though not in quantity, exceed the exports; the trade in raw silk is about equally balanced; while spices, once the glory of Eastern trade, were exported to the value of only £226,515, as compared with imports more valuable and also twofold larger.

The export of raw cotton has been subject to excessive variations. At the close of the last century cotton was sent to England in small quantities, chiefly the produce of the Central Provinces, collected at Mirzapur and shipped at Calcutta, or the produce of Guzerat, despatched from Surat. In the year 1805 the total export of cotton from Surat was valued at £108,000; in the same year the English returns show only 2000 bales of East Indian cotton imported into Great Britain. But this figure was far below the average, for by 1810 the corresponding number of bales had risen to 79,000, to sink again to 2000 in 1813, and to rise to 248,000 in 1818. Bombay did not begin to participate in this trade until 1825, but has now acquired the practical monopoly, since the railway has diverted to the west the produce of the Central Provinces. In 1834, when the commerce of India was first thrown open, 33,000,000 lb were exported. Analysing the exports of cotton during the forty years since 1840, we find that in the first quinquennial period they averaged 2⅛ millions sterling in value, and did not rise perceptibly until 1858, when they first touched 4 millions. From that date the increase was steady, even before the American exports were cut off by war in 1861. India then made the most of her opportunity, though quantity and quality did not keep pace with the augmented price. The highest figures of value was attained with 37⅜ millions sterling in 1865, and the highest figure of quantity with 803,000,000 lb in 1866. Thenceforth the decline has been constant, though somewhat irregular, the lowest figures both of quantity and value being those of 1878-79. The most recent feature of the trade is the comparatively small amount shipped to the United Kingdom, and the even distribution of the rest among Continental ports. The export of raw cotton in 1878-79 amounted to £7,914,091, and of twist and cotton goods to £2,581,823.

Second in,importance to cotton as a raw material of British manufacture comes jute, the trade in which is a creation of less than thirty years. At the time of the London Exhibition of 1851 jute fibre was practically untried and unknown, while attention was even then actively drawn to rhea or China grass, which remains to the present day unmanageable by any cheap process. From time immemorial jute has been grown in the swamps of Eastern Bengal, and has been woven into coarse fabrics for bags and even clothing. As early as 1795 Dr Roxburgh called attention to the commercial value of the plant, which he grew in the Botanical Gardens of Calcutta and named “jute,” after the language of his Orissa gardeners, the Bengali word being pat or kοshta. In 1828-29 the total exports of jute were only 364 cwts., valued at £62. From that date the trade steadily grew, until in the quinquennial period ending 1847-48 the exports averaged 234,055 cwts. The Crimean war, which cut off the supplies of Russian flax and hemp from the Forfarshire weavers, made the reputation of jute. Taking quinquennial periods, the export of jute rose from an average of 969,724 cwts. in 1858-63 to 2,628,100 cwts. in 1863-68 and 4,858,162 cwts. in 1868-73. The highest figures reached were in the year 1872-73, with 7,080,912 cwt⅛., valued at £4,142,548. The export of raw jute in 1878-79 reached £3,800,426, and of manufactured jute £1,098,434.

The export of grain, as already noticed, is now in the aggregate larger than that of cotton. The two chief items are rice ana wheat Rice is exported from British Burmah, from Bengal, and from Madras. From the point of view of the English produce market rice means only Burmese rice, which is annually exported to the large amount of about 12 million cwts., valued at 3 millions sterling. In the Indian tables this is all entered as consigned to the United Kingdom, though, as a matter of fact, the rice fleets from Burmah only call for orders at Falmouth, and are thence diverted tc various English or Continental ports. India has a practical monopoly of the European market. An export duty is levied on rice in India at the rate of 3 dnnds per rnaund, or about 6d. per cwt. A similar duty on wheat was repealed in 1875, and that trade has since conspicuously advanced. In 1874-75 the export of wheat was about 1 million cwts. Forthwith it increased year by year, until in 1877-78 it exceeded 6J million cwts., valued at nearly 3 millions sterling. In the following year the quantity fell away to almost nothing, owing to the general failure of the harvest in the producing districts. The Punjab is the principal wheat-growing tract in India, but hitherto the chief supplies have come from the NorthWestern Provinces and Oudh, being collected at Cawnpur and thence despatched by rail to Calcutta. The total export of grains in 1879 was valued at £9,802,363.

Oil-seeds, also, were freed in 1875, the duty previous to that date having been 3 per cent, ad valorem. Ten years before, the average [9:12:759] export was only about 4 million cwts. a year; but the fiscal change, σoinciding with an augmented demand in Europe, has caused an increase of threefold. In 1877-78 the total export amounted to 12,187,020 cwts., valued at more than 7∣ millions sterling. Of this Bengal contributed 7,799,220 cwts., and Bombay 3,179,475 cwts. Linseed and rape are consigned mainly to the United Kingdom, while France takes almost the entire quantity of til or gingelly. The export of oil-seeds in 1878-79 was valued at £4,682,512.

In actual amount, though not in relative importance, indigo holds its own in the face of competition from aniline dyes. The export of 1877-78 amounted to 120,605 cwts., valued at £3,494,334, being the highest figures on record. Of this total Bengal yielded 99,402 cwts., and Madras 16,899 cwts.· In 1878-79 the export of indigo amounted to 105,051 cwts., valued at £2,960,463. The most noticeable feature in this trade is the diminishing proportion sent direct to England, and the wide distribution of the remainder. Of other dyes, safflower has greatly fallen off, being now only in demand for a rouge in China and Japan; the export in 1877-78 was 3698 cwts., valued at £14,881. The export of myrobalans, on the other hand, was greatly stimulated by the Russo-Turkish war, which interrupted the supply of valonia and galls from Asia Minor. The quantity rose from 286,350 cwts. in 1875-76 to 537,055 cwts. in 1877-78, valued in the latter year at £230,526. Practically the whole is sent to the United Kingdom. Turmeric, also, exhibits an increase to 146,865 cwts. in 1877-78, valued at £123,766, of which the United Kingdom took about one-half. Lac-dye, like other kinds of lac, shows a depressed trade, the exports in 1877-78 having been 9570 cwts., valued at £29,009.

No other export has made such steady progress as tea, which has multiplied more than fourfold in the space of ten years. In 1867-68 the amount was only 7,811,429 lb; by 1872-73 it had reached 17,920,439 lb; and in 1878-79, without a single step of retrogression, it had further risen to 34,800,027 lb, valued at £3,170,118. Indian tea has now a recognized position in the London market, generally averaging about 4d. per ft> higher in value than Chinese tea, but it has failed to win acceptance in most other countries, excepting Australia. The exports of coffee from India are stationary, if not declining. The highest amount during the past ten years was 507,296 cwts. in 1871-72, the lowest amount 298,587 cwts. in 1877-78, valued at £1,338,499. In 1878-79 the export was 342,268 cwts., valued at £1,548,481.

Of manufactured goods, cotton and jute deserve notice, though by far the greater part of the produce of the Indian mills is consumed locally. The total value of cotton goods exported in 1878-79 was £1,644,125, being an increase of nearly threefold as compared with J 874-75. The exports of twist and yarn, spun in the Bombay mills, increased from 3 million lb in 1874-75 to 15⅜ million lb in 1877-78, valued in thé latter year at £682,058. The chief places of destination were—China, 13,762,133 lb; Aden, 1,181,120 lb; and Arabia, 393,371 lb. The export of twist and yarn in 1878-79 was valued at £937,698. Piece-goods belong to two classes. Coloured goods, woven in hand-looms, are exported from Madras to Ceylon and the Straits, to the annual value of about £230,000, the quantity being about 8 million yards; while in 1877-78 grey goods from the Bombay mills were sent to Aden, Arabia, Zanzibar, and the Mekran coast, amounting to over 10 million yards, and valued at £141,509. Jute manufactures consist of gunny bags, gunny cloths, and rope and twine, almost entirely the produce of the Calcutta mills. In all of these the value of the exports is increasing faster than the quantity, having multiplied nearly fourfold in the last five years. In 1877-78 the total export of jute manufactures was valued at £771,127, and in 1878-79 at £1,098,434. Gunny bags, for the packing of wheat, rice, and wool, were exported in 1877-78 to the number of more than 26⅜ millions, valued at £729,669. Of tliis total £298,000 (includ∙ ing by far the most valuable bags) was sent to Australia, £162,000 to the Straits, £80,000 to the United States, £77,000 to Egypt, £32,000 to China, and £81,000 to other countries, this comprising a considerable quantity destined for England. In 1878-79 the export of gunny bags had increased to 45⅜ millions, valued at a million sterling. Of gunny cloth in pieces nearly 3 million yards were exported in 1877-78, almost entirely to the United States, valued at £35,610; in 1878-79 these exports had increased to upwards of 4∣ million yards. Of rope and twine 4428 cwts. were exported, valued at £5443.

The following tables, being taken from Indian returns, do not in all cases show the real origin of the imports or the ultimate destination of the exports, but primarily the countries with which India has direct dealings. London still retains its historical pre-eminence as the first Oriental mart in the world, whither buyers flock from the other countries of Europe to satisfy their wants. Germans go there for wool, Frenchmen for jute, and all nations alike for rare dyes, spices, and drugs. Though the opening of the Suez Canal has restored to the maritime cities of the Mediterranean some share of the business that they once monopolized, yet, on the other hand, the advantage of prior possession, the growing use of steamers, and the certainty of being able to obtain a return freight, all tend to favour trade with England carried in English bottoms. As the result of these conflicting influences, the trade of India with the United Kingdom, while in actual amount it remains pretty constant, shows a relative decrease as compared with the total trade.

[table]

The opening of the Suez Canal in 1869, while it has stimulated every department of trade into greater activity, has not materially changed its character. As might be anticipated, the imports, being for the most part of small bulk and high value, first felt the advantages of this rou te. In 1875-76 as much as 85 per cent, of the imports fromEuropeand Egypt (excluding treasure) passed through the canal, but only 29 per cent, of the exports. In 1878-79 the proportion of imports was substantially the same, while that of exports had risen to 64 per cent., showing that such bulky commodities as cotton, grain, oil-seeds, and jute were beginning to participate in the advantages of rapid traffic. The actual values of canal trade in 1877-78, the year of its greatest development, were 29 millions sterling for imports, and 23 millions for exports. It is estimated that the canal has reduced the length of the voyage from London to India by the equivalent of thirty-six days, the route round the Cape being more than 11,000 miles, that through the canal less than 3000 miles.

In 1873-74, which may be regarded as a normal year, though the figures are not altogether free from suspicion, the total number of vessels engaged in the coasting trade that cleared and entered was 294,374, with an aggregate of 10,379,862 tons; the total value of both exports and imports was returned at £34,890,445. Of the total number of vessels, 280,913, with 4,843,668 tons, were native craft. Bombay and Madras divide between them nearly all the native craft; while in Bengal and Burmah a large and increasing proportion of the coasting traffic is carried in British steamers. In 1877-78, the year of famine, the number of ships increased to 319,624, the tonnage to 15,732,246 tons, and the. value to £67,814,446. By far the largest item was grain, of which a total of 1,137,690 tons, valued at 13 millions sterling, was thrown into the famine-stricken districts from the seaboard. Next in importance come raw cotton and cotton goods. The trade in raw cotton amounted to 387,438 cwts., valued at £957,900, much of which was merely transshipped from one port to another in the Bombay presidency. Cotton, twist, and yarn amounted to 17,425,993 lt>, valued at £965,038, of which the greater part was sent from Bombay to Bengal and Madras. The total value of the cotton piece-goods was £620,866, including about 24 million yards of grey goods sent from Bombay to Bengal and to Sind in nearly equal proportions, and about 2 million yards of coloured goods from Madras. Stimulated by the activity of the grain trade, the exports of gunny bags from Calcutta coastwise rose to a total value of nearly [9:12:760] £960,000. The trade in betel-nuts amounted to nearly 44 million lb, valued at over £500,000. Burmah consumes most of these, obtaining its supplies from Bengal; while Bombay gets considerable quantities from Madras, from the Concan and Goa, and from Bengal. Sugar (refined and unrefined) figures to the large amount of £900,000, of which the greater part came from Bengal. The movements of treasure coastwise show a total of just 5 millions sterling, being exceptionally augmented by the conveyance of silver to Burmah in payment for rice supplied to Madras.

The following table exhibits the totals of the trade conducted along the landward frontier of the Indian empire, so far as figures are available:—

Registered Frontier Trade of India in 1877-1878.
[table]

In any community raised above primitive barbarism the aggregate volume of its internal trade must be far greater than that of its foreign commerce; but, from the nature of the case, it is impossible to estimate its amount or even to describe adequately its general character. On the one hand, there is the wholesale business connected with foreign commerce in its earliest stages—the collection of agricultural produce from a thousand little villages, its accumulation at a few great central marts, and its despatch to the seaboard; in return for which manufactured articles are distributed by the same channels, though in the reverse direction. On the other hand, there is the interchange of commodities of native growth and manufacture, sometimes between neighbours, but also between distant provinces. With a few unimportant exceptions, free trade is the rule throughout the vast peninsula of India, by land as well as by sea. The Hindus possess a natural genius for commerce, as is shown by the daring with which they have penetrated into the heart of Central Asia, and to· the east coast of Africa. Among the benefits which British rule has conferred upon them is the removal of the innumerable shackles that a short-sighted despotism had imposed upon their talents.

Broadly speaking, the greater part of the internal trade remains in the hands of the natives. Europeans control the shipping business, and have a share in the collection of some of the more valuable staples of exports, such as cotton, jute, oil-seeds, and wheat. But the work of distribution and the adaptation of the supply to the demand of the consumer naturally fall to those who are best acquainted with native wants. Even in the presidency towns the retail shops are generally owned by natives. The Vaisya, or trading caste of Manu, has no longer any separate existence; but its place is occupied by several well-marked classes. On the western coast the Pârsis, by the boldness and extent of their operations, tread close upon the heels of the most prosperous English houses. In the interior of the Bombay presidency, business is mainly divided between two classes, the Baniyas of Guzerat and the Mârwâris from Râjputâna. Each of these profess a peculiar form of religion, the former being Vishnu vites of the. Vallabhâchâri sect, the latter Jains. In the Deccan their place is taken by Lingâyats from the south, who again follow their own form of Hinduism, which is an heretical species of Siva worship. Throughout Mysore, and in the north of Madras, Lingâyats are still found, but along the eastern sea-board the predominating classes of traders are those named Chetties and Komatis. In Bengal many of the upper castes of Sùdras have devoted themselves to general trade; but there again the Jain Mârwâris from Râjputâna and the North-West occupy the front rank. Their head-quarters are in Murshidâbâd district, and their agents are to be found throughout the valley of the Brahmaputra, as far up as the unexplored frontier of China. They penetrate everywhere among the wild tribes; and it is said that the natives of the Khâsi hills are the only hillmen who do their own business of buying and selling. In the North-Western Provinces and Oudh the traders are generically called Baniyas; ând in the Punjab are found the Khatris, who have perhaps the best title of any to regard themselves as descendants of the original Vaisyas. According to the general census of 1872, the total number of persons in all India returned as connected with commerce and trade was 3,224,000, or 5 ’ 2 per cent, of the adult males.

Local trade is conducted either at the permanent bdzdrs: of great towns, at weekly markets held in certain villages, at annual gatherings primarily held for religious purposes, or by means of travelling brokers and agents. The cultivator himself, who is the chief producer and also the chief customer, knows little of the great towns, and expects the dealer to come to his own door. Each village has at least one resident trader, who usually combines in his own person the functions of money-lender, grain dealer, and cloth seller. The simple system of rural economy is entirely based upon the dealings of this man, whom it is the fashion sometimes to decry as a usurer, but who is really the one thrifty person among an improvident population. Abolish the money-lender, and the general body of cultivators would have nothing to depend upon but the harvest of a single year. The money-lender deals chiefly in grain and in specie. In those districts where the staples of export are largely grown, the cultivators commonly sell their crops to travelling brokers, who re-sell to larger dealers, and so on until the commodities reach the hands of the agents of the great shipping houses. The wholesale trade thus rests ultimately with a comparatively small number of persons, who have agencies, or rather corresponding firms, at the great central marts. Buying and selling in their aspects most characteristic of India are to be seen, not at these great towns, nor even at the weekly markets, but at the fairs which are held periodically at certain spots in most districts. Religion is always the original pretext of these gatherings or melds, at some of which nothing is done beyond bathing in the river, or performing various superstitious ceremonies. But in the majority of cases religion has become a mere excuse for secular business. Crowds of petty traders attend, bringing all those miscellaneous articles that can be packed into a pedlar’s wallet; and the neighbouring villagers look forward to the occasion to satisfy alike their curiosity and their household wants.

It is, of course, impossible to express accurately in figures the extent of internal trade, but the following statistics will serve in some measure to show both its recent development and its actual amount. They are based upon the registration returns that have been collected for some years past in certain provinces. In 1863-64 the total external trade of the Central Provinces, both export and import, was estimated to amount to 102,000 tons, valued at £3,909,000. By 1868-69, after the opening of the Jabalpur through railway, it had increased to 209,000 tons, valued at £6,795,000. In 1877-78, the year of famine in southern India, the corresponding figures were 635,000 tons and £9,373,000, showing an increase in fourteen years of more than sixfold in quantity, and considerably more than twofold in value. The comparatively Small increase in value is to be attributed to the exclusion from the later returns of opium, which merely passes through in transit from Mâlwâ. In 1874-75 the total external trade of the Punjab amounted to about 600,000 tons, valued (but probably overvalued) at about £16,000,000. In 1877-78 it had increased to nearly 900,000 tons, valued at £17,500,000. The total trade of Behar in [9:12:761] 1877-78 was valued at £16,000,000. But perhaps the significance of such enormous totals will become plainer if we take the case of a single mart, Patna, which may claim to be considered one of the most important centres of inland traffic in the world. Favourably situated on the Ganges, near the confluence of the Son and the Gogra, where the principal trade routes branch off to Nepal, it has become a great changing station for the transfer of goods from river to rail. In the year 1876-77 the total registered trade of Patna (excluding the Government monopoly of opium, and probably omitting a good deal besides) was valued in the aggregate at 7⅜ millions sterling. Many articles are included twice over, both as exported and imported, but the imports alone amounted to more than 4 millions. Among the principal items on one side or the other may be mentioned—European piece-goods, £1,217,000; indigo, £789,000; oil-seeds, £557,000; salt, £389,000; sugar, £274,000; food grains, £258,000; hides, £185,000; saltpetre, £156,000.

Manufactures.

Though India may be truly described as an agricultural and not a manufacturing country, yet it would be erroneous to infer that it is destitute of the arts of civilized life. It has no swarming hives of industry to compare with the factory centres of Lancashire, nor a large mining population, living under the soil rather than on it. In short, it has not reached that modern stage of industrial development which is based upon the use of coal and the discoveries of physical science. But in all manufactures requiring manual dexterity and artistic taste India may challenge comparison with England in the last century. The organization of Hindu society demands that the necessary arts, such as those of the weaver, the potter, and the smith, should be practised in every village. The pride and display of the rival kingdoms, into which the country was formerly divided, gave birth to many arts of luxury that have not yet been entirely forgotten in the decayed capitals. When the first European traders reached the coast of India in the 16th century, they found a civilization among both “Moors” and “Gentoos” at least as highly advanced as their own. In architecture, in fabrics of cotton and silk, in goldsmith’s work and jewellery, the people of India were then unsurpassed. But while the East has stood still, or rather retrograded (for, in the face of keen competition, to stand still is to retrograde), the West has advanced with a gigantic stride which has no parallel in the history of human progress. On the one hand, the downfall of the native courts has deprived the skilled workman of his chief market, while, on the other, the English capitalist has enlisted in his service forces of nature against which the village artisans in vain try to compete. The fortunes of India are bound up with those of a country whose manufacturing supremacy depends upon a great export trade. The tide of circumstances, more inexorable than artificial enactments, has compelled the weaver to exchange his loom for the plough, and has crushed out a multitude of minor handicrafts. Political economy, judging only by the single test of cheapness, may approve the result; but the philosopher will regret the increasing uniformity of social conditions, and the loss to the world of artistic tendencies which can never be restored.

Historically the most interesting, and still the most important in the aggregate, of all Indian industries are those conducted in every rural village of the land. The Hindu village system is based upon division of labour quite as much as upon hereditary caste. The weaver, the potter, the blacksmith, the brazier, the oil-presser, are each members of a community, as well as inheritors of a family occupation. On the one hand, they have a secure market for their wares, and, on the other, their employers have a guarantee that their trades shall be well learned. Simplicity of life and permanence of employment are here happily combined with a high degree of excellence in design and honesty of execution. The stage of civilization below these village industries is represented by the hill tribes, especially those on the north-east frontier, where the weaving of clothes is done by the women of the family,—a practice which also prevails throughout Burmah. A higher stage may be found in those villages or towns which possess a little colony of weavers or braziers noted for some specialty. Yet one degree higher is the case of certain arts of luxury, such as ivory carving or the making of gold lace, which chance or royal patronage has fixed at some capital now perhaps falling into decay. One other form of native industry owes its origin to European interference. Many a village in Lower Bengal and on the Coromandel coast still shows traces of the time when the East India Company and its European rivals gathered large settlements of weavers round their little forts, and thus formed the only industrial towns that ever existed in India. But when the Company abandoned its manufacturing business in 1833, these centres of industry rapidly declined; and the once celebrated muslins of India have been driven out of the market of the world by Manchester goods.

Cotton weaving may be called the oldest indigenous industry of India. The Greek name for cotton fabrics, sin-don (σινδων), is etymologically the same as that of India or Sind; in later days Calicut on the Malabar coast has given us “calico.” Cotton cloth, whether plain or ornamented, has always been the single material of clothing for both men and women, except in Assam and Burmah, where silk is preferred, perhaps in reminiscence of an extinct trade with China. When European adventurers found the way to India, cotton and silk always formed part of the rich cargoes they brought home. The English, in especial, appear to have been careful to fix their earliest settlements amid a weaving population—at Surat, at Calicut, at Ma-sulipataιn, at Hooghly. In delicacy of texture, in purity and fastness of colour, in grace of design, Indian cottons may still hold their own against the world; but in the matter of cheapness they have been unable to face the competition of Manchester.

In 1870 the Madras Board of Revenue published a valuable report upon hand-loom weaving, from which the following local figures are taken. The total number of looms at work in that presidency, with its general population of 31 millions, was returned at 279,220, of which 220,015 were in villages and 59,205 in towns, showing a considerable increase upon the corresponding number in 1861, when the mοhtarfa or assessed tax upon looms was abolished. The total estimated consumption of twist was 31,422,712 lb, being at the rate of 112 fij per loom. Of this amount, about one-third was imported twist and the remainder country-made. The total value of the cotton goods woven was returned at 3⅜ millions sterling, or £12, 10s. per loom, but this was believed to be much under the truth. The export of country-made cloth in the same year was about £220,000. In the Central Provinces (population 8 millions), where hand-loom weaving is still fairly maintained, and where statistics are more trustworthy than in other parts, the number of looms is returned at 87,588, employing 145,896 weavers, with an annual out-turn valued at £828,000. In 1878-79 the export of Indian piece-goods from the Central Provinces was valued at £162,642. As regards Bengal, hand-loom weaving is generally on the decline. The average consumption of piece-goods throughout the province is estimated at about 5s. per head, and the returns of registered trade show that European piece-goods are distributed from Calcutta at the rate of about 2s. 5d. per head. In Midnapur, Nadiya, and Bardwân the native weavers still hold their own, appears from the large imports of European twist; but in the eastern districts, which have to balance their large exports of jute, rice, and oil-seeds, the imports of European cloth rise to the high figure of 2s. 7d. per head. No part of India has suffered more from English competition than Bombay, where, however, the introdιιction of steam machinery is beginning to restore the balance. Twist from the Bombay mills is now generally used by the hand-loom weavers of the presidency, and is largely exported to China. But it is in the finer fabrics produced for export that the west of India has suffered most. Taking Surat alone, the export by sea of piece-goods at the beginning of the century was valued at £360,000 a year. By 1845 the value had dropped to £67,000, rising again to £134,000 in 1859; but in 1874 it was only £4188.

Silk weaving is also a common industry everywhere, silk fabrics, or at least an admixture of silk in cotton, be.in∏∙
[9:12:762]

universally affected as a mark of wealth. Throughout British Burmah, and also in Assam, silk is the common material of clothing, being made up by the women of the household. In Burmah the bulk of the silk is imported from China, generally in a raw state; but in Assam it is obtained from two or three varieties of worms, which are generally fed on jungle trees and may be regarded as semi-domesticated. Bengal is the only part of India where sericulture, or the rearing of the silk-worm proper on mulberry, can be said to flourish. The greater part of the silk is wound in European filatures, and exported in the raw state to Europe. The native supply is either locally consumed, or sent up the Ganges to the great cities of the North-West. A considerable quantity of raw silk, especially for Bombay consumption, is imported from China. Tasar silk, or that obtained from the cocoons of semi-domesticated worms, does not contribute much to the supply. As compared with cotton weaving, the manufacture of silk fabrics may be called a town and not a village industry. These fabrics are of two kinds—(1) those composed of pure silk, and (2) those with a cotton warp crossed by a woof of silk. Both kinds are often embroidered with gold and silver. The mixed fabrics are known as mashru or sufi, the latter word, meaning “permitted,” being used because the strict ceremonial law will not allow Mahometans to wear clothing of pure silk. They are largely woven in the towns of the Punjab and Sind, at Agra, at Hyderabad in the Deccan, and at Tanjore and Trichinopoli. Pure silk fabrics are either of simple texture, or highly ornamented in the form of kinkhabs or brocades. The latter are a specialty of Benares, Murshidâbâd, Ahmadâbâd, and Trichinopoli. Printed silks are woven at Surat for the wear of Pârsi and Guzerati women. Quite recently mills with steam machinery have been established at Bombay, which weave silk fabrics for the Burmese market, chiefly lûngyis, tarnains, and patsoes. The silk manufactures exported from India consist almost entirely of the handkerchiefs known as bandannas and corahs, with a small proportion of tasar fabrics. The trade appears to be on the decline, the total exports having decreased from 2,468,052 yards, valued at £238,000, in 1875-76 to 1,481,256 yards, valued at £147,000, in 1877-78. But in 1879 the value had again risen to £195,897; and the returns for 1874-77 were unusually high.

Embroidery has already been referred to in the two preceding paragraphs. The groundwork may be either silk, cotton, wool, or leather. The ornament is woven in the loom, or sewn on afterwards with the needle. Muslin is embroidered with silk and gold thread at Dacca, Patnâ, and Delhi. Sind and Cutch (Kachhch) have special embroideries of coloured silk and gold. Leather-work is embroidered in Guzerat. In some of the historical capitals of the Deccan, such as Gulbargah and Aurangâbâd, velvet (makhmaΓ) is gorgeously embroidered with gold, to make canopies, umbrellas, and housings for elephants and horses, f··ruse on state occasions. Not only the goldsmith, but also the jeweller lends his aid to Indian embroidery.

Carpets and rugs may be classified into those made of cotton and those made of wool. The former, called satranjis and daris, are made chiefly in Bengal and northern India, and appear to be an indigenous manufacture. The woollen or pile carpets known as kalin and kαlicha are those which have recently attained so much popularity in England, by reason of the low price at which the outturn of the jail manufactories can be placed in the market. The art was probably introduced into India by the Mahometans. The historical seats of the industry are in Kashmir, the Punjab, and Sind, and at Agra, Mïrzâpur, Jabalpur, Warangal in the Deccan, Malabar, and Masulipatam. Velvet carpets are also made at Benares and Murshidâbâd, and silk pile carpets at Tanjore and Salem. At the London Exhibition of 1851 the finest Indian rugs came from Warangal, the ancient capital of the Andhra dynasty, about 80 miles east of Hyderabad. Their characteristic feature was the exceedingly fine count of the stitches, about 12,000 to the square foot. “They were also perfectly harmonious in colour, and the only examples in which silk was used with an entirely satisfactory effect” (Birdwood). The price was not less than £10 per square yard. The common rugs, produced in enormous quantities in the jails at Lahore, Jabalpur, Mïrzâpur, Benares, and Bangalore, sell in England at 7s. 6d. each.

Gold and silver and jewels, both from their colour and their intrinsic value, have always been the favourite material of Oriental ornament. Even the hill tribes of Central India and the Himalayas have developed some skill in hammering silver into brooches and torques. Imitation of knotted grass and leaves seems to be the origin of the simplest and most common form of gold ornament, the early specimens consisting of thick gold wire twisted into bracelets, &c. A second archaic type of decoration is to be found in the chopped gold jewellery of Guzerat. That is made of gold lumps, either solid or hollow, in the form of cubes and octahedrons, strung together on red silk. Of artistic jeweller’s work, the best known examples come from Trichinopoli, Cuttack, Delhi, and Kashmir. Throughout southern India the favourite design is that known as swdmi, in which the ornamentation consists of figures of Hindu gods in high relief, either beaten out from the surface or fixed upon it by solder or screws. The hammered repoussé silver work of Cutch (Kachhch), though now entirely naturalized, is said to be of Dutch origin. Similar work is done at Lucknow and Dacca. The goldsmith’s art contributes largely to embroidery, as has already been mentioned. Gold and silver thread is made by being drawn out under the application of heat. The operation is performed with such nicety that one rupee’s worth of silver will make a thread nearly 800 yards long. Before being used in the loom this metallic thread is generally twisted with silk.

Precious stones are lavishly used by Indian jewellers, who care less for their purity and commercial value than for the general effect produced by a blaze of splendour. “But nothing can exceed the skill, artistic feeling, and effectiveness with which gems are used in India both in jewellery proper and in the jewelled decoration of arms and jade” (Birdwood).

Iron Work.— The chief duty of the village smith is, of course, to make the agricultural implements for his fellowvillagers. But in many towns in India, often the sites of former capitals, iron work, especially in the manufacture of arms, still retains a high degree of artistic excellence.

Cutlery.— The blade of the Indian talvvdr or sword is sometimes marvellously watered, and engraved with date and name, sometimes sculptured in half-relief with hunting scenes, sometimes shaped along the edge with teeth or notches like a saw. Matchlocks and other firearms are made at several towns in the Punjab and Sind, at Monghyr in Bengal, and at Vizianâgaram in Madras. Chain armour, fine as lacework and said to be of Persian origin, is still manufactured in Kashmir, Râjputâna, and Cutch (Kachhch). Ahmadnagar in Bombay is famous for its spear-heads. Both firearms and swords are often damascened in gold, and covered with precious stones. In fact, the characteristic of Indian arms, as opposed to those of other Oriental countries, is the elaborate goldwork hammered or cut upon them and the unsparing use of gems. Damascening on iron and steel, known as kuft, is chiefly practised in Kashmir, and at Guzerat and Siâlkot in the Punjab. Damascening in silver, which is chiefly done upon bronze, [9:12:763] is known as bidari work, from the ruined capital of Bidar in the nizâm’s dominions, where it is still chiefly carried on.

Brass and Copper.— The village brazier, like the village smith, manufactures the necessary vessels for domestic use. Chief among these vessels is the lota, or globular bowl, universally used in ceremonial ablutions. The form of the lota, and even the style of ornamentation, has been handed down unaltered from the earliest times. Benares enjoys the first reputation in India for work in brass and copper. In the south, Madura and Tanjore have a similar fame; and in the west, Ahmadâbâd, Poona, and Nâsik. At Bombay itself large quantities of imported copper are wrought up by native braziers. The temple bells of India are well known for the depth and purity of their note. In many localities the braziers have a special repute either for a peculiar alloy or for a particular process of ornamentation. Silver is sometimes mixed with the brass, and in rarer cases gold. The brass or rather bell-metal ware of Murshidâbâd, known as khdgrai, has more than a local reputation, owing to the large admixture of silver in it.

Pottery is made in almost every village, from the small vessels required in cooking to the large jars used for storing grain, and occasionally as floats to ferry persons across a swollen stream. But, though the industry is universal, it has hardly anywhere risen to the dignity of a fine art. Sind is the only province of India where the potter’s craft is pursued with any regard to artistic considerations; and there the industry is said to have been introduced by the Mahometans. Sind pottery is of two kinds, encaustic tiles and vessels for domestic use. In both cases the colours are the same,—turquoise blue, copper green, dark purple, or golden brown, under an exquisitely transparent glaze. The usual ornament is a conventional flower pattern, pricked in from paper and dusted along the pricking. The tiles, which are evidently of the same origin as those of Persia and Turkey, are chiefly to be found in the ruined mosques and tombs of the old Musalmân dynasties; but the industry still survives at the little towns of Saidpur and Bubri. Artistic pottery is made at Hyderabad, Karachi, Tatta, and Hâla, and also across the border, at Lahore and Mùltân in the Punjab. The Madura pottery also deserves mention from the elegance of its form and the richness of its colour. The North-Western Provinces have, among other specialties, an elegant black ware with designs in white metal worked into its surface.

Carving and Inlaying.— Stone sculpture is an art of the highest antiquity in India, as may be seen in the early memorials of Buddhism. Borrowing an impulse from Greek exemplars, the Buddhist sculptors at the commencement of our era freed themselves from the Oriental tradition which demands only the gigantic and the grotesque, and imitated nature with some success. But with the revival of Brahmanism Hindu sculpture again degenerated; and so far as the art can still be said to exist, it possesses a religious rather than an aesthetic interest. In the cities of Guzerat, and in other parts of India where the houses are built of wood, their fronts are ornamented with elaborate carving. Wood-carving, an important industry in Western India, is said, perhaps erroneously, to owe its origin to Dutch patronage, though the models of the carvers are evidently taken from their own temples. The favourite materials are blackwood, sandal-wood, and jack-wood. The supply of sandal-wood comes from the forests of the Western Ghâts in Kânara and Mysore, but some of the finest carving is done at Surat and Ahmadâbâd. Akin to sandal-wood carving is the inlaying of the miscellaneous articles known as “Bombay boxes.” This art is known to be of modern date, having been introduced from Shiraz in Persia towards the close of the last century. It consists of binding together in geometrical patterns strips of tin-wire, sandal-wood, ebony, ivory, and stag’s horn. At Vizagapatam, in Madras, similar articles are made of ivory and stag’s horn, with scroll-work edged in to suit European taste. At Mâinpuri, in the North-Western Provinces, wooden boxes are inlaid with brass wire. The chief seats of ivory-carving are Amritsar, Benares, Murshidâbâd, and Travancore, where any article can be obtained to order, from a full-sized palanquin to a lady’s comb. Human figures in clay, dressed to the life, are principally made at Krishnagar in Bengal, Lucknow, and Poona.

It remains to give some account of those manufactures proper, conducted by steam machinery and under European supervision, which have rapidly sprung up in certain parts of India during the past few years. These comprise cotton, jute, silk, and beer.

The first mill for the manufacture of cotton yarn and cloth by machinery worked by steam was opened at Bombay in 1854. The enterprise grew with scarcely a check, until by 1879 the total number of mills throughout India was 58, with about 1⅛ million spindles and 12,000 looms, giving employment to upwards of 40,000 persons—men, women, and children. Of this total, 30 mills, or more than half, were in the island of Bombay, which now possesses a busy manufacturing quarter with tall chimney stalks, recalling the aspect of a Lancashire town; 14 were in the cotton-growing districts of Guzerat, also in the Bombay presidency; 6 were in Calcutta and its neighbourhood; 3 at Madras; 2 at Cawnpur in the North-Western Provinces; 1 at Nagpur in the Central Provinces; 1 at Indore, the capital of Holkar’s dominions; and 1 at Hyderabad, the residence of the nizam. Like the jute mills of Bengal, the cotton factories of Bombay have suffered of late years from the general depression of trade.

The Indian mills are, almost without exception, the property of joint-stock companies, the shares in which are largely taken up by natives. The overlookers are skilled artisans brought from England, but natives are now beginning to qualify themselves for the post. The operatives are all paid by the piece; and, as compared with other Indian industries, the rate of wages is high. In 1877, at Bombay, boys earned from 14s. to £1 a month; women, from 16s. to £1; and jobbers, from £3 to £6, 10s. Several members of one family often work together, earning among them as much as £10 a month. The hours of work are from six in the morning to six at night, with an hour allowed in the middle of the day for meals and smoking. A Factory Act, to regulate the hours of work for children and young persons and to enforce the fencing of dangerous machinery, &c., is now (1881) under the consideration of the legislative council.

Besides supplying the local demand, these mills are gradually beginning to find a market in foreign countries, especially for their twist and yarn. Between 1872-73 and 1878-79 the export of twist from Bombay increased from 1,802,863 ff>, valued at £97,162, to 21,271,059 ⅛>, valued at £883,665, or an increase of nearly twelvefold in quantity and ninefold in value. Within the same period of èight years the export of grey piece-goods increased from 4,780,834 yards, valued at £75,495, to 14,993,336 yards, valued at £198,380. The twist and yam are mostly sent to China and Japan, the piece-goods to the coast of Arabia and Africa. The figures for the coasting trade also show a corresponding growth, the total value of twist carried from port to port in 1878-79 having been £804,996, and of piece-goods (including hand-loom goods) £654,553. Mr 0 r Conor, who has devoted much attention to the matter, thus summarizes his opinion regarding the future of the Indian cotton mills in his Review of Indian Trade for ∖ ST1-Ι⅛ “Whether we can hope to secure an export trade or not, it is certain that there is a sufficient outlet in India itself for the manufactures of twice fifty mills; and, if the industry is only judiciously managed, the manufactures of our mills must inevitably, in course of time, supersede Manchester goods of the coarser kinds in the Indian market.”

The jute mills of Bengal have sprung up to rival Dundee, just as Bombay competes with Manchester; but in the former case the capital is mostly supplied by Europeans. They cluster thickly round Calcutta, extending across the river into Hooghly district; and one has been planted at Sirajganj, far away up the Brahmaputra in the middle of the jute-producing country. In 1879 the total number of jute mills in India was 21, of which all but two were in Bengal, and the number is annually increasing. The weaving of jute into gunny cloth is an indigenous industry throughout northern Bengal, chiefly in the district of Puraiah and Dinâjpur. The gunny is made by the semi-aboriginal tribe of Koch, Rajbansi or Pâli, both for clothing and for bags; and, as with other industries practised by non-Hindu races, the weavers are the women of the family, and not a distinct caste. In 1877-78 just three million bags were imported into Calcutta from Pâbnâ district, being the product of the Sirajganj mills. The total exports by sea and land of both power-loom and hand-made bags numbered 80 millions, of which not more than 6 millions were hand-made. The East Indian Railway[9:12:764] took 20 millions for the grain marts of Behar and the NorthWestern Provinces (chiefly Patna and Cawnpur); and 1 million went as far as Ludhiana in the Punjab. The total exports by sea exceeded 57 millions, of which 32 millions represent interportal, and 25 millions foreign trade. Bombay took as many as 16 millions, and British Burmah 12 millions. In fact, Calcutta supplies bagging for the whole of India. The foreign trade may be given in greater detail, for gunny weaving is perhaps the single Indian industry that aims at a foreign market. The total export of jute manufactures (both bags and cloth) in 1872-73 was valued at £200,669. By 1878-79 the value had risen to £1,098,434, or an increase of fivefold in six years. Within the same period the exports to the United Kingdom alone increased from 21,200 bags, valued at £585, to 7 million bags, valued at £184,400. The other countries which take Indian gunny bags are the following, with the values for 1877-78:—Australia, £298,186; Straits Settlements, £161,772; United States, £79,795; Egypt, £76,726; China, £32,121.

Brewing has recently become established as a prosperous business at the large hill stations on the Himalayas. There are now about twelve breweries in India, including five in the Punjab and NorthWestern Provinces, at Mari (Murree), Simla, Kasauli, Masuri (Mus-soorie), and NâiniTâl, and two in the Madras presidency, at Utakamand and Bellaτy. The total quantity of beer brewed was returned at 2,162,888 gallons in 1877 and 1,522,769 gallons in 1878, the diminution being due to the termination of a contract between the Commissariat Department and one of the Masuri breweries. The total quantity of beer imported in 1878-79 was 2 million gallons by Government and 1 million gallons on private account, so that the Indian breweries now satisfy just one-third of the entire demand. At Simla imported beer sells at over 18s. per dozen, while that from the local brewery can be obtained for Ils. per dozen. The hops are entirely imported, for the experimental plantation of 100 acres established by the râjâ of Kashmir has not yet proved a practical success. The imports of hops show a steady increase from 1529 cwts. in 1875—76 to 1807 cwts. in 1876—77, and 2135 cwts. in 1877-78.

The steam paper-mills established in the neighbourhood of Calcutta and at Bombay have almost entirely destroyed the local manufactures of paper which once existed in many parts of the country. The hand-made article, which was strong though coarse, and formed a Mahometan specialty, is now no longer used for official purposes. Besides manufacturing munitions of war, the Government possesses a large leather factory at Cawnpur, which turns out saddlery, &c., of excellent quality. Indeed, leather manufactures are an important local industry in Oudh and the NorthWestern Provinces, and are conducted on such a scale as to preclude the import from England, except in the case of articles de luxe. Minerals.

The Indian peninsula, with its wide area and diversified features, supplies a great store of mineral wealth, characterized both by variety and unusual richness. In utilizing this wealth, English enterprise has met with many rebuffs. Much capital has been expended with no other result in many cases than disappointment. But the experience has not been thrown away; and the mining industry, now established on a sure basis, is rising into an important position in a country which ought gladly to welcome any employment other than the universal pursuit of agriculture.

Iron.— In purity of ore, and in antiquity of working, the iron deposits of India probably rank first in the world. They are to be found in every part of the country, from the northern mountains of Assam and Kurnaun to the extreme south of the Madras presidency. Wherever there are hills, iron is found and worked to a greater or less extent. The indigenous methods of smelting the ore, which are everywhere the same, and have been handed down unchanged through countless generations, yield a metal of the finest quality in a form well suited to native wants. But they require an extravagant supply of charcoal; and even with the cheapness of native labour the product cannot compete in price with imported iron from England. European enterprise, attracted by the richness of the ore and the low rate of wages, has repeatedly tried to establish ironworks on a large scale; but hitherto every one of these attempts has ended in failure, alike in Madras, in the Central Provinces, in the Râniganj coal-field, and in Kumâun. At the present time iron is manufactured only by peasant families of smelters, each working on a very small scale; and even this industry is languishing under the competition of English imports. The initial difficulty in India is to find the three elements of iron working— namely, the ore, the flux, and the fuel—sufficiently near to each other; the second difficulty is the choking of the furnaces from the excessive quantity of ash in the coat

Coal has been known to exist in India since 1774, and is said to have been worked as far back as 17 75. There are now altogether fifty-eight collieries in the country, with an annual out-turn of about 1 million tons. In India, as elsewhere, coal-mining and railway extension have gone hand in hand. Coal is comparatively worthless unless it can be brought to market by rail; and the price of coal is the chief element in determining the expenses of railway working. The history of coal in India has, on the whole, been one of continual progress. The first mine, at Râniganj, dates from 1820, and has been worked regularly up to the present time. In 1878 its output was 50,000 tons. For twenty years no new mine was opened; but the commencement of the East India Railway in 1854 gave a fresh impetus to the industry, and since that date collieries have been opened at the rate of two or three every year. The largest number of additions was seven, in 1874. By 1878 the total number of collieries in connexion with the East Indian system was fifty-six. From these are supplied, not only the railway itself, but also the jute mills of Calcutta, and the river steamers of Lower Bengal. In 1877-78 the railway used 308,000 tons of coal from its own collieries at Karharbâri and Srirâmpur, and sent exactly the same quantity to Calcutta. In that year the imports of coal into Calcutta by sea were only 80,000 tons, so that Calcutta now uses about 80 per cent, of Indian to 20 per cent, of foreign coal. Bombay, on the other hand, and also Madras are entirely supplied with coal from England. The collieries in the Central Provinces, which are the only others worked on a large scale, are limited to the supply of the Great Indian Peninsula Railway. They are two in number,—(1) the Warora colliery, under the management of the Public Works Department, and (2) the Mohpâni colliery, which has been leased to the Narbadâ Coal Company. The total area of the Râniganj coal-field has been estimated at 500 square miles. In this “black country” of India, which is dotted with tall chimney-stalks, six European companies are at work, besides many native firms. At first coal was raised from surface quarries, but regular mining is now carried on, according to the system of “pillar and stall.” The seams are entirely free from gas, so that the precautions usual in England against explosion are found unnecessary. The miners are all drawn from the aboriginal low-castes, chiefly Santâls and Bauris, who are noted for their endurance and docility. Bauris work with the pick, but Santâls will consent to use no other tool than the crowbar. Wages are high, and the men look well-fed, though they waste their surplus earnings in drink. The great drawback of Indian coal is its large proportion of ash, varying from 14 to 20 per cent., as against 3 to 6 per cent, in English coal. This places it at a great disadvantage alike for iron-smelting and locomotive purposes. But it has been proved that, with efficient firegrates and proper manipulation, 135 lb of Warora coal will do the work of 100 ft> of English coal.

Salt, an article of supreme necessity to the Indian peasant who eats no meat, is derived from three main sources, exclusive of importation from Europe :—(1) by evaporation from sea-water along the entire double line of seaboard from Bombay to Orissa, but especially in Guzerat and on the Coromandel coast; (2) by evaporation from inland lakes, of which the Sâmbhar Lake in Râjputâna affords the chief example; (3) by quarrying solid hills of salt in [9:12:765] the north-east of the Punjab. The last is the only case in which salt can be said to exist as a mineral. It occurs in solid cliffs, which for extent and purity are stated to have no rival elsewhere in the world. The chief of these has given its name to the Salt Range, running across the districts of Jhelum (Jhilam) and Shâhpur, from the bank of the Jhelum river to Kâlàbâgh in Bannu district. Similar deposits are found beyond the Indus in Kohât district, where the salt is of two kinds, red and green, and in the hill state of Mandi bordering on Kângrâ district. The salt is found in the red marls and sandstones of the Devonian group. In some cases it can be obtained from open quarries; but more generally it is approached by regular mining by pick and blasting, through wide galleries. The principal mine is at Keora in Jhelum district, now called after Lord Mayo. The total annual out-turn in the Punjab is returned at about 50,000 tons, yielding a revenue to Government of more than .£400,000. In 1877-78 the actual figures of revenue were—(1) from the Salt Range, .£426,000, (2) from Kohat, £8000, (3) from Mandi, £6000.

In southern India salt made by evaporation is almost universally consumed. Lower Bengal, especially eastern Bengal, uses salt imported from Cheshire at low rates of freight, and paying the excise duty at Calcutta or other port of entry. In Orissa and south-western Bengal both imported salt and salt made by solar evaporation are consumed, the latter being alone considered pure for religious purposes or for the priests.

Saltpetre.— At one time India had almost a monopoly of the supply of saltpetre upon which Europe depended for its gunpowder. In combination with other saline substances it occurs as a white efflorescence upon the surface of the soil in many parts of the country, especially in the upper valley of the Ganges. Its preparation leaves common salt as one of the residuary products; and consequently fiscal reasons have tended to limit the manufacture to the most remunerative region, which is found in North Behar. The manufacture is simple, and entirely in the hands of a special caste of natives, called Nuniyâs, who are conspicuous for their capacity of enduring hard work. As is the case with most Indian industries, they work under a system of money advances from middle-men, who are themselves sub-contractors under the large houses of business. In former times the East India Company engaged in the manufacture on its own account; when it abandoned all private trade, its works were taken over by European firms, but these have in their turn retired from the business, which is now in a state of decline, partly owing to the general fall in price, and partly to the restrictions imposed by the salt preventive department. The exports of saltpetre from Calcutta are fairly constant, averaging about 450,000 cwts. a year, of which one-half goes to the United Kingdom. More than two-thirds of the total comes from Behar, chiefly from the districts of Tirhût, Sâran, and Champâran, though Patnâ is the railway station for despatch to Calcutta. Cawnpur, Ghâzipur, Allahâbâd, and Benares, in the North-Western Provinces, send small quantities, while a little comes from the Punjab.

Gold exists in many parts and probably in considerable quantities. Herodotus affirms that the Indians were the only nation who paid their tribute to Darius in gold; and there is some reason for believing that the “Ophir” of King Solomon is to be identified with the Malabar coast. Nearly every hill stream is washed for gold, whether in the extreme south, in the central plateau, or on the north-east and northwest frontiers. It is true that gold-washing is everywhere a miserable business, affording the barest livelihood; but yet the total amount of gold obtained in this way cannot be insignificant. In recent years attention has been prominently drawn to the possibility of extracting gold from the quartz formation of southern India, which bears many points of resemblance to the auriferous quartz reefs of Australia. The principal localities are in the Wainâd (Wynaad) subdivision of the Nilgiri district and in Kolâr district of Mysore. Gold-washing has always been practised there; and the remains of old workings show that at some unknown period operations have been conducted on a large scale.

From about 1875 to 1880 individual pioneers were prospecting in that region. Crushing the quartz by rude native methods, they proved that it contained a larger proportion of gold than is known to yield a profit in Australia. These experiments on the southern ends of six reefs yielded an average of 7 dwts. per ton of quartz, rising in one case to 11 dwts. The best assay of the gold showed a fineness of slightly over 20 carats. In 1879 Government summoned a practical mining engineer from Australia, whose report was eminently hopeful. He described the quartz reefs as of great extent and thickness and highly auriferous. One reef in Kolar, laid bare 100 feet longitudinally, gave an average of 1 oz. of gold per ton. In order to attract capital, Government proposed to grant mining leases at a dead rent of Rs. 5 (10s. ) per acre, subject to no royalty or further tax. Up to 1880 the enterprise had scarcely passed beyond the stage of laboratory experiments. If the results of actual working with elaborate machinery realize the promise held out by competent investigators, gold-mining will be established as an important industry in southern India.

Copper is known to exist in many parts of the country in considerable quantities. The richest mines are in the lower ranges of the Himalayas, from Dâijiling westward to Kumâun. The ore occurs in the form of copper pyrites, often accompanied by mundic, not in true lodes, but disseminated through the slate and schist. The miners arc almost always Nepâlïs, and the remoteness of the situation has deterred European capital. The extent of abandoned workings proves that these mines have been known and worked for many years. The best seams show a proportion of copper slightly above the average of Cornish ore, but the ordinary yield is not more than about 4 per cent. The mines resemble magnified rabbit-holes, meandering passages being excavated through the rock with little system. The tools used are an iron hammer and chisel, and sometimes a small pick. After extraction, the ore is pounded, washed, and smelted on the spot. The price obtained for the metal is Rs. 2.8.0 per 3 sers, or at the rate of about lOd. a pound. Copper-ore, of fair purity and extending over a considerable area, also occurs in Singbhùm district of Chutiâ Nâgpur, where there are many deserted diggings and heaps of scoriae. In 1857 a company was started to re-open the workings at these mines; but, though large quantities of ore were produced, the enterprise did not prove remunerative, and was finally abandoned in 1864. A similar attempt to work the copper found in Nellore district of Madras also ended in failure.

Lead occurs in the form of sulphuret or galena along the Himalayas on the Punjab frontier, and has been worked at one place by an English company.

Tin is confined to the Burmese peninsula. Very rich deposits, yielding about 70 per cent, of metal, occur over a large extent of country in Mergui and Tavoy districts o£ the Tenasserim region. The ore is washed and smelted, usually by Chinese, in a very rough and unscientific way. Recent experiments made by a European firm seem to show that the deposits, though rich and extensive, are not sufficiently deep to repay more elaborate processes.

Antimony, in the form of surmd, which is largely used by the natives as a cosmetic, is chiefly derived from the hill states of the Punjab. It is also found in Mysore and Burmah. The minerals of Râjputâna, which have not yet been thoroughly ascertained, include an ore of cobalt used for colouring enamel.

Petroleum is produced chiefly in Independent Burmah, but it has also been found on British territory in Pegu, in [9:12:766] Assam, and in the Punjab. Near the village of Ye-nang-yaung in Upper Burmah, on the banks of the Irawadi, there are upwards of one hundred pits or wells with a depth of about 250 feet, from which petroleum bubbles up in inexhaustible quantities. The annual yield is estimated at 11,000 tons, of which a considerable quantity is exported. Petroleum wells are also found in the British districts of Akyab, Kyouk-hpyu, and Thayet-myo, which first attracted British capital with most promising results in 1877. In Assam petroleum occurs in the neighbourhood of the coalfields in the south of Lakhimpur district, and was worked in conjunction with the coal by a European capitalist in 1866. In the Punjab petroleum is worked by the Public Works Department at two spots in Râwal Pindi district. In 1873-74 the total yield was only 2756 gallons.

Stone.— The commonest and also the most, useful stone of India is kaιιkar, a nodular form of impure lime, which is found in almost every river valley, and is used universally for metalling the roads. Lime for building is derived from two sources,—(1) from burning limestone and kankar, and (2) from the little shells so abundantly found in the marshes. Calcutta derives its chief supply from the quarries of the Khâsi hills in Assam, known as “Sylhet lime,” and from the Susunia quarries in Bankura district. The Gangetic delta is destitute of stone, nor does the alluvial soil afford good materials for brick-making or pottery. But a European firm has recently established large pottery-works at Râniganj in Bardwân, which employ about five hundred hands, and carry out contracts for drainage pipes and stoneware. The centre of the peninsula and the hill country generally abound in building-stone of excellent quality, which has been used locally from time immemorial. Among the finest stones maybe mentioned the pink marble of Râjputâna, of which the historical buildings at Agra were constructed, the trap of the Deccan, the sandstone of the Godâvari and the Narbadâ, and the granite of southern India. Quarries of slate are scattered through the peninsula, and are sometimes worked by European capital. Mica and talc are also quarried to make ornaments. Among the hills of Orissa and Chutiâ Nâgpur household vessels and ornaments are skilfully carved out of an indurated variety of potstone.

Precious Stories.— Despite its legendary wealth, which is really due to the accumulations of ages, India cannot be said to be naturally rich in precious stones. Under the Mahometan rule diamonds were a distinct source of state revenue; and Akbar is said to have received a royalty of £80,000 a year from the mines of Panna. But at the present day the search for them, if carried on anywhere in British territory, is an insignificant occupation. The name of Golconda has passed into literature; but that city, once the Musalmân capital of the Deccan, was rather the home of diamond-cutters than the source of supply. It is believed that the far-famed diamonds of Golconda actually came from the sandstone formation which extends across the south-east borders of the nizâm’s dominions into the Madras districts of Ganjâm and Godâvari. A few worthless stones are still found in that region. Sambalpur, on the upper channel of the Mahânadi river in the Central Provinces, is another spot once famous for diamonds. So late as 1818 a stone is said to have been found there weighing 84 grains and valued at £500. The river valleys of Chutiâ Nâgpur are also known to have yielded a tribute of diamonds to their Mahometan conqueror. At the present day the only place where the search for diamonds is pursued as a regular industry is the native state of Panna (Punnah) in Bundelkhand. The stones are found by digging down through several strata of gravelly soil and washing the earth. Even there, however, the pursuit is understood to be unremunerative, and has failed to attract· European capital. About other gems little information is available. ( Turquoises are said to be found near Mültân in the Pun-g jab, though far inferior to the Persian stones. Independent Burmah yields many valuable gems; and some excitement has been caused by the discovery of sapphire mines just across the Siamese frontier. Poor pearl fisheries exist off the coast of Madura district in the extreme south, and in the Gulf of Cambay; but the great majority of Indian pearls come either from Ceylon or from the Persian Gulf. In the year 1700 the Dutch obtained a lease of all the pearl fisheries along the Madura coast, and sublet the right of fishing to native boatmen, of whom seven hundred are said to have taken licences annually at the rate of 60 ecus per boat. The town of Cambay in Guzerat is celebrated for its carving in carnelian, agate, and onyx. The stones come from the neighbourhood of Ratanpur, in the state of Râjpipla. They are dug up by Bhil miners, and subjected to a process of burning before being carved. The most valued colour for carnelians is red, but they are also found white and yellow. Lapis lazuli is found in the mountains of the north, and freely used in the decoration of temples and tombs.

Famines.

As the agriculture of India is mainly dependent upon the bounty of nature, so is it peculiarly exposed to the vicissitudes of the seasons. In any country where the population is dense and the means of communication backward, the failure of a harvest, whether produced by drought, by flood, by blight, by locusts, or by war, must always cause much distress. Whether that shall develop into famine is merely a matter of degree, depending upon a combination of circumstances—the comparative extent of the failure, the density of the population, and the practicability of imports.

Drought, or an inadequate supply of rain, is undoubtedly the great cause of wide-spread famine. No individual foresight, no compensating influences, can entirely prevent those recurring periods of continuous drought with which large provinces of India are afflicted. An average rainfall, if irregularly distributed, may affect the harvest to a moderate degree, as also may flood or blight. The total failure of a monsoon may result in a general scarcity, sufficiently severe to arouse the solicitude of Government. But famine proper, or wide-spread starvation, is caused only by a succession of years of drought. The cultivators of India are not dependent upon a single harvest or upon the crops of one year. In the event of a partial failure, they can draw for their food supply either upon their own grain pits or upon the stores of the village merchants. The first sufferers, and those who suffer most in the end, are the class who live by daily wages. But small is the number that can hold out, either in capital or credit, against a second year of insufficient rainfall; and not impossibly a third season may prove adverse. AU the great famines in India of which we have record have been caused by drought, and usually by drought repeated over a series of years.

This being so, it becomes necessary to inquire into the water supply, which varies extremely in different parts of the country. It can be derived only from three sources— (1) local rainfall, (2) natural inundation, and (3) artificial irrigation from rivers, canals, tanks, or wells. Any of these sources may exist separately or together. In only a few parts of India can the rainfall be entirely trusted, as both sufficient in its amount and regular in its distribution. Those favoured tracts include the whole strip of coast beneath the Western Ghâts, from Bombay to Cape Comorin; and the greater part of the provinces of Assam and Burmah, together with the deltaic districts at the head of the Bay [9:12:767] of Bengal. There the annual rainfall rarely, if ever, falls below 100 inches; artificial irrigation and famine are alike unknown. The whole of the rest of the peninsula may be described as liable, more or less, to drought. In Orissa, the scene of one of the most severe famines of recent times, the average rainfall exceeds 60 inches a year; in Sind, which has been exceptionally free from famine under British rule, the average falls to less than 10 inches. The local rainfall, therefore, is not the only element to be considered. Broadly speaking, artificial irrigation has protected, or is now in course of protecting, certain fortunate regions, such as the eastward deltas of the Madras rivers and the upper valley of the Ganges. The rest, and by far the greater portion, of the country is still exposed to famine. Nor is it easy to see any remedy. Meteorological science may teach us to foresee what is coming; but it may be doubted whether it is in our power to do more than alleviate. Lower Bengal and Oudh are watered by natural inundation as much as by the local rainfall; Sind derives its supplies mainly from canals filled by the floods of the Indus; the Punjab and the North-West Provinces are dependent largely upon wells; the Deccan with the entire south is the land of tanks and reservoirs. But in all these cases, when the rainfall has failed over a series of years, the artificial supply must likewise fail after no long interval, so that irrigation becomes a snare rather than a benefit. Water works on a scale adequate to guarantee the whole of India from drought are not only above the possibilities of finance; they are also beyond the reach of engineering skill.

Taking the example of the famine of 1876-78, the most • wide spread and the most prolonged that India has yet known, we may say that the drought commenced in Mysore by the failure of the monsoon in 1875, and that all fear of distress in the North-West Provinces did not pass away until 1879. But it will always be known in history as the great famine in the south. Over the entire Deccan, from Poona to Bangalore, the south-west monsoon failed to bring its usual rainfall in the summer of 1876. In the autumn of the same year the north-east monsoon proved deficient in the south-eastern districts of the Madras presidency. The main food crop, therefore, entirely perished throughout an immense tract of country; and, as the harvest of the previous year had also been short, prices rapidly rose to famine rates. In November 1876 it was first officially recognized that starvation was abroad in the land, and that Government must adopt measures to keep the people alive. From that time until the middle of 1878, a period of more than eighteen months, the campaign against famine was strenuously conducted, with various vicissitudes. The summer monsoon of 1877 proved a failure; some relief was brought in October of that year by the autumn monsoon; but all anxiety was not removed until the arrival of a normal rainfall in June 1878. Meanwhile the wave of drought had reached northern India, where it found the stocks of grain much depleted to meet the famine demand in the south. Bengal, Assam, and Burmah were the only provinces that escaped scot free in that disastrous year. The North-West Provinces, the Punjab, Râjputâna, and the Central Provinces alike suffered from drought through all the summer of 1877, and from its consequences well into the following year. When once famine gets ahead of relief operations, all is over. The flood of distress bursts through the embankment. Starvation and all the attendant train of famine diseases sweep away their thousands. The total expenditure of Government upon famine relief on this occasion may be estimated at about 8 millions sterling, not including the indirect loss of revenue nor the amount debited against the state of Mysore. For this large sum of money there is but little to show in the way of works constructed. The largest number of persons in receipt of relief at one time in Madras was 2,591,900 in September 1877; of these only 634,581 were nominally employed on works, while the rest were gratuitously fed. From cholera alone the deaths were returned at 357,430 for Madras, 58,648 for Mysore, and 57,252 for Bombay. Dr Cornish, the sanitary commissioner of Madras, well illustrated the effects of the famine by contrasting the returns of births and deaths over a series of years. In 1876, when famine with its companion cholera was already beginning to be felt, the births registered in Madras numbered 632,113 and the deaths 680,381. In 1877, the year of famine, the births fell to 477,447, while the deaths rose to 1,556,312. In 1878 the results of the famine showed themselves by a still further reduction of the births to 348,346, and by the still high number of 810,921 deaths. In 1879 the births recovered to 476,307, still considerably below the average, and the deaths diminished to 548,158. These figures are, of course, not accurate; but they serve to show how long the results of famine are to be traced in the vital statistics of a people.^[15. With regard to the deaths caused by the famine and the diseases connected with it, the Famine Commissioners thus report:—“It has been estimated, and in our opinion on substantial grounds, that the mortality which occurred in the provinces under British administration during the period of famine and drought extending over the years 1877 and 1878 amounted, on a population of 197 millions, to 5∣ millions in excess of the deaths that would have occurred had the seasons been ordinarily healthy; and the statistical returns have made certain what has long been suspected, that starvation and distress greatly check the fecundity of the population. It is probable that from this cause the number of births during the same period has been lessened by 2 millions; the total reduction of the population would thus amount to about 7 millions. Assuming the ordinary death roll, taken at the rate of 35 per mille, on 190 millions of people, the abnormal mortality of the famine period may be regarded as having increased this total by about 40 per cent.” But when estimated over a period of years the effect of famine as a check upon the population is small. The Famine Commissioners calculate that, taking the famines of the past thirty years, as to which alone an estimateof any value can be made, the abnormal deaths caused by famine and its diseases have been less than 2 per mille of the Indian population per annum. As a matter of fact cultivation quickly extended after the famine of 1877-78, and there were in Bombay and Madras 120,000 more acres under tillage after the long protracted scarcity than before it.]

The first great famine of which we have any trustworthy record is that which devastated the lower valley of the Ganges in 1769-70. One-third of the population is credibly reported to have perished. The previous season had been bad; and, as not uncommonly happens, the break-up of the drought was accompanied by disastrous floods. Beyond the importation into Calcutta and Murshidabad of a few thousand ma∕ιmds of rice from the fortunate districts of Bâkarganj and Chittagong, it does not appear that any public measures for relief were taken or proposed. The next great famine was that which afflicted the Carnatic from 1780 to 1783, and has been immortalized by the genius of Burke. It was primarily caused by the ravages of Hyder Ali’s army. A public subscription was organized by the Madras Government, from which sprang the “Monegar Choultry,” or permanent institution for the relief of the native poor. In 1783-84 Hindustan Proper suffered from a prolonged drought, which stopped short at the frontier of British territory. Warren Hastings, then governor-general, advocated the construction of enormous granaries, to be opened only in times of necessity. One of these granaries or golàs stands to the present day in the city of Patna, but it was never used until thé scarcity of 1874. In 1790-92 Madras was again the scene of a two years’ famine, which is memorable as being the first occasion on which the starving people were employed by Government on relief works. No useful lesson of administrative experience is to be learned from the long list of famines and scarcities which afflicted the several provinces of India at recurring periods during the first half of the present century. In 1860-61 a serious attempt was made to alleviate an exceptional distress in the North-Western Provinces. About half a million persons are estimated to have been relieved at an expenditure by Government of about three quarters of a million sterling. Again, in 1865-66, which will ever be known as the year of the Orissa famine, the Government attempted to organize relief works and distribute charitable funds. But on neither of these occasions can it be said that the efforts were successful. In Orissa, especially, the admitted loss of one-fourth of [9:12:768] the population proves the danger to which an isolated province is exposed. The people of Orissa died because they had no surplus stocks of grain of their own, and because importation was absolutely impracticable. Passing over the prolonged drought of 1868-7θ in the North-West Provinces and Râjputâna, we come to the Behar scarcity of 1873-74, which first attracted the interest of England. Warned by the failure of the rains, and watched and stimulated by the excited sympathy of the public at home, the Government carried out in time a comprehensive scheme of relief. By the expenditure of 6⅛ millions sterling, and the importation of one million tons of rice, all risk even of the loss of life was prevented. The comparatively small area of distress, and the facilities of communication by rail and river, alone permitted the accomplishment of the feat, which remains unparalleled in the annals of famine. During the recent famine in southern India the authorities worked with no less energy, and charitable bounty was far more conspicuous, yet the conditions of the case predestined failure. The stricken tract was many times larger than Behar. No early warning was given. The rainfall failed, not once, but for three successive seasons, and, above all, adequate importation and distribution of grain were physical impossibilities. The people were dying while the grain that could have kept them alive was rotting on the beach of Madras or on the railway sidings of Upper India. What administrative enterprise can accomplish where the circumstances are within the compass of human control may be learned from the case of Bombay. In that presidency the famine affected about 34,000 square miles of country, with a population of about 5,000,000 souls. The highest number of persons in receipt of relief at one time· was 529,000 in June 1877, of whom the great majority were employed on remunerative works. The importation of grain was left entirely free; and within twelve months 268,000 tons were brought by rail and 166,000 tons by sea into the distressed districts. The total gross cost to Government was estimated at 1⅛ millions, of which about 1 million will be returned.

Administration.

The supreme authority over all British India, both for executive and legislative purposes, is vested by a series of Acts of Parliament^[16. The chief of these Acts are 13 Geo. III. c. 63; 33 Geo. III. c. 52; 3 and 4 Will. IV⅛ c. 85; 21 and 22 Vict. c. 106; and 24 and 25 Vict. c. 67.] in the viceroy or governor-generalin-council, subject to the ultimate sanction of the secretary of state in England. Every executive order and every legislative statute runs in the name of the “Governor-Generalin-Council”;^[17. A style first authorized by 33 Geo. III. e. 52, § 39.] but in certain exceptional classes of cases^[18. “Cases of high importance and essentially affecting the public interest and welfare” (33 Geo. III. c. 52, § 47); “when any measure is proposed whereby the safety, tranquillity, or interests of the British possessions in India may in the judgment of the governor-general be essentially affected” (3 and 4 Will. IV. c. 85, § 49); “cases of emergency” (24 and 25 Vict. c. 67, § 23).] a power is reserved to the viceroy to act independently of his council. This council is twofold. First, there is the ordinary or executive council,^[19. The lineal descendant of the original council organized under the charters of the Company, first constituted by parliamentary sanction in 1773 (13 Geo. III. c. 63, § 7).] usually composed of. about six official members besides the viceroy, which may be compared with the cabinet of a constitutional country. It meets regularly at short intervals, discusses and decides upon questions of foreign policy and domestic administration, and prepares measures for the legislative council. Its members divide among themselves the chief departments of state, such as those of foreign affairs, finance, war, public works, &c.; while the viceroy combines in his own person the duties both of constitutional sovereign and prime minister. Secondly, there is the legislative council,^[20. Originally identical with the executive council, upon which legislative powers were conferred by 13 Geo. III. c. 63, § 36. The distinction between the two councils was first recognized in the appointment of “the fourth member” (3 and 4 Will. IV. c. 85, § 40).] which is constituted by the same members as the preceding, with the addition of the governor of the province in which it may be held, and official delegates from Madras and Bombay, together with certain nominated members representing the non-official native and European communities. The meetings of the legislative council are held when and as required. They are open to the public; and a further guarantee for publicity is insured by the proviso that draft bills must be published a certain number of times in the Gazette. As a matter of practice, these draft bills have usually been first subjected to the criticism of the several provincial governments. In regard to the supreme judicial authority there is no such uniform system. The presidencies of Madras and Bombay, and also two of the three great provinces which have been created out of the old presidency of Bengal, and are now known as the lieutenant-governorships of Bengal and the North-Western Provinces, have each a high court,^[21. First constituted out of the Supreme Courts and the Sudder (Sa<b) Courts in 1861 (24 and 25 Vict. c. 104).] supreme both in civil and criminal business, with an ultimate appeal to the judicial committee of the privy council in England. Of the subordinate provinces, the Punjab has a chief court, with three judges; the Central Provinces, Oudh, Mysore, and Berar have each a judicial commissioner, who sits alone; while in Assam and British Burmah the chief commissioner, or supreme executive ofiicer, is also the highest judicial authority.

The law administered in the Indian courts consists mainly of (1) the enactments of the Indian legislative councils above described and of the bodies which preceded them, (2) statutes of the British parliament which apply to India, (3) the Hindu and Mahometan laws on domestic inheritance or other cases affecting the Hindus and Mahometans, and (4) the customary law affecting particular castes and races. Much has been done towards consolidating individual sections of the Indian law; and in the Indian penal code, together with the codes of civil and criminal procedure, we have memorable examples of such efforts.

But, though the governor-general-in-council is theoretically supreme over every part of India alike,^[22. Will. IV. c, 85, §§ 39 and 65.] his actual authority is not everywhere exercised in the same direct manner. For ordinary purposes of administration British India is partitioned into provinces, each with a government of its own; and certain of the native states are attached to those provinces with which they are most nearly connected geographically. These provinces, again, enjoy various degrees of independence, in accordance with the course of their historical development. The two sister presidencies of Madras and Bombay still retain many marks of their original equality with Bengal. They each have an army and a civil service of their own. They are each administered by a governor appointed direct from England, with an executive and a legislative council, whose functions are analogous to those of the councils of the governorgeneral.^[23. Vict. c. 67, § 42.] They thus possess a domestic legislature; and in administrative matters, also, the interference of the viceroy is a somewhat remote contingency. Of the other provinces, Bengal, or rather Lower Bengal, occupies a peculiar position. Like the North-Western Provinces and the Punjab, it is administered by a single official, with the style of lieutenant-governor, who is controlled by no executive council; but, unlike those two provinces, Bengal has a legislative council, so far preserving a sign of its early preeminence. The remaining provinces, whether ruled by a lieutenant-governor or by a chief commissioner, may be regarded from an historical point of view as fragments of the original Bengal presidency, which as thus defined would be co-extensive with all British India that is not appropriated either to Madras or to Bombay. The lieutenant-governors and most of the chief commissioners are chosen from the covenanted civil service. In executive matters they are the practical rulers; but, excepting the lieutenant-governor of Bengal, they have no legislative authority. To complete[9:12:769] the total area of territory under British administration, it is necessary to add certain ⅛wαs∕-provinces, under the immediate control of the viceroy. These consist of Ajmir (Ajmere), transferred from Râjputàna; Berar, or the districts assigned by the nizâm of Hyderabad; the state of Mysore, to be restored in 1881 upon terms to its native râjâ; and the tiny territory of Coorg, in the extreme south.

Another difference of administration, though now of less importance than in former times, derives its name from the old regulations, or uniform rules of law and practice which preceded the present system of acts of the legislature. These regulations, originally intended to be universal in their application, have been from time to time withdrawn so far as regards certain tracts of country which from their backward state of civilization or other causes seemed to require exceptional treatment. In non-regulation territory, broadly speaking, a larger measure of discretion is allowed to the officials, both in the collection of revenue and in the administration of civil justice; strict rules of procedure yield to the necessities of the case, and the judicial and executive departments are to a great extent combined in the same hands. Closely connected with this indulgence in favour of the personal element in administration, a wider field is also permitted for the selection of the administrative staff, which is not confined to the covenanted civil service, but includes military officers on the staff and also uncovenanted civilians. The title of the highest authority in a non-regulation district is not that of collector-magistrate, but deputy commissioner; and the supreme authority in a non-regulation province is usually styled, not lieutenant-governor, but chief commissioner. The Central Provinces and British Burmah are examples of non-regulation provinces; but non-regulation districts are to be found also in Bengal and the North-Western Provinces, where their existence can always be traced by the office of deputy commissioner

Alike in regulation and in non-regulation territory the unit of administration is the district,—a word of very definite meaning in official phraseology. The district officer, whether known as collector-magistrate or as deputy commissioner, is the sole responsible head of his jurisdiction

Upon lιis energy and character rests ultimately the effiriency of the Indian Government. Not only are his own special duties so numerous and so vast as to be bewildering to the outsider, but the work of his subordinates, European and native, largely depends upon the stimulus of his personal example. His position has been compared to that of the French préfet ; but such a comparison is un just in many ways to the Indian district officer: he is not a creature of the Home Office, who takes his colour from his chief and represents only officialism, but an active worker in every department of popular well-being, with a large measure of individual initiative. As the very name of collector-magistrate implies, his main functions are twofold. He is a fiscal officer, charged with the collection of the revenue from land and other sources; and he is a civil and criminal judge of first instance. But this explanation of his title by no means exhausts his multifarious duties. He does in his local sphere all that the home secretary is supposed to do in England, and a great deal more; for he is the representative of a paternal and not of a constitutional government. Police, jails, education, municipalities, roads, sanitation, dispensaries, are all to him matters øl daily concern; while, in addition, he is expected to make himself acquainted with every phase of the social life of the natives and with each natural aspect of the country. Besides being a lawyer, an accountant, and a clerk, he ought also to possess no mean knowledge of agriculture, political economy, and engineering.

The total number of districts in British India is two hundred and thirty-eight. They vary greatly in size and in number of inhabitants. The average area is 3778 square miles, ranging from an average of 6612 square miles in Madras to an average of 1999 square miles in Oudh. The average population is 802,927, similarly ranging from an average of 1,508,219 in Madras to an average of 161,597 in Burmah, The Madras districts are thus both the largest and tu« most populous. In every province but Madras, the districts are grouped into larger areas, known as divisions, each under the charge of a commissioner. But these divisions are not properly units of administration, as the districts are. They are aggregates of units, formed only for convenience of supervision, so that an intermediate authority may exercise the universal watchfulness which would be impossible for a distant lieutenant-governor. The districts are again partitioned out into lesser tracts, which are strictly units of administration, though subordinate ones. The system of partitioning, and also the nomenclature, vary in the different provinces; but generally it may be said that the subdivision or tahsil is the ultimate unit of administration. The double name indicates the twofold principle of separation: the subdivision is properly the charge of an assistant magistrate or executive officer, the tahsil is the charge of a deputy-collector or fiscal officer; and these two offices may or may not be in the same hands. Broadly speaking, the subdivision is characteristic of Bengal, where revenue duties are in the background, and the tahsil of Madras, where the land settlement requires attention year by year. There is no administrative unit below the subdivision or tahsil. The thdmd, or police division, only exists for police purposes. The pargand, or fiscal division under native rule, has now but an historical interest. The village still remains as the agricultural unit, and preserves its independence for revenue purposes in certain parts of the country. The township is peculiar to Burmah.

The judicial jurisdictions coincide for the most part with the magisterial and fiscal boundaries. But, except in Madras, where the districts are large, a single civil and sessions judge, i.e., the supreme judicial officer under the high court, sometimes exercises jurisdiction over more than one district. As has been already mentioned, in non-regulation territory judicial and executive functions are combined in the same hands.

The preceding sketch of Indian administration would be incomplete without a reference to the secretariat, or central office, which in some sense controls and gives life to the whole. From the secretariat are issued the orders which regulate or modify the details of administration; into the secretariat come all the multifarious reports from the local officers, to be there digested for future reference. But though the secretaries may enjoy the advantages of life at the presidency capitals, with higher salaries and better prospects of promotion, it is recognized that the efficiency of the empire rests ultimately upon the shoulders of the district officers, who bear the burden and heat of the day, with few opportunities of winning fame or reward.

Land Settlement.— As the land furnishes the main source of Indian revenue, so the assessment of the land tax is the main work of Indian administration. No technical term is more familiar to Anglo-Indians, and none more strange to the English public, than that of land settlement. No subject has given rise to more voluminous controversy. It will be enough in this place to explain the general principles upon which the system is based, and to indicate the chief differences of application in the several provinces, That the state should appropriate to itself a direct share in the produce of the soil is a fundamental maxim of Indian finance, that has been recognized throughout the East from time immemorial. The germs of rival systems can be traced in the old military and other service tenures of Assam, and in the poll tax of Burmah, <kc. The exclusive development of the land system is due to two conditions,—a comparatively high state of agriculture and an organized plan of administration,—both of which are supplied by the primitive village community. During the lapse of untold genera tions, despite domestic anarchy and foreign conquest, the Hindu village has in many parts preserved its simple customs, written in the imperishable tablets of tradition. The land was not held by private owners, but by occupiers under [9:12:770] the petty corporation; the revenue was not due from individuals, but from the community represented by its headman. The aggregate harvest of the village fields was thrown into a common fund, and before the general distribution the head-man was bound to set aside the share of the state. No other system of taxation could be theoretically more just, or in practice less obnoxious to the people. Such is an outline of the land system as it may be found at the present day throughout large portions of India both under British and native rule; and such we may fancy it to have been universally before the Mahometan conquest. The Musalmâns brought with them the avarice of conquerors, and a stringent system of revenue collection. Under the Mughal empire, as organized by Akbar the Great, the share of the state was fixed at one-third of the gross produce of the soil; and a regular army of tax-collectors was permitted to intervene between the cultivator and the supreme government. The entire vocabulary of the present land system is borrowed from the Mughal administration. The· zaminddr himself is a creation of the Mahometans, unknown to the early Hindu system. He was originally a mere taxcollector, or farmer of the land revenue, who agreed to furnish a lump sum from the tract of country assigned to him. If the Hindu village system may be praised for its justice, the Mughal farming system had at least the merit of efficiency. Shah Jâhân and Aurangzeb extracted a larger land revenue than the British do. When the government was first undertaken by the East India Company, no attempt was made to understand the social system upon which the land revenue was based. The zaminddr vfvs> conspicuous and useful; the village community and the cultivating rayat did not force themselves into notice. The zaminddr seemed a solvent person, capable of keeping a contract; and his official position as tax-collector was confused with the proprietary rights of an English landlord. The superior stability of the village system was overlooked, and in the old provinces of Bengal and Madras the village organization has gradually been suffered to fall into decay. The consistent aim of the British authorities has been to establish private property in the soil, so far as is consistent with the punctual payment of the revenue. The annual Government demand, like the succession duty in England, is universally the first liability on the land; when that is satisfied, the registered landholder has powers of sale or mortgage scarcely more restricted than those of a tenant in fee-simple. At the same time the possible hardships, as regards the cultivator, of this absolute right of property vested in the owner have been anticipated by the recognition of occupancy rights or fixity of tenure, under certain conditions. Legal rights are everywhere taking the place of unwritten customs. Land, which was before merely a source of livelihood to the cultivator and of revenue to the state, has now become the subject of commercial speculation. The fixing of the revenue demand has conferred upon the owner a credit which he never before possessed, by allowing him a certain share of the unearned increment. This credit he may use improvidently, but none the less has the land system of India been raised from a lower to a higher stage of civilization.

The means by which the land revenue is assessed is known as settlement, and the assessor is styled a settlement officer. In Bengal the assessment has been accomplished once and for all, but throughout the greater part of the rest of India the process is continually going on. The details vary in the different provinces; but, broadly speaking, a settlement may be described as the ascertainment of the agricultural capacity of the land. Prior to the settlement is the work of survey, which first determines the area of every village and frequently of every field also. Then comes the settlement officer, whose duty it is to estimate the character of the soil, the kind of crop, the opportunities for irrigation, the means of communication and their probable development in the future, and all other circumstances which tend to affect the value of the produce. With these facts before him, he proceeds to assess the Government demand upon the land according to certain general principles, which may vary in the several provinces. The final result is a settlement report, which records, as in a Domesday Book, the entire mass of agricultural statistics concerning the district.

Lower Bengal and a few adjoining districts of the North-Western Provinces and of Madras have a permanent settlement, i,e., the land revenue has been fixed in perpetuity. When the Company obtained the diwdni or financial administration of Bengal in 1765, the theory of a settlement, as described above, was unknown. The existing Mahometan system was adopted in its entirety. Engagements, sometimes yearly, sometimes for a term of years, were entered into with the zaminddrs to pay a lump sum for the area over which they exercised control. If the offer of the zaminddr was not deemed satisfactory, another contractor was substituted in his place. But no steps were taken, and perhaps no steps were possible, to ascertain in detail the amount which the country could afford to pay. For more than twenty years these temporary engagements continued, and received the sanction of Warren Hastings, the first titular governor-general of India. Hastings’s great rival, Francis, was among those who urged the superior advantages of a permanent assessment. At last, in 1789, a more accurate investigation into the agricultural resources of Bengal was commenced, and the settlement based upon this investigation was declared perpetual by Lord Cornwallis in 1793. The zaminddrs of that time were raised to the status of landlords, with rights of transfer and inheritance, subject always to the payment in perpetuity of a rent-charge. In default of due payment, their lands were liable to be sold to the highest bidder. The aggregate assessment was fixed at sikkd Rs. 26,800,989, equivalent to Co.’s Rs. 28,587,722, or say 2∣ millions sterling. By the year 1871-72 the total land revenue realized from the same area had increased to Rs. 35,208,866, chiefly owing to the inclusion of estates which had escaped the original assessment for various reasons. While the claim of Government against the zaminddrs was thus fixed for ever, it was intended that the rights of the zaminddrs ovqt their own tenants should be equally restricted. But no detailed record of tenant-right was inserted in the settlement papers, and, as a matter of fact, the cultivators lost rather than gained in security of tenure. The same English prejudice which made a landlord of the zaminddr could recognize nothing but a tenant-at-will in the rdyat. By two stringent regulations of 1799 and 1812 the tenant was practically put at the mercy of a rack-renting landlord. If he failed to pay his rent, however excessive, his property was rendered liable to distraint and his person to imprisonment. At the same time the operation of the revenue sale law had introduced a new race of zaminddr», who were bound to their tenants by no traditions of hereditary sympathy, but whose sole object was to make a profit out of their newly purchased property. The rack-rented peasantry found no protection in the law courts until 1859, when an Act was passed which restricted the land-' lord’s powers of enhancement in certain specified cases. The zaminddr is the only person recognized by the revenue law; but in a large number of cases the zaminddr has in effect parted with all his interest in the land by means of the creation of perpetual leases or patnis. These leases are usually granted in consideration of a premium or lump sum paid down, and there is nothing to prevent the patnidar from creating an indefinite series of sub-tenures beneath his own. The permanent settlement was not preceded by any systematic survey. But in the course of the past thirty years the whole of Bengal has been subject to a professional survey, which determined the boundaries of every village, and issued maps on the scale of 4 inches to the mile.
[9:12:771]

This survey, however, has only a topographical value. No statistical inquiries were made, and no record obtained of rights in the soil. Even the village landmarks then set up have fallen into decay.

The permanent settlement was confined to the three provinces of Bengal, Behar, and Orissa, according to their boundaries at that time. Orissa Proper, which was conquered from the Marhattâs in 1803, is subject to a temporary settlement, of which the current term of thirty years will not expire until 1897. The assessment is identical with that fixed in 1838, which was based upon a careful field measurement and upon an investigation into the rights of every landholder and under-tenant. The settlement, however, was made with the landholder, and not with the tenant, and in practice the rights of the cultivators are no more secure than in Bengal. In Assam Proper, or the valley of the Brahmaputra, the system of settlement is simple and effective. The cultivated area is artificially divided into mauzds or blocks, over each of which is placed a native official or mauzdddr. Every year the mauzdddr ascertains the area actually under cultivation, and then assesses the fields according to their character, at a certain prescribed rate.

The prevailing system throughout the Madras presidency is the rdyatwdri, which takes the cultivator or peasant proprietor as its rent-paying unit, somewhat as the Bengal system takes the zaminddr. This system cannot be called indigenous to the country, any more than the zaminddη of Bengal. If any system deserves that name, it is that of village assessment, which still lingers in the memories of the people in the south. When the British declared themselves heir to the nawâb of the Carnatic at the opening of the present century, they had no adequate experience of revenue management. The authorities in England favoured the zaminddri system already at work in Bengal, which appeared at least calculated to secure punctual payment. The Madras Government was accordingly instructed to enter into permanent engagements with zaminddrs, and, where no zaminddrs could be found, to create substitutes out of enterprising contractors. The attempt resulted in failure in every case, except where the zaminddrs happened to be the representatives of ancient lines of powerful chiefs. Several of such chiefs exist in the extreme south and in the north of the presidency. Their estates have been guaranteed to them on payment of a peshkash or permanent tribute, and are saved by the custom of primogeniture from the usual fate of subdivision. Throughout the rest of Madras there are no zaminddrs either in name or fact. The influence of Sir Thomas Munro afterwards led to the adoption of the rdyatwdri system, which will always be associated with his name. According to this system, an assessment is made with the cultivating proprietor upon the land taken up for cultivation year by year. Neither zaminddr nor village officer intervenes between the cultivator and the state, which takes directly upon its own shoulders all a landlord’s responsibility. The early rdyatwdri settlements in Madras were based upon insufficient experience. They were preceded by no survey, but adopted the crude estimates of native officials. Since 1858 a department of revenue survey has been organized, and the old assessments have been everywhere revised.

Nothing can be more complete in theory and more difficult of exposition, than a Madras ràyatwdrî settlement. First, the entire area of the district, whether cultivated or uncultivated, and of each field within the district is accurately measured. The next step is to calculate the estimated produce of each field, having regard to every kind of both natural and artificial advantage. Lastly, a rate is fixed upon every field, which may be regarded as roughly equal to one-third of the gross and one-half of the net produce. The elaborate nature of these inquiries and calculations may be inferred from the fact that as many as thirty-five different rates are sometimes struck for a single district, ranging from 6d. to £1, 4s. per acre. The rates thus ascertained are fixed for a term of thirty years; but during that period the aggregate rent-roll of a district is liable to be affected by several considerations. New land may be taken up for cultivation, or old land may be abandoned; and occasional remissions are permitted under no less than eighteen specified heads. Such matters are discussed and decided by the collector at the jamahandi or court held every year for definitely ascertaining the amount of revenue to be paid by each ràyat for the current season. This annual inquiry has sometimes been mistake⅛by careless passers-by for an annual reassessment of each rdyat’s holding. It is not, however, a change in the rates for the land which he already holds, but an inquiry into and record of the changes in his former holding or of any new land which he may wish to take up.

In the early days of British rule no system whatever prevailed throughout the Bombay presidency; and even at the present time there are tracts where something of the old confusion survives. The modern “survey tenure,” as it is called, dates from 1838, when it was first introduced into one of the tdlukas of Poona district, and it has since been gradually extended over the greater part of the presidency. As its name implies, the settlement is preceded by survey. Each field is measured, and an assessment placed upon it according to the quality of the soil and the crop. This assessment holds good, without any possibility of modification, for a term of thirty years. The average rate varies from a maximum of 4s. 6d. an acre in the rich black soil lands of Guzerat to a minimum of lOd. an acre in the barren hills of the Concan.

The primary characteristic of the Bombay system is its simplicity. The field is the unit., and its actual occupier is the only person recognized by the revenue law. He knows exactly what he will have to pay, and the state knows what it will receive, during the currency of the term. The assessment is, in fact, a rent-charge liable to be modified at intervals of thirty years. Secondly, the system is characterized by its fairness to the tenant. He possesses “a transferable and heritable property, continuable without question at the expiration of a settlement lease, on his consenting to the revised rate.” To borrow a metaphor from English law, his position has been raised from that of a villein to that of a copyholder. In exchange for the mere leave to exist and till the soil he has received a right of property in the soil he tills, and he stands forth a free man. If the Bombay peasants have not reaped all the advantages from this system that might have been hoped for, the fault rests, not with the system, but with themselves. They were unequal to the responsibilities of property which they had not won by their own exertions, but which the state (perhaps prematurely) cast upon them.

The North-Western Provinces and the Punjab have a similar land system. In that part of India the village community has preserved its integrity more completely than elsewhere. Government therefore recognizes the village, and not the zaminddr's estate or the rdyat's field, as the unit of land administration. Throughout the North Western Provinces, indeed, the village is commonly owned by proprietors with the title of zaminddrs whereas in the Punjab the community is still the proprietor. But this is a distinction of tenure rather than of administration. In both cases alike the state recognizes only the village, and makes its arrangement with the owners of the village, whether they be one or many, whether they be individuals, a corporation, or a bhdydchdra (brotherhood). The survey there becomes a more comprehensive undertaking than in Madras or Bombay. In addition to measurement, and agricultural appraisement and calculation, it includes the duty of drawing up an exhaustive record of all rights and sub-tenures existing in every village. The proprietors are alone responsible for the revenue; but, when the state limits its claims against them, it is no less careful to define at the same time the rights of other parties interested in the soil. The term of settlement both in the NorthWestern Provinces and in the Punjab is thirty years. The principle of assessment is that the Government revenue shall be equal to one-half of the improved rent, leaving the other half as the share of the landlord, who is liable for due payment, and has the trouble of collecting it from the [9:12:772] cultivators. The average rate of assessment is about 2s. lid. per acre in the North-Western Provinces, and Is. 4d. in the Punjab.

The Oudh talukdärs resemble English landlords even more closely than do the zamindärs of Bengal. In origin the majority were not revenue-farmers, but territorial magnates, whose influence was derived from feudal authority as much as from mere wealth. Their present legal status dates from the pacification that followed on the mutiny of 1857. The engagement then entered into has been described as a political treaty rather than a revenue assessment. The great tdlukdars were invited to become responsible each for a gross sum payable from the territory over which he exercised feudal rights. This sum was fixed in perpetuity; and the exceptional position of the talukdars was recognized by conferring upon them, not only the right of succession by primogeniture, but also the privilege of bequest,—a privilege unknown alike to Hindu and Mahometan law. Land not comprised in tdlukdarι estates was settled in the ordinary way with its proprietors or zaminddrs for a term of thirty years. The whole of Oudh has since been accurately surveyed.

The Central Provinces contain many varieties of land tenure, from the feudatories, who pay only a light tribute, to the village communities, who are assessed in the usual manner after survey. Population is sparse and agriculture backward, so that the incidence of land revenue is everywhere low. The survey was conducted generally on the Punjab system, adopting the village and not the field as the unit of measurement. The current settlement for a term of thirty years will expire in 1897.

' In 1873-74 the total land revenue realized from territory under British administration in India amounted to £20,919,256, which is raised to £22,768,144 by the inclusion of certain local rates and cesses levied on land. This latter figure shows an average of 9 ’ 4d. per acre of gross area and 2s. 4 - 7d. per head of total population. The highest rate of assessment appears to be that in Bombay, which is 3s. 10 ’ 4d. per head; the lowest, Is. 2 , 7d. per head in Bengal and Assam.

Salt Administration.— Next to land, salt contributes the largest share to the Indian revenue; and, where salt is locally manufactured, its supervision becomes an important part of administrative duty. Up to within quite recent times the tax levied upon salt varied extremely in different parts of the country, and a strong preventive staff was required to be stationed along a continuous barrier hedge, which almost cut the peninsula into two fiscal sections. The reform of Sir J. Strachey in 1878, by which the higher rates were reduced and the lower rates raised, with a view to their ultimate equalization over the whole country, effectually abolished this old engine of oppression. Communication is now free; and it has been found that prices are absolutely lowered by thus bringing the consumer nearer to his market, even though the rate of taxation be increased. In the Punjab and Râjputâna salt administration has thus become, as in Lower Bengal, a simple matter of weighing quantities and levying a uniform tax. In Bombay, also, the manufacture is now conducted with a minimum of expense at large central dépôts in Guzerat under a thorough system of excise supervision. Along the western coast, however, from Orissa to Cape Comorin, the process of evaporating sea-water is everywhere carried on as a private industry, though on Government account. As with poppy cultivation in Bengal, the manufacture of salt is a monopoly, which can only be defended by the peculiar circumstances of the case. No one is compelled to manufacture, and rights of property in a salt-pan are strictly respected, while the state contrives, by means of a careful staff of supervisors, to obtain the maximum of profit with a minimum of interference. The system as at present carried on has been gradually developed out of the experience of nearly a century. The manufacturers belong to the same class as ordinary cultivators; and, as a rule, their condition is somewhat more prosperous, for they possess an hereditary privilege with a commercial value. They do not work upon a system of advances, as is the case with so many other Indian industries; but they are paid at a certain rate when they bring their salt to the Government dépôt. This rate of payment, known as kudivaram, is at present fixed at an average of 1 dnna 5 ’ 8 pies per maund of 82γ ft>; the other expenses of the salt department, for supervision, &c., raise the total cost to 3 dnnds 5 ’ 6 pies per maund. The price now charged to the consumer by the Madras Government is Rs. 2.8.0 per maund, the balance being net profit. The equal rate of salt duty which will ultimately prevail throughout all India is Rs. 2.8.0 per maund, or 7s. a cwt. This rate is already (1881) levied in Madras, Bombay, the North-Western Provinces, and the Punjab, but in Bengal a higher rate is provisionally in force of Rs. 2.14.0 per maund, or 8s. a cwt. In British Burmah only 3 dnnds per maund, or 6d. a cwt., is charged for local consumption, and a transit duty of 1 per cent, ad valorem for salt sent across the frontier.

Excise.— Excise, like salt, is not only a department of revenue collection, but also to a great extent a branch of the executive. In other words, excise duties in India are not a mere tax upon lhe consumer, levied for convenience through the manufacturer and retail dealer, but a species of Government monopoly. The only excisable articles are intoxicants and drugs; and the avowed object of the state is to check consumption not less than to raise revenue. Details vary in the different provinces, but the general plan of administration is the same. The right to manufacture and the right to retail are both monopolies of Government permitted to private individuals only upon terms. Distillation of country spirits is allowed according to two systems,—either to the highest bidder under strict supervision, or only upon certain spots set apart for the purpose. The latter is known as the sαdr or central distillery system. The right of sale is also usually farmed out to the highest bidder, subject to regulations fixing the minimum quantity of liquor that may be sold at one time. The brewing of beer from rice and other grains, which is universal among the hill tribes and other aboriginal races, is practically untaxed and unrestrained. The European breweries recently established at several hill stations pay a tax at the rate of 6d. a gallon. Apart from spirits, excise duties are levied upon the sale of a number of intoxicating or stimulant drugs, of which the most important are opium and gàvjà or bhang.· Opium is issued for local consumption in India from the Government manufactories at Patna and Benares, and sold through private retailers at a monopoly price. This drug is chiefly consumed in Assam, Burmah, and the Punjab. Gdnjd is an intoxicating preparation made from the flowers and leaves of Indian hemp (Cannabis sativa, var. indica). The cultivation of hemp for this purpose is almost confined to a limited area in Rajshahi district, Bengal, and to the farther valleys of the Himalayas, whence the drug is imported under the name of charas. Its abuse is sometimes a cause, not only of crime, but also of insanity. Government attempts to ch< ck consumption—first, by fixing the retail duty at the highest rate that will not encourage smuggling, and, secondly, by continually raising that rate as experience allows. Scientifically speaking, gdnjd consists of the flowering and fruiting heads of the female plant; bhang or siddhi, of the dried leaves and small stalks, with a few fruits; while charas is the resin itself, collected in various ways as it naturally exudes. No duty whatever is now levied upon tobacco in any part of India. The plant is universally grown by the cultivators for their own smoking, and, like everything else, was subject to taxation under native rule; but the impossibility of accurate excise supervision has caused the British Government to abandon the impost.

The municipalities at present existing in India are a creation of the legislature and a branch of the general system of administration. Their origin is to be traced, not in the native panchdyat, but in the necessity for relieving the district officer of some of the details of his woιk. The panchdyat or elective council of five is one of the institutions most deeply rooted in the Hindu mind. By it the village community was governed, the head-man being only the executive official, not the legislator or judge; by it all caste dis putes were settled; by it traders and merchants were organized into powerful guilds, to the rules of which even European outsiders have had to submit; by it the Sikh army of the khdlsd was despotically governed, when the centralized system of Ranjit Sinh fell to pieces [9:12:773] at his death. But the Hindu village organization had been greatly broken up under Mughal rule. The modern municipal committee is a body appointed by Government, on the nomination of the collector, to assist iιi∣∣> in the discharge of his local duties, and to assess new modes of taxation. Police, roads, and sanitation are the three main objects for which a municipality is constituted. Outside a municipality these objects are (in different provinces) the care of the collector, of some member of his subordinate staff, or of a local fund board. Within municipal limits they are delegated to a committee, who practically derive their authority from the collector’s sanction, implied or expressed. Except in the great towns, the municipalities cannot be said to enjoy any of the attributes of corporate life. However, as education advances, and with it the desire and capacity of self-government, the municipal committee will doubtless form the germ from which free local institutions will in the future be developed. In 1876-77, excluding the three presidency capitals, there were altogether 894 municipalities in British India, with 12,381,059 inhabitants, or just 7 per cent, of the total population. Out of an aggregate number of 7519 members of municipal committees concerning whom information is available, 1794 were Europeans and 5725 natives; 1863 were ex-officio, 4512 nominated, and 1144 elected,—the last class being almost confined to the North-Western and Central Provinces. The financial statistics of these municipalities are given in a subsequent section.

Imperial Finance.— It is impossible to present a concise view ' of Indian finance, such as shall be at once accurate and intelligible.

In the first place, the aggregate figures of revenue and expenditure are officially returned according to a system which, though necessary for purposes of account, usually misleads the English financier. T ie whole system of administration is based upon the view that the British power is a paternal despotism, which owns, in a certain sense, the entire soil of the country, and whose duty it is to perform the various functions of a wealthy and enlightened proprietor. In addition, it takes on itself the business of a manufacturer and trader on a grand scale, as in the case of opium and salt. All these considerations tend to swell the totals on both sides of the balance-sheet with large items, which, on strict analysis, ought to be eliminated as mere matters of account. The actual taxation on the people of British India for 1878, as will be shown below, was 34f millions, or under 3s. 8d. per head of the population. In the second place, the methods of keeping the public accounts have been subjected to frequent changes during recent years, to such an extent as to render comparative statements of totals valueless.

The following table, which has been compiled from the Parliamentary Abstract for 1877-78, exhibits the gross imperial revenue and expenditure of India for that year, according to the system of accounts adopted at the time. For the reasons already given, it is practically impossible to analyse these statements in such a way as to show the actual amount raised by taxation, and the actual amount returned in protection to person and property. It is equally impossible to compare the totals with those for previous years. The only profitable plan is to take some of the items and explain their real meaning.
[table]

Revenue.— It will be seen from the above statement that the larger portion of the gross revenue is not derived from taxation at all. Public works, including railways, alone yield about 7.⅛ millions sterling, or nearly 13 per cent, of the total. If we add the items of post office and telegraphs, which also represent payment for work done or services supplied, the proportion rises to nearly 14 per cent. Then the sum of 9 millions gross, or 6⅜ millions net, derived , 01 P 0 pium, being somewhat more than an additional 15 per cent, of the gross revenue, is admitted to be no charge upon the native tax-payer, but a voluntary contribution to the Indian exchequer by the Chinese consumer of the drug. Nearly one-third of the total gross revenue is thus accounted for. The land revenue, amounting to just 20 millions in an exceptionally bad year, cannot be passed over so lightly. Whether it should be properly regarded as a tax, or only as rent, is an abstruse problem for political economists to settle; but, in any case, it is paid without question, as an immemorial perquisite of the state. It yields 34 per cent, or more than one-third of the gross revenue. The importance of the land tax from the point of view of administration has been considered in a previous section. Setting aside provincial rates and assessed taxes as insignificant in theiι∙ amount and variable in their incidence, we are left with four principal headings,—excise, customs, salt, and stamps,—which together constitute the indisputable taxation of the people. The total amount yielded by these four items is just 14$ millions, being nearly 25 per cent., or one-fourth of the whole. Salt alone yields 6⅜ millions, or 11 per cent. On the total population of 191 millions, the gross revenue of 59 millions shows an incidence of 6s. 2 jd. per head. The land tax alone shows an incidence of 2s. l∣d. per head, the four taxes proper of Is. 61d. per head. The whole revenue of British India of the nature ot actual taxation, including land revenue, excise, assessed taxes, provincial rates, customs, salt, and stamps, amounted in 1878 to £34,883,586, or 3s. 7∣d, per head. The rate was about 4s. per head in 1880.

Of the four items, excise and stamps are both almost entirely creations of British rule. Excise is simply a tax upon intoxicating liquors and deleterious drugs, levied both on the manufacture and on the sale, according to different systems in different provinces. Like the corresponding duty in England, it is voluntarily incurred, and presses hardest upon the lowest classes. But, unlike the English excise, it can hardly be called an elastic source of revenue, for the rate is intentionally kept so high as to discourage consumption. No duty whatever is levied upon tobacco. Stamps, as in England, is an ambiguous item. The greater part is derived from fees on litigation, and only a comparatively trifling amount from stamps proper on deeds of transfer, &c. Customs are divided into import and export duties, both of which have been so greatly lightened in recent years that their permanent maintenance must be considered doubtful. At the present time (1881) import duties, usually at the rate of 5 per cent, ad valorem, are levied upon a comparatively long list of commodities, of which the chief are cotton goods above a certain degree of fineness. All duties on exports have now been removed, with the single exception of that on rice, which brings in about £500,000 a year. That is levied at the rate of 3 ànnds a maund, or about 6d. per cwt., being equivalent to an ad valorem rate of about 10 per cent. India, including Burmah, possesses a practical monopoly of the supply of rice to Europe, and therefore the tax falls upon the consumer· rather than upon the native producer. The salt tax is a matter of more importance and of greater difficulty. As an impost upon an article of prime necessity, and as falling with greatest severity upon the lowest classes, it violates the elementary rules of political economy. On the other hand, it may be urged that this tax is familiar to the people, and levied in a manner which arouses no discontent, and that it is the only means available of spreading taxation proper over the community. Recent reforms have tended to equalize the incidence of the salt tax over the entire country, with the immediate result of abolishing arbitrary and vexatious customs lines, and with a view to its ultimate reduction.

Expenditure^— Putting aside the cost of collection and civil administration, which explainthemselves, the most important items of expenditure are army, interest on debt, famine relief, loss by exchange, and public works, to which may be added the complex item of payments in England. Military expenditure averages fully 16 millions a year, being thus considerably more than the whole amount obtained from taxation proper. Of this total, about 12 millions represent payments in India, and 4 millions payments in England; On non-effective services nearly 2 millions are expended in England and less than £700,000 in India. Regimental pay accounts for nearly 7 millions, the commissariat for about 2 millions in India, and stores for another million in England. In 1877-78 the total capital of the Indian debt was returned at over 146$ millions sterling, being just 15s. 4d. per head of the population. The total charge for interest was 5 millions, being at the rate of £3, 14s. 4d. per cent.; but this excludes the interest to be credited against expenditure on reproductive public works, which is entered under another heading. In 1840 the debt amounted to only 30 millions, but it gradually increased to 52 millions in 1857. Then came the Mutiny, which added 42 millions of debt in four years. The rate of increase was again gradual but slow till about 1874, when famine relief conspired with public works to cause a rapid augmentation, which has continued to the present time. The most significant feature in that augmentation is the larger proportion of debt contracted in England. During the last ten years the silver debt has risen only 10 millions, whereas the gold debt has risen 28 millions. No charge has recently pressed harder upon the Indian, exchequer than that of famine relief. Apart from loss by reduced revenue, the two famines of 1874 and 1877-78 have caused a direct expenditure one haritable and relief works, amounting in the aggregate to nearly 15 millions. Loss by exchange is an item whichnaβ [9:12:774] only lately taken its place in the accounts, and is due to the circumstance that large payments in gold require to be made in England by means of the depreciated rupee. It is, of course, not a matter of expenditure proper, but merely the result of a peculiar mode of book-keeping, which estimates the rupee at the arbitrary value of 2s. In 1869-70 the loss by exchange was more than balanced by an equally nominal entry of gain by exchange on the other side of the ledger. In 1876-77 this item attained its maximum of nearly 1J million net. The expenditure on public works is provided from three sources—(1) the capital of private companies, with a Government guarantee, (2) loans for the construction of railways and canals, (3) current revenue applied towards such works as are considered to be not directly remunerative. In 1877-78 the total capital raised by the guaranteed railway companies was 95⅜ millions, and the net earnings were 5 millions, thus showing on the average a satisfactory balance-sheet. In the ten years ending with 1878 29 millions were expended under the second head upon works classed as reproductive or extraordinary, of which 19 millions were appropriated to state railways and 10 millions to irrigation. The amount spent from revenue upon ordinary public works in 1877-78 was nearly 3∣ millions. The division of the expenditure into that paid in India and that paid in England becomes of importance when it is remembered that the latter portion requires to be provided in gold. In 1877-78, out of the total expenditure of 62⅛ millions, 48.∣ millions, or 78 per cent., were paid in India, and 14 millions, or 22 per cent., in England, including the guaranteed interest of the railway.companies.

Local Finance.— Independent of imperial finance, and likewise independent of certain sums annually transferred from the imperial exchequer to be expended by the provincial governments, there is another Indian budget for local revenue and expenditure. That consists of an income derived mainly from cesses upon land, and expended to a great extent upon minor public works. In 1877—78 local revenue and expenditure were each returned at about 3⅜ millions.

Municipal Finance.— Yet a third budget is that belonging to the municipalities. The three presidency towns of Calcutta, Madras, and Bombay had in 1876-77 a total municipal income of £668,400, of which £519,322. was derived from taxation, being at the rate of 7s. per head of population. In addition, there were 894 minor municipalities, with a total population of 12,381,059. Their aggregate income was £1,246,974, of which £979,088 was derived from taxation, being at the rate of Is. 7d. per head. In the presidency towns, rates upon houses, &c., are the chief source of income; but in the district municipalities, excepting Bengal, octroi duties are more relied upon. On the side of expenditure the chief items are conservancy, roads, and police.

Army.— At the present time (1881) the entire constitution of the Indian army is under the consideration of a commission. The existing organization is based upon the historical division into the three Ïresidencies of Bengal, Madras and Bombay There are still three ndian armies, each composed of both European and native troops, with their own commanders-in-chief and separate staff, though the commander-in-chief in Bengal exercises a supreme authority over the other two. There is also a fourth army, known as the Punjab frontier force, which, though on the Bengal establishment, is under the immediate orders of the lieutenant-governor of the province.

Established Strength of the Indian Army in 1877-78.
[table]

Police.— Excluding the village watch, which is still maintained as a subsidiary force in many parts of the country, the total regular police of all kinds in British India in 1877 consisted of a total strength of 157,999 officers and men, being an average of one policeman to every 7∣ square miles of total area or to every 1096 of the total population. The total cost of maintenance was £2,511,704, of which £2,165,073 was payable from imperial or provincial revenues. The former figure gives an average cost of £3 per square mile of area and 3d. per head of population. The average pay of ∙ach constable was 7 rupees a month, or £8, 8s. a year.

Jails.— In 1877 the total number of places of confinement in British India, including central and district jails and lock-ups, was 636; the total number of prisoners admitted during the year, or remaining over from the previous year, was 587,288; the daily average was 118,456—113,087 males and 5369 females. These figures show 1 male prisoner to every 868 of the male population, 1 female prisoner to every 17,244 of the female population, and 1 prisoner to every 1618 of the total population of both sexes. The Ïlaces of transportation for all British India are the Andaman and Γicobar Islands, where there are two penal establishments; these βontained in 1877 a daily average of 9145 convicts.

Education.

The existing system of education in India is mainly dependent upon the Government, being directly organized by the state, at least in its higher departments, assisted throughout by grants-in-aid, and under careful inspection. But at no period of its history has India been an altogether unenlightened country. The origin of the Deva-Nâgari alphabet is lost in antiquity, though that is generally admitted not to be of indigenous invention. Inscriptions on stone and copper, the palm-leaf records of the temples, and in later days the wide-spread manufacture of paper, all alike indicate, not only the general knowledge, but also the common use, of the art of writing. From the earliest times the caste of Brâhmans has preserved, by oral tradition as well as in MSS., a literature unrivalled alike in its antiquity and in the intellectual subtlety of its contents. The Mahometan invaders introduced the profession of the historian, which reached a high degree of excellence, even as compared with contemporary Europe. Through all changes of government vernacular instruction in its simplest form has always been given, at least to the children of respectable classes, in every large village. On the one hand, the tols or seminaries for teaching Sanskrit philosophy at Benares and Nadiyâ recall the schools of Athens and Alexandria; on the other, the importance attached to instruction in accounts reminds us of the picture which Horace has left of a Roman education. Even at the present day knowledge of reading and writing is, owing to the teaching of Buddhist monks, as widely diffused throughout Burmah as it is in some countries of Europe. English efforts to stimulate education have ever been most successful when based upon the existing indigenous institutions.

During the early days of the East India Company’s rule the promotion of education was not recognized as a duty of Government. The enlightened mind of Warren Hastings did indeed anticipate his age by founding the Calcutta madrasa for Mahometan teaching, and by affording steady patronage alike to Hindu pandits and European students. But Wellesley’s schemes of imperial dominion did not extend beyond the establishment of a college for English officials. Of the Calcutta colleges, that of Sanskrit was founded in 1824, when Lord Amherst was governor-general, the medical college by Lord William Bentinck in 1835, the Hooghly madrasa by a wealthy native gentleman in 1836. The Sanskrit college at Benares had been established in 1791, the Agra college in 1823. Meanwhile the missionaries made the field of vernacular education their own. Discouraged by the official authorities, and ever liable to banishment or deportation, they not only devoted themselves with courage to their special work of evangelization, but were also the first to study the vernacular dialects spoken by the common people. Just as two centuries earlier the Jesuits at Madura, in the [9:12:775] extreme south, composed works in Tamil, which are still acknowledged as classical by native authors, so did the Baptist mission at Serampur, near Calcutta, first raise Bengali to the rank of a literary dialect. The interest of the missionaries in education, which has never ceased to the present day, though now comparatively overshadowed by Government activity, had two distinct aspects. They studied the vernacular, in order to reach the people by their preaching and to translate the Bible; and they taught English, as the channel of non-sectarian learning.

At last the Government awoke to its own responsibility in the matter of education, after the long and acrimonious controversy between the advocates of English and vernacular teaching had worn itself out. The present system dates from 1854, being based upon a comprehensive despatch sent out by Sir C. Wood (afterwards Lord Halifax) in that year. At that time the three universities were founded at Calcutta, Madras, and Bombay; English-teaching schools were established in every district; the benefit of grants-in-aid was extended to the lower vernacular institutions and to girls’ schools; and public instruction was erected into a department of the administration in every province, under a director, with a staff of inspectors. In some respects this scheme may have been in advance of the time; but it supplied a definite outline, which has gradually been filled up with each succeeding year of progress. A network of schools has now been spread over the country, graduated from the indigenous village institutions up to the highest colleges. All alike receive some measure of pecuniary support, which is justified by the guarantee of regular inspection; and a series of scholarships at once stimulates efficiency and opens a path to the university for children of the poor. In 1877-78 the total number of educational institutions of all sorts in British India was G6,202, attended by an aggregate of 1,877,942 pupils, showing an average of one school to every 14 square miles, and nine pupils to every thousand of the population. In the same year the total expenditure upon education from all sources was £1,612,775, of which £782,240 was contributed by the provincial governments, £258,514 was derived from local rates, and £32,008 from municipal grants. These items may be said to represent state aid, while end owments yielded £37,218, subscriptions £105,853, and fees and fines £277,039. The degree in which education has been popularized and private effort has been stimulated may be estimated from the fact that in Bengal the total of voluntary payments now exactly balances the total of Government grants.

Universities.— The three universities of Calcutta, Madras, and Bombay were incorporated in 1857, on the model of the university of London. They are merely examining bodies, composed of a chancellor, vice-chancellor, and senate, with the privilege of conferring degrees in arts, law, medicine, and civil engineering. The governing body, or syndicate, consists of the vice-chancellor and certain members of the senate. Quite recently a fourth university, on the same plan, has been founded at Lahore for the Punjab. Though not themselves places of instruction, the universities control the whole course of higher education by means of their examinations. The entrance examination for matriculation is open to all; but when that is passed candidates for higher stages must enrol themselves in one or other of the affiliated colleges. In the ten years ending 1877-78 9686 candidates successfully passed the entrance examination at Calcutta, 6381 at Madras, and 2610 at Bombay. Many fall off at that stage, and very few’ proceed to the higher degrees. During the same ten years 952 graduated B. Λ., and only 254 Μ. A., with honours, at Calcutta; 496 B.A. and 14 Μ. A. at Madras; 217 B.A. and 28 Μ. A. at Bombay. Calcutta possesses by far the majority of graduates in law and medicine, while Bombay is similarly distinguished in engineering. In 1877—78 the total expenditure on the four universities was £22,093.

The colleges or institutions for higher instruction may be divided into two classes,—those which teach the arts course of the universities, and those devoted to special branches of knowledge. According to another principle, they are classified into those entirely supported by Government and those which only receive grants-in-aid. The latter class comprises the missionary colleges. In 1877-78 the total number of colleges, including medical and engineering colleges and Mahometan madrasas, was 82, attended by 8894 students. Of these, 35 colleges with 3848 students were in Bengal proper, and 21 colleges with 1448 students in Madras. In the same year the total expenditure on the colleges was £186,162, or at the rate of £21 per student.

Boys' Schools.— This large class includes many varieties, which may be subdivided either according to the character of the instruction. givem or according to the proportion of Government aid they receive. The higher schools are those in which not only is English taught, but that language is also the medium of instruction. They educate up to the standard of the entrance examination at the universities, and train generally those candidates who seek employment in the upper grades of Government service. As far as possible one of these schools, known as the zild or district school, is established by Government at the head-quarters of every district, and many others receive grants-in-aid. The middle schools, as their name implies, are intermediate between the higher and the primary schools. Generally speaking, they are placed in the smaller towns and larger villages, and they provide that measure of instruction which is recognized to be useful by the middle classes themselves. Some of them teach English, but others only the vernacular. This class includes the tahsili schools, established at the headquarters of every tahsil or subdivision in the North-Western Provinces. In 1877—78 the total expenditure on both higher and middle schools was £478,250. The lower and primary schools complete the series. They present every degree of efficiency, from the indigenous and unaided village school to the vernacular schools in the presidency capitals. Their extension is the chief test of the success of the educational system. No uniformity prevails in this matter throughout the several provinces. In Bengal up to the last few years primary instruction was sadly neglected; but, since the reforms inaugurated by Sir G. Campbell in 1872, by which the benefit of the grant-in-aid rules was extended to the pdthsàlàs or village schools, this reproach has been removed. In 1871—72 the total number of primary schools under inspection was only 2451, attended by 64,779 pupils. By 1877—78 the number of schools had risen to 16,042, and the number of pupils to 360,322, being an increase of about sixfold in six years. In the latter year the total expenditure from all sources was £78,000, towards which Government contributed only £27,000, thus showing how state aid stimulates private outlay. The North-Western Provinces owe their system of primary instruction to their great lieutenant-governor, Mr Thomason, whose constructive talent can be traced in every department of the administration. In addition to the tahsili or middle schools already referred to, he drew up a scheme for establishing halkabandi or primary schools in every central village (whence their name), to which the children from the surrounding hamlets might resort. His scheme has since been largely developed by means of the educational cess added to the land revenue. In Bombay the primary schools are mainly supported out of local funds raised in a similar manner. In British Burmah, on the other hand, primary education is still left to a great extent in the hands of Buddhist monks, who receive no pecuniary support from Government. The monastic schools are only open to boys, but there are also lay teachers who admit girls to mixed classes. Government has hardly any schools of its own in Burmah, the deficiency being supplied by several missionary bodies, who obtain state aid. In many parts of the Madras presidency, also, the missionaries possess a practical monopoly of education at the present day. In 1877-78 the amount of money expended upon lower and primary schools in British India was £406,135, or just one-fourth of the total educational budget.

Girls’ Schools.— Of late years something has been done, though not much, to extend the advantages of education to girls. In this, as in other educational matters, the missionaries nave been the pioneers of progress. In a few exceptional places, such as Tinnevelli in Madras, the Khâsi hills of Assam, and among the Karen tribes of Burmah, female education has a real existence, for in these places the missionaries have influence enough to overcome the prejudices of the people. But elsewhere, even in the large towns and among the English-speaking classes, all attempts to develop the intelligence of women are regarded with scarcely disguised aversion. Throughout the North-Western Provinces, with their numerous and wealthy cities, and a total female population of 15 millions, only 6550 girls attended school in 1877-78. In Bengal, with just double the inhabitants, the corresponding number was less than 12,000. Madras, British Burmah, and to a small degree Bombay and the Punjab, are the only provinces that contribute to the following statistics in any tolerable proportion:—Total girls’ schools in 1877-78, 2002; number of pupils, 66,615; mixed schools for boys and girls, 2955; pupils, 90,915; total amount expended on girls’ schools, £78,729, of which £27,000 was devoted to the 12,000 girls of Bengal.

Normal and other Special Schools, kc.— Tn 1877—78 the normal and technical sohools numbered 155, with a total of 6864 students; [9:12:776] the total expenditure was £54,260, or an average of nearly £7 per student. School mistresses, as well as masters, are trained in these institutions; and there also the missionaries have shown themselves active in anticipating a work which Government subsequently took up. Of schools of art, the oldest is that founded by Dr A. Hunter at Madras in 1850, and taken in charge by the Education Department in 1856. This school, as also those at Calcutta and Bombay, has been very successful in developing the industrial capacities of the people, and training workmen for public employment. Museums have been established at the provincial capitals and many other large towns. Schools for European and other foreign races have also attracted the attention of Government. In 1877-78 the number of such institutions was 104, with 9121 pupils; the expenditure from all sources was £80,197, or an average of nearly £9 per pupil. Foremost among these are the asylums for the orphans of British soldiers, established at hill stations lp.g. Utakamand and Sanawar) in memory of Sir Henry Lawrence.

Newspapers and Books.— Closely connected with the subject of education is the steady growth of the vernacular press, which is ever busy issuing both newspapers and books. The missionaries were the first to cast type in the vernacular languages, and to employ native compositors. The earliest newspaper was the Bengali Samdchar Darpan, which was issued in 1835 by the Baptist Mission at Serampur. For many years the vernacular press preserved the marks of its origin, by being limited almost absolutely to theological controversy. The missionaries continued their work; and they were encountered with their own weapons by the theistic sect of the Brahma Sanιaj, and also by orthodox Hindus. So late as 1850 the majority of newspapers were still sectarian rather than political, but during the last twenty years the vernacular press has gradually risen to become a powerful engine of political discussion. The number of newspapers regularly published in the several vernaculars at the present time is said to reach the formidable total of 230. The aggregate number of copies issued is estimated by Mr Roper Lethbridge at about 150,000; but the circulation proper, that is, the actual number of readers, is infinitely larger. In Bengal the vernacular press suffers from the competition of English newspapers, some of which are entirely owned and written by natives. In the north-west, from Lucknow to Lahore, about 100 newspapers are printed in Hindustani or Urdu, the vernacular of the Mahometans throughout India. Many of these are conducted with considerable ability and enterprise, and may fairly be described as representative of native opinion in the large towns. The Bombay journals are almost equally divided between Marathi and Guzerathn Those in the former language are characterized by the traditional independence of the race of Sivaji; those in the latter language are the organs of the Parsis and of the trading community. The newspapers of Madras printed in Tamil and Telugu are politically unimpörtant, being still for the most part devoted to religion.

As regards books, or rather registered publications, in the vernacular languages, Bengal takes the lead; while the Punjab, Bombay, the North-Western Provinces, and Madras follow in order. In 1877-78 the total number of registered publications was 4890, of which 544 were in English, 3064 in one of the vernaculars, 719 in a classical language of India, and 563 bilingual. Of the vernacular works, 709 dealt with religion, 663 with poetry and the drama, 330 with language, 195 with science, 181 with fiction, 146 with law, and 95 with medicine.^[28. In the preparation of the administrative sections and statistics, the writer specially acknowledges the assistance of Mr J. S. Cotton.] History. Hon-Aryan or Aboriginal Races.

Our earliest glimpses of India disclose two races struggling for the soil. The one was a fair-skinned people, who had lately entered by the north-western passes—a people of Aryan (literally “noble”) lineage, speaking a stately language, worshipping friendly and powerful gods. The other was a race of a lower type, who had long dwelt in the land, and whom the lordly new-comers drove back before them into the mountains, or reduced to servitude on the plains. The comparatively pure descendants of these two races in India are now nearly equal in number, there being about 18 millions of each; their mixed progeny, sprung chiefly from the ruder stock, make up the mass of the present Indian population.

The lower tribes were an obscure people, who, in the absence of a race-name of their own, are called the nonAryans or aborigines. They have left no written records; indeed, the use of letters, or of the simplest hieroglyphics, was to them unknown. The sole works of their hands which have come down to us are the rude stone circles and upright slabs or mounds beneath which, like the primitive peoples of Europe, they buried their dead. From these we only discover that, at some far distant but unfixed period, they knew how to make round pots of hard, thin earthenware, that they fought with iron weapons, and that they wore ornaments of copper and gold. The coins of imperial Rome have been found in their later graves. Earlier remains, lying in the upper soils of large areas, prove that these ancient tombbuilders formed only one link in a chain of primaeval races. Long before their advent, India was peopled, as far as the depths of the Central Provinces, by tribes unacquainted with the metals, who hunted and warred with polished flint axes and other deftly-wrought implements of stone similar to those dug up in northern Europe. And even these were the successors of yet ruder beings, who have left their agate knives and rough flint weapons in the Narbadâ valley. In front of this far-stretching background of the Bronze and Stone Ages, we see the so-called aborigines being beaten down by the newly arrived Aryan race.

The struggle is commemorated by the two names which the victors gave to the early tribes, namely, the Dasyus, or “enemies,” and the Dâsas, or “slaves.” The last remains to this day the family name of multitudes of the lower class in Bengal. The new-comers from the north prided themselves on their fair complexion, and their Sanskrit word for “colour” (varna) came to mean “race” or “caste.” Their earliest poets, at least three thousand and perhaps four thousand years ago, praised in the Rig-Veda their gods, who, “slaying the Dasyus, protected the Aryan colour, η who “subjected the black-skin to the Aryan man.” Moreover, the Aryan, with his finely-formed features, loathed the squat Mongolian faces of the aborigines. One Vedic singer speaks of them as “noseless” or flat-nosed, while another praises his own “beautiful-nosed” gods. The same unsightly feature was commented on with regard to a non-Aryan Asiatic tribe, by the companions of Alexander the Great on his Indian expedition, at least a thousand years later. The Vedic hymns abound in scornful epithets for the primitive tribes, as “disturbers of sacrifices,” “gross feeders on flesh,” “raw-eaters,” “lawless,” “not-sacrificing,” “without gods,” and “without rites.” As time went on, and these rude tribes were driven back into the forest, they were painted in still more hideous shapes, till they became the “monsters” and “demons” of the Aryan poet and priest. Their race-name Dasyu, “enemy,” thus grew to signify a goblin or devil, as the old Teutonic word for enemy has become the English “fiend.”

Nevertheless, all of them could not have been savages. We hear of wealthy Dasyus, and even the Vedic hymns speak much of their “seven castles” and “ninety forts.” In later Sanskrit literature the Aryans make alliance with aboriginal princes; and when history at length dawns on the scene, we find some of the most powerful kingdoms of India ruled by dynasties of non-Aryan descent. Nor were they devoid of religious rites, nor of cravings after a future life. “They adorn,” says a very ancient Sanskrit treatise,^[29. Chandogya Upanishad, quoted in Muir’s Sanskrit Texts.] “the bodies of their dead with gifts, with raiment, with ornaments, imagining that thereby they shall attain the world to come.” These ornaments are the bits of bronze, copper, and gold, which we now dig up from beneath their rude stone monuments. In the great Sanskrit epic which narrates the advance of the Aryans into southern India, a non-Aryan chief describes his race as “of fearful swiftness, unyielding in battle, in colour like a dark blue cloud.”^[30. Râmâyana.]
[9:12:777]

Thrust back by the Aryans from the plains, these primitive peoples have lain hidden away in the recesses of the mountains, like the remains of extinct animals which zoologists find in hill-caves. India thus forms a great museum of races, in which we can study man from his lowest to his highest stages of culture.

Among the rudest fragments of mankind are the isolated Andaman islanders in the Bay of Bengal. The old Arab and European voyagers described them as dog-faced man-eaters. The English officers sent to the islands in 1855 to establish a settlement found themselves surrounded by quite naked cannibals of a ferocious type, who daubed themselves when festive with red earth, and mourned in a suit of olive-coloured mud. They used a noise like weeping to express friendship or joy, bore only names of common gender, which they received before birth; and their sole conception of a god was an evil spirit who spread disease. For five years they repulsed every effort at intercourse by showers of arrows; but the officers slowly brought them to a better frame of mind by building sheds near the settlement, where these poor beings might find shelter from the tropical rains, and receive medicines and food.

The Anamalai hills, in southern Madras, form the refuge of a whole series of broken tribes. Five hamlets of long-haired wildlooking Puliars live on jungle products, mice, or any small animals they can catch, and worship demons. Another clan, the Munda-vars, shrink from contact with the outside world, and possess no fixed dwellings, but wander over the innermost hills .with their cattle, sheltering themselves under little leaf-sheds, and seldom remaining in one spot more than a year. The thick-lipped smallbodied Kaders, “Lords of the Hills,” are a remnant of a higher race. They file the front teeth of the upper jaw as a marriage ceremony, live by the chase, and wield some influence over the ruder forest-folk. These hills, now very thinly peopled, abound in the great stone monuments (kistvaens and dolmens) which the primitive tribes used for their dead. Th® Nairs of south-western India still practice polyandry, according to which a man’s property descends not to his own but to his sister’s children. That system also appears among the Himalayan tribes at the opposite extremity of India.

In the Central Provinces the aboriginal races form a large proportion of the population. In certain districts, as in the feudatory state of Bastar, they amount to three-fifths of the inhabitants. The most important race, the Gonds, have made some advances in civilization; but the wilder tribes still cling to the forest, and live by the chase, and some of them are reported to have used, within a few years back, flint points for their arrows. The Marias wield bows of great strength, which they hold with their feet while they draw the string with both hands. A still wilder tribe, the Maris, fly from their grass-built huts on the approach of a stranger. Once a year a messenger comes to them from the local raja to take their tribute of jungle products. He does not enter their hamlets, but beats a drum outside, and then hides himself. The shy Maris creep forth, place what they have to give in an appointed spot, and run back again into their retreats.

Further to the north-east, in the tributary states of Orissa, there is a poor tribe, 10,000 in number, of Juangs or Patuas, literally the “leaf-wearers,” whose women formerly wore no clothes. Their only vestige of covering was a few strings of beads round the waist with a bunch of leaves tied before and behind. Those under the British influence were clothed in 1871 by order of Government, and their native chief was persuaded to do the same work for the others. This leaf-wearing tribe had no knowledge of the metals till quite lately, when foreigners came among them, and no word exists in their native language for iron or any other metal. But their country abounds with flint weapons, so that the Juangs form a remnant to our own day of the Stone Age. “Their huts,” writes the officer who knows them best, “arc among the smallest that human beings ever deliberately constructed as dwellings. They measure about 6 feet by 8. The head of the family and all the females huddle together in this one shell, not much larger than a dog-kennel.” The boys and the young men of the village live in one large building apart by themselves; and this custom of having a common abode for the whole male youth of the hamlet is found among many of the aboriginal tribes in distant parts of India. The Kandhs of Orissa, who kept up their old tribal ritual of human sacrifice until it was put down by the British in 1835-45, and the Santals in the west of Lower Bengal, who rose in 1855, are examples of powerful and highly developed non-Aryan tribes.

Proceeding to the northern boundary of India, we find the slopes and spurs of the Himalayas peopled by a great variety of rude tribes. As a rule they are fierce, black, undersized, and ill-fed. They formerly eked out a wretched subsistence by plundering the more civilized hamlets of the Assam valley,—a means oflivelihood which they are but slowly giving up under British rule. Some of the wildest of them, such as the independent Abars, are now employed as a sort of irregular police, to keep the peace of the border, in return for a yearly gift of cloth, hoes, and grain. Their very names bear witness to their former wild life. One tribe, the Akas of Assam, is divided into two clans, known respectively as “The eaters of a thousand hearths,” and “The thieves who lurk in the cottonfield.”

Whence came these primitive peoples, whom the Aryan invaders found in the land more than three thousand years ago, and who are still scattered over India, the fragments of a prehistoric world 1 Written records they do not possess. Their oral traditions tell us little, but such hints as they yield feebly point to the north. They seem to preserve dim memories of a time when the tribes dwelt under the shadow of mightier hill ranges than any to be found on the south of the river plains of Bengal. “The Great Mountain” is the race-god of the Santâls, and an object of worship among other tribes. The Gonds, in the heart of of Central India, have a legend that they were created at the foot of Dewâlagiri Peak in the Himâlayas. Till lately they buried their dead with the feet turned northwards, so as to be ready to start again for their ancient home in the north.

The language of the non-Aryan races, that record of a nation’s past more enduring than rock inscriptions or tables of brass, is being slowly made to tell the secret of their origin. It already indicates that the early peoples of India belonged to three great stocks, known as the Tibeto-Burman, the Kolarian, and the Dravidian. The Tibeto-Burman tribes cling to the skirts of the Himâlayas and their north-eastern offshoots. They crossed over into India by the north-eastern passes, and in some prehistoric time had dwelt in Central Asia, side by side with the forefathers of the Mongolians and the Chinese. Several of the hill languages in Eastern Bengal preserve Chinese terms, others contain Mongolian. Thus the Nâgâs in Assam still use words for three and water which might almost be understood in the streets of Canton.

The following are the twenty principal dialects of the Tibeto-Burman group:—(1) Câchâri or Bodo, (2) Garo, (3) Tripura orMrung, (4) Tibetan or Bhutia, (5) Gurung l (6) Murmi, (7) Newar, (8) Lepcha, (9) Miri, (10) Aka, (11) Mishmi dialects, (12) Dhimal, (13) Kanâwari dialects, (14) Mikir, (15) Singpho, (16) Nâga dialects, (17) Kuki dialects, (18) Burmese, (19) Khyeng, and (20) Manipuri.

“It is impossible,” writes Mr Brandreth, “to give even an approximate number of the speakers included in this group, as many of the languages are either across the frontier or only project a short distance into our own territory. The languages included in this group have not, with perhaps one or two exceptions, both a cerebral and dental row of consonants, like the South-Indian languages; some of them have aspirated forms of the surds, but not of the sonants; others have aspirated forms of both. The languages of this group, even those which most diverge from each other, have several words in common, and especially numerals and pronouns, and also some resemblances of grammar. In comparing the resembling words, the differences between them consist often less in any modification of the root-syllable than in the various additions to the root. Thus in Burmese we have nd, ’ ear; , Tibetan, mα-bα; Magar, na-kep; Newar, nai-pong ; Dhimal, nd-hdthong ; Kiranti dialects, nd-pro, nd-rék, nd-gduik ; Naga languages, te-na-ro, te-na∙ rang·, Manipuri, na-kong ; Kupui, ka-nd∙, Sak, aka-nd ; Karen, na-klιu ; and so on. It can hardly be doubted that such additions as these to monosyllabic roots are principally determinative syllables for the purpose of distinguishing between what would otherwise have been monosyllabic words having the same sound. These determinatives are generally affixed in the languages of Nepal and in the Dhimal language; prefixed in the Lepcha language, and in the languages of Assam, of Manipur, and of the Chittagong and Arakan hills. ° Words are also distinguished by difference of tone. The tones are generally of two kinds, described as the abrupt or short, and the pausing or heavy; and it has been remarked that those’ languages which are most given to adding other syllables to the root make the least use of the tones, and vice versa·, where the tones most prevail the least recourse is had to determinative syllables.”

The Kolarians, the second of the three non-Aryan stocks, seem also to have entered Bengal by the north-eastern [9:12:778] passes. They dwell chiefly in the north, and along the north-eastern edge of the three-sided table-land which covers the southern half of India. Some of the Dravidians, or third stock, appear, on the other hand, to have found their way into the Punjab by the north-western passes. They now inhabit the southern part of the three-sided table-land, as far down as Cape Comorin, the southernmost part of India. It appears as if the two streams of the Kolarian tribes from the north-east and the Dravidians from the north-west had converged and crossed each other in Central India. The Dravidians proved the stronger, broke up the Kolarians, thrust aside their fragments to east and west, and then rushed forward in a mighty body to the south.

It thus happened that, while the Dravidians formed a vast mass in southern India, the Kolarians survived only as isolated tribes, scattered so far apart as soon to forget their common origin. One of the largest of the Kolarian races, the Santâls, dwells on the extreme eastern edge of the three-sided table-land of Central India, where it slopes down into the Gangetic valley of Lower Bengal. The Kurkus, a broken Kolarian tribe, inhabit a patch of country about 400 miles to the west, and have for perhaps thousands of years been cut off from the Santâls by mountains and pathless forests, and by intervening races of the Dravidian and Aryan stocks. The Kurkus and Santâls have no tradition of a common origin; yet at this day the Kurkus speak a language which is little else than a dialect of Santâli. The Savars, once a great Kolarian tribe, mentioned by Pliny and Ptolemy, are now a poor wandering race of woodcutters of northern Madras and Orissa. Yet fragments of them have lately been found deep in Central India, and as far west as Râjputâna on the other Bide.

The nine principal languages of the Kolarian group are—(1) Santâli, (2) Mundâri, (3) Ho, (4) Bhumij, (5) Korwa, (6) Kharria, (7) Juang, (8) Kurku, and perhaps (9) Savar. Some of them are separated only by dialectical differences.

“The Kolarian group of languages,” writes Mr Brandreth, “has both the cerebral and dental row of letters, and also aspirated forms, which last, according to Caldwell, did not belong to early Dravidian. There is also a set of four sounds, which are perhaps peculiar to Santâli, called by Skrefsrad semi-consonants, and which, when followed by a vowel, are changed respectively into g, j, cl, and b. Gender of nouns is animate and inanimate, and is distinguished by difference of pronouns, by difference of suffix of a qualifying noun in the genitive relation, and by the gender being denoted by the verb. As instances of the genitive suffix, we have in Santâli in-ren hopon, ‘ my son,’ but in-ak orak, ‘my house.’ There is no distinction of sex in the pronouns, but of the animate and inanimate gender. The dialects generally agree in using a short form of the third personal pronoun suffixed to denote the number, dual and plural, of the noun, and short forms of all the personal pronouns are added to the verb in certain positions to express both number and person, both as regards the subject and object, if of the animate gender,—the inanimate gender being indicated by the omission of these suffixes. No other group of languages, apparently, has such a logical classification of its nouns as that shown by the genders of both the South-Indian groups. The genitive in the Kolarian group of the full personal pronouns is used for the possessive pronoun, which again takes all the post-positions, the genitive relation being thus indicated by the genitive suffix twice repeated. The Kolarian languages generally express grammatical relations by suffixes, and adi the post-positions directly to the root, without the intervention of an oblique form or genitive or other suffix. They agree with the Dravidian in having inclusive and exclusive forms for the plural of the first personal pronoun, in using a relative participle instead of a relative pronoun, in the position of the governing word, and in the possession of a true causal form of the verb. They have a dual, which the Dravidians have not, but they have no negative voice. Counting is by twenties instead of by tens, as in the Dravidian. The Santâli verb, according to Skrefsrud, has twenty-three tenses, and for every tense two forms of the participle and a gerund.”

The compact Dravidians in the south, although in afterdays subdued by the higher civilization of the Aryan race which pressed in among them, were never thus broken into fragments. Their pure descendants consist, indeed, of small and scattered tribes; but they have given their languages to 46 millions of people in southern India. That some of the islands in the distant Pacific Ocean were peopled either from the Dravidian settlements in India, or from an earlier common source, remains a conjectural induction of philologers, rather than an established ethnological fact. 1 The aboriginal tribes in southern and western Australia use almost the same words for 7, thou, he, we, you, &c., as the fishermen on the Madras coast, and resemble in many other ways the Madras hill tribes, as in the use of their national weapon the boomerang.

Bishop Caldwell recognizes twelve distinct Dravidian languages :—(1) Tamil, (2) Malayâlim, (3) Telugu, (4) Kanarese, (5) Tulu, (6) Kudugu, (7) Toda, (8) Kota, (9) Gond, (10) Khond, (11) Urâon, (12) Râjmahâl.

“In the Dravidian group,” writes Mr Brandreth, “there is a rational and an irrational gender of the nouns, which is distinguished in the plural of the nouns, and sometimes in the singular also, by affixes which appear to be fragmentary pronouns, by corresponding pronouns, and by the agreement of the verb with the noun, the gender of the verb being expressed by the pronominal suffixes. To give an instance of verbal gender, we have in Tamil, from the root sey, ‘ to do,’ seyd -άη, ‘he (rational) did seyd -άΐ, ‘ she (rational) did; ’ seyd-adu, ‘ it (irrational) did; ’ scyd-Λr, ‘ they (the rationale) did; ’ seyd-a, ‘ they (the irrationals) did; ’—the full pronouns being avan, ‘ he; ’ aval, ‘ she; ’ adu, ‘ it; ’ avar, ‘ they ∕ avei, ‘ they. ’ This distinction of gender, though it exists in most of the Dravidian languages, is not always carried out to the extent that it is in Tamil. In Telugu, Gond, and Khond it is preserved in the plural, but in the singular the feminine rational is merged in the irrational gender. In Gond the gender is furtiter marked by the noun in the genitive relation taking a different suffix, according to the number and gender of the noun on which it depends. In Urâon the feminine rational is entirely merged in the irrational gender, with the exception of the pronoun, which preserves the distinction between rationale and irrationals in the plural; as as, ‘ he,’ referring to a god or a man; àd, ‘ she,’ or ‘ it,’ referring to a woman or an irrational object; but dr, ‘ they,’ applies to both men and women; abrà, ‘they,’to irrationals only. The rational gender, besides human beings, includes the celestial and infernal deities; and it is further subdivided in some of the languages, but in the singular only, into masculine and feminine. An instance of this subdivision in the Tamil verb was given above.

“The grammatical relations in the Dravidian are generally expressed l>y suffixes. Many nouns have an oblique form, which is a remarkable characteristic of the Dravidian group; still, with the majority of nouns, the post-positions are added directly to the nominative form. Other features of this group are—the frequent use of formatives to specialize the meaning of the root; the absence of relative pronouns, and the use instead of a relative participle, which is usually formed from the ordinary participle by the same suffix as that which Dr Caldwell considers as the oldest sign of the genitive relation; the adjective succeeding the substantive; of two substantives, the determining preceding the determined; and the verb being the last member of the sentence. There is no true dual in the Dravidian languages. In the Dravidian languages there are two forms of the plural of the pronoun of the first person, one including, the other excluding, the person addressed. As regards the verbs, there is a negative voice, but no passive voice, and there is a causal form.”

We discern, therefore, long before the dawn of history, masses of men moving uneasily over India, and violently pushing in among still earlier tribes. They crossed the snows of the Himâlayas, and plunged into the tropical forests in search of new homes. Of these ancient races fragments now exist in almost exactly the same stage of human progress as they were when described by Vedic poets over three thousand years ago. Some are dying out, such as the Andaman islanders, among whom only one family in 1869 had so many as three children. Others are increasing, like the Santâls, who have doubled themselves under British rule. Taken as a whole, and including certain half-Hinduized branches, they number 17,716,825, or say 18 millions, equal to three-quarters of the population of England and Wales. But while the bolder or more 1 See the authorities in Bishop Caldwell’s Comparative Grammar of the Dravidian Languages, pp. 78-80, &c. (ed. 1857).
[9:12:779]

isolated of the aboriginal races have thus kept themselves apart, by far the greater portion submitted in ancient times to the Aryan invaders, and now make up the mass of the Hindus.

In Bengal and Assam the aborigines are divided into nearly sixty distinct races. In the North-Western Provinces sixteen tribes of aborigines are enumerated in the census of 1872. In the Central Provinces they number If millions,—the ancient race of Gonds, who ruled the central table-land before the rise of the Marhattâs, alone amounting to 1∣ millions. In British Burmah the Karens, whose traditions have a singularly Jewish tinge, number 330,000. In Oudh the nationality of the aboriginal tribes has been stamped out beneath successive waves of Râjput and Mahometan invaders. In centres of the ancient Hindu civilization, the aboriginal races have become the low-castes and out-castes on which the social fabric of India rests. A few of them, however, still preserve their ethnical identity as wandering tribes or jugglers, basket-weavers, and fortune-tellers.· Thus the Nâts, Bediyas, and other gipsy clans are recognized to this day as distinct from the surrounding Hindu population.

The aboriginal races on the plains have supplied the hereditary criminal classes, alike under the Hindus, the Mahometans, and the British. Formerly organized robber communities, they have, under the stricter police administration of our days, sunk into petty pilferers. But their existence is still recognized by the Criminal Tribes Act, passed in 1871, and occasionally enforced within certain localities of northern India.

The non-Aryan hill races, who figured from Vedic times downwards as marauders and invaders, have ceased to be a disturbing element. Many of them appear as predatory clans in Mahometan and early British India. They sallied forth from their mountains at the end of the autumn harvest, pillaged and burned the lowland villages, and retired to their fastnesses laden with the booty of the plains. The measures by which many of these wild races have been reclaimed mark some of the most honourable episodes of Anglo Indian rule. Cleveland’s Hill-Rangers in the last century, and the Bhils and Mhairs in more recent times, are well-known examples of marauding races being turned into peaceful cultivators and loyal soldiers. An equally salutary transformation has taken place in many a remote forest and hill tract of India. The firm order of British rule has rendered their old plundering life no longer possible, and at the same time has opened up to them new outlets for their energies. Their character differs in many respects from that of the tamer population of the plains. Their truthfulness, sturdy loyalty, and a certain joyous bravery, almost amounting to playfulness, appeal in a special manner to the English mind. There is scarcely a single administrator who has ruled over them for any length of time without finding his heart drawn to them, and leaving on record his belief in their capabilities for good.

Primitive Hinduism. Wq have seen that India may be divided into three regions. Two of these, the Himâlayas in the north and the three-sided table-land in the south, still form the retreats of the non-Aryan tribes. The third, or the great river plains, became in very ancient times the theatre on which a nobler race worked out its civilization.

That race belonged to the splendid Aryan or IndoGermanic stock, from which the Brâhman, the Râjput, and the Englishman alike descend. Its earliest home seems to have been in Central Asia. From this common campingground certain branches of the race started for the east, others for the west. One of the western offshoots founded the Persian kingdom; another built Athens and Lacedaemon, and became the Greek nation; a third went on to Italy, and reared the city on the seven hills which grew into imperial Rome. A distant colony of the same race excavated the silver-ores of prehistoric Spain; and, when we first catch a sight of ancient England, we see an Aryan settlement fishing in willow canoes, and working the tinmines of Cornwall. Meanwhile other branches of the Aryan stock had gone forth from the primitive home in Central Asia to the east. Powerful bands found their way through the passes of the Himalayas into the Punjab, and spread themselves, chiefly as Brâhmans and Râjputs, over India.

The Aryan offshoots to the east and to the west alike asserted their superiority over the earlier peoples whom they found in possession of the soil. The history of ancient Europe is the story of the Aryan settlements around the shores of the Mediterranean; and that wide term, modern civilization, merely means the civilization of the western branches of the same race. The history and development of India consist of the history and development çf the eastern offshoots of the Aryan stock who settled in that land. In the west, the Aryan speech has supplied the modern languages of Europe, America, and England’s island empires in the southern Pacific. In the east, Hinduism and Buddhism, the religions of the Indian branch of the Aryans, have become the faiths of more than one-half of the whole human race, and spread Aryan thought and culture throughout Asia to the utmost limits of China and Japan.

We know little regarding these noble Aryan tribes in their early camping-ground in Central Asia. From words preserved in the languages of their long-separated descendants in Europe and India, scholars infer that they roamed over the grassy steppes with their cattle, making long halts to rear crops of grain. They had tamed most of the domestic animals, were acquainted with some metals, understood the arts of weaving and sewing, wore clothes, and ate cooked food. They lived the hardy life of the temperate zone, and the feeling of cold seems to be one of the earliest common remembrances of the eastern and the western branches of the race. Ages afterwards, when the Vedic singers in hot India prayed for long life, they asked for “a hundred, winters T The forefathers of the Greek and the Roman, of the Englishman and the Hindu, dwelt together in Asia, spoke the same tongue, worshipped the same gods. The languages of Europe and India, although at first sight they seem wide apart, are merely different forms of the original Aryan speech. This is especially true of the common words of family life. The names for father, mother, brother, sister, and widow are the same in most of the Aryan languages, whether spoken on the banks of the Ganges, of the Tiber, or of the Thames. Thus the word daughter, which occurs in nearly all of them, has been derived from two Sanskrit roots meaning “to draw milk,” and preserves the memory of the time when the daughter was the little milk-maid in the primitive Aryan household.

The ancient religions of Europe and India had a similar origin. They were to some extent made up of the sacred stories or myths which our common ancestors had learned while dwelling together in Central Asia. Some of the Vedic gods were also the gods of Greece and Rome; and to this day the Deity is adored by names derived from the same old Aryan root by Brâhmans in Calcutta, by Protestant clergymen at Westminster, and by Catholic priests in Peru.

The Vedic hymns exhibit the Indian branch of the Aryans on its march to the south-east and in its new homes. The earliest songs disclose the race still to the [9:12:780] north of the Khyber Pass, in Cabul; the later ones bring it as far as the Ganges. Their victorious advance eastwards through the intermediate tract can be traced in the Vedic writings almost step by step. One of their famous settlements lay between the two sacred rivers, the Saraswati and the Drishadvati,—supposed to be the modern Sarsuti near Thânesar, in the Punjab, and the Ghaggar, a day’s march from it. That fertile strip of land, not more than 60 miles long by 20 broad, was fondly remembered by them as their Holy Land, “fashioned of God, and chosen by the Creator.” As their numbers increased, they pushed eastwards along the base of the Himalayas, into what they afterwards called the Land of the Sacred Singers {Brdh-marshidesha). Their settlements practically included the five rivers of the Punjab, together with the other great river-system formed by the upper courses of the Jumna and the Ganges. In them the Vedic hymns were composed; and the steady supply of water led the Aryans to settle down from their old state of wandering pastoral tribes into communities of husbandmen. The Vedic poets praised the rivers which enabled them to make this great change—perhaps the most important step in the progress of a race. “May the Indus,” they sang, “the far-famed giver of wealth, hear us,—(fertilizing our) broad fields with water.” The Himâlayas, through whose passes they had reached India, and at whose southern base they long dwelt, made a lasting impression on their memory. The Vedic singer praised “Him whose greatness the snowy ranges, and the sea, and the aerial river declare.” In all its long wanderings through India the Aryan race never forgot its northern home. There dwelt its gods and holy singers, and their eloquence descended from heaven among men.

The Pig-Veda forms the great literary memorial of the early Aryan settlements in the Punjab. The age of this venerable hymnal is unknown. The Hindus believe, without evidence, that it existed “from before all time,” or at least 3001 years B.C.,—nearly 5000 years ago. European scholars have inferred from astronomical dates that its composition was going on about 1400 B.c. But these dates are themselves given in writings of later origin, and might have been calculated backwards. We only know that the Vedic religion had been at work long before the rise of Buddhism in the 6th century b.c. Nevertheless, the antiquity of the Rig-Veda, although not to be expressed in figures, is abundantly established. The earlier hymns exhibit the Aryans on the north-western frontiers of India just starting on their long journey. Before the embassy of the Greek Megasthenes, at the end of the 4th century b.c., they had spread their influence as far as the delta of Lower Bengal, 1500 miles distant. At the time of the Periplus the southernmost point of India had become a seat of their worship. “What a series of centuries must have elapsed,” writes Weber, “before this boundless tract of country, inhabited by wild and vigorous tribes, could have been brought over to Brâhmanism !”

The Brâhmans declare that the Vedic hymns were directly inspired by God. Indeed, in our own times, the great theistic church of Bengal, which rejects Brâhmanical teaching, was rent into two sects on the question of the divine authority of the Veda. As a matter of fact, the hymns were composed by certain families of Rishis or psalmists, some of whose names are preserved. The RigVeda is a very old collection of 1017 of these short lyrical poems, chiefly addressed to the gods, and containing 10,580 verses. They show us the Aryans on the banks of the Indus, divided into various tribes, sometimes at war with each other, sometimes united against the “black-skinned” aborigines. Caste, in its later sense, is unknown. Each father of a family is the priest of his own household. The chieftain acts as father and priest to the tribe; but at the greater festivals he chooses some one specially learned in holy offerings to conduct the sacrifice in the name of the people. The chief himself seems to have been elected; and his title of Vis-pati, literally “Lord of the Settlers,” survives in the old Persian Vis-paiti, and as the Lithuanian Wiéz-patis in central Europe at this day. Women enjoyed a high position, and some of the most beautiful hymns were composed by ladies and queens. Marriage was held sacred. Husband and wife were both “rulers of the house” (dampatι) i and drew near to the gods together in prayer, The burning of widows on their husbands’ funeral-pile was unknown, and the verses in the Veda which the Brâhmans afterwards distorted into a sanction for the practice have the very opposite meaning. “Rise, woman,” says the sacred text to the mourner; “come to the world of life. Come to us. Thou hast fulfilled thy duties as a wife to thy husband.”

The Aryan tribes in the Veda are acquainted with most of the metals. They have blacksmiths, coppersmiths, and goldsmiths among them, besides carpenters, barbers, and other artisans. They fight from chariots, and freely use the horse, although not yet the elephant, in war. They have settled down as husbandmen, till their fields with the plough, and live in villages or towns. But they also cling to their old wandering life, with their herds and “cattle-pens.” Cattle, indeed, still form their chief wealth, the coin ( Latin, pecunia) in which payments of fines are made; and one of their words for war literally means “a desire for cows.” They have learned to build “ships,” perhaps large river-boats, and seem to have heard something of the sea. Unlike the modem Hindus, the Aryans of the Veda ate beef, used a fermented liquor or beer made from the soma plant, and offered the same strong meat and drink to their gods. Thus the stout Aryans spread eastwards through northern India, pushed on from behind by later arrivals of their own stock, and driving before them, or reducing to bondage, the earlier “black-skinned” races. They marched in whole communities from one river-valley to another, each house-father a warrior, husbandman, and priest, with his wife, and his little ones, and cattle.

These free-hearted tribes had a great trust in themselves and their gods. Like other conquering races, they believed that both themselves and their deities were altogether superior to the people of the land and their poor rude objects of worship. Indeed, this noble self-confidence is a great aid to the success of a nation. Their divinities—in Sanskrit, Devαtα, literally “the Shining Ones”— were the great powers of nature. They adored the Father-heaven, {Dyaush-pitar, the Dies-pitcr or Jupiter of Rome, the Zeus of Greece, the Low German Duus, and, through the old French god-demon Dus-ius, the Deuce of English slang), together with Mother-earth, and the Encompassing Sky (Pαrunα in Sanskrit, Uranus in Latin, Ouranοs in Greek). Indra, or the aqueous vapour that brings each autumn the precious rain on which plenty or famine still depends, received the largest number of hymns. By degrees, as the settlers realized more and more keenly the importance of the periodical rains in their new life as husbandmen, he became the chief of the Vedic gods. “The gods do not reach unto thee, O Indra, nor men; thou overcomest all creatures in strength.” Agni, the God of fire (Latin ignis), ranks perhaps next to Indra in the number of hymns addressed to him as “the youngest of the gods,” “the lord and giver of wealth.” The Maruts are the Storm Gods, “who make the rocks to tremble, who tear in pieces the forest.” Ushas, “the High-born Dawn” (Greek, Bos), “shines upon us like a young wife, rousing every living being to go forth to his work.” The Asvins, or “Fleet Outriders” of the Dawn, are the first rays of sunrise, ‘ ‘ Lords of Lustre.” The Sun himself (Sürjya), the Wind (Vâyu), the Friendly Day (Mitra), the animating fermented juice of the Sacrificial Plant (Soma) and many others, are invoked in the Veda,— in all about thirty-three gods, “who are eleven in heaven, eleven on earth, and eleven dwelling in glory in mid-air.”

The terrible blood-drinking deities of modern Hinduism are scarcely known in the Veda. Buffaloes are indeed offered; and one hymn points to a symbolism based on human sacrifices, an early practice apparently extinct before the time of the Vedic singers. The great horse sacrifice was substituted for the flesh and blood of a man. But, asa whole, the hymns are addressed to bright, [9:12:781] friendly gods. Ru<lra, who was destined to become the Siva of the Hindus, and the third person, or Destroyer, in their Triad, is only the god of Roaring Tempests in the Veda ; Vishnu, the second person, or Preserver, in the Hindu Triad, is but slightly known as the deity of the Shining Firmament; while Brahma, the first person, or Creator, has no separate existence in these simple hymns. The naines of the dreadful Mahâdeva, Dιirga, Kali, and of the gentler Krishna and Rama, are equally unknown in the RigVeda.

While the aboriginal races buried their dead under rude stone monuments, the Aryan—alike in India, in Greece, and in Italy— made use of the funeral-pile as the most solemn method of severing the mortal from the immortal part of man. As he derived his natural birth from his parents, and a partial regeneration, or second birth, from the performance of his religious duties, so the fire, by setting free the soul from the body, completed the third or heavenly birth. His friends stood round the pyre as round a natal bed, and commanded his eye to go to the sun, his breath to the wind, his limbs to the earth,—the water and plants whence they had been derived. But “as for his unborn part, do thou, Lord (Agni), quicken it with thy heat; let thy flame and thy brightness quicken it; convey it to the world of the righteous.” The doctrine of transmigration was unknown. The circle round the funeral-pile sang with an assurance that their friend went direct to a state of blessedness and reunion with the loved ones who had gone before.

The hymns of the Rig-Veda were composed, as we have seen, by the Aryans in their colonies along the Indus, and on their march eastwards towards the Jumna and upper Ganges. The growing numbers of the settlers, and the arrival of fresh Aryan tribes from behind, still compelled them to advance. From the Land of the Sacred Singers Manu describes them as spreading through “The Middle Land” {Madhyadesha), comprising the whole river systems of Upper India as far east as Oudh and Allahâbâd, with the Himalayas as its northern and the Vindhyâ ranges as its southern boundary. The conquest of the vast new tracts thus included seems not to have commenced till the close of the Rig-Vedic era, and it must have been the work of many generations. During this advance the simple faith of the Rig-Vedic singers was first adorned with stately rites, and then extinguished beneath them. The race progressed from a loose confederacy of tribes into several well-knit nations, each bound together by the strong central force of kingly power, directed by a powerful priesthood and organized on a firm basis of caste.

Whence arose this new constitution of the Aryan tribes into nations, with castes, priests, and kings 1 We have seen that, although in their earlier colonies on the Indus each father was priest in his family, yet the chieftain, or lord of the settlers, called in some man specially learned in holy offerings to conduct the great tribal sacrifices. Such men were highly honoured, and the famous quarrel which runs throughout the whole Veda sprang from the claims of two rival sages, Vashishtha and Visvâmitra, to perform one of these ceremonies. The art of writing was unknown, and the hymns and sacrificial words had to be handed down by word of mouth from father to son. It thus happened that the families who learned them by heart became, as it were, the hereditary owners of the liturgies required at the most solemn offerings to the gods. Members of these households were chosen again and again to conduct the tribal sacrifices, to chant the battle-hymn, to implore the divine aid, or to pray away the divine wrath. Even the Rig-Veda recognizes the importance of these sacrifices. “That king,” says a verse, “before whom marches the priest, he alone dwells well-established in his own house, to him the people bow down. The king who gives wealth to the priest, he will conquer, him the gods will protect.” The tribesmen first hoped, then believed, that a hymn or prayer which had once acted successfully, and been followed by victory, would again produce the same results. The hymns became a valuable family property for those who had composed or learned them. The Rig-Veda tells how the prayer of Vashishtha prevailed “in the battle of the ten kings,” and how that of Visvâmitra “preserves the tribe of the Bhârats.” The potent prayer was termed brdhma t and he who offered it brdhman. Woe to all who despised either! “Whosoever,” says the Rig-Veda, “scoffs at the prayer {frdhma) which we have made, may hot plagues come upon him, may the sky burn up that hater of Brâhmans” (frdhma-dvish ∖ Certain families thus came to have, not only an hereditary claim to conduct the great sacrifices, but also the exclusive knowledge of the ancient hymns, or at any rate of the traditions which explained their symbolical meaning. They naturally tried to render the ceremonies solemn and imposing. By degrees a vast array of ministrants grew up around each of the greater sacrifices. There were first the officiating priests and their assistants, who prepared the sacrificial ground, dressed the altar, slew the victims, and poured out the libations; second, the chanters of the Vedic hymns; third, the reciters of other parts of the service; fourth, the superior priests, who watched over the whole, and corrected any mistakes.

Meanwhile other castes had been gradually formed. As the Aryans moved eastwards from the Indus, some of the warriors were more fortunate than others, or received larger shares of the conquered lands. Such families had not to till their fields with their own hands, but could leave that work to be done by the aboriginal races whom they subdued. In this way there grew up a class of warriors, freed from the labour of husbandry, who surrounded the chief or king, and were always ready for Rattle. It seems likely that these kinsmen and “companions of the king” formed an important class among the early Aryan tribes in India, as they certainly did among the ancient branches of the race in Europe, and still do at the petty courts of India. Their old Sanskrit names, Kshattriya, Rdjanya, and Rajbansi, mean “connected with the royal power,” or “of the royal line”; their usual modern name Rdjput means “of royal descent.” In process of time, when the Aryans settled down, not as mere fighting clans, but as powerful nations, in the middle land along the Jumna and Ganges, this warrior class grew in numbers and in power. The black races had been reduced to serfdom, or driven back into the Himalayas and the Vindhyâs, on the north and the south of that fertile tract. The incessant fighting, which had formed the common lot of the tribes on their actual migration eastwards from the Indus, ceased. A section of the people laid· aside their arms, and devoted themselves to agriculture or other peaceful pursuits. The sultry heats of the Middle Land must also have abated their old northern energy, and led them to love repose. Those who, from family ties or from personal inclination, preferred a soldier’s life had to go beyond the frontier to find an enemy. Distant expeditions of this sort could be undertaken much less conveniently by the husbandman than in the ancient time, when his fields lay on the very border of the enemy’s country, and had just been wrested from it. Such expeditions required and developed a class of regular soldiers whose presence was not constantly needed at home for tilling the land. The old warrior companions and kinsmen of the king formed a nucleus round which gathered all the more daring spirits, and laid the foundation of a military caste. The Aryans on the Ganges, in the “Middle Land,” thus found themselves divided into three classes-first, the priests, or Brâhmans; second, the warriors and king’s companions, called in ancient times Kshattriyas, at the present day Râjputs; third, the husbandmen, or agricultural settlers, who retained the old name of Vaisyas, from the root vis, which in the Vedic period had included the whole “people.” These three classes gradually became distinct castes; intermarriage between them ceased, and each kept more and more strictly to its hereditary employment. But they were all recognized as belonging to the “twice-born” or Aryan race, were all present at the great national [9:12:782] sacrifices, and all worshipped the same bright gods. Beneath them was a fourth or servile class, called Sùdras, the remnants of the vanquished aboriginal tribes whose lives had been spared. These were “the slave-bands of black descent,” the Dâsas of the Veda. They were distinguished from their “twice-born” Aryan conquerors as being only “once-born,” and by many contemptuous epithets. They were not allowed to be present at the great national sacrifices, nor at the feasts which followed them. They could never rise from their servile condition, and to them was assigned the severest toil in the fields, and all the hard and dirty work of the village community. Of the four Indian castes, three had a tendency to increase. As the Aryan conquests spread, more aboriginal tribes were reduced to serfdom as Sιidras. The warriors, or Kshattriyas, would constantly receive additions from the more wealthy or enterprising members of the cultivating class. When an expedition or migration went forth to subdue new territory, all the colonists would for a time lead a military life, and their sons would probably all regard themselves as Kshattriyas. In ancient times entire tribes, and at the present day the mass of the population throughout large tracts, thus claim to be of the warrior or Râjput caste. Moreover, the kings and chief fighting-men of aboriginal races who, without being conquered by the Aryans, entered into alliance with them, would likely assume names of the warrior or Kshattriya rank. We see this process going on before our eyes among many of the aboriginal peoples. The Brâhmans, in their turn, seem at first to have received into their body distinguished families of Kshattriyan descent. In later times, too, we find that sections of aboriginal races were “manufactured” into Brâhmans. The Vaisya or cultivating caste did not tend in this manner to increase. No one felt ambitious to win his way into it, except perhaps the poor Sùdras, to whom any change of condition was forbidden. The Vaisyas themselves tended in early times to rise into the more honourable warrior class, and at a later period to be mingled with the labouring multitude of Sùdras and mixed descent. In many provinces they have almost disappeared as a distinct caste from the modern population. In ancient India, as at the present day, the three conspicuous castes were (1) the priests and (2) warriors, of Aryan birth, and (3) the serfs or Sudras, the remnants of earlier races. The Kshattriyas or Râjputs, at any rate in some parts of India, seem to represent a quite separate ethnical movement from that of the Brahmans—that is to say, either a different Aryan migration into India, or an altogether distinct race of perhaps Scythic origin. The Sùdras had no rights, and, once conquered, ceased to struggle against their fate. But a long contest raged between the priests and warriors for the chief place in the Aryan commonwealth.

In order to understand that contest, we must go back to the time when the priests and warriors were simply fellow-tribesmen. The priestly or Brâhman caste grew slowly out of the families of Rishis who composed the Vedic hymns, or were chosen to conduct the great tribal sacrifices. In after times the whole Brâhman population of India pretended to trace their descent from seven Rishis. But the composers of the Vedic hymns were sometimes kings or distinguished warriors rather than priests; the Veda itself speaks of these royal Rishis {Pajarshis). When the Brâhmans put forward their claim to the highest rank, the warriors or Kshattriyas were slow to admit it; and, when the Brâhmans went a step farther, and declared that only members of their families could be priests, or gain admission into the priestly caste, the warriors disputed their pretensions. In later ages the Brâhmans, having the exclusive keeping of the sacred writings, effaced from them, as far as possible, all traces of the struggle. They taught that their caste had come forth from the mouth of God, divinely appointed to the priesthood from the beginning of time. Nevertheless, a large body of Vedic verses and Sanskrit texts has now been brought to bear upon the struggle between the Brâhmans and Kshattriyas for the highest rank. 1

In many of the Aryan tribes, however, the priests failed to establish themselves as an exclusive order. Indeed, the four castes, and especially the Brâhman caste, seem only to have obtained their full development amid the plenty of the Middle Land (Madhyadeshd), watered by the Jumna and the Ganges. The earlier Aryan settlements to the west of the Indus remained outside the caste system; the later Aryan offshoots to the south and east of the middle land only partially carried that system with them. But in the Middle Land itself, with Delhi as its western capital and the great cities of Ajodhya and Benares on its eastern frontier, the Brâhmans grew by degrees into a compact, learned, and supremely influential body, the makers of Sanskrit literature. Their language, their religion, and their laws became in after times the standards aimed at throughout all India. They naturally denounced all who did not submit to their pretensions, and stigmatized the other Aryan settlements who had not accepted their caste system as lapsed tribes or outcastes (Vrishalas). Among the lists of such fallen races we read the name afterwards applied to the Ionians or Greeks Havanas). The Brâhmans of the middle land had not only to enforce their supremacy over the powerful warriors of their own kingdoms, but to extend it among the Aryan tribes who had never fully accepted the caste system. That must have been the slow work of ages, and it seems to have led to bitter feuds. See Brahmanism, vol. iv. p. 201.

While the Brahmans claimed religion, theology, and philosophy as their special domain, and the chief sciences and arts as supplementary sections of their divinely-inspired knowledge, they secured their social supremacy by codes of law. Their earliest Dhαrmα-sdstras, or legal writings, belong to the Sûtra period, or scholastic development, of the Veda. But their two great digests, upon which the fabric of Hindu jurisprudence has been built up, are of later date. The first of these, the code of Manu, is separated from the Vedic era by a series of Brahmanical developments, of which we possess only a few of the intermediate links. It is a compilation of the customary law current probably about the 5th century b.c., and exhibits the social organization which the Brahmans, after their 1 The quarrel between the two sages Visvämitra and Vashishtha, which runs through the whole Veda, is typical of this struggle. Visvämitra stands as a representative of the royal-warrior rank, who claims to perform a great public sacrifice. The white-robed Vashishtha represents the Brahmans or hereditary priesthood, and opposes the warrior’s claim. In the end Visvämitra established his title to conduct the sacrifice; but the Brahmans explain this by saying that his virtues and austerities won admission for him into the priestly family of Bhrigus. He thus became a Brâhman, and could lawfully fill the priestly office. Visvämitra serves as a typical link, not only between the priestly and the worldly castes, but also between the sacred and the profane sciences. He was the legendary founder of the art of war, and his son Susrα-fa is quoted as the earliest authority on Indian medicine. These two sciences of war and medicine form upa-Vedas, or supplementary sections of the divinely inspired knowledge of the Brâhmans. Another royal Rishi, Vitahavya, “attained the condition of Brâhmanhood, venerated by mankind,” by a word of the saintly Bhrigu. Parasu-Râma, the divine champion of the Brâhmans, was of warrior descent by his mother’s side. Manu, their legislator, sprang from the warrior caste; and his father is expressly called “the seed of all the Kshattriyas.” But when the Brâhmans had firmly established their supremacy they became reluctant to allow the possibility of even princes finding an entrance into their sacred order. King Ganaka was more learned than all the Brâhmans at his court, and performed terrible penances to attain to Brâhmanhood. Yet the legends leave it doubtful whether he gained his desire. The still more holy but probably later Matanga wore his body to skin and bone by a thousand years of austerities, and was held from falling by the hand of Indra himself. Nevertheless, he could not attain to Brâhmanhood. The reformer, Gautama Buddha, who in the 6th century before Christ overthrew the Brâhman supremacy, and founded a new religion, was a prince of warrior descent, perhaps born in too late an age to be adopted into and utilized by the Brâhman caste.
[9:12:783]

successful struggle for the supremacy, had established in the Middle Land of Bengal. The Brahmans, indeed, claimed for their laws a divine origin, and ascribed them to the first Manu, or Aryan man, 30 millions of years ago. But, as a matter of fact, the laws of Manu are the result of a series of attempts to codify the usages of some not very extensive centre of Brahmanism in northern India,—a metrical digest of local customs condensed by degrees from a legendary mass of 100,000 couplets (slokas) into 2684. They may possibly have been reduced to their final form of a written code with a view to securing the system of caste against the popular movement of Buddhism, and thus giving a rigid fixity to the privileges of the Brahmans.

The second great code of the Hindus, that of Yâjnavalkya, belongs to a period when Buddhism had established itself, and probably to a territory where it was beginning to succumb to the Brâhmanical reaction. It represents the Brâhmanical side of the great contro-versv (although a section of it deals with the organization of monasteries), refers to the execution of deeds on metal plates, and altogether marks an advance in legal precision. Its compilation belongs to a period apparently not earlier than the 2d century A.D., and certainly not later than the 6th or 7th.

These codes deal with Hindu law in three branches, namely—(1) domestic and civil rights and duties, (2) the administration of justice, (3) purification and penance. They stereotyped the unwritten usages which regulated the family life and social organization of the old Aryan communities in the middle land. They did not pretend to supply a body of law for all the numerous races of India, but only for Hindu communities of the Brâhmanical type. It is do ιbtful whether they quite accurately represent the actual customary law even in such communities, for they were apparently drawn up with a view to asserting and maintaining the special privileges of the Brâhmans. This they effect by a rigid demarcation of the employments of the people, each caste or division of a caste having its own hereditary occupation assigned to it; by stringent rules against intermingling the castes by marriage; by forbidding the higher castes, under severe penalties, to eat or drink or hold social intercourse with the lower; and by punishing the lower castes with still.more cnιel penances for defiling by their touch the higher castes, or in any way infringing on their privileges. They exhibit the Hindu community in the four ancient divisions of priests, warriors, cultivators, and serfs (sιidrαs). But they disclose that this old Aryan classification failed to represent the actual facts even of the Aryan communities in northern India. They admit that the mass of the people did not belong to anyone of the four castes, and ascribe its origin to mixed concubinage or illicit connexions. The ancient Brâhmanical communities in northern India, as revealed by the codes themselves, consisted—first, of an Aryan element divided into priests, warriors, and cultivators, all of whom bore the proud title of the twice-born, and wore the sacred thread; second, of the subjugated races, “the once-born” Siidras; and third, of the vast residue of the Varna-sankara, literally the “mingled colours,” a great but uncertain number of castes to whom was assigned a mixed descent from the four recognized classes. The same division exists to this day. According to the census of 1871, the separate tribes an I castes in Lower Bengal do not fall short of a thousand; in the North-Western Provinces the Hindu population was arranged under two hundred and ninety-one specified castes besides numerous subdivisions. The distinctly recognized “mixed castes” throughout British India cannot be estimated at less than three hundred, and probably amount to many more.

As the Brâhmans spread their influence eastwards and southwards from the Middle Land, they carried their codes with them. The number of their sacred law books (Dharma-s<istras) amounted to at least fifty-six, and separate schools of Hindu law sprang up. Thus the Dàyabhaga version of the law of inheritance prevails in Bengal while the Mitâksharâ commentary on Yâjnavalkya is current in Madras and throughout southern and western India. But all modern recensions of Hindu law rest upon the ancient codes; and these codes, as we have seen, only recorded the usages of certain B t αhmanical centres in the north, and perhaps did not fairly record e J e l 1 V. lel l 1 ' ^A∙ s . Brahmans gradually moulded the population of India into Hinduism, such codes proved too narrow a basis for dealing with the rights, duties, and social organization of the people. The later Hindu legislators, accordingly, inculcated the recognition of the local usages or land-law of each part of the country, and of each class or tribe. While binding together and preserving the historical unity of the Aryan twice-born castes by systems of law founded on their ancient codes, they made provision for the customs and diverse stages of civilization of the ruder peoples of India, over whom they established their ascendency. By such provisions, alike in religion and law, the Brâhmans incorporated the Indian races into that loosely coherent mass known as the Hindu population.

. It is to this plastic element that Hinduism owes its success; and it is an element which English administrators have sometimes overlooked. The races of British India exhibit many stages of domestic institutions from the polyandry of the Nairs to the polygamy of the Kulin Brâhmans. The structure of their industrial organization varies, from the nomadic husbandry of the Burmese to the long chain of tenures which in Bengal stretches from the proprietor through a series of middle-men to the actual tiller of the soil. Every stage in human progress is represented, from the hunting tribes of the central plateau to the rigid trade-guilds of Guzerat. The Hindu legislators recognized tnat each of these diverse stages of social development had its own usages and common law. Vriha-spati says: “The laws (dha,rma) practised by the various countries, castes, and tribes, they are to be preserved; otherwise the people are agitated.” Dévala says: “Whit gods there are in any country, . . . and whatsoever be the custom and law anywhere, they are not to be despised there; the law there is such.” Varâhamihira sajs: “The custom of the country is first to be considered; what is the rule in each country, that is to be done.” The most learned English scholar in southern India has thus summed up the matter: “By custom only can the Dharma-sâstra [Hindu law] be the rule of others than Brâhmans [only one-thirtieth of the population of Madras], and even in the case of Brahmans it is very often superseded by custom.”^[31. Dr Burnell’s Σ>dya∙Viblιdgha, Introd. p. xv.; see also The Hindu Law as administered by the High Court of Judicature at Madras. by J. Nelson, Μ.A., District Judge of Cuddapah, chaps, iii. and iv. (Madras, 1877).]

The English, on assuming the government of India, wisely declared that they would administer justice according to the customs of the people. But the high courts enforce the Brâhmanical codes with a comprehensiveness and precision unknown in ancient India. Thus in Bengal the custom of sagai, by which deserted or divorced wives among the lower castes marry again, was lately tried according to “the spirit of Hindu law ”; while in Madras learned judges have pointed out a divergence between the Hindu law as now administered and the actual usages of the people. Those usages are unwritten and uncertain. The Hindu law is printed in many accessible forms, and Hindu barristers are ever pressing its principles upon the courts. Efforts at comprehensive codification in British India are thus surrounded by special difficulties, for it would be improper to give the fixity of a code to all the unwritten half-fluid usages current among the three-hundred unhomogeneous castes of Hindus, while it might be fraught with future injustice to exclude any of them. Each age has the gift of adjusting its institutions to its actual wants, especially among tribes whose customs have not been reduced to written law. Many of those customs will, if left to themselves, die out; others of them, that prove suited to the new social developments under British rule, will live. But the process of natural selection must be, to some extent, the work of time, and not a single act of conscious legislation. This has been recognized by the ablest of Anglo-Indian codifiers. They apply the word code to the systematic arrangement of the rales relating to some well-marked section of juristic rights, or to some executive department of the administration of justice. “In its larger sense,” write the Indian Law Commissioners, 1879, “of a general assemblage of ail the laws of a community, no attempt has yet been made in this country to satisfy the conception of a code. The time for its realization has manifestly not arrived.”

The Brahmans were not merely the depositaries of the sacred books, the philosophy, the science, and the laws of the ancient Hindu commonwealth; they were also the creators and custodians of its secular literature. They had a practical monopoly of Vedic learning, and their policy was to trace back every branch of knowledge and intellectual effort to the Veda.

In order to understand the long domination of the Brâhmans and the influence which they still wield, it is necessary to keep in mind their position as the great literary caste. Their priestly supremacy has been repeatedly assailed, and was during a space of several hundred years overthrown. But throughout twenty-two centuries they have been the counsellors of Hindu princes and the teachers of the Hindu people. They represent the early Aryan civilization of India; and the essential history of the Hindus is a narrative of the attacks upon the continuity of that civilization,—that is to say, of attacks upon the Brâhmanical system of the Middle Land, and - of the modifications and compromises to which that system has had to submit. Those attacks range themselves under six epochs :—first, the religious uprising of the half-Brâhmanized Aryan tribes on the east of the Middle Land, initiated by the preaching of Buddha in the 6th century b.c., culminating in the Buddhist kingdoms [9:12:784] about the commencement of our era, and melting into modern Hinduism about the 8th ceutury A.D.; second, warlike inroads of non-Brâhmanical Aryans or other races from the west, commencing with the Greek invasions in the 4th century b.c., and continuing under the Graeco-Bactrian empire and its successors to probably the 3d or 5th century a.d. ; third, the influence of the non-Aryan tribes of India and of the non-Aryan low-castes incorporated from them, —an influence ever at work, indeed by far the most powerful agent in dissolving Brâhmanism into Hinduism, but represented in a special manner by the non-Aryan kingdoms about the 7th and 8th centuries a.d.; fourth, the reaction against the low beliefs, priestly oppression, and bloody rites which resulted from this compromise between Brâhmanism and aboriginal worship, a reaction which received an impetus from the preaching of Sankar-Achârjya, who founded a philosophical Sivaite sect in the 8th or 9th century, and received its full development under a line of great Vishnuvite reformers from the 12th to the 16th centuries a.d. ; fifth, Mahometan invasions and the rule of Islam, 1000 to 1765 a.d. ; sixth, the English supremacy, and the great popular upheaval which it has produced in the 18th and 19th centuries.

Buddhist Period.

(6th century B.c. to 8th century A.D.)

The first great solvent of Brâhmanism was the teaching of Buddha. The life of this celebrated man has three sides,—its personal aspects, its legendary developments, and its religious consequences upon mankind. In his own person Buddha appears as a prince and preacher of ancient India. In the legendary developments of history Buddha ranks as a divine teacher among his followers, as an incarnation of Vishnu among the Hindus, and apparently as a saint of the Christian church, with a day assigned to him in both the Greek and Roman calendars. As a religious founder he left behind him a system of beliefs which has gained more disciples than any other creed in the world, and which, after a lapse of twenty-four centuries, is now professed by 500 millions of people, or more than one-third of the human race.

The life of Buddha is related at length under Buddhism, vol. iv. p. 424. In this place it is unnecessary to give more than a brief sketch of the history of Buddhism in India.

On the death of Buddha, five hundred of his disciples met in a cave near Râjâgriha, to gather together his sayings. This was. the first council. They chanted the lessons of their master in three great divisions—the words of Buddha to his disciples, his code of discipline, and his system of doctrine. These became the three collections of Buddha’s teaching, and the word for a Buddhist council means literally “a singing together.” A century afterwards, a second council of seven hundred was held at Vaisali, to settle disputes between the more and the less strict followers of Buddhism. It condemned a system of ten “indulgences” which had grown up, but it led to the separation of the Buddhists into two hostile parties, who afterwards split into eighteen or more sects.

During the next two hundred years Buddhism spread over northern India, perhaps receiving a new impulse from the Greek kingdoms in the Punjab. About 244 B.c. Asoka, the king of Magadha or Behar, became a zealous convert to Buddhism. He is said to have supported 64,000 Buddhist priests; he founded many religious houses, and his kingdom is called the Land of the Monasteries (Vihâra or Behar) to this day. He did for Buddhism what Constantine afterwards effected for Christianity; he organized it on the basis of a state religion. This he accomplished by five means—by a council to settle the faith, by edicts promulgating its principles, by a state department to watch over its purity, by missionaries to spread its doctrines, and by an authoritative collection of its sacred books. In 244 b.c. Asoka convened at Patnâ the third Buddhist council of one thousand elders. Evil men, taking on them the yellow robe of the order, had given forth their own opinions as the teaching of Buddha. Such heresies were now corrected; and the Buddhism of southern Asia practically dates from Asoka’s council. In a number of edicts, both before and after the synod, he published throughout India the grand principles of the faith. Such edicts are still found graven deep upon pillars, in caves, and on rocks, from the Yusafzai valley beyond Peshâwar on the north-western frontier, through the heart of Hindustân, to Kâthiâwâr and the Central Provinces on the south and Orissa in the east. Tradition states that Asoka set up 64,000 memorial columns or topes; and the thirty inscriptions extant in our own day show how widely these royal sermons were spread over India. In the year of the council, the king also founded a state department to watch over the purity and to direct the spread of the faith. A minister of justice and religion (Dharma Mahâmâtra) directed its operations∣ and, one of .its first duties being to proselytize, he was specially charged with the welfare of the aborigines among whom its missionaries were sent. Asoka did not think it enough to convert the inferior races without looking after their material interests. Wells were to be dug and trees planted along the roads; a system of medical aid was established throughout his kingdom and the conquered provinces, as far as Ceylon, for both man and beast. Officers were appointed to watch over domestic life and public morality, and to promote instruction among the women as well as the youth.

Asoka recognized proselytism by peaceful means as a state duty. The rock inscriptions record how he sent forth missionaries “to the utmost limits of the barbarian countries,” to “intermingle among all unbelievers” for the spread of religion. They shall mix equally with Brâhmans and beggars, with the dreaded and the despised, both within the kingdom “and in foreign countries, teaching better things.” Conversion is to be effected by persuasion, not by the sword. Buddhism was at once the most intensely missionary religion in the world and the most tolerant. This character of a proselytizing faith which wins its victories by peaceful means, so strongly impressed upon it by Asoka, has remained a prominent feature of Buddhism to the present day. Asoka, however, not only took measures to spread the religion; he also endeavoured to secure its orthodoxy. He collected the body of doctrine into an authoritative version, in the Magadhi language or dialect of his central kingdom in Behar,—a version which for two thousand years has formed the canon (pitakas) of the southern Buddhists.

The fourth and last of the great councils was held under King Kanishka, according to one tradition, four hundred years after Buddha’s death. The date of Kanishka is still uncertain; but, from the evidence of coins and inscriptions, his reign has been fixed in the 1st century after Christ, or, say, 40 a.d. Kanishka, the most famous of the Saka conquerors, ruled over north-western India and the adjoining countries. His authority had its nucleus in Kashmir, but it extended to both sides of the Himâlayas, from Yarkand and Khokan to Agra and Sind. His council of five hundred compiled three commentaries on the Buddhist faith. These commentaries supplied in part materials for the Tibetan or northern canon, drawn up at a subsequent period. The northern canon, or, as the Chinese proudly call it, the “greater vehicle of the law,” includes many later corruptions or developments of the Indian faith as originally embodied by Asoka (244 B.c.) in the “lesser vehicle,” or canon of the southern Buddhists.
[9:12:785]

The Kanishka commentaries were written in the Sanskrit language, perhaps because the Kashmir and northern priests who formed his council belonged to isolated Aryan colonies, which had been little influenced by the growth of the Indian vernacular dialects. In this way Kanishka and his Kashmir council (Î 40 a.d.) became in some degree to the northern or Tibetan Buddhists what Asoka and his Patnâ council (244 b.c.) had been to the Buddhists of Ceylon and the south.

The missionary impulse given by Asoka quickly bore fruit In the year after his great council at Patnâ. his son Mahindo carried Asoka’s version of the Buddhist scriptures in the Magadhi language to Ceylon. He took with him a band of fellow missionaries; and soon afterwards his sister, the princess Sanghamitta, who had entered the order, followed with a company of nuns. It was not, however, till six hundred years later (410-432 A.D.) that the holy books were rendered into Pâli, the sacred language of the southern Buddhists. About the same time missionaries from Ceylon finally established the faith in Burmah (450 A.D.). The Burmese themselves assert that two Buddhist preachers landed in Pegu as early as 207 RC. Some indeed place their arrival just after the Patnâ council (244 B.C.), and point out the ruined city of Tha-ton, between the Tsi-tang and Salwin estuaries, as the scene of their pious labours. Siam was converted to Buddhism in 638 a.d.; Java received its missionaries direct from India between the 5th and the 7th centuries, and spread the faith to Bali and Sumatra. While southern Buddhism was thus wafted across the ocean, another stream of missionaries had found its way by Central Asia into China. Their first arrival in that empire is said to date from the 2d century B.C., although it was not till 65 a.d. that Buddhism there became an established religion. The Graeco-Bactrian kingdoms in the Punjab and beyond it afforded a favourable soil for the faith. The Scythian dynasties that succeeded them accepted it, and the earliest remains which recent discovery has unearthed in Afghânistân are Buddhist. Kanishka’s council, soon after the commencement of the Christian era, gave a fresh impetus to the faith. Tibet, south Central Asia, and China lay along the great missionary routes of northern Buddhism; the Kirghis are said to have carried Buddhist settlements as far west as the Caspian; on the east, the religion was introduced into the Korea in 372 a.d., and thence into Japan in 552.

Buddhism never ousted Brâhmanism from any large part of India. The two systems co-existed as popular religions during more than a thousand years (244 B.c. to about 800 λ.d.), and modern Hinduism is the joint product of both. Certain kings and certain eras were intensely Buddhistic; but the continuous existence of Brâhmanism is abundantly proved from the time of Alexander (327 b,c.) downwards. The historians who chronicled his march, and the Greek ambassador Megasthenes, who succeeded them (300 b.c.) in their literary labours, bear witness to the predominance of the old faith in the period immediately preceding Asoka. Inscriptions, local legends, Sanskrit literature, and the drama disclose the survival of Brâhman influence during the next six centuries (244 b.c. to 400 a.d.), From 400 a. I), we have the evidence of the Chinese pilgrims, who toiled through Central Asia into India as the birthplace of their faith. Fa-Hian entered India from Afghânistân, and journeyed down the whole Gangetic valley to the Bay of Bengal in 399-413 a.d. He found Brâhman priests equally honoured with Buddhist monks, and temples to the Indian gods side by side with the religious houses of his own faith. Hwen Tsang also travelled to India from China by the Central Asia route, and has left a fuller record of the state of the two religions in the 7th century. His journey extended from 629 to 645 a.d., and everywhere throughout India he found the two faiths eagerly competing for the suffrages of the people. By that time, indeed, Brâhmanism was beginning to assert itself at the expense of the other religion. The monuments of the great Buddhist monarchs, Asoka and Kanishka, confronted him from the time he neared the Punjab frontier; but so also did the temples of Siva and his “dread” queen Bhimâ. Throughout north-western India he found Buddhist convents and monks surrounded by “swarms of heretics.” The political power was also divided, although the Buddhist sovereigns predominated. A Buddhist monarch ruled over ten kingdoms in Afghânistân. At Peshâwar the great monastery built by Kanishka was deserted, but the populace remained faithful. In Kashmir king and people were devout Buddhists, under the teaching of five hundred monasteries and five thousand monks. In the country identified with Jâipur, on the other hand, the inhabitants were devoted to heresy and war.

Buddhist influence in northern India seems, during the 7th century a.d., to have centred in the fertile doâb or plain between the Jumna and the Ganges. At Kanauj (Kanyâkubja), on the latter river, Hwen Tsang found a powerful Buddhist monarch, Silâditya, whose influence reached from the Punjab to north-eastern Bengal, and from the Himâlayas to the Narbadâ river. There flourished one hundred Buddhist convents and ten thousand monks. But the king’s eldest brother had been lately slain by a sovereign of eastern India, a hater of Buddhism; and two hundred temples to the Brâhman gods reared their heads under the protection of the devout Silâditya himself. This monarch seems to have been an Asoka of the 7th century a.d., and he practised with primitive vigour the two great Buddhist virtues of spreading of the faith and charity. The former he attempted by means of a general council in 634 A.D. Twenty-one tributary sovereigns attended, together with the most learned Brâhman and Buddhist monks of their kingdoms. But the sole object of the convocation was no longer the undisputed assertion of the Buddhist religion. It dealt with the two distinct phases of the religious life of India. First there was a discussion between the Buddhists and Brâhmans, especially of the Sânkhya and Vaiseshika schools, and then followed a dispute between the two Buddhist sects who followed respectively the northern and the southern canons, known as “the greater and the lesser vehicle of the law.” The rites of the populace were of as composite a character as the doctrines of their teachers. On the first day of the council a statue of Buddha was installed with great pomp; on the second, an image of the sun-god; on the third, a figure of Siva.

Silâditya held a solemn distribution of his royal treasures every five years. Hwen Tsang describes how on the plain near Allahâbâd, where the Ganges and the Jumna unite their waters, all the kings of the empire, and a vast multitude of people, were feasted for seventy-five days. Silâditya brought forth the stores of his palace, and gave them away to Brâhmans and Buddhists, monks and heretics, without distinction. At the end of the festival he stripped off his jewels and royal raiment, gave them to the bystanders, and, like Buddha of old, put on the rags of a beggar. By this ceremony the monarch commemorated the Great Renunciation of the founder of the Buddhist faith, and at the same time practised the highest duty inculcated alike by the Buddhist and Brâhmanical religions, namely, almsgiving. Hwen Tsang describes a distribution on a smaller scale in the western kingdom of Valabhi (circa 636 a.d.). “For seven days every year the king holds a great assembly at which he distributes to the multitude of recluses choice dishes, the three garments, medicine, the seven precious things, and rare objects of [9:12:786] great value. After giving all these in alms he buys them back at double price.” The intellect of this king, we are told, was weak and narrow.^[32. Report of A relu Survey, Western India, for 1874-75, p. 83.] Similar “fields of charity” seem to have been held by many Buddhist princes in memory of the Great Renunciation. The vast monastery of Nalanda in Behar formed a seat of learning which recalls the universities of mediaeval Europe. Ten thousand monks and novices of the eighteen schools there studied theology, philosophy, law, science, especially medicine, and practised their devotions. They were supported from the royal funds.

Hwen Tsang travelled from the Punjab to the mouth of the Ganges, and made journeys into southern India. But everywhere he found the two religions mingled. Gayâ, which holds so high a sanctity in the legends of Buddha, had already become a great Brâhman centre. On the east of Bengal, Assam had never been converted to Buddhism. In the south-west, Orissa was a stronghold of the faith; at the seaport of Tamluk at the mouth of the Hügli (Hooghly ), the temples to the Brâhman gods were five times more numerous than the convents of the faithful. On the Madras coast Buddhism flourished; and indeed throughout southern India the faith seems still to have been in the ascendant, although struggling against Brâhman heretics and their gods.

During the next two centuries Brâhmanism gradually became the ruling religion. There are legends of persecutions instigated by Brâhman reformers, such as Kumarila Bhatta and Sankar-Achârjya. But the downfall of Buddhism seems to have resulted from natural decay, and from new movements of religious thought, rather than from any general suppression by the sword. Its extinction is contemporaneous with the rise of Hinduism, and belongs to a subsequent part of this sketch. In the 11th century, only outlying states, such as Kashmir and Orissa, remained faithful; and before the Mahometans fairly came upon the scene Buddhism as a popular faith had disappeared from India. During the last ten centuries Buddhism has been a banished religion from its native home. But it has won greater triumphs in its exile than it could ever have achieved in the land of its birth. It has created a literature and a religion for more than a third of the human race, and has profoundly affected the beliefs of the rest. Five hundred millions of men, or 35 per cent, of the inhabitants of the world, still follow the teaching of Buddha. Afghânistân, Nepâl, Eastern Turkistân, Tibet, Mongolia, Manchuria, China, Japan, the Eastern Archipelago, Siam, Burmah, Ceylon, and India at one time marked the magnificent circumference of its conquests. Its shrines and monasteries stretched in a continuous line from the Caspian to the Pacific, and still extend from the confines of the Russian empire to the equatorial archipelago. During twenty-four centuries Buddhism has encountered and outlived a series of powerful rivals. At this day it forms one of the three great religions of the world, and is more numerously followed than either Christiauity or Islâm. In India its influence has survived its separate existence. It not only left behind it a distinct sect, but it supplied a basis upon which Brâhmanism finally developed from the creed of a caste into the religion of the people. This Buddhistic influence ou Hinduism will be afterwards noticed. The distinct sect is known as the Jains (q.v.), who number about half a million^[33. Returned by the census of 1872 as 485,020 “Buddhists” in India, besides the 2,447,831 Buddhists in Burrnah. Except in a few spots, chiefly among the spurs of the Himalayas and in south-eastern Bengal, the Indian Buddhists may be generally reckoned as Jains.] in India. The noblest survivals of Buddhism in India are to be found, not among any peculiar body, but in the religion of the people; in that principle of the brotherhood of man, with the reassertion of which each new revival of Hinduism starts; in the asylum which the great Hindu sects afford to women wlιo have fallen victims to caste rules, to the widow and the out-caste; in that gentleness and charity to all men, which take the place of a poor-law in India, and give a high significance to the half-satirical epithet of the “mild” Hindu.

Greek-Roman Period.

The external history of India commences with the Greek invasion in 327 B.c. Some indirect trade between India and the Levant seems to have existed from very ancient times. Homer was acquainted with tin^[34. Greek, Kassiteros ; Sanskrit, Kastira ; hence, subsequently, the name of Cassiterides given to the Scilly Islands. Elephas, ivory, through the Arabian eleph (from Arabic el, the, and Sanskrit ibha, domestic elephant), is also cited.] and other articles of Indian merchandise by their Sanskrit names; and a long list has been made of Indian products mentioned in the Bible.^[35. Dr Birdwood's Handbook to the British Indian Section of the Paris Exhibition of 1878, pp. 20-35.] But the first Greek historian who speaks clearly of India was Hecataeus of Miletus (549-486 b.c.); the knowledge of Herodotus (450 B.c.) ended at the Indus; and Ctesias, the physician (401 B.c.), brought back from his residence in Persia only a few facts about the products of India, its dyes and fabrics, monkeys and parrots. India to the east of the Indus was first made known in Europe by the historians and men of science who accompanied Alexander the Great in 327 B.c. Their narratives, although now lost, are condensed in Strabo, Pliny, and Arrian. Soon afterwards Megasthenes, as Greek ambassador resident at a court in the centre of Bengal (30G-298 B.C.), had opportunities for the closest observation. The knowledge of the Greeks and Romans concerning India practically dates from his researches, 300 B,c.^[36. The fragments of the Indica of Megasthenes, collected by Dr Schwanbeck, with the first part of the Indica of Arrian, the Periplus Maris Erythraei, and Arrian’s Account of the Voyage of Nearchus, have been translated in two most useful volumes by Mr J. W. M i Crindle, Μ. A. (Triibner, 1877 and 1879). The Indica of Ctesias, with the 15th Book of Strabo, is also promised; and the difficult sections referring to India in Ptolemy’s Geographia, properly annotated, would complete a work of the highest value to Indian history.] δ

Alexander the Great entered India early in 327 B.c., crossed the Indus above Attock, and advanced, without a struggle, over the intervening territory of the Taxiles^[37. The Takkas, said to be a Turanian race, were the earliest inhabitants of Râwal Pindi district. They gave their name to the town of Takshasila or Taxila, which Alexander found “a rich and large city, the most populous between the Indus and Hydaspes” (Arrian); it is identified with the ruins of Deri Shahan. Taki or Asarur, on the road between Lahore and Pindi Bhatiyân, was the capital of the Punjab in 633 a. d.] to the Jhelum (Hydaspes). He found the Punjab divided into petty kingdoms, jealous of each other, and most of them inclined to join an invader rather than to oppose him. One of these local monarchs, Porus, disputed the passage of the Jhelum, with a force which, substituting guns for chariots, exactly equalled the army of Ranjit Sinh, the ruler of the Punjab in the present century.^[38. Professor Cowell, who thinks that the Greeks probably exaggerated the numbers of the enemy, judiciously remarks:—“Porus, one of several who occupied the Punjab, is said to have had 200 elephants, 300 chariots, 400 horse, and 30,000 efficient infantry; which, as observed by Sir A. Burnes, is (substituting guns for chariots) exactly the establishment of Ranjit Sinh, who was master of the whole Punjab and several other territories” (Cowell, App. iii. to Elphinstone’s Hist. Ind., p. 262, ed. 1866). General Cunningham, who has given a lucid account of the battle, with an excellent map, Anc. Geog. oj India, pp. 159-177 (ed. 1871), states the army of Alexander at “about 50,000 men, including 5000 auxiliaries under Mophis of Taxila.”] Plutarch gives a vivid description of the battle from Alexander’s own letters. Having drawn up his troops at a bend of the Jhelum, about 14 miles west of the modern field of [9:12:787] Chilianwàla,^[39. And about thirty miles south-west of Jhelum town.] the Macedonian general crossed under shelter of a tempestuous night. The chariots hurried out by Porus stuck in the muddy bank of the river, and in the general engagement which followed his elephants refused to face the Greeks, and, wheeling round, trampled his own army under foot. His son fell early in the onset; Purus himself fled wounded, but, on tendering his submission, was confirmed in his kingdom, and became the conqueror’s trusted friend.

Alexander built two memorial cities on the scene of his victory,—Bucephalia on the west bank, near the modern Jalàlpur, named after his beloved charger slain in the battle, and Nicaea, the present Mong, on the east side of the river.

Alexander advanced south-east through the kingdom of the younger Porus to Amritsar, and, after a sharp bend backward to the west, to fight the Cathaei at Sangala, he reached the Beas (Hyphasis). There, at a spot not far from the modern battlefield of Sobrâon, he halted his victorious standards.^[40. The change in the course of the Sutlej has altered the old position of that river to the Beas at this point. The best small map of Alexander’s route is No. V. in General Cunningham’s Ane. Geog. of India, p. 104 (ed. 1871)—64 miles to the inch.] He had resolved to march to the Ganges; but his troops were worn out by the heats of the Punjab summer, and their spirits broken by the hurricanes of the south-west monsoon. The native tribes had already risen in his rear, and the conqueror of the world was forced to turn back before he had crossed even the frontier province of India. The Sutlej, the eastern districts of the Punjab, and the mighty Jumna still lay between him and the Ganges. A single defeat might be fatal to his army; if the battle on the Jhelum had not gone in his favour, not a Greek would have reached the Afghân side of the passes. Yielding at length to the clamour of his troops, lie led them back to the Jhelum. He there embarked 8000 of them in boats previously prepared, and floated dυwu the river; the remainder of his army marched in two divisions along the banks.

The country was hostile, and the Greeks held only the land on which they encamped. At Mùltân (Mooltan), then as now the capital of the southern Punjab, he had to fight a pitched battle with the Malli, and was severely wounded in taking the city. His enraged troops put every soul within it to the sword. Farther down, near the confluence of the five rivers of the Punjab, he made a long halt, built a town,—Alexandria, the modern Uchch,—and received the submission of the neighbouring states. A Greek garrison and satrap, left there by Alexander, laid the foundation of a lasting influence. Having constructed a new fleet suitable for the greater rivers on which he was now to embark, he proceeded southwards through Sind, and followed the course of the Indus until he reached the ocean. In the apex of the delta he founded a city—Patala—which remains to this day under the name of Hyderabad, the capital of Sind.^[41. For its successive appearances in history, see General Cunningham’s Ane. Geog. of India, pp. 279-287, under Patala or Nirankot. He gives an excellent map of Alexander’s campaign in Sind at p. 248. Patala (Pattala, Pitasila, or Pattale) was formerly identified with Thatha, a town near to where the western arm of the Indus bifurcates (M*Crindle, Commerce and Navigation of the Erythroean Sea, p. 156, ed. 1879).] At the mouth of the Indus Alexander beheld for the first time the majestic phenomenon of the tides. One part of his army he shipped off under the command of Nearchus to coast along the Persian Gulf; the other he himself led through southern Baluchistân and Persia to Susa, where, after terrible losses from want of water and famine on the march, he arrived in 325 B.c.

During his two years’ campaign in the Punjab and Sind, Alexander captured no province, but he made alliances, founded cities, and planted garrisons. He had trans ferred much territory to chiefs and confederacies devoted to his cause; every petty court had its Greek faction; and the detachments which he left behind at various positions, from the Afghân frontier to the Beas, and from near the base of the Himâlayas to the Sind delta, were visible pledges of his return. At Taxila (Deri-Shahan) and Nicaea (Mong) in the northern Punjab, at Alexandria (Uchch) in the southern Punjab, at Patala (Hyderabad) in Sind, and at other points along his route, he established military settlements of Greeks or allies. A large body of his troops remained in Bactria; and, in the partition of the empire which followed Alexander’s death in 323 B.c., Bactria and India eventually fell to Seleucus Nicator, the founder of the Syrian monarchy.

Meanwhile a new power had arisen in India. Among the Indian adventurers who thronged Alexander’s camp in the Punjab, each with his plot for winning a kingdom or crushing a rival, Chandra Gupta, an exile from the Gangetic valley, seems to have played a somewhat ignominious part. He tried to tempt the wearied Greeks on the banks of the Beas with schemes of conquest in the rich south-eastern provinces; but, having personally offended their leader, he had to fly the camp (326 b.c.). In the confused years which followed, he managed, with the aid of plundering hordes, to form a kingdom on the ruins of the Nanda dynasty in Magadha, or Behar (316 b,c.). ^[42. Corpus Inscriptionum Indicarum, i. Pref. vii.] He seized the capital, Pataliputra, the modern Patnâ, established himself firmly in the Gangetic valley, and compelled the north-western principalities, Greeks and natives alike, to acknowledge his suzerainty.^[43. For the dynasty of Chandra Gupta see Numismata Orientalia (Ceylon fasciculus), pp. 41-50.] While, therefore, Seleucus was winning his way to the Syrian monarchy during the eleven years which followed Alexander’s death, Chandra Gupta was building up an empire in northern India. Seleucus reigned in Syria from 312 to 280 B,c., Chandra Gupta in the Gangetic valley from 316 to 292 b.c. In 312 B.c. the power of both had been consolidated, and the two new sovereignties were soon brought face to face.

In that year Seleucus, having recovered Babylon, proceeded to re-establish his authority in Bactria and the Punjab. In the latter province he found the Greek influence decayed. Alexander had left behind a mixed force of Greeks and Indians at Taxila. No sooner was he gone than the Indians rose and slew the Greek governor; the Macedonians massacred the Indians; a new governor, sent by Alexander, murdered the friendly Punjab prince, Porus, and was himself driven out of the country by the advance of Chandra Gupta from the Gangetic valley. Seleucus, after a war with Chandra Gupta, determined to ally himself with the new power in India rather than to oppose it. In return for five hundred elephants, he ceded the Greek settlements in the Punjab and the Cabul valley, gave his daughter to Chandra Gupta in marriage, and stationed an ambassador, Megasthenes, at the Gangetic court (circa 306-298 b.c.). Chandra Gupta became familiar to the Greeks as Sandrocottus, king of the Prasii; his capital, Pataliputra,^[44. The modern Patna, or Pattana, means simply “the city.’’ For its identification with Pataliputrapura and Mr Ilavenshaw’s crucial discoveries see General Cunningham’s Anc. Geog. India, p. 452 seq.] or Patna, was rendered into Palibothra. On the other hand, the names of Greeks and kings of Grecian dynasties appear in the rock inscriptions, under Indian forms.^[45. The Greeks as Yonas (Yavanas) are the '∖ioves or Ionians. In the 13th edict of Asoka five Greek princes appear: Antiochus (of Syria), Ptolemy (Philadelphus of Egypt), Antigonus (Gonatus of Macedon), Magas (of Cyrene), Alexander (II. of Epirus).]

Megasthenes has left a life-like picture of the Indian people. Notwithstanding some striking errors, the observations which he jotted down at Patna, three hundred years before Christ, give as [9:12:788] accurate an account of the social organization in the Gangetic valley as any which existed when the Bengal Asiatic Society commenced its labours at the end of the last century (1785). Up to the time of Megasthenes the Greek idea of India was a very vague one. Their historians spoke of two classes of Indians,—certain mountainous tribes who dwelt in northern Afghanistan under the Caucasus or Hindu Kush, and a maritime race living on the coast of Baluchistan. Of the India of modera geography lying beyond the Indus they practically knew nothing. It was this India to the east of the Indus that Megasthenes opened up to the Western world. He describes the classification of the people, dividing them, however, into seven castes instead of four,^[46. Ancient India as described by Megasthenes and Arrian, being fragments of the Indika, by J. W. M*Crindle, M.A., p. 40 (ed. 1877).] —namely, philosophers, husbandmen, shepherds, artisans, soldiers, inspectors, and the counsellors of the king. The philosophers were the Brahmans, and the prescribed stages of their life are indicated. Megasthenes draws a distinction between the Brahmans (Bpαχμαj∕es) and the Sarmanae CSapμdraι), from which some scholars have inferred that the Buddhist Sarmanas were a recognized class fifty years before the council of Asoka. But the Sarmanae also include Brahmans in the first and third stages of their life as students and forest recluses.^[47. Brahmachârins and Vanaprasthas (5λJ0ωι). Weber very properly declines to identify the ^S,apμdvat exclusively with the Buddhist Sarmana. Hist. Ind. Lit., p. 28 (ed. 1878).] The inspectors^[48. The tφoρoι (Diodorus, Strabo), tπlσκoπoι (Arrian).] or sixth class of Megasthenes have been identified with Asoka ’ s Mahâmâtra and his Buddhist inspectors of morals.

The Greek ambassador observed with admiration the absence of slavery in India, the chastity of the women, and the courage of the men. In valour they excelled all other Asiatics; they required no locks to their doors; above all, no Indian was ever known to tell a lie. Sober and industrious, good farmers, and skilful artisans, they scarcely ever had recourse to a lawsuit, and lived peaceably under their native chiefs. The kingly government is portrayed almost as described in Manu, with its hereditary castes of councillors and soldiers. Megasthenes mentions that India was divided into one hundred and eighteen kingdoms; some of which, such as that of the Prasii under Chandra Gupta, exercised suzerain powers. The village system is well described, each little rural unit seeming to be an independent republic. Megasthenes remarked the exemption of the husbandmen (Vaisyas) from war and public services, and enumerates the dyes, fibres, fabrics, and products (animal, vegetable, and mineral) of India. Husbandry depended on the periodical rains; and forecasts of the weather, with a view to “make adequate provision against a coming deficiency,” formed a special duty of the Brahmans. “The philosopher who errs in his predictions observes silence for the rest of his life.”

Before the year 300 B.c. two powerful monarchies had thus begun to act upon the Brâhmanism of northern India, from the east and from the west. On the east, in the Gangetic valley, Chandra Gupta (316-292 B.c.) firmly consolidated the dynasty which during the next century produced Asoka (264-223 B.C.), established Buddhism throughout India, and spread its doctrines from Afghânistân to China, and from Central Asia to Ceylon. On the west, the heritage of Seleucus (312-280 B.c.) diffused Greek influences, and sent forth Graeco-Bactrian expeditions to the Punjab. Antiochus Theos (grandson of Seleucus Nicator) and Asoka (grandson of Chandra Gupta), who ruled these two monarchies in the 3d century b.c., made a treaty with each other (256). In the next century Eucratides, king of Bactria, conquered as far as Alexander’s royal city of Patala, and possibly sent expeditions into Cutch and Guzerat, 181—161 b.c. Of the Graeco-Bactrian monarchs, Menander advanced farthest into North-Western India, and his coins are found from Cabul, near which he probably had his capital, as far as Muttra on the Jumna. The Buddhist dynasty of Chandra Gupta profoundly modified the religion of northern India from the east; the empire of Seleucus, with its Bactrian and later offshoots deeply influenced the science and art of Hindustan from the west.

Brâhman astronomy owed much to the Greeks, and what the Buddhists were to the architecture of northern India, that the Greeks were to its sculpture. Greek faces and profiles constantly occur in ancient Buddhist statuary, and enrich almost all the larger museums in

India. The purest specimens have been found in the Punjab, where the Ionians settled in greatest force. As we proceed eastward from the Punjab, the Greek type begins to fade. Purity of outline gives place to lusciousness of form. In the female figures, the artists trust more and more to swelling breasts and towering chignons, and load the neck with constantly accumulating jewels. N evertheless, the Grecian type of countenance long survived in Indian art. It is perfectly unlike the present coarse conventional ideal of sculptured beauty, and may even be traced in the delicate profiles on the so-called sun temple at Kanârak, built in the 12th century a,d. on the remote Orissa shore.

It must suffice to indicate the ethnical and dynastic influences thus brought to bear upon India, without attempting to assign dates to the individual monarchs. The chronology of the twelve centuries intervening between the Graeco-Bactrian period and the Mahometan conquest still depends on a mass of conflicting evidence derived from inscriptions, legendary literature, unwritten traditions, and coins.^[49. The evidence is well indicated in the Report of the Archaeological Survey of Western India for 1874-75, p. 49 (Mr E. Thomas’s monograph).] Four systems of computation exist, based upon the Vikramâditya, Saka, Seleucidan, and Parthian eras. In the midst of this confusion we see dim masses moving southwards from Central Asia into India. The Graeco-Bactrian kings are traced by coins as far as Muttra on the Jumna; and Sanskrit texts have recently revealed their advance through the Middle Land of the Brâhmans (Madhyadesha) to Sâketa (or Ajodhya), the capital of Oudh, and to Patnâ in Behar.^[50. Weber, Hist. Ind. Lit., p. 251-52, with his valuable notes, quoting Goldstiicker (ed. l a 78).] The credentials of the Indian embassy to Augustus in 22-20 B.c. were written on skins,— a circumstance which indicates the extent to which Greek usage had overcome Brâhmanical prejudices. During the century preceding the Christian era Scythian or Tartar hordes began to supplant the Graeco-Bactrian influence in the Punjab.

Scythic and Hon-Aryan Influences.

About 126 b.c. the Tartar tribe of Su is said to have driven out the Greek dynasty from Bactria, and the Graeco-Bactrian settlements in the Punjab were overthrown by the Tue-Chi.^[51. De Guignes, supported by Professor Cowell on the evidence of coins. Appendix to Elphinstone’s History of India, p. 269 (ed. 1866).] The Scythian migrations towards India culminated in the empire of Kanishka, who held the fourth Buddhist council, circa 40 a.d., and practically became the royal founder of northern Buddhism. The Scythic element played an important part in the history of northern India. Under Kanishka and his successors a connexion was established with the Buddhist nations of central and eastern Asia, traces of which survived to the time of Hwen Tsang (629-645 a.d.) in the name of China-pati, about 10 miles to the west of the Beas river.^[52. General Cunningham’s Anc. Geog. Ind., p. 200.] China-pati is said to have been the town which Kanishka appointed for the residence of his Chinese hostages, It has been suggested that the Aswamedha, or great horse sacrifice, in some of its Indian developments at any rate, was based upon Scythic ideas. “It was in effect,” writes Mr Edward Thomas, “a martial challenge, which consisted in letting the victim who was to crown the imperial triumph at the year’s end go free to wander at will over the face of the earth, its sponsor being bound to follow its hoofs, and to conqueror conciliate” the chiefs through whose territories it passed. Such α prototype seems to him to shadow forth the life of the Central Asia communities of the horseman class, “among [9:12:789] whom a steed captured in hostile forays had so frequently to be traced from camp to camp, and surrendered or fought for at last.”^[53. Report of Archaeological Survey of Western India, pp. 37, 38, 1876. But see, in opposition to Mr Thomas’s view, Μ. Senart in the French Journ. Asiatique, 1875, p. 126.]

An effort has been made to trace Buddha himself to a Scythic origin. He belonged to a royal stock of Sâkyas; and the Chinese records supply an intermediate link between his birthplace in Bengal and the supposed home of his race in Central Asia. It is inferred from them that a branch of the Scythian hordes who overran western Asia about 625 b.c. made its way to Patala on the Indus, the site selected by Alexander in 325 B.c. for his headquarters in that delta, and still the capital of Sind under the name of Hyderabad. One portion of these Patala Scythians went westwards by the Persian Gulf to Assyria; another section eventually moved north-east into the Gangetic valley, and became the Sâkyas of Kapilavastu, among whom Buddha was born.^[54. Catena of the Buddhist Scriptures fvorn the Chinese, by S. Beal, pp. 126-130 (Trübner, 1871).] His dying command, that he should be buried according to the old custom of his race, and a mound erected over his remains, is opposed to the Indo-Aryan form of obsequies by cremation; but it is essentially in accord with the Scythian mode of disposing of the dead. In the topes or funeral mounds of Buddhism is seen a reproduction of the royal Scythian tombs of which Herodotus speaks.^[55. Herod, iv. 71, 72, 217.] It is therefore argued that the Christian fathers trace back, by no accident, the Manichean doctrine to one “Scythianus,” whose disciple Terebinthus took the name of Buddha.^[56. “I believe,” says the greatest living authority on Indo-Chinese Buddhism, “the legend of Sâkya was perverted into this history of Scythianus.”—S. Beal, Catena, ut supra, p. 129, footnote.]

Whatever may be the value of this conjecture, the influence of the Scythian dynasties in northern India is an historical fact. The northern or Tibetan form of Buddhism, represented by Kanishka and his council in 40 a.d., made its way down to the plains of Hindustân, and during the next six centuries competed with the earlier Buddhism of Asoka. The Chinese pilgrim in 629-645 a.d. found both the northern or Scythic and the southern forms of Buddhism in full vigour in India. He spent fourteen months at China-pati, the town where Kanishka had kept his Chinese hostages in the Punjab; and he records the debates between the northern and southern sects of Buddhists in Oudh, Behar, Kâthiâwâr, and at other places. The Scythic influence in India was a dynastic as well as a religious one. Theevidenceof coins and the names of Indian tribes of reigning families, such as the Sâkas, Huns, and Nâgas, point to Scythian settlements as far south as the Central Provinces.^[57. Muir’s Sanskrit Texts, chap. v. vol. i, 1868; C. Grant’s Gazetteer of the Central provinces, lxx. &c., Nagpur, 1870; Reports of the Archaeological Survey of India and of Western India ; Professor H. H. Wilson (and Dr F. Hall), Vishnu Purâna, ii. 134.]

Many scholars believe that the Scythians poured down upon India in such masses as to supplant the previous population. The Jits or Jâts,^[58. The word occurs as Jâts and Jats, but the identity of the two forms has been established by reference to the Ain-i-Akbari. Some are Hindus, others Mahometans.] who form nearly one-half of the inhabitants of the Punjab, are identified with the Getae; their great subdivision the Dhe, with the Dahae, whom Strabo places on the shores of the Caspian. This view has received the support of most eminent investigators, from Professor H. H. Wilson to General Cunningham, the director-general of the archaeological survey.^[59. See, among other places, part iv. of Archaeological Report, p. 19.] The existing division between the Eastern Jâts and the Dhe has, indeed, been traced back to the contiguity of the Massa-getae or Great Getae^[60. Massa means “great” in Pehlevi.] and the Dahae, who dwelt by the side of each other in Central Asia, and who may have advanced together during the great Scythian movement towards India on the decline of the Bactrian empire. Without pressing such identifications too closely in the service of particular theories, the weight of authority is in favour of a Scythian origin for this most numerous and most industrious section of the population of the Punjab.^[61. It should be mentioned, however, that Dr Trumpp believes them to be of Aryan origin {Zeitsch. d. Deutsch. Morg. Gesellsch., xv. p. 690). See Mr J. Beames’s admirable edition of Sir Henry Elliot’s Glossary of the Races of the North-Western Provinces, vol. i. pp. 103-137 (ed. 1869).] A similar descent has been assigned to certain of the Râjput tribes. Colonel Tod, still the standard historian of Râjâsthân, strongly insisted on this point. Some relationship between the Jâts and the Râjputs, although obscure, is acknowledged; and, although the jus connubii no longer exists between them, an inscription shows that they intermarried in the 5th century a.d. ^[62. Inscription discovered in Kotah state; No. 1 of Inscription Appendix to Colonel Tod’s Annals and Antiquities of Râjâsthân, vol. i. p. 701, note 3 (Madras reprint, 1873).] ° Professor Cowell, indeed, regarded the arguments for the Scythic descent of the Râjputs as inconclusive.^[63. Appendix to Elphinstone’s Hist. Ind., pp. 250 seq. (ed. 1866).] But the whole evidence now collected was not before him; and authorities of great weight have deduced alike from local investigation^[64. Tod’s Râjâsthân, pp. 52, 483, 500, &c., vol. i. (Madras reprint, 1873).] and from Sanskrit literature^[65. Dr Fitz-Edward Hall’s edition of Professor H. H. Wilson’s Vishnu Purâna, vol. ii. p. 134. The Hûnas, according to Wilson, were “the White Huns, who were established in the Punjab and along the Indus, as we know from Arrian, Strabo, and Ptolemy, confirmed by recent discoveries of their coins and by inscriptions.” “I am not prepared,” says Dr Fitz-Edward Hall, “to deny that the ancient Hindus when they spoke of the Hûnas included the Huns. In the Middle Ages, however, it is certain that a race called Hûna was understood by the learned of India to form a division of the Kshattriyas.”—Professor Dowson’s Dick Hind. Mythology, <⅛c., p. 122.] a Scythic origin for the Jâts, and for some at least of the Râjput tribes. We shall see that the Scythian hordes also supplied certain of the NonAryan or so-called aboriginal races of India.

The Scythic settlement was not effected without a struggle. As Chandra Gupta advanced from the Gangetic valley, and rolled back the tide of Graeco-Bactrian conquest (circa 312-306 B.C.), so the Indian heroes of the first century before and after Christ are native princes who stemmed the torrent of Scythian invasion. Vikramâditya, king of Ujjain won his paramount place in Indian story by driving out the invaders. An era, the Samvat, beginning in 57 B.c. was founded in honour of his achievements. Its date^[66. Sarnvatsara, “the year.” The uncertainty which surrounds even this long accepted finger-post in Indian chronology may be seen from Dr J. Fergusson’s paper “On the Sâka and Samvat and Gupta Eras,” Journal Roy. As. Soc., new series, vol. xii., especially p. 172.] seems at variance with his legendary victories over the Scythian Kanishka in the first century after Christ;^[67. The Hushka, Jushka, and Kanishka family of the Râjâ Tarangini, or chronicles of Kashmir, are proved by inscriptions to belong to the 4th century of the Seleucidan era, or the 1st century a.d.] but his very name suffices to commemorate his struggle against the northern hordes as Vikramâditya Sakâri, or the enemy of the Scythians. His reign forms the Augustan era of Sanskrit literature; and tradition has ascribed the highest efforts of the Indian intellect during many centuries to the poets and philosophers, or nine gems, of his court. As Chandra Gupta, who freed India from the Greeks, is celebrated in the drama Mudra-rakshasa, so Vikramâditya, the vanquisher of the Scythians, forms the central royal personage of the Hindu stage.

Vikramâditya’s achievements, however, formed no final deliverance, but merely an episode in a long struggle between the Indian dynasties and new races from the north. Another popular era, the Saka (literally the [9:12:790] Scythian), takes its commencement in 78 a.d., ^[68. Monday, 14th March, 78 A.D., Julian style.] and is supposed to commemorate the defeat of the Scythians by a king of southern India, Salivâhana.^[69. General Cunningham. See also Mr E. Thomas’s letter, dated 16th September 1874, to the Academy, which brings this date within the period of the Kanishka family (2 B.c. to 87 a.d.).] During the seven centuries which followed, three powerful monarchies, the Sâhs, Guptas, and Valabhis, established themselves in northern and western India. The Sâhs of Surâshtra are traced by coins and inscriptions from 60 or 70 b.c. to after 235 a.d, ^[70. By Mr Newton. See Mr E. Thomas, “On the Coins of the Sah Kings,” Archaeol. Rep. Western India, p. 44, 1876; and Dr J. Fergusson, Journ. Roy. As. Soc., 1880.] After the Sâhs come the Guptas of Kanauj,^[71. Now a town of only 17,000 inhabitants in Farrakhàbâd district, but with ruins extending over a semicircle of 4 miles in diameter.] in the North-Western Provinces, the Middle Land (Madhyadesha) of ancient Brâhmanism. The Guptas introduced an era of their own, commencing in 319 b.c., and ruled in person or by viceroys over northern India during one hundred and fifty years, as far to the south-west as Kâthiâwâr The Gupta dynasty was overthrown by foreign invaders, apparently a new influx of Huns or Tartars from the north-west (450-470 A.D.). The Valabhis succeeded the Guptas, and ruled over Cutch, the northwestern districts of Bombay^[72. Lat-desa, including the collectorates of Surat, Broach, Kaira, and parts of Baroda territory.] and Mâlwâ, from 480 to after 722 a.d. ^[73. The genealogy is worked out in detail by Mr E. Thomas, ut supra, pp. 80-82.] The Chinese pilgrim gives a full account of the court and people of Valabhi (630-640 a,d.). Buddhism was the state religion, but heretics (Brâhmans) abounded; and the Buddhists themselves were divided between the northern school of the Scythian dynasties and the southern or Indian school of Asoka. The Valabhis seem to have been overthrown by the early Arab invaders of Sind in the 8th century.

The relations of these three Indian dynasties, the Sâhs, Guptas, and Valabhis, to the successive hordes of Scythians who poured down on northern India are obscure. There is abundant evidence of a long-continued struggle, but the attempt to assign dates to its chief episodes has not yet produced results which can be accepted as final. Two Vikramâditya Sakâris, or vanquishers of the Scythians, are required for the purposes of chronology; and the great battle of Korùr, near Mùltân, at which the Scythian hosts perished, has been shifted backwards and forwards from 78 to 544 a.d. ^[74. a.d. was the popularly received date, commemorated by the S&ka era; “between 524 and 544 a.d.” is suggested by Dr Fergusson (p. 284 of Journ. Roy. As. Soc., vol. xii.) in the latest discussion of the subject during 1880.] The truth seems to be that, during the first six centuries of the Christian era, the fortunes of the Scythian or Tartar races rose and fell from time to time in northern India. They more than once sustained great defeats; and they more than once overthrew the native dynasties. Their presence is abundantly attested during the century before Christ, represented by Vikramâditya (57 b.c.); during the first century after Christ, represented by the Kanishka family (2 b.c. to 87 a.d.); and thence to the time of Cosmas Indicopleustes, about 535 a d. The latest writer on the subject^[75. Dr J. Fergusson, ut supra, pp. 282-284, &c.] believes that it was the White Huns who overthrew the Guptas between 465 and 470 a.d. He places the great battles of KorUr and Maushari, which “freed India from the Sâkas and Hûnas,” between 524 and 544 a.d. Cosmas Indicopleustes, who traded in the Red Sea about 535 a.d., speaks of the Huns as a powerful nation in northern India in his days.^[76. Topographia Christiania, lib, xi. p. 338, Paris, 1707; apud Fergusson, ut supra.]

While Greek and Scythic influences had thus been at work in northern India during nine centuries (327 b.c. to 544 a.d.), another element was profoundly affecting the future of the Indian people. In a previous section we have traced the fortunes, and sketched the present condition, of the non-Aryan “aborigines.” The Brâhmanical Aryans never effected anything like a complete subjugation of these earlier races. The tribes and castes of non-Aryan origin still number about 18 millions in British territory; the castes who claim a pure Aryan descent are under 17 millions. The non-Aryans have influenced the popular dialects of almost every province, and in southern India have given their speech to 46 millions of people. The Vedic settlements along the five rivers of the Punjab were merely colonies or confederacies of Aryan tribes, who had pushed in among a non-Aryan population. When an Aryan family advanced to a new territory, it had often, as in the case of the Pândava brethren, to clear the forest and drive out the aboriginal people. This double process constantly repeated itself, and so late as 1657 a.D., when the Hindu râjâ founded the present city of Bareilly, his first work was to cut down the jungle and expel the Katheriyas. The ancient Brâhmanical kingdoms of the Middle Land, or Madhyadesha, in the North-Western Provinces and Oudh, were surrounded by non-Aryan peoples. All the legendary advances beyond the centre of Aryan civilization, narrated in the epic poets, were made into the territory of nonAryan races. When we begin to catch historic glimpses of India, we find the most powerful kingdoms ruled by nonAryan princes. Thus the Nandas, whom Chandra Gupta succeeded in Behar, were a Sùdra or non-Aryan dynasty; and, according to one account, Chandra Gupta and his grandson Asoka came of the same stock.^[77. The Mudrd-ràkshasa represents Chandra Gupta as related to the last of the Nandas; the commentator on the Vishnu Purâna says be was the son of a Nanda by a low-caste woman. Professor Dowson’s Diet. Hindu Mythology, &c., p. 68 (Triibner, 1879).]

The Buddhist religion did much to incorporate the nonAryan tribes into the Indian polity. During the long struggle against Graeco-Bactrian and Scythian inroads (327 b.c. to 544 a.d.), the Indian aboriginal races must have had an ever-increasing importance, whether as enemies or allies. At the end of that struggle we discover them in some of the fairest tracts of northern India. In almost every district throughout Oudh and the North-Western Provinces ruined towns and forts are ascribed to aboriginal races who ruled at different periods, according to the local legends, between the 5th and 11th centuries a.d. When the Mahometan conquest supplies an historical footing after 1000 a.d., non-Aryan races were in possession of some of these districts, and had been lately ousted from others.

The statistical survey has brought to light many traces of these obscure peoples. It would be impossible to follow that survey through each locality; but we propose, with the utmost brevity, to indicate a few of the results. Starting from the west, Alexander the Great found Râwal Pindi district in the hands of the Takkas or Takshaks, from whom its Greek name of Taxila was derived. This people has been traced to a Scythian migration about the 6th century b.c. ^[78. Such dates have no pretension to be anything more than intelligent conjectures based on very inadequate evidence. With regard to the Takshaks, see Colonel Tod and the authorities which he quotes, R6jΛs∙ thân, vol. i. 53 passim; 93 seq. (Madras reprint, 1873).] u Their settlements in the 4th century b.c. seem to have extended from the Paropamisan range^[79. Where Alexander found them as the Parae-tacae— pahàri, or Hill Tacae (?).] in Afghânistân deep into northern India. Their Punjab capital, Takshâsila or Taxila, was the largest city that Alexander found between the Indus and the Jhelum (327 [9:12:791] B.c.).^[80. Arrian. The Brdhman mythologists, of course, found an Aryan pedigree for so important a person as King Taksha, and make him the son of Bharata, and nephew of Rama-chandra!] Salihâvana, from whom the Sâka or Scythian era took its commencement (78 a.d.), is held by some authorities to have been a Takshak.^[81. Tod, Ràjàsthàn, i. 95 (ed. 1873).] In the 7th century a.d. Taki,^[82. Taki, or Asarυr, 45 miles west of Lahore. General Cunningham, Anc. Geog. Ind., p. 191, and map vi. (ed. 1871). This Taki lies considerably to the south-east of the Takshâsila of Alexander’s expedition.] perhaps derived from the same race, was the capital of the Punjab. The Scythic Takshaks are supposed to have been the source of the great serpent race, the Takshaks or Nâgâs, who figure so prominently in Sanskrit literature and art, and whose name is still retained by the Nâgâ tribes of our own day. The words Nâgâ and Takshak in Sanskrit both mean “a snake,” or mythological tailed monster. The Takshaks are identified with the Scythian Takkas, and the Nâ"âs have been connected with the Tartar patriarch Nagas, the second son of El-khân.^[83. Tod, RAjΛstMm, i. 53 (ed. 1873).] The two names, however, seem to have been applied by the Sanskrit writers to a variety of non-Aryan peoples in India, whose religion was of an anti-Aryan type. We learn, for example, how the four Pându brethren of the Mahâbhârata turned out ’ the snake-king Takshaka from his primaeval Khândava forest The Takshaks and Nâgâs were the tree and serpent worshippers, whose rites and objects of adoration have impressed themselves so deeply on the architecture and sculpture of India. The names were applied in a confused manner to different races of Scythic origin; and the greatest authority on tree and serpent worship in India has deliberately selected the term a Scythian” for the antiAryan elements which entered so largely into the Indian religions both in ancient and modern times.^[84. Dr J. Fergusson’s Tree and Serpent Worship, p. 71-72. (India Museum, 4to, 1868). For the results of more recent local research, see Mr Rivett-Carnac’s papers in the Journ. of the As. Soc., Bengal, “The Snake Symbol in India,” “Ancient Sculpturings on Rocks," “Stone Carvings at Mainpuri,” &c.; and the Hon. Rio Sihib Vish-vanâks Niriyan Mandlik’s “Serpent Worship in Western India,” and •other essays, in the Bombay As. Soc. Journal.] The Chinese records give a full account of the Nâgâ geography of ancient India. They enumerate numerous and powerful Nâgâ, kingdoms, from which Buddhism derived many of its converts. The Chinese chroniclers, indeed, classify the Nâgâ princes of India into two great divisions, as Buddhists and non-Buddhists. The serpent worship which formed so typical a characteristic.of the Indo-Scythic races led the Chinese to confound them with the objects of their adoration; and the Indian Nâgâs and their rites se m to have supplied the Dragon races of Chinese Buddhism and of religious and secular art in China.

As the Greek invaders found Râwal Pindi district in possession of a Scythic race of Takkas in 327 b,c., so the Musalmân conqueror found it inhabited by a fierce nonAryan race of Ghakkars thirteen hundred years later. The Ghakkars for a time imperilled the safety of Mahmùd of Ghazni in 1008 A.D. Ferishta describes them as savages addicted to polyandry and infanticide. The tide of Mahometan conquest rolled on, but the Ghakkars remained in possession of their submontane tract. In 1205 they slew the second Mahometan conquerer of India, Muhammad Ghori, in his tent, and ravaged the Punjab to the gates of Lahore; and, in spite of conversion to Islâm by the sword, it was not till 1525 that they made their submission to Bâbar in return for a grant of country. During the next two centuries they rendered great services to the Mughal dynasty against the Afghâu usurpers, and rose to high influence in the Punjab. Driven from the plains by the Sikhs in 1765, the Ghakkar chiefs maintained their independence in the Murree (Marri) Hills till 1830, when they were crushed after a bloody struggle. In 1849 Râwal Pindi passed, with the rest of the Sikh territories, under British rule. But the Ghakkars revolted four years afterwards, and threatened Murree, the summer capital of the Punjab, so late as 1857. They now number only 10,153 persons, described by the British officers as “a fine spirited race, gentlemen in ancestry and bearing, and clinging under all reverses to the traditions of noble blood.”

We have selected the inhabitants of Râwal Pindi district to illustrate the long-continued presence and vitality of the non-Aryan races in India. We shall deal more briefly with other parts of the country. Proceeding inwards to the North-Western Provinces, we find traces of an early Buddhist civilization having been overturned by rude nonAryan races. In Bareilly district, for example, the wild Ahirs from the north, the Bhils from the south, and the Bhars from the west seem to have expelled highly developed Aryan communities not long before 1000 a.d. Still farther to the east, all remains of prehistoric masonry in Oudh and the North-Western Provinces are assigned either to the ancient Buddhists or to a mediaeval race of Bhars. The Bhars appear to have possessed the north Gangetic plains in the centuries coeval with the fall of Buddhism. Their kingdoms extended over most of Oudh, and lofty mounds covered with ancient groves still mark the sites of their forgotten cities. They are the mysterious “fort-builders” to whom the peasantry ascribe any ruin of unusual size. In the western districts their power is said to have been crushed by the Sharki dynasty of Jaunpur in the end of the 14th century. In the eastern districts of the north Gangetic plain, the Bhars figure still more prominently in local traditions, and an attempt has been made to trace their continuous history. In Gorakhpur district a movement of aboriginal Tharus and Bhars seems to have overwhelmed the early outposts of Aryan civilization several centuries before Christ. They afterwards became vassals of the Buddhist kingdom of Behar on the south-east, and on the fall of that power, about 550, the Bhars regained their independence. The Chinese pilgrim in the 7th century comments on the large number of monasteries and towers in this region—the latter probably monuments of the struggle with the aboriginal Bhars, who were there finally crushed between the 7th and 10th centuries.

As we advance still farther eastwards into Bengal, we find that the non-Aryan races have within historical time supplied a large part of the Hindu population. In the north the Koch established their dominion upon the ruins of the Aryan kingdom of Kâmrùp, which the Afghân king of Bengal had overthrown in 1489. The Koch gave their name to the native state of Kuch (Cooch) Behar, and their descendants, together with those of other non-Aryan tribes, form the mass of the people in the neighbouring British districts. Some eluded the effects of their low origin by becoming Musalmâns, and thus obtained that social equality which Islâm grants to all mankind. The rest have merged more or less into the Hindu population; but masses of them claim, in virtue of their position as an old dominant race, to belong to the Kshattriya caste. They call themselves Râjbansis, a term exactly correspond ing to the Râjputs of western India. The râjâs of Kuch Behar lay claim to a divine origin, in order to conceal their aboriginal descent; and all remembrance of the Koch tribe is carefully avoided at court.

Proceeding still eastwards, we enter the adjacent valley of Assam, until last century the seat of another non-Aryan ruling race. The Ahams entered Assam from the southeast about 1350 (?), had firmly established their power by 1663, gradually yielded to Hinduism, and were overpowered by fresh invasions from Burmah between 1750 and 1820, when the valley was annexed to British India.
[9:12:792]

By the Burmese the Ahams have been completely crushed as a dominant race, and the>r national priests, to the number of 179,000, have been forced to till the soil togain their living. But the people of Assam are still so essentially made up of aboriginal races and their Hinduized descendants that not 65,000 persons of even alleged pure Aryan descent can be found in a population exceeding 4 millions.

We have hitherto confined our survey to the country on the north of the Ganges. If we pass to the southern Gangetic plain, we find that almost every tract has traditions of a non-Aryan tribe, either as a once dominant race or as lying at the root of the local population. The great division of Bundelkhand contains several crushed peoples of this class, and takes its name from the Bundelas, a tribe of at least semi-aboriginal descent. As we rise from the Gangetic plain into the highlands of the Central Provinces, we reach the abiding home of the non-Aryan tribes. One such race after another—Gaulis, Nâgâs, Gonds, Ahirs— ruled from the Sâtpura plateau. If we turn to the lower provinces of Bengal we find the delta peopled by masses of non-Aryan origin. One section of them has merged into low-caste Hindus; another section has sought a more equal social organization by accepting the creed of Mahomet. But such changes of faith do not alter their ethnical type; and the Musalmân of the delta differs as widely in race from the Afghân as the low-caste Hindu of the delta differs from the Brâhman. Throughout southern India the non-Aryan elements make up almost the entire population, and have supplied the great Dravidian family of languages, spoken by 46 millions of people.

Hahometan Period.

At the very time that Buddhism was being crusned out of India by the Brâhmanic reaction, a new faith was being born in Arabia, destined to supply a youthful fanaticism which should sweep the country from the Himalayas to Cape Comorin, and from the western to the eastern sea. Muhammad, commonly known as Mahomet, the founder of Islam, died at Medina in 632 A.D., while the Chinese • pilgrim Hwen Tsang was still on his travels. The first Mahometan invasion of India is placed in 664, only thirty-two years after the death of the prophet. The Punjab is said to have been ravaged on this occasion with no permanent results. The first Mahometan conquest was the outlying province of Sind, which from the point of view of geology may be regarded as a continuation of the desert of Baluchistan. In 711, or seventy-nine years after the death of Mahomet, an Arab army under Muhammad Kâsim invaded and conquered the Hindus of Sind in the name of Walid I., caliph of Damascus, of the Bene-Umyyeh line. In the same year Roderic, the last of the Goths, fell before the victorious Saracens in Spain. But in India the bravery of the Rajputs and the devotion of the Brâhmans seem to have afforded a stronger national bulwark than existed in western Europe. In 750 the Hindus rose in rebellion and drove out the Musalmân tyrant, and the land had rest for one hundred and fifty years.

The next Mahometan invasion of India is associated with the name of Sultân Mahmùd of Ghazni. Mahmùd was the eldest son of Sabuktagin, surnamed Nasr-ud-din, in origin a Turkish slave, who had established his rule over the greater part of modern Afghanistan and Khorasân with Ghazni as his capital. In 977 Sabuktagin is said to have defeated Jâipal, the Hindu râjâ of Lahore, and to have rendered the Punjab tributary. But his son Mahmùd was the first of the great Musalmân conquerors whose names still ring through Asia. Mahmιid succeeded to the throne in 997. During his reign of thirty-three years he extended the limits of his father’s kingdom from Persia on the east to the Ganges on the west; and it is related that he led his armies into the plains of India no less than seventeen times. In 1001 he defeated Râjâ Jâipal a second time, and took him prisoner. But Anandpal, the son of Jâipal’ raised again the standard of national independence, and gathered an army of Râjput allies from the furthest comers of Hindustân. The decisive battle was fought in the valley of Peshâwar. Mahmùd won the day by the aid of his Turkish horsemen, and thenceforth the Punjab has been a Mahometan province, except during the brief period of Sikh supremacy. The most famous of Mahmùd’s invasions of India was that undertaken in 1024 against Guzerat. The goal of this expedition was the temple dedicated to Siva at Somnâth, around which so many legends have gathered. It is reported that Mahmùd marched through Ajmir, to avoid the desert of Sind; that he found the Hindus gathered on the neck of the peninsula of Somnâth in defence of their holy city; that the battle lasted for two days; that in the end the Râjput warriors fled to their boats, while the Brâhman priests retired into the inmost shrine; that Mahmιid, introduced into this shrine, rejected all entreaties by the Brâhmans to spare their idol, and all offers of ransom; that he smote the image with his club, and forthwith a fountain of precious stones gushed out. Until the British invasion of Afghânistân in 1839, the club of Mahmùd and the sandal-wood gates of Somnâth were preserved at the tomb of the great conqueror near Ghazni. The club has now disappeared, and the gates carried back to India by General Nott are recognized to be a clumsy forgery. To Mahometans Mahmùd is known, not only as a champion of the faith, but as a munificent patron of literature. The dynasty that he founded was not long-lived. Fourteen of his descendants occupied his throne within little more than a century, but none of them achieved greatness. A bloodfeud arose between them and a line of Afghân princes who had established themselves among the mountains of Ghor. In 1152 Bahrâm, the last of the Ghaznivide Turks, was overthrown by Allah-ud-din of Ghor, and the wealthy and populous city of Ghazni was razed to the ground. But even the Ghoride conqueror spared the tomb of Mahmùd.

Khusru, the son of Bahrâm, fled to Lahore, and there established the first Mahometan dynasty within India. It speedily ended with his son, also called Khusru, whom Muhammad Ghori, the relentless enemy of the Ghaznivide house, carried away into captivity in 1186.

The Afghâns of Ghor or Ghur thus rose to power on the downfall of the Turks of Ghazni. The founder of the family is said to have been Izzud-din al Husâin, whose son Allah-ud-din destroyed Ghazni, as already mentioned. Allah-ud-din had two nephews, Ghiyâs-ud-din and Muiz-ud-din, the latter of whom, also called Shahab-ud-din by Musalmân chroniclers, and generally known in history as Muhammad Ghori, is the second of the great Mahometan conquerors of India. In 1176 he took Mùltân and Uchch; in 1187 Lahore fell into his hands; in 1191 he was repulsed before Delhi, but soon afterwards he redeemed this disaster. Hindustân Proper was at that period divided between the two Râjput kingdoms of Kanauj and Delhi. Muhammad Ghori achieved his object by playing off the rival kings against each other. By 1193 he had extended his conquests as far east as Benares, and the defeated Râjputs migrated in a body to the hills and deserts now known as Râjputâna. In 1199 one of his lieutenants, named Bakhtiyar, advanced into Bengal, and expelled by an audacious stratagem the last Hindu râjâ of Nadiyâ. The entire northern plain, from the Indus to the Brahmaputra, thus lay under the Mahometan yoke. But Muhammad Ghori never settled himself permanently in India. His favourite residence is said to have been the old capital of Ghazni, while he governed his Indian conquests through the agency [9:12:793] of a favourite slave, Kutab-ud-din. Muhammad Ghori died in 1206, being assassinated by some Ghakkar tribesmen while sleeping in his tent by the bank of the Indus; on his death both Ghor and Ghazni drop out of history, and Delhi first appears as the Mahometan capital of India.

On the death of Muhammad Ghori, Kutab-ud-din at once laid aside the title of viceroy, and proclaimed himself sultân of Delhi. He was the founder of what is known as the slave dynasty, which lasted for nearly a century (1206-1288). The name of Kutab is preserved in the minar, or pillar of v.’ct >ry, which still stands amid the ruins of ancient Delhi, towering high above all later structures. Kutab himself is said to have been successful as a general and an administrator, but none of his successors has left a mark in history.

In 1294 Allah-ud-din Khiljf, the third of the great Mahometan conquerors of India, raised himself to the throne of Delhi by the treacherous assassination of his uncle Firoz II., who had himself supplanted the last of the slave dynasty. Allah-ud-din had already won military renown by his expeditions into the yet unsubdued south. He had plundered the temples at Bhilsa in central India, which are admired to the present day as the most interesting examples of Buddhist architecture in the country. At the head of a small band of horsemen, he had ridden as far south as Deogiri in the Deccan, and plundered the Marhattâ capital. When once established as sultân, he planned more extensive schemes of conquest. One army was sent to Guzerat under Alaf Khân, who conquered and expelled the last Râjput king of Anhalwâr or Pâtan. Another army, led by the sultân in person, marched into the heart of Râjputâna, and stormed the rock-fortress of Chitor, where the Râjputs had taken refuge with their women and children. A third army, commanded by Malik Kafιir, a Hindu renegade and favourite of Allah-ud-din, penetrated to the extrem? south of the peninsula, scattering the unwarlike Dravidian races, and stripping every Hindu temple of its accumulations of gold and jewels. To this day the name of Malik Kafùr is remembered in the remote district of Madura, in association with irresistible fate and every form of sacrilege.

Allah-ud-din died in 1316, having subjected to Islâm the Deccan and Guzerat. Three of his descendants followed him upon the throne, but their united reigns extended over only five years. In 1321 a successful revolt was headed by Ghiyas ud-din Tughlak, governor of the Punjab, who is said to have been of Turkish origin. The Tughlak dynasty lasted for about seventy years, until it was swept away by the invasion of Timûr, the fourth Mahometan conqueror of India, in 1398. Ghiyas-ud-din, the founder of the line, is only known for having removed the capital from Delhi to a spot about 4 miles further to the east, which he called Tughlakâbâd. His son and successor, Muhammad Tughlak, who reigned from 1325 to 1351, is described by Elphinstone as “one of the most ’ accomplished princes and one of the most furious tyrants that ever adorned or disgraced human nature.” He wasted the treasure accumulated by Allah-ud-din in purchasing the retirement of the Mughal hordes, who had already made their appearance in the Punjab. When the internal circulation failed, he issued a forced currency of copper, which is said to have deranged the whole commerce of the country At one time he raised an army for the invasion of Persia. At another he actually despatched an expedition against China, which perished miserably in the Himâkyan passes. When Hindustan was thus suffering from his misgovernment, he conceived the project of transferring the seat of empire to the Deccan, and compelled the inhabitants of Delhi to remove a distance of 700 miles to Deogiri or Daulatâbâd. And yet during the reign of this sultân both the Tughlak dynasty and the city of Delhi are said to have attained their utmost growth. Muhammad was succeeded by his cousin Firoz, who likewise was not content without a new capital, which he placed a few miles north of Delhi, and called after his own name. Meanwhile the remote provinces of the empire began to throw off their allegiance to the sultâns of Delhi. The independence of the Afghân kings of Bengal is generally dated from 1336, when Muhammad Tughlak was yet on the throne. The commencement of the reign of Allah-ud-din, the founder of the Bâhmani dynasty in the Deccan, is variously assigned to 1347 and 1357. Zafar Khân, the first of the Ahmadâbâd kings, acted as an independent ruler from the time of his first appointment as governor of Guzerat in 1391. These and other revolts prepared the way for the fourth great invasion of India under Timûr (Tamerlane).

Accordingly, when Timûr invaded India in 1398, he encountered but little organized resistance. Mahmιid, the last of the Tughlak dynasty, being defeated in a battle outside the walls of Delhi, fled into Guzerat. The city was sacked and the inhabitants massacred by the victorious Mughals. But the invasion of Timûr left no permanent impress upon the history of India, except in so far as its memory fired the imagination of Bâbar (Baber), the founder of the Mughal dynasty. The details of the fighting and of the atrocities may be found related in cold blood by Timûr himself in the Malfuzat-i-Timûri, which has been translated in Elliot’s History of India as told by its own Historians, vol. iii. Timûr marched back to Samarkand as he had come, by way of Cabul, and Mahmûd Tughlak ventured to return to his desolate capital. He was succeeded by what is known as the Sayyid dynasty, which held Delhi and a few miles of surrounding country for about forty years. The Sayyids were in their turn expelled by Beloli, an Afghan of the Lodi tribe, whose successors removed the seat of government to Agra, which thus for the first time became the imperial city. In 1525 Bâbar (Baber), the fifth in descent from Timûr, and also the fifth Mahometan conqueror, invaded India at the instigation of the governor of the Punjab, won the victory of Pânipat over Ibrâhîm, the last of the Lodi dynasty, and founded the Mughal empire, which lasted, at least in name, until 1857.

Before entering upon the story of the Mughal empire, it is desirable to give a short sketch of the condition of southern India at this period, which marks a turning point in Indian history. The earliest local traditions agree in dividing the extreme south into four provinces, Kerala, Pandya, Chola, and Chera, which together made up the country of Dravida, occupied by Tamil-speaking races. Of these kingdoms the greatest was that of Pandya, with its capital of Madura, the foundation of which is assigned on high authority to the 4th century b.c. Other early southern cities whose sites can be identified are Combaconum and Tanjore, the successive capitals of the Chola kingdom, and Talkad in Mysore, now buried by the sands of the Kâveri (Cauvery), the capital of the Chera kingdom. The local Parana, or chronicle of Madura, gives a list of two Pandyan dynasties, the first of which has seventy-three kings, the second forty-three. Parakrama, the last king of the second dynasty, was overthrown by the Mahometan invader, Mâlik Kafûr, in 1324; but the Musalmâns never established their power in the extreme south, and a series of Hindu lines ruled at Madura into the 18th century. No other Dravidian kingdom can boast such a continuous succession as that of Madura. The chronicles enumerate fifty Chera kings, and no less than sixty-six Chola kings,, as well as many minor dynasties which ruled at various periods over fractions of the south. Little confidence, however, can be placed in Hindu genealogies, and the early history of the Dravidian races yet [9:12:794] remains to be deciphered from mouldering palm leaves and the more trustworthy inscriptions on copper and stone. Authentic history begins with the Hindu empire of Vijayanagar or Narsingha, which exercised an ill defined sovereignty over the entire south from the 12th to the 16th century. The foundation of the city of Vijayanagar is assigned to the year 1118, and to an eponymous hero, Râjâ Vijaya, the fifth of his line. Its extensive ruins are still to be traced on the right bank of the Tungabhadra river within the Madras district of Bellary. The city itself has not been inhabited since it was sacked by the Mahometans in 1565, but vast remains still exist of temples, fortifications, tanks, and bridges, haunted by beasts of prey and venomous reptiles. The empire of Vijayanagar represents the last stand made by the national faith in India against conquering Islam. For at least three centuries its sway over the south was undisputed, and its râjâs waged wars and concluded treaties of peace with the sultâns of the Deccan on equal terms.

The earliest of the Mahometan dynasties in the Deccan was that founded by Allah-ud-din in 1347 or 1357, which has received the name of the Bâhmani dynasty from the supposed Brâhman descent of its founder. The capital was first at Gulbargah, and was afterwards removed to Bidar, both which places still possess magnificent palaces and mosques in ruins. Towards the close of the 14th century the Bâhmani empire fell to pieces, and five independent kingdoms divided the Deccan among them. These were— (1) the Adil Shâhi dynasty, with its capital at Bijapur, founded in 1489 by a son of Amurath II., sultân of the Ottomans; (2) the Kutab Shâhi dynasty, with its capital at Golconda, founded in 1512 by a Turkoman adventurer; (3) the Nizâm Shâhi dynasty, with its capital at Ahmadnagar, founded in 1490 by a Brâhman renegade, from the Vijayanagar court; (4) the ïmad Shâhi dynasty of Berar, with its capital at Ellichpur, founded in 1484 also by a Hindu from Vijayanagar; (5) the Barid Shâhi dynasty, with its capital at Bidar, founded about 1492 by one who is variously described as a Turk and a Georgian slave. It is, of course, impossible here to trace in detail the history of these several dynasties. In 1565 they combined against the Hindu râjâ of Vijayanagar, who was defeated and slain in the decisive battle of Talikota. But, though the city was sacked and the supremacy of Vijayanagar for ever destroyed, the Mahometan victors did not themselves advance into the south. The Naiks or feudatories of Vijayanagar everywhere asserted their independence. From them are descended the well-known Pâlegârs of the south, and also the present râjâ of Mysore. One of the bloodroyal of Vijayanagar fled to Chandragiri, and founded a line which exercised a prerogative of its former sovereignty by granting the site of Madras to the English in 1639. Another scion claiming the same high descent lingers to the present day near the ruins of Vijayanagar, and is known as the râjâ of Anagundi, a feudatory of the nizâm of Hyderabad. Despite frequent internal strife, the sultâns of the Deccan retained their independence until conquered by the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb in the latter half of the 17th century. To complete this sketch of India at the time of Bâbar’s invasion it remains to say that an independent Mahometan dynasty reigned at Ahmadâbâd in Guzerat for nearly two centuries (from 1391 to 1573), until conquered by Akbar; and that Bengal was similarly independent, under a line of Afghân kings, with Gaur for their capital, from 1336 to 1573. When, therefore, Bâbar invaded India in 1525, the greater part of the country was Mahometan, but it did not recognize the authority of the Afghân sultan of the Lodi dynasty, who resided at Agra, and also ruled the historical capital of Delhi. After having won the battle of Pânipat, Bâbar was no more acknowledged as emperor of India than his ancestor Timûr had been Bâbar, however, unlike Timûr, had resolved to settle in the plains of Hindustân, and carve out for himself a new empire with the help of his Mughal followers. His first task was to repel an attack by the Râjputs of Chitor, who seem to have attempted to re-establish at this time a Hindu empire. The battle was fought at Sikri near Agra, and is memorable for the vow made by the easy living Bâbar that he would never again touch wine. Bâbar was again victorious, but died shortly afterwards in 1530. He was succeeded by his son Humâyiïn, who is chiefly known as being the father of Akbar. In Humâyùn’s reign the subject Afghâns rose in revolt under Sher Shâh, a native of Bengal, who for a short time established his authority over all Hindustân. Humâyùn was driven as an exile into Persia; and, while he was flying through the desert of Sind, his son Akbar was born to him in the petty fortress of Umarkot. But Sher Shâh was killed at the storming of the rock-fortress of Kâlinjar, and Humâyùn, after many vicissitudes, succeeded in re-establishing his authority at Lahore and Delhi.

Humâyùn died by an accident in 1556, leaving but a circumscribed kingdom, surrounded on every side by active foes, to his son Akbar, then a boy of only fourteen years. Akbar the Great, the real founder of the Mughal empire as it existed for two centuries, was the contemporary of our own Queen Elizabeth (1558-1603). He was born in 1542, and his reign lasted from 1556 to 1605. When his father died he was absent in the Punjab, fighting the revolted Afghâns, under the guardianship of Bairâm Khân, a native of Badakshân, whose military skill largely contributed to recover the throne for the Mughal line. For the first seven years of his reign Akbar was perpetually engaged in warfare. His first task was to establish his authority in the Punjab, and in the country around Delhi and Agra. In 1568 he stormed the Râjput stronghold of Chitor, and conquered Ajmir. In 1570 he obtained possession of Oudh and Gwalior. In 1572 he marched in person into Guzerat, defeated the last of the independent sultâns of Ahmadâbâd, and formed the province into a Mughal viceroyalty or subah. In the same year his generals drove out the Afghâns from Bengal, and reunited the lower valley of the Ganges to Hindustân. Akbar was then the undisputed ruler of a larger portion of India than had ever before acknowledged the sway of one man. But he continued to extend his conquests throughout his lifetime. In 1578 Orissa was annexed to Bengal by his Hindu general Todar Mall, who forthwith organized a revenue survey of the whole province. Cabul submitted in 1581, Kashmir in 1586, Sind in 1592, and Kandahâr in 1594. At last he turned his arms against the Mahometan kings of the Deccan, and wrested from them Berar; but the permanent conquest of the south was reserved for Aurangzeb.

If the history of Akbar were confined to this long list of conquests, his name would on their account alone find a high place among those which mankind delights to remember. But it is as a civil administrator that his reputation is cherished in India to the present day. With regard to the land revenue, the essence of his procedure was to fix the amount which the cultivators should pay at one-third of the gross produce, leaving it to their option to pay in money or in kind. The total land revenue received by Akbar amounted to about 16∣ millions sterling. Comparing the area of his empire with the corresponding area now under the British, it has been calculated that Akbar, three hundred years ago, obtained 15j millions where they obtain only 13⅛ millions,—an amount representing not more than one-half the purchasing pcΛ ’ er of Akbar’s 154 millions. The distinction between khalsä [9:12:795] land, or the imperial demesne, and jagir lands, granted revenue free or at quit rent in reward for services, also dates from the time of Akbar. As regards his military system, Akbar invented a sort of feudal organization, by which every tributary râjâ took his place by the side of his own Mughal nobles. In theory it was an aristocracy based only upon military command; but practically it accomplished the object at which it aimed by incorporating the hereditary chiefships of Râjputâna among the mushroom „.cations of a Mahometan despotism. Musalmâns and Hindus were alike known only as mansabdars or commanders of so many horse, the highest title being that of amir (ameer), corrupted by European travellers into umrah or omrah. The third and last of Akbar’s characteristic measures were those connected with religious innovation, about which it is difficult to speak with precision. The necessity of conciliating the proud warriors of Râjputana had taught him toleration from his earliest dιys. His favourite wife was a Râjput princess, and another wife is said to have been a Christian. O.ut of four hundred and fifteen of his mansabddrs whose names are recorded, as many as fifty-one were Hindus. Starting from the broad ground of general toleration, Akbar was gradually led on by the stimulus of cosmopolitan discussion to question the truth of his inherited faith. The counsels of his friend Abul Fazl, coinciding with that sense of superhuman omnipotence which is bred of despotic power, led him at last to promulgate a new state religion, based upon natural theology, and comprising the best practices of all known creeds. In this strange faith Akbar himself was the prophet, or rather the head of the church. Every morning he worshipped the sun in public, as being the representative of the divine soul that animates the universe, while he was himself worshipped by the ignorant multitude.

Akbar died in 1605, in his sixty-third year. He lies buried beneath a plain slab in the magnificent mausoleum which he had reared at Sikandra, near his capital of Agra. As his name is still cherished in India, so his tomb is still honoured, being covered by a cloth presented by Lord Northbrook when viceroy in 1873.

The reign of Jahângir, his son, extended from 1605 to 1627. It is chiefly remarkable for the influence exercised over the emperor byhis favourite wife, surnamed Nùr Mahâl, or the Light of the Harem. The currency was struck in her name, and in her hands centred all the intrigues that made up the work of administration. She lies buried by the side of her husband at Lahore, whither the seat of government had been moved by Jahângfr, just as Akbar had previously transferred it from Delhi to Agra. It was in the reign of Jahângfr that the English first established themselves at Surat, and also sent their first embassy to the Mughal court.

Jahângfr was succeeded by his son Shâh Jahân, who had rebelled against his father, as Jâhangfr had rebelled against Akbar. Shâh Jahân’s reign is generally regarded as the period when the Mughal empire attained its greatest magnificence, though not its greatest extent of territory. He founded the existing city of Delhi, which is still known to its Mahometan inhabitants as Jahânâbâd. At Delhi also he erected the celebrated peacock throne; but his favourite place of residence was Agra, where his name will ever be associated with the marvel of Indian architecture, the Tâj Mahâl. That most chaste and most ornamental of buildings was erected by Shâh Jahân as the mausoleum of his favourite wife Mumtaz Mahâl, and he himself lies by her side. It is said that twenty thousand workmen laboured on the work for twenty years. Besides the Tâj, Shâh Jahân also built at Agra within the old fort the palace and the pearl mosque, both of which, like the Tâj, have been preserved to be objects of admiration to the present day. Shâh Jahân had four sons, whose fratricidal wars for the succession during their father’s lifetime it would be tedious to dwell upon. Suffice it to say that Aurangzeb, by mingled treachery and violence, supplanted or overthrew his brothers and proclaimed himself emperor in 1658, while Shâh Jahân was yet alive.

Aurangzeb’s long reign, from 1658 to 1707, may be regarded as representing both the culminating point of Mughal power and the beginning of its decay. Unattractive as his character was, it contained at least some elements of greatness. None of his successors on the throne was anything higher than a debauchee or a puppet. He was the first to conquer the independent sùltâns of the Deccan, and to extend his authority to the extreme south. But even during his lifetime two new Hindu nationalities were being formed in the Marhattâs and the Sikhs; while immediately after his death the nawabs of the Deccan, of Oudh, and of Bengal raised themselves to practical independence. Aurangzeb had indeed enlarged the empire, but he had not strengthened its foundations. During the reign of his father Shâh Jahân he had been viceroy of the Deccan or rather of the northern portion only, which had been annexed to the Mughal empire since the reign of Akbar. His early ambition was to conquer the Mahometan kings of Bijapur and Golconda, who, since the downfall of Vijayanagar, had been practically supreme over the south. This object was not accomplished without many tedious campaigns, in which Sivaji, the founder of the Marhattâ confederacy, first comes upon the scene. In name Sivaji was a feudatory of the house of Bijapur, on whose behalf he held the rock-forts of his native Ghâts; but in fact he found his opportunity in playing off the Mahometan powers against one another, and in rivalling Aurangzeb himself in the art of treachery. In 1680 Sivaji died, and his son and successor, Sambhaji, was betrayed to Aurangzeb and put to death. The rising Marhattâ power was thus for a time checked, and the Mughal armies were set free to operate in the eastern Deccan. In 1686 the city of Bijapur was taken by Aurangzeb in person, and in the following year Golconda also fell. No independent power then remained in the south, though the numerous local chieftains, known as pälegärs and naiks, never formally submitted to the Mughal empire. During the early years of his reign Aurangzeb had fixed his capital at Delhi, while he kept his dethroned father, Shâh Jahân, in close confinement at Agra. In 1682 he set out with his army on his victorious march into the Deccan, and from that time until his death in 1707 he never again returned to Delhi. In this camp life Aurangzeb may be taken as representative of one aspect of the Mughal rule, which has been picturesquely described by European travellers of that day. They agree in depicting the emperor as a peripatetic sovereign, and the empire as held together by its military highways no less than by the strength of its armies.. The great road running across the north of the peninsula, from Dacca in the east to Lahore in the west, is generally attributed to the Afghân usurper, Sher Shâh. The other roads branching out southward from Agra, to Surat and Burhanpur and Golconda, were undoubtedly the work of Mughal times. Each of these roads was laid out with avenues of trees, with wells of water, and with frequent sardis or rest-houses. Constant communication between the capital and remote cities was maintained by a system of foot-runners, whose aggregate speed is said to have surpassed that of a horse. Commerce was conducted by means of a caste of bullock-drivers, whose occupation in India is hardly yet extinct.

On the death of Aurangzeb in 1707, the decline of the Mughal empire set in with extraordinary rapidity. Ten [9:12:796] emperors after Aurangzeb are enumerated in the chronicles, but none of them has left any mark on history. His son and successor was Bahâdur Shâh, who reigned only five years. Then followed in order three sons of Bahâdur Shâh, whose united reigns occupy only five years more. In 1739 Nâdir Shâh of Persia, the sixth and last of the great Mahometan conquerors of India, swept like a whirlwind over Hindustân, and sacked the imperial city of Delhi Thenceforth the Great Mughal (Mogul) became a mere name, though the hereditary succession continued unbroken down to our own day Real power had passed into the hands of Mahometan courtiers and Marhattâ generals, both of whom were then carving for themselves kingdoms out of the dismembered empire, until at last British authority placed itself supreme over all. From the time of Aurangzeb no Musalmân, however powerful, dared to assume the title of sultân or emperor, with the single exception of Tipù’s brief paroxysm of madness. The name of nawab, corrupted by Europeans into “nabob,” appears to be an invention of the Mughals to express delegated authority, and as such it is the highest title conferred upon Mahometans at the present day, as mahdrdjd is the highest title conferred upon Hindus. At first nawâbs were only found in important cities, such as Surat and Dacca, with the special function of administering civil justice; criminal justice was in the hands of the kotwäl. The corresponding officials at that time in a large tract of country were the subahddr and the faujdär. But the title of subahdâr, or viceroy, gradually dropped into desuetude, as the paramount power was shaken off, and nawâb became a territorial title with some distinguishing adjunct. During the troubled period of intrigue and assassination that followed on the death of Aurangzeb, two Mahometan foreigners rose to high position as courtiers and generals, and succeeded in transmitting their power to their sons The one was Chin Kulich Khân, also called Asof Jah, and still more commonly Nizâm-ul-Mulk, who was of Turkoman origin, and belonged to the Sunni sect. His independence at Hyderabad in the Deccan dates from 1712. The other was Saâdat Ali Khân, a Persian, and therefore a Shiâ, who was appointed subahdâr or nawâb of Oudh in 1720. Thenceforth these two important provinces paid no more tribute to Delhi, though their hereditary rulers continued to seek formal recognition from the emperor on their succession. The Marhattâs were in possession of the entire west and great part of the centre of the peninsula; while the rich and unwarlike province of Bengal, though governed by an hereditary line of nawâbs founded by Murshid Kuli Khân in 1704, still continued to pour its wealth into the imperial treasury. The central authority never recovered from the invasion of Nâdir Shâh in 1739, who carried off plunder variously estimated at from 8 to 30 millions .sterling The Marhattâs closed round Delhi from the south, and the Afghâns from the west. The victory of Pânipat, won by Ahmad Shâh Durâni over the united Marhattâ confederacy in 1761, gave the Mahometans one more chance of rule. But Ahmad Shâh had no ambition to found a dynasty of his own, nor were the British in Bengal yet ready for territorial conquest. Shâh Alam, the lineal heir of the Mughal line, was thus permitted to ascend the throne of Delhi, where he lived during the great part of a long life as a puppet in the hands of Mahâdaji Sindhia He was succeeded by Akbar II., who lived similarly under the shadow of British protection. Last of all came Bahâdur Shâh, who atoned for his association with the mutineers in 1857 by banishment to Burmah. Thus ended the Mughal line, after a history which covers three hundred and thirty years. Mahometan rule remodelled the revenue system, and has left behind forty millions of Musalmâns in British India.

Early European Settlements.

Mahometan invaders have always entered India from the north-west. Her new conquerors approached from the sea and from the south. From the time of Alexander to that of Vasco da Gama, Europe had enjoyed little direct intercourse with the East. An occasional traveller brought back stories of powerful kingdoms and of untold wealth; but the passage by sea was unthought of, and by land many wide deserts and warlike tribes lay between. Commerce, indeed, never ceased entirely, being carried on chiefly by the Italian cities on the Mediterranean, which traded to the ports of the Levant. But to the Europeans of the 15th century India was practically an unknown land, which powerfully attracted the imagination of spirits stimulated by the Renaissance, and ardent for discovery. All the learning on this subject has been collected by Dr Bird wood in his admirable lieport on the Old Records of the India Office (1879), from which the present section is largely borrowed. In 1492 Christopher Columbus set sail under the Spanish flag to seek India beyond the Atlantic, bearing with him a letter to the great khan of Tartary. The expedition under Vasco da Gama started from Lisbon five years later, and, doubling the Cape of Good Hope, cast anchor off the city of Calicut on the 20th May 1498, after a prolonged voyage of nearly eleven months. From the first Da Gama encountered hostility from the “Moors,” or rather Arabs, who monopolized the sea-borne trade; but he seems to have found favour with the zamorin, or Hindu râjâ of Malabar. It may be worth while to recall the contemporary condition of India at that epoch. An Afghân of the Lodi dynasty was on the throne of Delhi, and another Afghân king was ruling over Bengal. Ahmadâbâd in Guzerat, Gulbargah, Bijapur, Ahmadnagar, and Ellichpur in the Deccan were each the capital of an independent Mahometan kingdom; while the Hindu râjâ of Vijayanagar was recognized as paramount over the entire south, and was perhaps the most powerful monarch to be found at that time in all India. Neither Mughal nor Marhattâ had yet appeared above the political horizon.

After staying nearly six months on the Malabar coast, Da Gama returned to Europe by the same route as he had come, bearing with him the following letter from the zamorin to the king of Portugal: “Vasco da Gama, a nobleman of your household, has visited my kingdom and has given me great pleasure. In my kingdom there is abundance of cinnamon, cloves, ginger, pepper, and precious stones. What I seek from thy country is gold, silver, coral, and scarlet.” The arrival of Da Gama at Lisbon was celebrated with national rejoicings scarcely less enthusiastic than had greeted the return of Columbus. If the West Indies belonged to Spain by priority of discovery, Portugal might claim the East Indies by the same right Territorial ambition conspired with the spirit of proselytism and with the greed of commerce to fill all Portuguese minds with the dream of a mighty Oriental empire. The early Portuguese discoverers were not traders or private adventurers, but admirals with a royal commission to conquer territory and promote the spread of Christianity A second expedition, consisting of thirteen ships and twelve hundred soldiers, under the command of Cabral, was despatched in 1500. “The sum of his instructions was to begin with preaching, and, if that failed, to proceed to the sharp determination of the sword.” On his outward voyage Cabral was driven by stress of weather to the coast of Brazil. Ultimately he reached Calicut, and established factories both there and at Cochin, in the face of active hostility from the natives. In 1502 the king of Portugal obtained from Pope Alexander VI. a bull constituting him “lord of the navigation, conquests, and trade of Ethiopia, [9:12:797] Arabia, Persia, and India.” In that year Vasco da Gama sailed again to the East, with a fleet numbering twenty vessels. He formed an alliance with the râjâs of Cochin and Cananore against the zamorin of Calicut, and bombarded the latter in his palace. In 1503 the great Alfonso d’Albuquerque is first heard of, as in command of one of three expeditions from Portugal. In 1505 a large fleet of twenty-two sail and fifteen thousand men was sent under Francisco de Almeida, the first Portuguese governor and viceroy of India. In 1509 Albuquerque succeeded as governor, and widely extended the area of Portuguese influence. Having failed in an attack upon Calicut, he seized Goa, which has ever since remained the capital of Portuguese India. Then, sailing round Ceylon, he captured Malacca, the key of the navigation of the Indian archipelago, and opened a trade with Siam and the Spice Islands. Lastly, he sailed back westwards, and, after penetrating into the Persian Gulf and the Red Sea, returned to Goa only to die in 1515. Tn 1524 Vasco da Gama came out to the East for the third time, and he too died at Cochin. For exactly a century, from 1500 to 1600, the Portuguese enjoyed a monopoly of Oriental trade.

“From Japan and the Spice Islands to the Red Sea and the Cape of Good Hope, they were the sole masters and dispensers of the treasures of the east; while their possessions along the Atlantic coast of Africa and in Brazil complete their maritime empire. But they never commanded the necessary resources either of military strength or personal character for its maintenance and defence. They were also in another way unprepared for the commerce of which they thus obtained the control. Their national character had been f ∣rmed in their secular contest with the Moors, and above all things they were knights errant and crusaders, who looked on every pagan as an enemy at once of Portugal and of Christ. It is impossible for any one who has not read the contemporary narratives of their discoveries and conquests to conceive the grossness of the superstition and the cruelty with which the whole history of their exploration and subjugation of the Indies is stained. Albuquerque alone endeavoured to conciliate the good will of the natives, and to live in friendship with the Hindu princes, who were naturally better pleased to have the Portuguese, as governed by him, for their neighbours and allies than the Mahometans whom he had expelled or subdued. The justice and magnanimity of his rule did as much to extend and confirm the power of the Portuguese in the East as the courage and success of his military achievements; and in such veneration was his memory held by the Hindus, and even by the Mahometans, in Goa that they were accustomed to repair to his tomb, and there utter their complaints, as if in the presence of his shade, and call upon God to deliver them from the tyranny of his successors. The cruelties of Soarez, Sequeyra, Menezes, Da Gama, and succeeding viceroys drove the natives to desperation, and encouraged the princes of western India in 1567 to form a league against the Portuguese, in which they were at once joined by the king of Achin. Their undisciplined armies were not able to stand against the veteran soldiers of Portugal, 200 of whom, at Malacca, utterly routed and put to flight a force of 15,000. of the enemy. When, in 1578, Malacca was again besieged by the king of Achin, the small garrison of Portuguese succeeded in inflicting a loss on him of 10,000 men and all his cannon and junks. Twice again, in 1615 and for the last time in 1628, it was besieged, and on each occasion the Achinese were repulsed with equal bravery and good fortune. But these incessant attacks on the Portuguese evinced the decline of their empire, while the increased military forces sent out to the East proved an insupportable drain on the revenues and population of Portugal.

‘ ‘ In 1580 the crown of Portugal, consequent on the death of King Sebastian, became united with that of Spain, under Philip II.,—an event which proved the last fatal blow to the maritime and commercial supremacy of Portugal. It proved fatal in many ways, but chiefly because the interests of Portugal in Asia were subordinated to the European interests of Spain. In 1640 Portugal again became a separate kingdom, but in the meanwhile the Dutch and English had appeared in the Eastern Seas, and before their indomitable competition the Portuguese trade and dominion of the Indies withered away as rapidly as it had sprung up. The period of the highest development of Portuguese commerce was probably from 1590 to 1610, on the eve of the subversion of their political power by the Dutch, and when their political administration in India was at its lowest depth of degradation. At this period a single fleet of Portuguese merchantmen sailing from Goa to Cambay or Surat would number as many as 150 or 250 ‘carracks.’ Now only one Portuguese ship sails from Lisbon to Goa in the year.”

The only remaining Portuguese possessions in India are Goa, Daman, and Diu, all on the west coast, with an area of 1086 square miles and a population of 407,712 souls. The general census of 1871 also returned 426 Portuguese dwelling in British India, not including those of mixed descent, of whom about 30,000 are found in Bombay and 20,000 in Bengal, chiefly in the neighbourhood of Dacca and Chittagong. The latter are known as Firinghis; and, excepting that they retain the Roman Catholic faith and European surnames, are scarcely to be distinguished either by colour or by habits of life from the natives among whom they live.

The Dutch were the first European nation to break through the Portuguese monopoly. During the 16th century Bruges, Antwerp, and Amsterdam became successively the great emporia whence Indian produce, imported by the Portuguese, was distributed to Germany and even to England. At first the Dutch, following in the track of the English, attempted to find their way to India by sailing round the north coasts of Europe and Asia. William Barents is honourably known as the leader of three of these arctic expeditions, in the last of which he perished. The first Dutchman to double the Cape of Good Hope was Cornelius Houtman, who reached Sumatra and Bantam in 1596. Forthwith private companies for trade with the East were formed in many parts of the United Provinces, but in 1602 they were all amalgamated by the states-general into “The Dutch East India Company.” Within a few years the Dutch had established factories on the continent of India, in Ceylon, in Sumatra, on the Persian Gulf, and on the Red Sea, besides having obtained exclusive possession of the Moluccas. In 1618 they laid the foundation of the city of Batavia in Java, to be the seat of the supreme government of the Dutch possessions in the East Indies, which had previously been at Amboyna. At about the same time they discovered the coast of Australia, and in North America founded the city of New Amsterdam or Manhattan, now New York. During the 17th century the Dutch maritime power was the first in the world. The massacre of Amboyna in 1623 led the English East India Company to retire from the Eastern seas to the continent of India, and thus, though indirectly, contributed to the foundation of the British Indian empire. The long naval wars and bloody battles between the English and the Dutch within the narrow seas were not terminated until William of Orange united the two crowns in 1689. In the far East the Dutch ruled without a rival, and gradually expelled the Portuguese from almost all their territorial possessions. In 1635 they occupied Formosa; in 1640 they took Malacca, a blow from which the Portuguese never recovered; in 1651 they founded a colony at the Cape of Good Hope, as a half-way station to the East; in 1658 they captured Jaffnapatam, the last stronghold of the Portuguese in Ceylon; in 1664 they wrested from the Portuguese all their earlier settlements on the pepper-bearing coast of Malabar. The rapid and signal downfall of the Dutch colonial empire is to be explained by its short-sighted commercial policy. It was deliberately based upon a monopoly of the trade in spices, and remained from first to last destitute of the true imperial spirit. Like the Phoenicians of old, the Dutch stopped short of no acts of cruelty towards their rivals in commerce; and, like the Phoenicians, they failed to introduce a respect for their own higher civilization among the natives with whom they came in contact. The knell of Dutch supremacy was sounded by Clive, when in 1758 ho attacked the Dutch at Chinsurah both by land and water, and forced them to an ignominious capitulation. In the great French war from 1781 to 1811 England wrested from Holland every one of her colonies, though Java was restored in 1816 and Sumatra in exchange for Malacca in 1824. At the present time the Dutch flag flies nowhere on the mainland of India, though the quaint houses and regular canals at Chinsurah, at Negapatam, at Jaffnapatam, and at [9:12:798] many petty ports on the Coromandel and Malabar coasts, remind the traveller of familiar scenes in the Netherlands. In the census of 1872 only seventy Dutchmen were enumerated throughout the whole of India.

The earliest English attempts to reach India were made by the North-West Passage. In 1496 Henry VII. granted letters patent to John Cabot and his three sons (of whom one was the better known Sebastian) to fit out two ships f .>r the exploration of that route. They failed, but discovered the island of Newfoundland, and sailed along the coast of America from Labrador to Virginia. In 1553 the ill-fated Sir Hugh Willoughby attempted to force a passage along the north of Europe and Asia, the successful accomplishment of which has been reserved for a Swedish savant of our own generation. Sir Hugh perished miserably, but his second in command, Chancellor, reached a harbour on the White Sea, now Archangel. Thence he penetrated by land to the court of the grand-duke of Moscow, and laid the foundation of “the Russia Company for carrying on the overland trade between India, Persia, Bokhara, and Moscow.” Many subsequent attempts were madeat the North-West Passage from 1576 to 1616, which have left on our modern maps the imperishable names of Frobisher, Davis, Hudson, and Baffin. Meanwhile, in 1577, Sir Francis Drake had circumnavigated the globe, and on his way home had touched at Ternate, one of the Moluccas, the king of which island agreed to supply the English nation with all the cloves it produced. “The first Englishman who actually visited India was Thomas Stephens, in 1579, unless there be any foundation in fact for the statement of William of Malmesbury, that in the year 883 Sighelmus of Sherborne, being sent by King Alfred to Rome with presents to the pope, proceeded from thence to the East Indies to visit the tomb of St Thomas at Mylapore (Mailapur, also called Saint Thomé, a suburb of Madras), and brought back with him a quantity of jewels and spices. Stephens was educated at New College, Oxford, and was rector of the Jesuits’ College in Salsette. His letters to his father are said to have roused great enthusiasm in England to trade directly with India. In 1583 three English merchants, Ralph Fitch, James Newberry, and Leedes, went out to India overland as mercantile adventurers. The jealous Portuguese threw them into prison at Ormuz, and again at Goa. At length Newberry settled down as a shopkeeper at Goa., Leedes entered the service of the Great Mughal, and Fitch, after a lengthened peregrination in Ceylon, Bengal, Pegu, Siam, Malacca, and other parts of the East Indies, returned to England.”

The defeat of the “Invincible Armada” in 1588, at which time the crowns of Spain and Portugal were united, gave a fresh stimulus to maritime enterprise in England; and the successful voyage of Cornelius Houtman in 1596 showed the way round the Cape of Good Hope int√ waters hitherto monopolized by the Portuguese

The foundation of the English East India Company was on th : s wise “In 1599 the Dutch, who had now firmly established their trade in the East, having raised the price of pepper against us from 3s. per lb to 6s. and 8s., the merchants of London held a meeting on the 22d September at Founders’ Hall, with the lord mayor in the chair, and agreed to form an association for the purpose of trading directly with India. Queen Elizabeth also sent Sir John Mildenhall by Constantinople to the Great Mughal to apply for privileges for the English company, for which she was then preparing a charter, and on the 31st December 1600 the English East India Company was incorporated by royal charter under the title of ‘The Governor and Company of Merchants of London trading to the East Indies.’” The original company had only one hundred and twenty-five shareholders, and a capital of £70,000, which was raised to £400,000 in 1612, when voyages were first undertaken on the joint-stock account. Courten’sassociation, known also as “The AssadaMerchants,” from a factory founded by them in Madagascar, was established in 1635, but, after a period of internecine rivalry, united with the London Company in 1650. In 1655 the “Company of Merchant Adventurers” obtained a charter from Cromwell to trade with India, but united with the original company two years later. A more formidable rival subsequently appeared in the English company, or “General Society trading to the East Indies,” which was incorporated under powerful patronage in 1698, with a capital oi 2 millions sterling. According to Evelyn, in his Diary for March 5, 1698, “the old East India Company lost their business against the new company by ten votes in parliament, so many of their friends being absent, going to see a tiger baited by dogs.” However, a compromise was speedily effected through the arbitration of Lord Godolphin in 1702, and the London and the English companies were finally amalgamated in 1709, under the style of “The United Company of Merchants of England trading to the East Indies.” At the same time the Company advanced a loan to the state of £3,190,000 at 3 per cent, interest, in consideration of the exclusive privilege to trade to all places between the Cape of Good Hope and the Straits of Magellan.

The early voyages of the Company, from 1600 to 1612, are distinguished as the “separate voyages,” twelve in number. The subscribers individually bore the expenses of each voyage, and reaped the whole pr fits. With the exception of the fourth, all these separate voyages were highly prosperous, the profits hardly ever falling below 100 per cent. After 1612 the voyages were conducted on the joint-stock account.

The following chronological sketch of the progress of the Company in the East is quoted almost verbatim from Dr Birdwood’s valuable report

“The English were everywhere opposed from the first, as the Dutch had been, by the Portuguese; but James Lancaster succeeded in the first voyage (1602) in establishing commercial relations with the king of Achin, and at Priaman in the island of Sumatra, and with the Moluccas, and at Bantam, where he settled a factory or ‘House of Trade’ in 1603. In 1604 the Company undertook their second voyage, commanded by Sir Henry Middleton, who extended their trade to Banda and Amboyna. The success of these voyages was so great that it induced a number of private merchants to endeavour to obtain a participation in the trade; and in 1606 James I. granted a licence to Sir Edward Michelborne and others to trade ‘to Cathay, China, Japan, Corea, and Cambaya? Michelborne, however, on arriving in the East, instead of exploring new sources of commerce as the East India Company were doing, followed the pernicious example of the Portuguese in plundering the native traders among the islands of the Indian Archipelago. He in this way secured a considerable booty, but brought great disgrace on the British name, and much hindered the Company’s business at Bantam. In 1608 Captain D. Middleton, in command of the fifth voyage, was prevented by the Dutch from trading at Banda, but succeeded in obtaining a cargo at Pulo Way. In that year also Captain Hawkins in the third voyage, commanded by Captain Keeling, proceeded from Surat as envoy from James I. and the East India Com ρany to the court of the Great Mughal. He was graciously received by the emperor (Jahangir), and remained three years at Agra. In 1609 Captain Sharpey, who had conducted the fourth voyage, obtained the grant of free trade at Aden, and a cargo of pepper at Priaman. In that year also the Company constructed the dockyard at Deptford,—which was the beginning, observes Sir William Monson, ‘of the increase of great ships in England." In 1611 Sir Henry Middleton, in command of the sixth voyage, arrived before Cambay, and resolutely fought the Portuguese, who tried to beat him off, and obtained some important concessions from the native powers. In 1610-11 also Captain Hippon, commanding the seventh voyage, succeeded in establishing agencies at Masulipatam and in Siam, and at Patania or Patany on the Malay peninsula, and a factory at Pettipollee.

“In 1614 the Company’s fleet, of the tenth voyage, under Captain Best, was attacked off Swalley, the port of Surat, at the mouth of the river Tâpti, by an overwhelming force of Portuguese, who were utterly defeated in four successive engagements, to the great astonishment of the natives, who had hitherto considered them to be invincible. The first fruit of that decisive victory was the settlement of a factory at Surat, with subordinate agencies at Gogra, Ahmadâbâd, and Cambay. Trade was also opened with the Persian Gulf. In 1614 an agency was established by Mr Edwards of the Surat factory at Ajmrr. In 1615 Sir Thomas Roe was sent out by James I. as ambassador to the court of Jahangir, and succeeded in placing the Company’s trade in the Mughal dominions on a more favourable footing. The factory at Surat was the chief seat of the Company’s government in western India until the presidency was transferred to Bombay in 1685. In 1618 the English established a factory at Mocha, while the Dutch compelled them to resign all pretensions to the Spice Islands. In that year also the Company failed in its attempt to open a trade with Dabul, Baticola, and Calicut, through a want of sincerity on the part of the zamorin. In 1619 it was permitted to settle a factory and build a fort at Jask, in the Persian Gulf.

“In 1619 also the ‘ Treaty of Defence ’ with the Dutch, to prevent [9:12:799] disputes between the English and Dutch companies, was ratified. When it was proclaimed in the East, hostilities solemnly ceased for the space of an hour, while the Dutch and English fleets, dressed out in all their flags and with yards manned, saluted each other; but the treaty ended in the smoke of that stately salutation, and perpetual and fruitless contentions between the Dutch and English companies went on the same as ever. Up to that time the English company did not possess any portion of territory in sovereign right in the Indies, excepting in the island of Lantore or Great Banda. That island was governed by a commercial agent of the Company, who had under him thirty Europeans as clerks, overseers, and warehousemen; and these, with two hundred and fifty armed Malays, constituted the only force by which it was protected. In the islands of Banda and Pulo Roon and Rosengynthe Company possessed factories, in each of which were ten agents. At Macassar and Aehinalso they possessed factories or agencies, the whole being subordinate to Bantam. Such was the precarious situation of the English Company in the East at the commencement of their long struggle for commercial equality with the Dutch, whose ascendency in the Indian Archipelago was already firmly established on the basis of territorial dominion and authority. In 1620 the Dutch, notwithstanding the Treaty of Defence concluded the previous year, expelled the English from Pulo Roon and Lantore, and in 1621 from Bantam. The fugitive factors attempted to establish themselves first at Pulicat and afterwards at Masulipatam on the Coromandel coast, but were effectually opposed by the Dutch. In 1620 also the Portuguese made an attack upon the English fleet under Captain Shillinge, but were again defeated with great loss, and from that time the estimation in which the Portuguese were held by the natives of India steadily declined, while that of the English was proportionately raised. In that year the Company established agencies at Agra and Patna. In 1622 the English, joining with the Persians, attacked and took Ormuz from the Portuguese, and obtained from Shah Abbas a grant in perpetuity of the customs of Gombroon. This was the first time that the English took the offensive against the Portuguese. In the same year the -Company succeeded in re-establishing their factory at Masulipatam.

“On the 17th February 1623 occurred the ‘Massacre of Amboyna;’ and from that time the Dutch remained masters of Lantore and the neighbouring islands, and of the whole trade of the Indian Archipelago, until these islands were recaptured by the English in the great naval wars which commenced in 1793. In 1624 the English, unable to oppose the Dutch, withdrew nearly all their factories from the Archipelago, the Malay peninsula, Siam, and Japan. Some of the factors and agents retired to the island of Lagundy in the Strait of Sunda, but were forced, by its unhealthiness, to abandon it.

“In 1625-26 a factory was established at Armagâon on the Coromandel coast, subordinate to Masulipatam; but in 1628 Masulipatam was, in consequence of the oppressions of the native governor, for a time abandoned in favour of Armagâon, which then mounted twelve guns and had twenty-three factors and agents. In 1629 the factory at Bantam was re-established as an agency subordinate to Surat; and in 1630 Armagâon, reinforced by twenty soldiers, was placed under the presidency of Surat. In 1632 the factory was re-established at Masulipatam, by a firman, known as the ‘Golden Firman,’ from the king of Golconda. In 1634, by a firman dated February 2, the Company obtained from the Great Mughal liberty to trade in Bengal, without any other restriction than that their ships were to resort only to Pippli in Orissa. The Portuguese were in the same year expelled from Bengal. In 1634-35 Bantam was again raised to an independent presidency, and an agéncy was established at Tatta, or ‘Scindy.’ In 1637 Courten’s Association (chartered 1635) settled agencies at Goa, Baticola, Kârwâr (Carwar), Achin, and Râjâpur. Its ships had in 1636 plundered some native vessels at Surat and Diu, which disgraced the Company with the Mughal authorities (who could not comprehend the distinction between the Company and the Association), and depressed the English trade with Surat, while that of the Dutch proportionately increased. In 1638 Armagâon was abandoned as unsuited for commerce; and in 1639-40 Fort St George, Madcraspatam (‘Chinee-patam ’), was founded by Francis Day, and the factors at Armagâon were at once removed to it. It was made subordinate to Bantam, until raised in 1683 to the rank of a presidency. In 1640 the Company established an agency at Bussorah, ami a factory at Kârwâr. Trade having much extended, the Company’s yard at Deptford was found too small for their ships, and they purchased some copyhold ground at Blackwall, which at that time was a waste marsh, without an inhabitant; and there they opened another dockyard, in which was built the ‘Royal George,’ of 1200 tons, the largest ship yet seen in England. In 1642 the factories at Balasore and Hùgli (Hooghly) were established. In 1645, in consequence of services rendered by Dr Gabriel Broughton, surgeon of the ’ Hopewell,’ to the emperor Sbâh Jahân, additional privileges were granted to the Company; and in 1646 the governor of Bengal, who had also been professionally benefited by Broughton, made c >n-cessions which placed the factories at Balasore and Hooghly on a more favourable footing. In 1647 Courten’s Association established its colony at Assada, in Madagascar. In 1652 Cromwell declared war against the Dutch on account of their accumulated injuries against the Company. In 1653 the Company’s factory at Lucknow was withdrawn. No record has been found of its establishment. In 1658 the Company established a factory at Kâsimbâzâr (Cossimbazar, ‘ Castle Bazaar ’), an<l their establishments in Bengal were made subordinate to Fort St George instead of Bantam.

“In 1661 Bombay was ceded to the British crown as part of the dower of Catharine of Braganza. It was not delivered up by the Portuguese until 1665, and was transferred to the East India Com- . pany in 1668. The seat of the western presidency was removed to it from Surat in 1685. At that time the Company’s establishments in the East Indies consisted of the presidency of Bantam, with .t∙ dependencies of Jambee, Macassar, and other places in the Indian Archipelago; Fort St George and its dependent factories on the Coromandel coast and Bengal; and Surat, with its affiliated dependency of Bombay, and factories at Broach, Abmadâbâd, and other places in western India, and at Gombroon and Bussorah in the Persian Gulf and Euphrates valley. In that year also (1661) the factory at Biliapatam was founded. In 1663 the factories which had been established at Patnâ, Balasore, and Kâsimbâzâr were ordered to be discontinued, and purchases made only at Hooghly. In 1664 Surat was pillaged by Sivaji, but Sir George Oxenden bravely defended the English factory; and the Mughal emperor, in admiration of his conduct, granted the Company an exemption from customs for one year.

“In 1681 Bengal was separated from Madras, and Mr Hodges appointed ‘ agent and governor ’ of the Company’s affairs ‘ in the Bay of Bengal, and of the factories subordinate to it at Kâsimbâzâr, Patnâ, Balasore, Maldah, and Dacca. A corporal of approved fidelity, with twenty soldiers, was to be a guard to the agent’s person at the factory of Hooghly, and to act against interlopers.’ In 1683 Fort St George (Madras) was constituted a presidency. In 1684 Sir John Child was made ‘ captain-general and admiral of India,’ and Sir John Wybome ‘ vice-admiral and deputy governor of Bombay; ’ and in 1685 the seat of the presidency was transferred from Surat to Bombay. In 1686 the factory at Hooghly was much oppressed by the governor of Bengal, and the Company’s business in India generally suffered from the wars of the Mughals and Marhattâs. Sir John Child was therefore appointed ‘governor-general,’ with full power in India to make Avar or peace, and ordered to proceed to inspect the Company’s possessions in Madras and Bengal, and arrange for their safety. On the 20th of December the Company’s agent and council quitted the open factory at Hooghly, and retired to Sutanati (Calcutta). Tegnapatam (Fort St David) was first settled in this year (1686), and definitively established in 1691-92. In 1687 the Company retired from all its factories and agencies in Bengal to Madras, but established the settlement of Fort York at Bencoolem In 1689 the Company’s factories at Vizagapatam and Masulipatam were seized by the Mahometans, and the factors massacred. It was in 1689 also that at last the Company determined to consolidate their position in India on the basis of territorial sovereignty, in order to acquire the political status of an independent power in their relations with the Mughals and Marhattâs. To this end they passed the following resolution for the guidance of the local governments in India:—‘The increase of our revenue is the subject of our care, as much as our trade; ’ tis that must maintain our force when twenty accidents may interrupt our trade; ’ tis that must make us a nation in India; without that we are but a great number of interlopers, united by His Majesty’s royal charter, fit only to trade where nobody of power thinks it their interest to prevent us; and upon this account it is that the wise Dutch, in all their general advices that we have seen, write ten paragraphs concerning their government, their civil and military policy, warfare, and the increase of their revenue, for one paragraph they write concerning trade.’”

It will be convenient to refer in this place to the other European nations who attempted at various times to open trade with the East. The Portuguese at no time attempted to found a company, but always maintained their Eastern trade as a royal monopoly. The first incorporated company was the English, established in 1600, which was quickly followed by the Dutch in 1602. The Dutch conquests, however, were made in the name of the state, and rank as national colonies, not as private possessions. Next came tho French, whose first East India Company was formed in 1604, the second in 1611, the third in 1615, the fourth (Richelieu’s) in 1642, the fifth (Colbert’s) in 1644. The sixth was formed by the union of the French East and West India, Senegal, and China companies under the name of “The Company of the Indies,” in 1719. The exclusive privileges of the company were, by the king’s decree, suspended in 1769, and the company was finally abolished by the National Assembly in 1796. The first Danish East India Company was founded in 1612, and the second in 1670. The settlements of Tranqnebar and Serampur were both founded in 1616, and acquired by the English by purchase from Denmark fn 1845. Other Danish settlements on the mainland of India were Porto Novo, and Eddova and Holcheri on the Malabar coast The com.

paιιy founded by the Scotch in 1695 may be regarded as having been still-born; and the “Royal Company of the Philippine Islands,” incorporated by the king of Spain in 1733, had little to do with India proper; of more importance, though but short-lived, was “The Ostend Company,” incorporated by the emperor of Austria in 1723, its factors being chiefly persons who had served the Dutch and English companies. But the opposition of the maritime powers forced the court of Vienna in 1727 to suspend the company’s charter for seven years. The Ostend company, after passing through, a very trying existence, prolonged through the desire of the Austrian Government to participate in the growing East India trade, became bankrupt in 1784, and was finally extinguished by the regulations which were prescribed on the renewal of the English East India Company’s charter in 1793. The last nation of Europe to engage in maritime trade with India was Sweden. When the Ostend company was suspended, a number of its servants were thrown out of employment, of whose special knowledge of the East Mr Henry Koning, of Stockholm, took advantage, obtaining a charter for the “Swedish Company,” dated June 13, 1731. This company was reorganized in 1806. The extent to which foreign nations now carry on direct dealings with India may be inferred approximately from the following figures, taken from the census report of 1871. There were then in British India about 8000 inhabitants of continental Europe; but of these the nationality of only 2628 was more particularly specified, chiefly in Bengal. Germans numbered 7 55, French, 631; Portuguese, 426; Italians, 282; Greeks, 127; Swedes, 73; Russians, 72; Dutch, 70; Norwegians, 58; Danes, 45; Spaniards, 32; Belgians, 20; Swiss, 19; Turks, 18.

British Empire (1765 to 1881).

The political history of the British in India begins in the 18th century with the French wars in the Carnatic. Fort St George, the nucleus of Madras, was their earliest territorial possession, properly so called, in India, having been founded by Thomas Day in 1639. The land on which it stood, with an area round of about 5 miles in length by 1 mile in breadth, was purchased from the râjâ of Chandragiri, who claimed to be the lineal descendant of the Hindu emperors of Vijayanagar. The French settlement of Pondicherri, about 100 miles lower down the Coromandel coast, was established in 1672, and for many years the English and French traded side by side, without either active rivalry or territorial ambition. The English, especially, appear to have been submissive to the native powers at Madras no less than in Bengal. They paid their annual rent of 1200 pagodas (say £500) to the deputies of the Mughal empire when Aurangzeb annexed the south, and on two several occasions bought off a besieging army with a heavy bribe.

On the death of Aurangzeb in 1707, the whole of southern India became practically independent of Delhi. In the Deccan Proper, the Nizâm-ul-Mulk founded an independent dynasty, with Hyderabad for its capital, which exercised a nominal sovereignty over the entire south. The Carnatic, or the lowland tract between the central plateau and the eastern sea, was ruled by a deputy of the nizâm, known as the nawâb of Arcot, who in his turn asserted claims to hereditary sovereignty. Further south, Trichinopoli was the capital of a Hindu râjâ, and Tanjore formed another Hindu kingdom under a degenerate descendant of the line of Sivaji. Inland, Mysore was gradually growing into a third Hindu state, while everywhere local chieftains, called pälegars or naiks, were in semi-independent possession of citadels or hill-forts.

In that condition of affairs the flame of war was kindled between the English and the French in Europe in 1745. Dupleix was at that time governor of Pondicherri, and Clive was a young writer at Madras. An English fleet first appeared on the Coromandel coast, but Dupleix by a judicious present induced the nawâb of Arcot to interpose and prevent hostilities. In 1746 a French squadron arrived, under the command of La Bourdonnais. Madras surrendered almost without a blow, and the only settlement left to the English was Fort St David, a few miles south of Pondicherri, where Clive and a few other fugitives sought shelter. The nawâb, faithful to his policy of impartiality, marched with 10,000 men to drive the French out of Madras, but he was signally defeated by a French force of only four hundred men and two guns. In 1748 an English fleet arrived under Admiral Boscawen and attempted the siege of Pondicherri, while a land force co-operated under Major Lawrence, whose name afterwards became associated with that of Clive. The French successfully repulsed all attacks, and at last peace was restored by the treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, which gave back Madras to the English (1748).

The first war with the French was merely an incident in the greater contest in Europe. The second war had its origin in Indian politics, while England and France were at peace. The easy success of the French arms had inspired Dupleix with the ambition of founding a French empire in India, under the shadow of the existing Mahometan powers. Disputed successions at Hyderabad and at Arcot supplied him with the opportunity that he lacked. On both thrones he placed nominees of his own, and for a short time posed as the supreme arbiter of the entire south. In boldness of conception, and in knowledge of Oriental diplomacy, Dupleix has had probably no rival. But he was no soldier, and he was destined in that sphere to encounter the “heaven-born genius” of Clive. For the English of Madras, under the instinct of self-preservation, were compelled to maintain the cause of another candidate to the throne of Arcot in opposition to the nominee of Dupleix. This candidate was Muhammad All, afterwards known in history as Wâla-jah. The war that then ensued between the French and English, each with their native allies, has been exhaustively described in the pages of Orme. The one incident that stands out conspicuously is the capture and subsequent defence of Arcot by Clive in 1751. This heroic feat, even more than the battle of Plassey, established the reputation of the English for valour throughout India. Shortly afterwards Clive returned to England in ill-health, but the war continued fitfully for many years. On the whole, English influence predominated in the Carnatic, and their candidate, Muhammad All, maintained his position at Arcot. But the French were no less supreme in the Deccan, whence they were able to take possession of the coast tract called “the Northern Circars.” The final struggle was postponed until 1760, when Colonel (afterwards Sir Eyre) Coote won the decisive victory of Wandewash over the French general Lally, and proceeded to invest Pondicherri, which was starved into capitulation in January 1761. A few months later the hill-fortress of Gingee (Chenji) also surrendered. In the words of Orme, “That day terminated the long hostilities between the two rival European powers in Coromandel, and left not a single ensign of the French nation avowed by the authority of its Government in any part of India.”

Meanwhile the interest of history shifts with Clive to Bengal. The first English settlement in that part of India was Pippli in Orissa, to which the East India Company was permitted to trade in 1633, six years before the foundatioι of Madras. The river on which Pippli stood has since silted up, and the very site of the English settlement is now unknown and undiscoverable. In 1642 factories were opened at Balasore and Hügli (Hooghly), and in 1681 Bengal was erected into a presidency, as yet subject to Madras. The name of Calcutta is not heard of till 1686, when Job Charnock, the chief at Hooghly, was expelled by the deputy of Aurangzeb, and settled lower down the river on the opposite bank. There he acquired a grant of the three petty villages of Sutanati, Gobindpur, and Kâlighât (Calcutta), and founded the original Fort William in 1696.

At the time of Aurangzeb’s death in 1707 the nawâb or governor of Bengal was Murshid Kuli Khân, known also [9:12:801] in European history as Jafar Khâu. By birth a Brâhman, and brought up as a slave in Persia, he united the administrative ability of a Hindu to the fanaticism of a renegade. Hitherto the capital of Bengal had been at Dacca on the eastern frontier of the empire, whence the piratical attacks of the Portuguese and of the Arakanese or Maghs could be most easily checked. Murshid Kuli Khân transferred his residence to Murshidâbâd (Moorshedabad), in the neighbourhood of Kâsimbâzâr (Cossimbazar), the river port of all the Ganges trade. The English, the French, and the Dutch had each factories at Kâsimbâzâr, as well as at Dâcca, Patnâ, and Maldah. But Calcutta was the headquarters of the English, Chandarnagar of the French, and Chinsurah of the Dutch, all three towns being situated close to each other in the lower reaches of the Hooghly, where the river is navigable for large ships. Murshid Kuli Khân ruled over Bengal prosperously for twenty-one years, and left his power to a son-in-law and a grandson. The hereditary succession was broken in 1740 by Ali Vardi Khân, who was the last of the great nawâbs of Bengal. In his days the Marhattâ horsemen began to ravage the country, and the English at Calcutta obtained permission to erect an earth-work, which is known to the present day as the Marhattâ ditch. All Vardi Khân died in 1756, and was succeeded by his grandson, Sirâj-ud-Daulâ (Surajah Dowlah), a youth of only eighteen years, whose ungovernable temper led to a rupture with the English within two months after his accession. In pursuit of one of his own family who had escaped from his vengeance, he marched upon Calcutta with a large army. Many of the English fled down the river in their ships. The remainder surrendered after a feeble resistance, and were thrown as prisoners into the “black hole” or military jail of Fort William, a room about 18 feet square, with only two small windows barred with iron. It was the month of June, in which the tropical heat of Calcutta is most oppressive. When the door of the prison was opened in the morning, only twenty-three persons out of one hundred and forty-six were found alive.

The news of this disaster fortunately fcund Clive returned to Madras, where also was a squadron of king’s ships under Admiral Watson. Clive and Watson promptly sailed to the mouth of the Ganges with all the troops that could be got together.' Calcutta was recovered with little fighting, and the nawâb consented to a peace which restored to the Company all their privileges, and gave them compensation for their losses of property. It is possible that matters might have ended here if a fresh cause of hostilities had not suddenly arisen. War had just been declared between the English and French in Europe, and Clive, following the traditions of his early warfare in the Carnatic, attacked and captured Chandarnagar. Sirâj-ud-Daulâ, exasperated by that breach of neutrality within his own dominions, took the side of the French. But Clive, again acting upon the policy he had learned from Dupleix, had provided himself with a rival candidate to the throne. Undaunted, he marched out to the battlefield of Plassey (Palâsi), at the head of about 1000 Europeans and 2100 sepoys, with 9 pieces of artillery. The Mahometan army is said to have consisted of 50,000 foot, 18,000 horse, and 50 pieces of cannon. But there was a traitor in the Mahometan camp in the person of Mir Jafar, who had married a sister of the late nawâb, Ali Vardi Khân. The battle was short but decisive. After a few rounds of artillery fire, Surâj-ud-Daulâ fled, and the road to Murshidâbâd was left open.

The battle of Plassey was fought on June 23, 1757, an anniversary afterwards remembered when the mutiny was at its height in 1857. History has agreed to adopt this date as the beginning of the British empire in the East; but the immediate results of the victory were comparatively small, and several more hard-won fights were fought before even the Bengalis would admit the superiority of the British arms. For the moment, however, all opposition was at an end. Clive, again following in the steps of Dupleix, placed his nominee, Mir Jafar, upon the masnad at Murshidâbâd, being careful to obtain a patent of investiture from the Mughal court. Enormous sums were exacted from Mir Jafar as the price of his elevation. The Company claimed 10,000,000 rupees as compensation for losses; for the English, the Indian, and the Armenian inhabitants of Calcutta there were demanded the sums of 5,000,000, 2,000,000, and 700,000 rupees; for the squadron 2,500,000 rupees, and an equal sum for the army. The members of the council received the following amounts: —Mr Drake, thegovernor, and Colonel Clive 280,000 rupees each; and Mr Becker, Mr Watts, and Major Kilpatrick 240,000 rupees each. The whole amounted to <£2,697,750. The English, deluded by their avarice, still cherished extravagant ideas of Indian wealth; nor would they listen to the ungrateful truth. But it was found that there were no funds in the treasury to satisfy their inordinate demands, and they were obliged to be contented with one-half the stipulated sums, which, after many difficulties, were paid in specie and in jewels, with the exception of 584,905 rupees. The shares of the council were, however, paid in full. At the same time the nawâb made a grant to the Company of the zaminddri rights over an extensive tract of country round Calcutta, now known as the district of the Twenty-four Parganâs. The area of this tract was about 882 square miles, and it paid a permanent revenue or quit rent of about <£23,000. The gross rental at first payable to the Company was <£53,000, but within a period of ten years it had risen to £146,000. Originally the Company possessed only the zaminddri rights, 7,e., revenue jurisdiction. The superior lordship, or right to receive the quit rent, remained with the nawâb; but in 1759 this also was parted with by the Delhi emperor, the nominal suzerain of the nawâb, in favour of Clive, who thus became the landlord of his own masters, the Company. At that time also Clive was enrolled among the nobility of the Mughal empire, with the rank of commander of 6000 foot and 5000 horse. Clive’s jagir, as it was called, subsequently became a matter of inquiry in England, and on his death' it passed to the Company, thus merging the zaminddri in the proprietary rights.

In 1758 Clive was appointed by the court of directors the first governor of all the Company’s settlements in Bengal. From two quarters troubles threatened, which perhaps Clive alone was capable of overcoming. On the west the shdhzdda or imperial prince, known afterwards as the emperor Shâh Alam, with a mixed army of Afghans and Marhattâs, and supported by the nawâb wazir of Oudh, was advancing his own claims to the province of Bengal. In the south the influence of the French under Lally and Bussy was overshadowing the British at Madras. But the name of Clive exercised a decisive effect in both directions. Mir Jafar was anxious to buy off the shâhzâda, who had already invested Patnâ. But Clive in person marched to the rescue, with an army of only 450 Europeans and 2500 sepoys, and the Mughal army dispersed without striking a blow. In the same year Clive despatched a force southwards under Colonel Forde, which recaptured Masulipatam from the French, and permanently established British influence throughout the Northern Circars, and at the court of Hyderabad. Ho next attacked the Dutch, the sole European nation that might yet be a formidable rival to the English. He defeated them both by land and water; and from that time their settlement at Chinsurah existed only on sufferance.
[9:12:802]

From 1760 to 1765, while Clive was at home, the history of the English in Bengal contains little that is creditable. Clive had left behind him no system of government, but merely the tradition that unlimited sums of money might be extracted from the natives by the mere terror of the English name. In 1761 it was found expedient and profitable to dethrone Mir Jafar, the English nawâb of Murshidâbâd, and substitute his son-in-law, Mir Kâsim, in his place. On that occasion, besides private donations, the English received a grant of the three districts of Bardwân, Midnapur, and Chittagong, estimated to yield a net revenue of half a million sterling. But Mir Kâsim proved to possess a will of his own, and to cherish dreams of independence. He retired from Murshidâbâd to Monghyr, a strong position on the Ganges, which commanded the only means of communication with the west. There he proceeded to organize an army, drilled and equipped after European models, and to carry on intrigues with the nawâb wazir of Oudh. The actual outbreak of hostilities with the English happened on this wise. The Company’s servants claimed the privilege of carrying on private trade throughout Bengal, free from inland dues and all other imposts. The assertion of this claim caused frequent affrays between the customs’ officers of the nawâb and those traders who, whether falsely or not, represented that they were acting on behalf of the servants of the Company. The nawâb alleged that his civil authority was everywhere being set at nought. The majority of the council at Calcutta would not listen to his statements. The governor, Mr Vansittart, and Warren Hastings, then a junior member of council, attempted to effect some compromise. But the controversy had become too hot. The nawâb’s officers fired upon an English boat, and forthwith all Bengal was in a blaze. A force of 2000 sepoys was cut to pieces at Patnâ, and about 200 Englishmen in various parts of the province fell into the hands of the Mahometans, and were subsequently massacred. But as soon as regular warfare commenced Mir Kâsim met with no more successes. His trained regiments were defeated in two pitched battles by Major Adams, at Gheriah and at Udha-nâlâ, and he himself took refuge with the nawâb wazir of Oudh, who refused to deliver him up. This led to a prolongation of the war. Shâh Alam, who had now succeeded his father as emperor, and Shujâ-ud-Daulâ, the nawâb wa'zir of Oudh, united their forces, and threatened Patnâ, which the English had recovered. A more formidable danger appeared in the English camp, in the form of the first sepoy mutiny. This was quelled by Major (afterwards Sir Hector) Munro, who ordered twenty-four of the ringleaders to be blown from guns, an old Mughal punishment. In 1764 Major Munro won the decisive battle of Baxâr, which laid Oudh at the feet of the conquerors, and brought the Mughal emperor as a suppliant to the English camp.

Meanwhile the council at Calcutta had twice found the opportunity they desired of selling the government of Bengal to a new nawâb. But in 1765 Clive (now Baron Clive of Plassey, in the peerage of Ireland) arrived at Calcutta, as governor of Bengal for the second time, to settle the entire system of relations with the native powers. Two objects stand out conspicuously in his policy. First, he sought to acquire the substance, though not the name, of territorial power, by using the authority of the Mughal emperor for so much as he wished, and for no more; and, secondly, he desired to purify the Company’s service by prohibiting illicit gains, and at the same time guaranteeing a reasonable remuneration from honest sources. In neither respect were the details of his plans carried out by his successors. But the beginning of our Indian administration dates from this second governor ship of Clive, just as the origin of our Indian empire dates from his victory at Plassey. Clive’s first step was to hurry up from Calcutta to Allahâbâd, and there settle in person the fate of nearly half India. Oudh was given back to the nawâb wazir, on condition of his paying half a million sterling towards the expenses of the war. The provinces of Allahâbâd and Kora, forming the greater part of the Doâb, were handed over to Shâh Alam himself, who in his turn granted to the Company the diwdni or financial administration of Bengal, Behar, and Orissa, and also the territorial jurisdiction of the Northern Circars. A puppet nawâb was still maintained at Murshidâbâd, who received an annual allowance of about half a million sterling; and half that amount was paid to the emperor as tribute from Bengal. Thus was constituted the dual system of government, by which the English received all the revenues and undertook to maintain an army for the defence of the frontier, while the criminal jurisdiction vested in the nawâb. In Indian phraseology, the Company was diwân and the nawâb was nizâm. As a matter of general administration, the actual collection of the revenues still remained for some years in the hands of native officials. In attempting to reorganize and purify the Company’s service, Clive undertook a task yet more difficult than to partition the valley of the Ganges. The officers, civil and military alike, were all tainted with the common corruption. Their legal salaries were absolutely insignificant, but they had been permitted to augment them ten and a hundredfold by means of private trade and gifts from the native powers. Despite the united resistance of the civil servants, and an actual mutiny of two hundred military officers, Clive carried through his reforms. Both private trade and the receipt of presents were absolutely prohibited for the future, while a substantial increase of pay was provided out of the monopoly of salt.

Lord Clive quitted India for the third and last time in 1767. Between that date and the arrival of Warren Hastings in 1772 nothing of importance occurred in Bengal beyond the terrible famine of 1770, which is officially reported to have swept away one-third of the inhabitants. The dual system of government, however, established by Clive, had proved a failure. Warren Hastings, a tried servant of the Company, distinguished alike for intelligence, for probity, and for knowledge of Oriental manners, was nominated governor by the court of directors, with express instructions to carry out a predetermined series of reforms. In their own words, the court had resolved to “stand forth as diwân, and to take upon themselves, by the agency of their own servants, the entire care and administration of the revenues.” In the execution of this plan, Hastings removed the exchequer from Murshidâbâd to Calcutta, and for the first time appointed European officers, under the now familiar title of collectors, to superintend the revenue collections and preside in the civil courts. The urgency of foreign affairs, and subsequently internal strife at the council table, hindered Hastings from developing further the system of civil administration, a task finally accomplished by Lord Cornwallis.

Though Hastings always prided himself specially upon that reform, as well as upon the improvements he introduced into the collection of the revenues from salt and opium, his name will be remembered in history for the boldness and success of his foreign policy. From 1772 to 1774 he was governor of Bengal; from 1774 to 1785 he was the first titular governor-general of India, presiding over a council nominated, like himself, not by the Company, but by an Act of Parliament, known as the Regulating Act. In his domestic policy he was greatly hampered by the opposition of Francis; but, so far as regards external· relations with Oudh, with the [9:12:803] Marhattâs, and with Hyder Ali, he was generally able to compel assent to his own measures. His treatment of Oudh may here be passed over as not being material to the general history of India, while the personal aspects of his rule have been fully discussed in a separate article (vol. xi. p. 512). To explain his Marhattâ policy, it will be necessary to give a short retrospective sketch of the history of that people.

Sivaji the Great, as already mentioned, died in 1680, while Aurangzeb was still on the throne. The family of Sivaji produced no great names, either among those who continued to be the nominal chiefs of the Marhattâ confederacy, with their capital at Sâtârâ, or among the râjâs of Kolhapur and Tanjore. All real power passed into the hands of the peshwâ, or Brâhman minister, who founded in his turn an hereditary dynasty at Poona, dating from the beginning of the 18th century. Next rose several Marhattâ generals, who, though recognizing the suzerainty of the peshwâ, carved out for themselves independent kingdoms in different parts of India, sometimes far from the original home of the Marhattâ race. Chief among these generals were the gâikwâr in Guzerat, Sindhia, and Holkar in Mâlwa, and the Bhonslâ râjâ of Berar and Nâgpur. At one time it seemed probable that the Marhattâ confederacy would expel the Mahometans even from northern India; but the decisive battle of Pânipat, won by the Afghâns in 1761, gave a respite to the Delhi empire. The Marhattâ chiefs never again united heartily for a common purpose, though they still continued to be the most formidable military power in India. In especial, they dominated over the British settlement of Bombay on the western coast, which was the last of the three presidencies to feel the lust of territorial ambition. For more than a hundred years, from its acquisition in 1661 to the outbreak of the first Marhattâ war in 1775, the English on the -west coast possessed no territory outside the island of Bombay and their fortified factory at Surat.

The Bombay Government was naturally emulous to follow the example of Madras and Bengal, and to establish its influence at the court of Poona by placing its own nominee upon the throne. The attempt took form in 1775 in the treaty of Surat, by which Raghunâth Râô, one of the claimants to the throne of the peshwâ, agreed to cede Salsette and Bassein to the English, in consideration of being himself restored to Poona. The military operations that followed are known as the first Marhattâ war. Warren Hastings, who in his capacity of governor-general claimed a right of control over the decisions of the Bombay Government, strongly disapproved of the treaty of Surat, but, when war once broke out, he threw the whole force of the Bengal army into the scale. One of his favourite officers, General Goddard, marched across the peninsula from sea to sea, and conquered the rich province of Guzerat almost without a blow. Another, Captain Popham, stormed the rock-fortress of Gwalior, which was regarded as the key of Hindustân. Those brilliant successes atoned for the disgrace of the convention of Wargaum in 1779, when the Marhattâs dictated terms to a British force, but the war was protracted until 1782. It was then closed by the treaty of Salbye, which practically restored the status quo. Raghunâth Râo, the English claimant, was set aside; Guzerat was restored, and only Salsette and some other small islands were retained by the English.

Meanwhile Warren Hastings had to deal with a more formidable enemy than the Marhattâ confederacy. The reckless conduct of the Madras Government had roused the hostility both of Hyder Ali of Mysore and of the nizâm of the Deccan, the two strongest Musalmân powers in India, who attempted to draw the Marhattâs into an alliance against the English. The diplomacy of Hastings won over the nizâm and the Marhattâ râjâ of Nâgpur, but the army of Hyder Ali fell like a thunderbolt upon the British possessions in the Carnatic. A strong detachment under Colonel Baillie was cut to pieces at Pollilore, and the Mysore cavalry ravaged the country unchecked up to the walls of Madras. For the second time the Bengal army, stimulated by the energy of Hastings, saved the honour of the English name. Sir Eyre Coote, the victor of Wandewash, was sent by sea to relieve Madras with all the men and money available, while Colonel Pearse marched south overland to overawe the râjâ of Berar and the nizâm. The war was hotly contested, for Sir Eyre Coote was now an old man, and the Mysore army was well-disciplined and equipped, and also skilfully handled by Hyder and his son Τίρύ (Tippoo). Hyder died in 1782, and peace was finally concluded with Τίρύ in 1784, on the basis of a mutual restitution of all conquests.

It was Warren Hastings’s merit to organize the empire which Clive founded. He was governor or governor-general for thirteen years, a longer period than any of his successors. During that time the English lost the American colonies, but in India their reputation steadily rose to its highest pitch. Within a year Hastings was succeeded by Lord Cornwallis, the first English nobleman of rank who undertook the office of governor-general. His rule lasted from 1786 to 1793, and is celebrated for two events—the introduction of the permanent settlement into Bengal, and the second Mysore war. If the foundations of the system of civil administration were laid by Hastings, the superstructure was erected by Cornwallis. It was he who first entrusted criminal jurisdiction to Europeans, and established the Nizâmat Sadr Adâlat, or supreme court of criminal judicature, at Calcutta; and it was he who separated the functions of collector and judge. The system thus organized in Bengal was afterwards transferred to Madrasand Bombay, when those presidencies also acquired territorial sovereignty. But the achievement most familiarly associated with the name of Cornwallis is the permanent settlement of the land revenue of Bengal. Up to his time the revenue had been collected pretty much according to the old Mughal system. Zaminddrs, or Government farmers, whose office always tended to become hereditary, were recognized as having a right of some sort to collect the revenue from the actual cultivators. But no principle of assessment existed, and the amount actually realized varied greatly from year to year. Hastings had the reputation of bearing hard upon the zamimddrs, and was absorbed in other critical affairs of state or of war. On the whole he seems to have looked to experience, as acquired from a succession of quinquennial settlements, to furnish the standard rate of the future. Francis, on the other hand, Hastings’s great rival, deserves the credit of being among the first to advocate a limitation of the state demand in perpetuity. The same view recommended itself to the authorities at home, partly because it would place their finances on a more stable basis, partly because it seemed to identify the zαrninddr with the more familiar landlord. Accordingly, Cornwallis took out with him in 1787 instructions to introduce a permanent settlement. The process of assessment began in 1789 and terminated in 1791. No attempt was made to measure the fields or calculate the out-turn as had been done by Akbar, and is now done when occasion requires in the British provinces; but the amount payable was fixed by reference to what had been paid in the past. At first the settlement was called decennial, but in 1793 it was declared permanent for ever. The total assessment amounted to sihlca Rs.26,800,989, or about 2∣ millions sterling. Though Lord Cornwallis carried the scheme into execution, all praise or blame, so far as details are concerned, must [9:12:804] belong to Sir John Shore, afterwards Lord Teignmouth, whose knowledge of the country was unsurpassed by that of any civilian of his time. Shore would have proceeded more cautiously than Cornwallis’s preconceived idea of a proprietary body and the court of directors’ haste after fixity permitted»

The second Mysore war of 1790-92 is noteworthy on two accounts: Lord Cornwallis, the governor-general, led the British army in person, with a pomp and lavishness of supplies that recalled the campaigns of Aurangzeb; and the two great native powers, the nizâm of the Deccan and the Marhattâ confederacy, co-operated as allies of the British. In the result, Tipù Sultân submitted when Lord Cornwallis had commenced to beleaguer his capital. He agreed to yield one-half of his dominions to be divided among the allies, and to pay three millions sterling towards the cost of the war. Those conditions he fulfilled, but ever afterwards he burned to be revenged upon his English conquerors.

The period of Sir John Shore’s rule as governor-general, from 1793 to 1798, was uneventful. In 1798 Lord Mornington, better known as the marquis of Wellesley, arrived in India, already inspired with imperial projects that were destined to change the map of the country. Mornington was the friend and favourite of Pitt, from whom he is thought to have derived the comprehensiveness of his political vision and his antipathy to the French name. From the first he laid down as his guiding principle that the English must be the one paramount power in the peninsula, and that native princes could only retain the insignia of sovereignty by surrendering the substance of independence. The subsequent political history of India has been but the gradual development of this policy, which received its finishing touch when Queen Victoria was proclaimed empress of India in 1877.

To frustrate the possibility of a French invasion of India, led by Napoleon in person, was the governing idea of Wellesley’s foreign policy; for France at this time, and for many years later, filled the place afterwards occupied by Russia in the imagination of English statesmen. Nor was the possibility so remote as might now be thought. French regiments guarded and overawed the nizâm of Hyderabad. The soldiers of Sindhia, the military head of the Marhattâ confederacy, were disciplined and led by French adventurers. Tipù Sultân carried on a secret correspondence with the French directorate, and allowed a tree of liberty to be planted in his dominions. The islands of Mauritius and Bourbon afforded a convenient half-way house both for French intrigue and for the assembling of a hostile expedition. Above all, Napoleon Buonaparte was then in Egypt, dreaming of the conquests of Alexander; and no man knew in what direction he might turn his hitherto unconquered legions. Wellesley first addressed himself to the nizâm, where his policy prevailed without serious opposition. The French battalions at Hyderabad were disbanded, and the nizâm bound himself by treaty not to take any European into his service without the consent of the English Government,—a clause since inserted in every engagement entered into with native powers. Next, the whole weight of Wellesley’s resources was turned against Tipù, whom Cornwallis had scotched but not killed. His intrigues with the French were laid bare, and he was given an opportunity of adhering to the new subsidiary system. On his refusal war was declared, and Wellesley came down in state to Madras to organize the expedition in person, and watch over the course of events. One English army marched into Mysore from Madras, accompanied by a contingent from the nizâm. Another advanced from the western coast. Tipù, after offering but a feeble resistance in the field, retired into Seringapatam, and, when his capital was stormed, died fighting bravely in the breach. Since the battle of Plassey no event so greatly impressed the native imagination as the capture of Seringapatam, which won for General Harris a peerage and for Wellesley an Irish marquisate. In dealing with the territories of Τίρύ, Wellesley acted with unusual moderation. The central portion, forming the old state of Mysore, was restored to an infant representative of the Hindu râjâs, whom Hyder Ali had dethroned, while the rest was partitioned between the nizâm, the Marhattâs, and the English. At about the same time the province of the Carnatic, or all that large portion of southern India ruled by the nawâb of Arcot, and also the principality of Tanjore, were placed under direct British administration, thus constituting the Madras presidency almost as it has existed to the present day.

The Marhattâs had been the nominal allies of the English in both their wars with Tipιi, but they had never given active assistance, nor were they secured to the English side as the nizâm now was. The Marhattâ powers at this time were five in number. The recognized head of the confederacy was the peshwâ of Poona, who ruled the hill country of the Western Ghâts, the cradle of the Marhattâ race. The fertile province of Guzerat was annually harried by the horsemen of the gâikwâr of Baroda. In Central India two military leaders, Sindhia of Gwalior and Holkar of India, alternately held the pre-eminency. Towards the east the Bhonslâ râjâ of Nâgpur, sprung from the same stock as Sivaji, reigned from Berar to the coast of Orissa. Wellesley tried assiduously to bring these several Marhattâ powers within the net of his subsidiary system. At last, in 1802, the necessities of the peshwâ, who had been defeated by Holkar, and driven as a fugitive into British territory, induced him to sign the treaty of Bassein, by which he pledged himself to hold communications with no other power, European or native, and ceded territory for the maintenance of a subsidiary force. This greatly extended the English territorial influence in the Bombay presidency, but led directly to the second Marhattâ war, for neither Sindhia nor the râjâ of Nâgpur would tolerate this abandonment of Marhattâ independence. The campaigns that followed are perhaps the most glorious in the history of the British arms in India. The general plan and the adequate provision of resources were due to the marquis of Wellesley, as also the indomitable spirit that could not anticipate defeat. The armies were led by Sir Arthur Wellesley (afterwards duke of Wellington) and General (afterwards Lord) Lake. Wellesley operated in the Deccan, where, in a few short months, he won the decisive victories of Assaye and Argaum, and captured Ahmadnagar. Lake’s campaign in Hindustân was no less brilliant, though it has received less notice from historians. He won pitched battles at Aligarh and Lâswâri, and captured the cities of Delhi and Agra, thus scattering the French troops of Sindhia, and at the same time coming forward as the champion of the Mughal emperor in his hereditary capitals. Before the year 1803 was out, both Sindhia and the Bhonslâ râjâ were glad to sue for peace. Sindhia ceded all claims to the territory north of the Jumna, and left the blind old emperor Shâh Alam once more under British protection. The Bhonslâ forfeited Orissa to the English, who had already occupied it with a flying column, and Berar to the nizâm, who gained a fresh addition by every act of complaisance to the British Government. The freebooter, Jaswant Râo Holkar, alone remained in the field, supporting his troops by ravages through Mâlwâ and Râjputâna. The concluding years of Wellesley’s rule were occupied with a series of operations against Holkar, which brought no credit on the British name. The disastrous retreat of Colonel Monson through Central India recalled memories of the convention of Wargaum, and of the destruction of Colonel [9:12:805] Baillie’s force by Hyder Ali. The repulse of Lake in person at the siege of Bhartpur (Bhurtpore) is memorable as an instance of a British army in India having to turn back with its object unaccomplished.

The ambitious policy and the continuous wars of Lord Wellesley exhausted the patience of the court of directors at home. In 1804 Lord Cornwallis was sent out as governorgeneral a second time, with instructions to bring about peace at any price, while Holkar was still unsubdued, and Sindhia was threatening a fresh war. But Cornwallis •was now an old man and broken down in health. Travelling up to the north-west during the rainy season, he sank and died at Ghâzipur, before he had been ten weeks in the country. His immediate successor was Sir George Barlow, a civil servant of the Company, who, as a locum tenens, had no alternative but to carry out faithfully the orders of his employers. He is charged with being, under these orders, the only governor-general who diminished the area of British territory, and with violating engagements by abandoning the Râjput chiefs to the tender mercies of Holkar and Sindhia. During his administration also occurred the mutiny of the Madras sepoys at Vellore, which, though promptly suppressed, sent a shock of insecurity throughout the empire.

Lord Minto, governor-general from 1807 to 1813, consolidated the conquests which Wellesley had acquired. His only military exploits were the occupation of the island of Mauritius, and the conquest of Java by an expedition which he accompanied in person. The condition of Central. India continued to be disturbed, but Minto succeeded in preventing any violent outbreaks without himself having recourse to the sword. The Company had ordered him to follow a policy of non-intervention, and he managed to obey his orders without injuring the prestige of the British name. In his time the Indian Government first opened relations with a new set of foreign powers, by sending embassies to the Punjab, to Afghânistân, and to Persia. The ambassadors were all trained in the school of Wellesley, and formed perhaps the most illustrious trio of “politicals” that the Indian service has produced. Metcal fe was the envoy to the court of Ranjit Sinh at Lahore; Elphinstone met the shâh of Afghanistan at Peshâwar; and Malcolm was despatched to Persia. If it cannot be said that any of these missions were fruitful in permanent results, at least they introduced the English to a new set of diplomatic relations, and widened the sphere of their influence.

The successor of Lord Minto was Lord Moira, better known as the marquis of Hastings, who governed India for the long period of nine years, from 1814 to 1823. This period was marked by two wars of the first magnitude, the campaigns against the Gürkhas (Goorkhas) of Nepâl, and the third and last Marhattâ war. The Gürkhas, the present ruling race in Nepâl, are Hindu immigrants who claim a Râjput origin. The indigenous inhabitants, called Newars, belong to the Indo-Tibetan stock, and profess Buddhism. The sovereignty of the Gürkhas dates only from 1767, in which year they overran the valley of Khatmandu, and gradually extended their power over all the hills and valleys of Nepâh Organized upon a sort of military and feudal basis, they soon became a terror to all their neighbours, marching east into Sikkim, west into Kumâun, and south into the Gangetic plains. In the last quarter their victims were British subjects, and at last it became imperatively necessary to check their advance. Sir George Barlow and Lord Minto had remonstrated in vain, and nothing was left to Lord Moira but to take up arms. The campaign of 1814 was little short of disastrous. After overcoming the natural difficulties of a malarious climate and precipitous hills, the sepoys were on several occasions fairly worsted by the unexpected bravery of the little Gürkhas, whose heavy knives or kukris dealt terrible execution. But in 1815 General Ochterlony, who commanded the army operating by way of the Sutlej, stormed one by one the hill forts which still stud the Himâlayan states, now under the Punjab government, and compelled the Nepâl darbär to sue for peace. In the following year the same general advanced from Patnâ into the valley of Khatmandu, and finally dictated the terms which had before been rejected, within a few miles of the capital. By the treaty of Segauli, which defines the English relations with Nepâl to the present day, the Gürkhas withdrew on the one hand from Sikkim, and on the other from those lower ranges of the western Himâlayas which have supplied the health-giving stations of Naini Täl, Massuri, and Simla. Meanwhile the condition of Central India was every year becoming more unsatisfactory. Though the great Marhattâ chiefs were learning to live rather as peaceful princes than as leaders of predatory bands, the example of lawlessness they had set was being followed, and bettered in the following, by a new set of freebooters, known as the Pindhâris. As opposed to the Marhattâs, who were at least a nationality bound by some traditions of a united government, the Pindhâris were merely irregular soldiers, corresponding most nearly to the free companies of mediaeval Europe. Of no common race and of no common religion, they welcomed to their ranks the outlaws and broken tribes of all India,—Afghâns, Marhattâs, or Jâts. Their headquarters were in Mâlwâ, but their depredations were not confined to Central India. In bands, sometimes numbering a few hundreds, sometimes many thousands, they rode out on their forays as far as Malabar and the Coromandel coast. The most powerful of the Pindhâri captains, Amir Khân, had an organized army of many regiments, and several batteries of cannon. Two other leaders, known as Chitu and Karim, at one time paid a ransom to Sindhia of £100,000. To suppress the Pindhâri hordes, who were supported by the sympathy, more or less open, of all theMarhattâ chiefs, Lord Hastings (1817) collected the strongest British army that had been seen iw India, numbering nearly 120,000 men, half to operate from, the north, half from the south. Sindhia was overawed, and remained quiet. Amir Khân consented to disband his army, on condition of being guaranteed the possession of what is now the principality of Tank. The remaining bodies of Pindhâris were attacked in their homes, surrounded, and cut to pieces. Karim threw himself upon the mercy of the conquerors. Chitu fled to the jungles, and was killed by a tiger. In the same year (1817) as that in which the Pindhâris were crushed, and almost in the same month (November), the three great Marhattâ powers at Poona, Nâgpur, and Indore rose against the English. The peshwâ, Bâji Râo, had long been chafing under the terms imposed by the treaty of Bassein (1802), and the subsequent treaty of Poona (1817), which riveted yet closer the chains of dependence upon the paramount power. Elphinstone, then resident at his court, foresaw what was coming and withdrew to Kirkee, whither he bad ordered up a European regiment. The next day the residency was burned down, and Kirkee was attacked by the whole army of the peshwâ. The attack was bravely repulsed, and the peshwâ immediately fled from his capital. Almost the same plot was enacted at Nâgpur, where the honour of the British name was saved by the sepoys, who defended the hill of Sitâbaldi against enormous odds. The army of Holkar was defeated in the following month at the pitched battle of Mehidpur. All open resistance was now at an end. Nothing remained but to follow up the fugitives, and determine the conditions of the general pacification. In both these duties Sir John Malcolm played a prominent part. The dominions of the peshwâ were annexed to the Bombay [9:12:806] presidency, and the nucleus of the present Central Provinces was formed out of the territory saved from the Pindhàris. The peshwâ himself surrendered, and was permitted to reside at Bithùr, near Cawnpur, on a pension of <£80,000 a year. His adopted son was the infamous Nânâ Sâhib. To fill the peshwâ’s place to some extent at the head of the MarhattA confederacy, the lineal descendant of Sivaji was brought forth from obscurity, and placed upon the throne of Sàtârâ. An infant was recognized as the heir of Holkar, and a second infant was proclaimed râjâ of Nàgpur under British guardianship. At the same time the several states of Râjputâna accepted the position of feudatories of the paramount power. The map of India, as thus drawn by Lord Hastings, remained substantially unchanged until the time of Lord Dalhouβie. But the proudest boast of Lord Hastings and Sir John Malcolm was, not that they had advanced the pomoerium, but that they had conferred the blessings of peace and good government upon millions who had suffered unutterable things from Marhattâ and Pindhâri tyranny.

The marquis of Hastings was succeeded by Lord Amherst, after the interval of a few months, during which Mr Adam, a civil servant, acted as governor-general. Lord Amherst’s administration lasted for five years, from 1823 to 1828. It is known in history by two prominent events, the first Burmese war and the capture of Bhartpur. For some years past the north-east frontier had been disturbed by the restlessness of the Burmese. The country that fringes the western shore of the Bay of Bengal and runs up the valley of the Irawadi, with a people of Tibeto-Chinese origin, has a history of its own, parallel to, but not altogether independent of, that of India. Tradition asserts that its early civilization was introduced from the opposite coast of Coromandel, by a people who still preserve a trace of their origin in their name of Talaing (cf. Telinga and Telugu). However this may be, the Buddhist religion, professed by the Burmese at the present day, certainly came direct from India at a very early date. Many waves of invasion from Siam in the south and from the wild mountains in the north have passed over the land. These conquests were marked by that wanton and wholesale barbarity which seems to characterize the Tibeto-Chinese race, but the civilization of Buddhism survived every shock, and flourished around the ancient pagodas. European travellers in the 15th century visited Pegu and Tenasserim, which they describe as flourishing marts of maritime trade. During the period of Portuguese predominance in the East, Arakan became the resort of loose European adventurers. With their help the Arakanese extended their power inland, occupied Chittagong, and (under the name of the Maghs) became the terror of the entire delta of the Ganges. About 1750 a new dynasty arose, founded by Alaungphaya or Alυmpra, with its capital at A va, which still rules over Independent Burmah. The successors of Alompra, after having subjugated all Burmah, and overrun Assam, which was then an independent kingdom, began a series of encroachments upon British territory in India. As all peaceful proposals were contumeliously rejected,Lord Amherst was compelled to declare war in 1824. Little military glory could be gained by beating the Burmese, who were formidable only from the pestilential character of their country. One expedition with gunboats proceeded up the Brahmaputra into Assam; another marched by land through Chittagong into Arakan, for the Bengal sepoys refused to go by sea; a third, and the strongest, sailed from Madras direct to the mouth of the Irawadi. The war was protracted over two years. At last, after the loss of about 20,000 lives and an expenditure of <£14,000,000, the king of Ava consented to sign the treaty of Yandabu, by which he abandoned all claim to Assam, and ceded the provinces of Arakan and Tenasserim, which were already in the military occupation of the British. He retained all the valley of the Irawadi, down to the sea at Rangoon. The capture of Bhartpur in Central India by Lord Combermere in 1827 wiped out the repulse which Lake had received before that city in January 1805. A disputed succession necessitated British intervention. Artillery could make little impression upon the massive walls of mud, but at last a breach was effected by mining, and the city was taken by storm, thus losing its general reputation throughout India for impregnability, which had threatened to become a political danger.

The next governor-general was Lord William Bentinck, who had been governor of Madras twenty years earlier at the time of the mutiny of Vellore. His seven years’ rule (from 1828 to 1835) is not signalized by any of those victories or extensions of territory by which chroniclers delight to measure the growth of empire. But it forms an epoch in administrative reform, and in the slow process by which the hearts of a subject population are won over to venerate as well as dread their alien rulers. The modern history of the British in India, as benevolent administrators ruling the country with a single eye to the good of the natives, may be said to begin with Lord William Bentinck. According to the inscription upon his statue at Calcutta, from the pen of Macaulay, “He abolished cruel rites; he effaced humiliating distinctions; he gave liberty to the expression of public opinion; his constant study it was to elevate the intellectual and moral character of the nations committed to his charge.” His first care on arrival in India was to restore equilibrium to the finances, which were tottering under the burden imposed upon them by the Burmese war. This he effected by reductions in permanent expenditure, amounting in the aggregate to 1∣ millions sterling, as well as by augmenting the revenue from land that had escaped assessment and from the opium of Mâlwâ. He also widened the gates by which educated natives could enter the service of the Company. Some of these reforms were distasteful to the covenanted service and to the officers of the army, but Lord William was always staunchly supported by the court of directors and by the Whig ministry at home.

His two most memorable acts are the abolition of sati (suttee) and the suppression of the Thags (Thugs). At this distance of time it is difficult to realize the degree to which these two barbarous practices had corrupted the social system of the Hindus. European research has clearly proved that the text in the Vedas adduced to authorize the immolation of widows was a wilful mistranslation. But the practice had been engrained in Hindu opinion by the authority of centuries, and had acquired the sanctity of a religious rite. The emperor Akbar is said to have prohibited it by law, but the early English rulers did not dare so far to violate the traditions of religious toleration. In the year 1817 no less than seven hundred widows are said to have been burned alive in the Bengal presidency alone. To this day the most holy spots of Hindu pilgrimage are thickly dotted with little white pillars, each commemorating a sati. In the teeth of strenuous opposition, both from Europeans and natives, Lord William carried the regulation in council on December 4, 1829, by which all who abetted sati were declared guilty of “culpable homicide.” The honour of suppressing Thagi must be shared between Lord William and Captain Sleeman. Thagi was an abnormal excrescence upon Hinduism, in so far as the bands of secret assassins were sworn together by an oath based on the rites of the bloody goddess Kâli. Between 1826 and 1835 as many as 1562 Thags were apprehended in different parts of British India, and by the evidence of approvers the moral plague spot was gradually stamped out.

Two other historical events are connected with the [9:12:807] administration of Lord William Bentinck. In 1833 the charter of the East India Company was renewed for twenty years, but only upon the terms that it should abandon its trade and permit Europeans to settle freely in the country. At the same time a legal or fourth member was added to the governor-general’s council, who might not be a servant of the Company, and a commission was appointed to revise and codify the law. Macaulay was the first legal member of council, and the first president of the law commission. In 1830 it was found necessary to take the state of Mysore under British administration, where it has continued to the present year (1881), and in 1834 the frantic misrule of the râjâ of Coorg brought on a short and sharp war. The râjâ was permitted to retire to Benares, and the brave and proud inhabitants of that mountainous little territory decided to place themselves under the rule of the Company; so that the only annexation effected by Lord William Bentinck was “in consideration of the unanimous wish of the people.”

Sir Charles (afterwards Lord) Metcalfe succeeded Lord William as senior member of council. His short term of office is memorable for the measure which his predecessor had initiated, but which he willingly carried into execution, for giving entire liberty to the press. Public opinion in India, as well as the express wish of the court of directors at home, pointed to Metcalfe as the most fit person to carry out the policy of Bentinck, not provisionally, but as governor-general for a full term. Party exigencies, however, led to the appointment of Lord Auckland. From that date commences a new era of war and conquest, which may be said to have lasted for twenty years. All looked peaceful until Lord Auckland, prompted by his evil genius, attempted to place Shâh Shujâ upon the throne of Cabul, an attempt which ended in the gross mismanagement and annihilation of the garrison placed in that city. The disaster in Afghânistân was quickly followed by the conquest of Sind, the two wars in the Punjab, the second Burmese war, and last of all the Mutiny. Names like Gough and Napier and Colin Campbell take the places of Malcolm and Metcalfe and Elphinstone.

For the first time since the days of the sultâns of Ghazni and Ghor, Afghânistân had obtained a national king in 1747 in the person of the Ahmad Shâh Durâni, who found his opportunity in the confusion that followed on the death of the Persian conqueror, Nâdir Shâh. Before his death in 1773 Ahmad Shâh had conquered a wide empire, from Herat to Peshâwar and from Kashmir to Sind. His intervention on the field of Pânipat (176T) turned back the tide of Marhattâ conquest, and replaced a Mughal emperor on the throne of Delhi. But Ahmad Shâh never cared to settle down in India, and kept alternate state at his two national capitals of Cabul and Kandahâr. The Durâni kings were prolific in children, who fought with one another for the succession to the death. At last, in 1826, Dost Muhammad, head of the powerful Barakzâi family, succeeded in establishing himself as ruler of Cabul, with the subordinate title of amir (ameer), while two fugitive brothers of the Durâni line were living under British protection at Ludhiâna, on the frontier of the Punjab.

The attention of the English Government had been directed to Afghân affairs ever since the time of Lord Wellesley, who feared that Zamân Shâh, then holding his court at Lahore, might follow in the path of Nâdir Shâh, and overrun Hindustân. The growth of the powerful Sikh kingdom of Ranjit Sinh effectually dispelled any such alarms for the future. Subsequently, in 1809, while a French invasion of India was still a possibility to be guarded against, Elphinstone was sent by Lord Minto on a mission to Shâh Shujâ to form a defensive alliance. Before the year was out, Shâh Shujâ had been driven into exile, and a third brother, Mahmùd Shâh, was on the throne. In 1837, when the curtain rises upon the drama of English interference in Afghânistân, the usurper Dost Muhammad Barakzâi was firmly established at CabuL His great ambition was to recover Peshâwar from the Sikhs; and when Captain Alexander Burnes arrived on a mission from Lord Auckland, with the ostensible object of opening trade, the Dost was willing to promise everything, if only he could get Peshâwar. But Lord Auckland had another and more important object in view. At this time the Russians were advancing rapidly in Central Asia, and a Persian army, not without Russian support, was besieging Herat, the traditional bulwark of Afghânistân on the east. A Russian envoy was at Cabul at the same time as Burnes. The latter was unable to satisfy the demands of Dost Muhammad in the matter of Peshâwar, and returned to India unsuccessful. Lord Auckland forthwith resolved upon the hazardous plan of placing a more subservient ruler upon the throne of Cabul. Shâh Shujâ, one of the two exiles at Ludhiâna, was selected for the purpose. At this time both the Punjab and Sind were independent kingdoms. Sind was the less powerful of the two, and therefore a British army escorting Shâh Shujâ made its way by that route to enter Afghânistân through the Bolâu Pass. Kandahâr surrendered, Ghazni was taken by storm, Dost Muhammad fled across the Hindu Kush, and Shâh Shujâ was triumphantly led into the Bala Hissâr at Cabul in August 1839. During the two years that followed Afghânistân remained in the military occupation of the British. The catastrophe occurred in November 1841, when Sir Alexander Burnes was assassinated in the city of Cabul. The troops in the cantonments were then under the command of General Elphinstone (not to be confounded with the civilian Mountstuart Elphinstone), with Sir William Macnaghten as chief political adviser. Elphinstone was an old man, unequal to the responsibilities of the position. Macnaghten was treacherously murdered at an interview with the Afghân chief, Akbar Khân, eldest son of Dost Muhammad. After lingering in their cantonments for two months, the British army set off in the depth of winter to find its way back to India through the passes. When they started they numbered 4000 fighting men, with 12,000 camp followers. A single survivor, Dr Brydon, reached the friendly walls of Jalâlâbâd, where Sale was gallantly holding out. The rest perished in the defiles of Khurd, Cabul, and Jagdalak, either from the knives and matchlocks of the Afghâns or from the effects of cold. A few prisoners, mostly women, children, and officers, were considerately treated by the orders of Akbar Khân.

Within a month after the news reached Calcutta, Lord Auckland had been superseded by Lord Ellenborough, whose first impulse was to be satisfied with drawing off in safety the garrisons from Kandahâr and Jalâlâbâd. But bolder counsels prevailed. Pollock, who was marching straight through the Punjab to relieve Sale, was ordered to penetrate to Cabul, while Nott was only too glad not to be forbidden to retire from Kandahâr through Cabul. After a good deal of fighting, the two English forces met at their common destination in September 1842. The great bäzar at Cabul was blown up with gunpowder, to fix a stigma upon the city; the prisoners were recovered; and all marched back to India, leaving Dost Muhammad to take undisputed possession of his throne. The drama closed with a bombastic proclamation from Lord Ellenborough, who had caused the gates from the tomb of Mahmüd of Ghazni to be carried back as a memorial of “Somnâth revenged.”

Lord Ellenborough, who loved military display, had his tastes gratified by two more wars. In 1843 the Mahometan rulers of Sind, known as the “meers” or amirs, whose only [9:12:808] fault was that they would not surrender their independence, were crushed by Sir Charles Napier. The victory of Miâni, in which 3000 British troops defeated 20,000 Baluchis, is perhaps the most brilliant feat of arms in Indian history; but an honest excuse can scarcely be found for the annexation of the country. In the same year a disputed succession at Gwalior, fomented by feminine intrigue, resulted in an outbreak of the overgrown army which the Sindhia family had been allowed to maintain. Peace was restored by the battles of Maharâjpur and Punneah, at the former of which Lord Ellenborough was present in person.

In 1844 Lord Ellenborough was recalled by the court of directors, who differed from him on many points of administration, and distrusted his erratic genius. He was succeeded by Sir Henry (afterwards Lord) Hardinge, who had served through the Peninsular War and had lost a hand at Ligny. It was felt on all sides that a trial of strength between the British and the Sikhs was at hand.

The Sikhs were not a nationality like the Marhatt⅛s, but a religious sect bound together by the additional tie of military discipline. They trace their origin to one Nanak, an excellent and successful preacher, who was born in the neighbourhood of Lahore in the latter half of the 15th century, before the arrival of either Mughals or Portuguese in India. Nânak was a religious reformer, like others that arose in the country about that time, who preached the abolition of caste, the unity of the Godhead, and the obligation of leading a pure life. From Nanak ten gurus or apostles are traced down to Govind Sinh in 1708, with whom the succession stopped. Suffering continual persecution from the ruling Mahometans, which culminated in the reign of Aurangzeb, the Sikh religion maintained itself with extraordinary tenacity. At last the downfall of the Mughal empire transformed it into a territorial power, which possessed the only organization remaining in the Punjab. Even before the rise of Ranjit Sinh, offshoots from the Sikh misls or confederacies, each led by its elected sarddr, had carved out for themselves feudal principalities along the banks of the Sutlej, some of which have endured to the present day. Ranjit Sinh, the founder of the Sikh kingdom, was born in 1780. In his twentieth year he obtained the appointment of governor of Lahore from the Afghan emperor, and from that time he set himself to the task of basing a personal despotism upon the religious fanaticism of the Sikhs. The⅛Λα⅛4 or “the liberated” were organized into an army under European officers, which for steadiness and religious fervour has had no parallel since the “ironsides” of Cromwell. From Lahore as his capital he extended his conquests south to Mùltân, west to Peshawar, and north to Kashmir. On the east side alone he was hemmed in by the Sutlej, up to which river the authority of the British Government was advanced in 1804. Till his death in 1839 Ranjit Sinh was ever loyal to the engagements which he had entered into with Metcalfe in 1809. But he left no son capable of wielding his sceptre. Lahore was torn by dissensions between rival generals, ministers, and queens. The only strong power was the army of the khdlsd, which since the disaster in Afghanistan burned to measure its strength with the British sepoys. The French generals, Avitable and Court, were foolishly ousted, and the supreme military command was vested in a series of panchdyats or elective committees of five.

In 1845 the Sikh army, numbering 60,000 men with 150 guns, crossed the Sutlej and invaded British territory. Sir Hugh Gough, the commander-in-chief, together with the governor-general, hurried up to the frontier. Within three weeks four pitched battles were fought, at Moodkee, Ferozshah, Aliwâl, and Sobrâon. The British loss on each occasion was heavy; but by the last victory the Sikhs were fairly driven into and across the Sutlej, and Lahore surrendered to the British. By the terms of peace then dictated the infant son of Ranjit, Dhulip Sinh, was recognized as râjâ; the Jalandhar Doâb, or tract between the Sutlej and the Ravi, was annexed; the Sikh army was limited to a specified number; Major Henry Lawrence was appointed to be resident at Lahore; and a British force was detailed to garrison the Punjab for a period of eight years. Sir H. Hardinge received a peerage, and returned to England in 1848.

Lord Dalhousie succeeded, whose eight years’ administration (from 1848 to 1856) was more pregnant of results than that of any governor-general since Clive. Though professedly a man of peace, he was compelled to fight two wars, in the Punjab and in Burmah. These both ended in large acquisitions of territory, while Nagpur, Oudh, and several minor states also came under British rule. But Dalhousie’s own special interest lay in the advancement of the moral and material condition of the country. The system of administration carried out in the conquered Punjab by the two Lawrences and their assistants is probably the most successful piece of difficult work ever accomplished by Englishmen. British Burmah has prospered under their rule scarcely less than the Punjab. In both cases Lord Dalhousie deserves a large share of the credit. No branch of the administration escaped his reforming hand. He founded the public works department, to pay special attention to roads and canals. He opened the Ganges Canal, still the largest work of the kind in the country, and he turned the sod of the first Indian railway. He promoted steam communication with England via the Red Sea, and introduced cheap postage and the electric telegraph. It is Lord Dalhousie’s misfortune that these benefits are too often forgotten in the vivid recollections of the Mutiny, which avenged his policy of annexation.

Lord Dalhousie had not been six months in India before the second Sikh war broke out. Two British officers were treacherously assassinated at Mùltân. Unfortunately Henry Lawrence was at home on sick leave. The British army was not ready to act in the hot weather, and, despite the single-handed exertions of Lieutenant (afterwards Sir Herbert) Edwardes, this outbreak of fanaticism led to a general rising. The khalsa army again came together, and once more fought on even terms with the British. On the fatal field of Chilianwâla, which patriotism prefers to call a drawn battle, the British lost 2400 officers and men, besides four guns and the colours of three regiments. Before reinforcements could come out from England, with Sir Charles Napier as commander-in-chief, Lord Gough had restored his own reputation by the crowning victory of Guzerat, which absolutely destroyed the Sikh army. Mùltân had previously fallen; and the Afghân horse under Dost Muhammad, who had forgotten their hereditary antipathy to the Sikhs in their greater hatred of the British name, were chased back with ignominy to their native hills. The Punjab henceforth became a British province, supplying a virgin field for the administrative talents of Dalhousie and the two Lawrences. Râjâ Dhulip Sinh received an allowance of £50,000 a year, on which he retired as a country gentleman to Norfolk in England. The first step in the pacification of the Punjab was a general disarmament, which resulted in the delivery of no less than 120,000 weapons of various kinds. Then followed a settlement of the land tax, village by village, at an assessment much below that to which it had been raised by Sikh exactions, and the introduction of a loose but equitable code of civil and criminal procedure. Roads and canals were laid out by Colonel Robert Napier (afterwards Lord Napier of Magdala); and the security of British peace and the personal influence of British officers were felt to the furthest corners of the province. Thus it happened that, when the Mutiny broke out in 1857, the Punjab remained not only quiet but loyal, after only eight years’ experience of English rule; while the North Western Provinces, which had been British territory for more than half a century, rose in rebellion. The second Burmese war of 1852 was caused by the ill-treatment of European merchants at Rangoon, and the insolence offered to the captain of a frigate who had been sent to remonstrate. The whole valley of the Irawadi, from Rangoon to Prome, was occupied in a few months, and, as the king of Ava refused to treat, it was annexed, under the name of Pegu, to the provinces of Arakan and Tenasserim, which had been acquired in 1826. Since annexation the inhabitants of [9:12:809] Rangoon have increased tenfold in number, and that port now ranks third in British India, being surpassed only by Calcutta and Madras. Lord Dalhousie’s dealings with the feudatory states of India can only be rightly appreciated as part of his general policy. That rulers only exist for the good of the ruled was his supreme axiom of government, of which he gave the most conspicuous example by the practice of his own daily life. That British administration was better for the people than native rule followed from this axiom as a necessary corollary. He was thus led to regard.native chiefs from somewhat the same point of view as the Scotch regarded the hereditary jurisdictions after 1745, as mischievous anomalies, to be abolished by every means practicable. Good faith must be kept with rulers on the throne and with · their legitimate heirs, but no false sentiment should preserve dynasties that had forfeited all consideration by years of accumulated misrule, or prolong those that had no natural successor. The “doctrine of lapse” was merely a special application of these principles, though complicated by the theory of adoption. It has never been doubted that, according to Hindu private law, an adopted son entirely fills the place of a natural son, whether to perform the religious obsequies of his father or to inherit his property. In all respects he continues the persona of the deceased. But it was argued that the succession to a throne stood upon a different footing. The paramount power could not recognize such a right, which might be used as a fraud to hand over the happiness of millions to a base-born impostor. Here came in the maxim of “the good of the governed.” The material benefits to be conferred through British administration surely weighed heavier in the scale than a superstitious and frequently fraudulent fiction of inheritance. The first state to escheat to the British Government in accordance with these principles was Sâtârâ, which had been reconstituted by Lord Hastings on the downfall of the peshwâ in 1818. The last direct representative of Sivaji died without a male heir in 1848, and his deathbed adoption was set aside. In the same year the Râjput state of Karauli was saved by the interposition of the court of directors, who drew a fine distinction between a dependent principality and a protected ally. In 1833 Jhânsi suffered the same fate as Sâtârâ. But the most conspicuous application of the doctrine of lapse was the case of Nâgpur The last of the Bhonslâs, a dynasty older than the British Government itself, died without a son, natural or adopted, in 1853. That year also saw British administration extended to the Berars, or the assigned districts which the nizâm of Hyderabad was induced to cede as a territorial guarantee for the subsidies which he perpetually kept in arrear Three more distinguished names likewise passed away in 1853, though without any attendant accretion to British territory. In the extreme south the titular nawâb of the Carnatic and the titular râjâ of Tanjore both died without heirs. Their rank and their pensions died with them, though compassionate allowances were continued to their families. In the north of India, Bâji Râo, the ex-peshwâ who had been dethroned in 1818, lived on till 1853 in the enjoyment of his annual pension of £80,000. His adopted son, Nâna Sâhib, inherited his accumulated savings, but could obtain no further recognition.

The annexation of the province of Oudh is to be defended on very different grounds. Ever since the nawâb wazir, Shujâ-ud-Daulâ, received back his forfeited territories from the hands of Lord Clive in 1765, the very existence of Oudh as an independent state had depended only upon the protection of British bayonets. Thus, preserved alike from foreign invasion and from domestic rebellion, the long line of subsequent nawâbs had given way to that neglect of public affairs and those private vices which naturally flow from irresponsible power. Their only redeeming virtue was steady loyalty to the British Government. Oudh has been called “the Garden of India” by an author^[85. The Garden of India, or Chapters on Oudh History and Affairs, bv H. C. Irwin, London, 1880.] who endeavours to show that the evils of native rule were never so black as they have been painted. But at any rate that fair corner of the Gangetic basin, which now supports a denser population than any equal area on the surface of the globe, had been groaning for generations under anarchy for which each successive governor-general ⅛dmitted that he was partly responsible. Warning after warning had been given to the nawâbs (who had assumed the title of shâh or king since 1819) that they must put their house in order. What the benevolent Bentinck and the soldierly Hardinge had only threatened was reserved for Lord Dalhousie, who united honesty of purpose with decision of character. In this determination he had the full support of the court of directors at home. In 1856, the last year of his rule, he issued orders to General (afterwards Sir James) Outram, then resident at the court of Lucknow, to assume the direct administration of Oudh, on the ground that “the British Government would be guilty in the sight of God and man, if it were any longer to aid in sustaining by its countenance an administration fraught with suffering to millions.” The king, Wâjid Ali, bowed to irresistible force, though he ever refused to recognize the justice of his deposition. After a mission to England, by way of protest and appeal, he settled down in the pleasant suburb of Garden Reach near Calcutta, where he lived in the enjoyment of a pension of £120,000 a year. Oudh was thus annexed without a blow; but it may be doubted whether the one measure of Lord Dalhousie upon which he looked back himself with the clearest conscience was not the very one that most-alarmed native public opinion.

The marquis of Dalhousie resigned office in March 1856, being then only forty-four years of age; but he carried home with him the seeds of a lingering illness which resulted in his death in 1860. Excepting Cornwallis, he was the first, though by no means the last, of English statesmen who have fallen victims to their devotion to India’s needs. He was succeeded by his friend, Lord Canning, who, at the farewell banquet in England given to him by the court of directors, uttered these prophetic words: “I wish for a peaceful term of office. But I cannot forget that in the sky of India, serene as it is, a small cloud may arise, no larger than a man’s hand, but which, growing larger and larger, may at last threaten to burst and overwhelm us with ruin.” In the following year the sepoys of the Bengal army mutinied, and all the valley of the Ganges from Patnâ to Delhi rose in open rebellion.

The various motives assigned for the Mutiny appear inadequate to the European mind. The truth seems to be that native opinion throughout India was in a ferment, predisposing men to believe the wildest stories, and to act precipitately upon their fears. The influence of panic in an Oriental population is greater than might be readily believed. In the first place, the policy of Lord Dalhousie, exactly in proportion as it had been dictated by the most honourable considerations, was utterly distasteful to the native mind. Repeated annexations, the spread of education, the appearance of the steam engine and the telegraph wire, all alike revealed a consistent determination to substitute an English for an Indian civilization. The Bengal sepoys, especially, thought that they could see into the future farther than the rest of their countrymen. Nearly all men of high caste, and many of them recruited from Oudh, they dreaded tendencies which they deemed to be denationalizing, and they knew at first hand what annexation [9:12:810] meant. They believed it was by their prowess that the Punjab had been conquered, and all India was held quiet. The numerous dethroned princes, their heirs and their widows, were the first to learn and take advantage of the spirit of disaffection that was abroad. They had heard of the Crimean war, and were told that Russia was the perpetual enemy of England. They had money in abundance with which they could buy the assistance of skilful intriguers. They had everything to gain, and nothing to lose, by a revolution.

In this critical state of affairs, of which the Government had no official knowledge, a rumour ran through the cantonments of the Bengal army that cartridges had been served out greased with the fat of animals unclean alike to Hindu and Mahometan. After this, nothing could quiet the minds of the sepoys. Fires occurred nightly in the native lines; officers were insulted by their men; all confidence was gone, and only the form of discipline remained. On the afternoon of Sunday, May 10, 1857, the sepoys at Meerut (Mirath) broke into open mutiny. Their first mad frenzy marked by its excess the change from their usually quiet manners and orderly habits. They broke into the jail, and then ran through the cantonments, cutting down every European they met. At last they streamed off to the neighbouring city of Delhi, to stir up the native garrison and the criminal population of that great city, and to place themselves under the authority of the discrowned Mughal emperor. Meerut was the largest military station in India, with a strong European garrison of foot, horse, and guns, sufficient to overwhelm the mutineers before ever they reached Delhi. But just as the sepoys acted in irrational panic, so did British officers in but too many cases act with equally irrational indecision. The news of the outbreak was telegraphed to Delhi, and nothing more was done that night. The next morning the Mahometans of Delhi rose, and all that the Europeans there could do was to blow up the magazine. A rallying centre and a traditional name was thus given to the revolt, which forthwith spread like wildfire through all the North-Western Provinces and Oudh down into Lower Bengal. The same narrative must suffice for all, though each episode has its own peculiar story of sadness and devotion. The sepoys rose on their officers, without warning, and sometimes after protestations of fidelity. The Europeans, or persons of Christian faith, were massacred, sometimes also women and children. The jail was broken open, the treasure plundered, and then all marched off to some centre of revolt, to join in what had now become a national war. Only in the Punjab were the sepoys anticipated by the stern measures of repression and disarmament adopted by Sir John Lawrence and his lieutenants, among whom Edwardes and Nicholson were conspicuous. The Sikh population never wavered. Crowds of willing recruits came down from the Afghân hills. And thus the Punjab, instead of being itself a source of danger, was able to furnish a portion of its own garrison for the siege of Delhi. In Lower Bengal most of the sepoys mutinied, and then dispersed in different directions. The native armies of Madras and Bombay remained true to their colours. In Central India the contingents of many of the great chiefs sooner or later joined the rebels, but the Mahometan state of Hyderabad was kept loyal by the authority of its able minister Sir Sâlar Jang.

The main interest of the sepoy war gathers round the three cities of Cawnpur, Lucknow, and Delhi. The cantonments at Cawnpur contained the largest native garrison in India; and in the immediate neighbourhood, at Bithùr, was the palace of Dandhu Panth, the disinherited heir of the last peshwâ, whose more familiar appellation of Nâna Sâhib will ever be handed down to the infamy of history. At first the Nâna was profuse in his professions of loyalty, but as soon as the sepoys mutinied he put himself at their head, and was proclaimed peshwâ of the Marhattâs. The Europeans at Cawnpur, who numbered more women and children than fighting men, shut themselves up in improvised entrenchments, where they sustained a siege for nineteen days under the sun of a tropical June. At last, trusting to a safe conduct from the Nâna as far as Allahâbâd, they surrendered their position, and to the number of four hundred and fifty individuals embarked in boats on the Ganges. Forthwith a murderous fire was opened upon them from the river bank. Only a single boat escaped, and but four men, who swam across to the protection of a friendly râjâ, ultimately survived to tell the tale. The rest of the men were massacred on the spot; the women and children, numbering one hundred and twenty-five, were reserved for the same fate a few days later, when the avenging army of Havelock was at hand. Sir Henry Lawrence, the chief commissioner of Oudh, had foreseen the coming storm with a prophetic eye. He had fortified and provisioned the residency at Lucknow in good time, and thither he retired with all the European inhabitants and a weak British regiment on July 2. Two days later he was mortally wounded by a shell. But his example inspired the little garrison to hold out under unparalleled hardships and against enormous odds, until relieved by Havelock and Outram on September 25. But the relieving force was itself invested by fresh swarms of rebels, and it was not till November that Sir Colin Campbell, afterwards Lord Clyde, cut his way into Lucknow, and effected the final deliverance of the garrison. The siege of Delhi began on June 8, just one month after the original outbreak at Meerut. Siege in the proper sense of the word it was not, for the British army, encamped on the historic ridge, never exceeded 8000 men, while the rebels within the walls were more than 30,000 strong. In the middle of August Nicholson arrived with a reinforcement from the Punjab, but his own encouraging presence was more valuable than the reinforcement he brought. On September 14 the assault was delivered, and after six days’ desperate fighting in the streets Delhi was again won. Nicholson fell at the head of the storming party. Hodson, the intrepid leader of a corps of irregular horse, hunted down and brought in as prisoner the old Mughal emperor, Bahâdur Shâh, and then in cold blood shot down the emperor’s sons with his own hand. After the fall of Delhi and the final relief of Lucknow the war loses its dramatic interest, though fighting went on in various parts of the country for eighteen months longer. The population of Oudh and Rohilkhand, stimulated by the presence of the begum of Oudh, the nawâb of Bareilly, and Nâna Sâhib himself, had joined the mutinous sepoys en masse. In this quarter of India alone, it was the revolt of a people rather than the mutiny of an army that had to be quelled. Sir Colin Campbell in person conducted the campaign in Oudh, which lasted through two cold seasons. Valuable assistance was lent by Sir Jang Bahâdur of Nepâl, at the head of a numerous army of Gùrkhas. Town after town was occupied, fort ι after fort was stormed, until at length the last gun had been 1 recaptured and the last fugitive had flea across the 1 frontier by January 1859 In the meanwhile Sir Hugh Rose (afterwards Lord Strathnairn),with another army from Bombay, was conducting an equally brilliant campaign in Central India. His most formidable antagonists were the disinherited râni of Jhânsi, and Tântia Topi, whose military talent had previously inspired Nâna Sâhib with all the capacity for resistance that he ever displayed. The râni died fighting bravely at the head of her troops in June 1858; Tantiâ Topi, after doubling backwards and forwards through Central India, was at last betrayed and run down in April 1859.
[9:12:811]

The Mutiny sealed the fate of the East India Company, after a life of more than two and a half centuries.

The Company received its original charter of incorporation from Elizabeth in 1600. Its political powers, and the constitution of the Indian Government, were derived from the Regulating Act of 1773, passed by the ministry of Lord North. By that statute the governor of Bengal was raised to the rank of governor-general; and, in conjunction with his council of four other members, he was entrusted with the duty of superintending and controlling the governments of Madras and Bombay so far as regarded questions of peace and war; a supreme court of judicature was appointed at Calcutta, to which the judges were appointed by the crown; and a power of making rules, ordinances, and regulations was conferred upon the governor-general and his council. Next came the India Bill of Pitt (1784), which founded the board of control, strengthened the supremacy of Bengal over the other presidencies, and first authorized the historic phrase “governor-general-in-council.” The Act which abolished the Company’s monopoly of trade (1833) also introduced several reforms into the constitution of the Indian Government, and added to the council an additional member, who might not be chosen from among the Company’s servants, and was entitled to be present only at meetings for making laws and regulations; it gave the authority of Acts of Parliament to the laws and regulations so made, subject to the disallowance of the court of directors; it appointed a law commission; and it gave the governorgeneral-in-council a control over the other presidencies in all points relating to the civil or military administration. The charter of the Company was renewed for the last time in 1853, not for a definite period of years, but only for so long as parliament should ordain. On this occasion the number of directors was reduced, and their patronage as regards appointments to the civil service was taken away, to make room for the principle of open competition.

The Act for the better government of India (1858), which finally transferred the entire administration from the Company to the crown, was not passed without an eloquent protest from the directors, nor without acrimonious party discussion in parliament It enacts that India shall be governed by, and in the name of, the sovereign of England through one of the principal secretaries of state, assisted by a council of fifteen members. The governor-general received the new title of viceroy. The European troops of the Company, numbering about 24,000 officers and men, were amalgamated with the royal service, and the Indian navy was abolished. By the Indian Councils Act (1861) the governor-general’s council and also the councils at Madras and Bombay were augmented by the addition ofnon-official members, either natives or Europeans, for legislative purposes only; and by another Act passed in the same year nigh courts of judicature were constituted out of the existing supreme courts at the presidency towns.

It fell to the lot of Lord Canning both to suppress the Mutiny and to introduce the peaceful revolution that followed. As regards his execution of the former part of his duties, it is sufficient to say that he preserved his equanimity undisturbed in the darkest hours of peril, and that the strict impartiality of his conduct incurred alternate praise and blame from the fanatics on either side The epithet then scornfully applied to him of “Clemency” Canning is now remembered only to his honour. On November 1, 1858, at a grand darbdr held ai Allahâbâd the royal proclamation was published which announced that the queen had assumed the government of India. This document, which has been called the Magna Charta of the Indian people, went on to explain the policy of political justice and religious toleration which it was her royal pleasure to pursue, and granted an amnesty to all except those who had directly taken part in the murder of British subjects. Peace was proclaimed throughout India on July 8, 1859; and in the following cold weather Lord Canning made a viceregal progress through the upper provinces, to receive the homage of loyal princes and chiefs, and to guarantee to them the right of adoption. The suppression of the Mutiny increased the debt of India by about 40 millions sterling, and the military changes that ensued augmented the annual expenditure by about 10 millions. To grapple with this deficit, Mr James Wilson was sent out from the treasury as financial member of council. He reorganized the customs system, imposed an income tax and licence duty, and created a state paper currency. The penal code, originally drawn up by Macaulay in 1837, passed into law in 1860, together with a code of civil and criminal procedure.

Lord'Canning left India in March 1862, and died before he had been a month in England. His successor, Lord Elgin, only lived till November 1863, when he too fell a victim to the excessive work of the governor-generalship, dying at the Himâlayari station of Dharmsâlâ, where he lies buried. He was succeeded by Sir John Lawrence, the saviour of the Punjab. The chief incidents of his administration were the Bhutân war and the terrible Orissa famine. Lord Mayo, who succeeded him in 1869, carried on the permanent British policy of moral and material progress with a special degree of personal energy. The Ambâlâ(Umballa) darbâr,at which Shere Ali was recognized as amir of Afghànistân, though in one sense merely the completion of what Lord Lawrence had begun, owed much of its success to the personal influence of Lord Mayo himself. The same quality, combined with sympathy and firmness, stood him in good stead in all his dealings both with native chiefs and European officials. His example of hard work stimulated all to their best. While engaged in exploring with his own eyes the furthest corners of the empire, he fell by the hand of an assassin in the convict settlement of the Andaman Islands in 1872. His successor was Lord Northbrook, whose ability showed itself chiefly in the department of finance. During the time of his administration a famine in Lower Bengal in 1874 was successfully obviated by Government relief and public works, though at an enormous cost; the gâikwâr of Baroda was dethroned in 1875 for misgovernment and disloyalty, while his dominions were continued to a nominated child of the family; and the Prince of Wales made a tour through the country in the cold weather of 1875-76. Lord Lytton followed Lord Northbrook in 1876. On January 1, 1877, Queen Victoria was proclaimed Empress of India at a darldr of unequalled magnificence, held on the historic “ridge” overlooking the Mughal capital of Delhi. But, while the princes and high officials of the country were flocking to this gorgeous scene, the shadow of famine was already darkening over the south of India. Both the monsoons of 1876 had failed to bring their due supply of rain, and the season of 1877 was little better. The consequences of this prolonged drought, which extended from the Deccan to Cape Comorin, and subsequently invaded northern India, were more disastrous than any similar calamity since the introduction of British rule. Despite unparalleled importations of grain by sea and rail, despite the most strenuous exertions of the Government, which incurred a total expenditure on this account of 11 millions sterling, the loss of life from actual starvation and its attendant train of diseases was lamentable. The total number of deaths from disease and want in the distressed tracts in excess of the normal mortality for the two years 1876-78 is estimated to have raised the death-rate by 40 per cent., or 5{ millions. Tn the autumn of 1878 the affairs of Afghànistân again forced themselves into notice. Shere Ali, the amir, who [9:12:812] had been hospitably entertained by Lord Mayo, was found to be favouring Russian intrigues. A British embassy was refused admittance to the country, while a Russian mission was received with honour. This led to a declaration of war. British armies advanced by three routes,—the Khaibar (Khyber), the Kuram, and the Bolân, and without much opposition occupied the inner entrances of the passes. Shere Ali fled to Afghân Turkestân, and there died. A treaty was entered into with his son, Yâkub Khân, at Gandamak, by which the British frontier was advanced to the crests or further sides of the passes, and a British officer was admitted to reside at Cabul. Within a few months the British resident, Sir Louis Cavagnari, was treacherously attacked and massacred, together with his escort, and a second war became necessary. Yâkub Khân abdicated, and was deported to India; Cabul was occupied in force, and an Afghân chief of the Durâni line was placed in the government of Kandahâr with the title of wâli. At that crisis of affairs a general election in England resulted in a defeat of the ministry. Lord Lytton resigned with the Conservative ’ministry, and the marquis of Ripon was nominated as his successor in 1880. Since then, a British brigade received a defeat between Kandahâr and the Helmand river from the Herâti army of Ayùb Khân, a defeat promptly and completely retrieved by the brilliant march of General Sir Frederick Roberts from Cabul to Kandahâr, and by the total rout of Ayiïb Khân’s army on September 1, 1880. Abdurrahman Khân, the eldest male representative of the stock of Dost Muhammad, has now been recognized as amir of Cabul.
