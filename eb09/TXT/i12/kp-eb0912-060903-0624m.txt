IBN KHALLIKAN (1211 -1282). Abu Ί Abbâs Ahme⅛ better known as Ibn Khallikan,^[1. By some scholars this surname is written Ihn Khillikan; but his own autograph signature recently found upon a manuscript in the University Library, Cambridge, gives the usually accepted form. ] author of the celebrated Arabic biographical dictionary, was born at Arbela on the 22d September 1211. Some of his biographers trace his descent to Jaafer the Barmecide, the well-known unfortunate friend and vizier of Haroun Alraschid. His life was that of a scholar and literary man, and he was promoted in his later years to the office of cadi of Damascus. He died in the Najιbiyeh College of that city on the 29th October 1282. His great work is the Kitâb Wafayât el 'Aiyàn, “ The Obituaries of Eminent Men,” and contains brief sketches of the lives of all the most important [9:12:610] personages of Muslim history and literature, with many appropriate anecdotes illustrative of their personal character, and extracts from the works of such of them as were authors or poets. It is the most complete and at the same time the most universal and comprehensive biographical dictionary in the Arabic language, and is the indispensable companion of the student of Mahometan literature. Ibn Khallikan has many imitators, the best-known work of the kind being the Fuwdt eV Wafaydt, “Omissions of the Wafayat,” by Salâh ed din Muhammed ibn Shàkir, which has been published, as well as the work which it is intended to supplement, at the Boulak press.

Ibn Khallikan’s work has been published in Arabic with an English translation by Baron MacGuckin de Slane for the Oriental Translation Fund of Great Britain and Ireland (Paris, 1842), and this edition, which is found in most public libraries, is the best and the most accessible one extant.
