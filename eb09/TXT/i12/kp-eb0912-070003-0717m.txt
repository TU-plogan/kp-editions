IGLO, formerly Neudorf, a mining town of North Hungary, in the county of Szepes or Zips, is pleasantly situated on the Hernâd, and on the Kaschau-Oderberg line of railway, about 5 miles south of Löcse (Leutschau), in 48° 56' N. lat. and 20° 33' E. long. Among the few public buildings are Lutheran and Roman Catholic churches, a gymnasium, a teachers’ seminary, a circuit court, and the usual Government offices. There are, moreover, factories for the manufacture of stoneware, fuller’s earth, linen, and paper; also sawmills, steam flour mills, and iron foundries. In the vicinity are extensive iron and copper mines and •stone quarries. The inhabitants of the town and neighbourhood, are chiefly employed in mining, bee-keeping, flaxgrowing, agriculture, and trade. The population (including that of Great and Little Iglé-Hnilecz) amounts to 6691, mostly German by nationality and Lutheran by creed. Iglo was formerly the capital of the sixteen privileged Zips towns, and its origin may be traced to Saxon colonists of the 12th century.
