INDUS, one of the three greatest rivers of northern India, rises in unknown regions on the northern slopes of the sacred Kailas Mountain in the Himâlayas. . On the south of this same hill rises the Sutlej, the great feeder of the Indus, which unites with it after a separate course of about 1000 miles. The Indus rises in 32° N. lat. and 81° E, long., enters the Punjab in 34° 25' N. lat. and 72° 5Γ E. long., leaves the Punjab in 28° 27' N. lat. and 69° 47' E. long., enters Sind in 28° 26' N. lat. and 69° 47' E. long., and finally falls into the Arabian Sea in 23° 58' N. lat. and 67° 30' E. long. The basin of the Indus is estimated at 372,700 square miles, and its total length at a little over 1800 miles.

The first third of its course lies outside of British territory. It at first flows north-west for about 160 miles under the name of “Sinh-ka-bab,” until it receives the Gar. Shortly after this junction it enters Kashmir. Near Iskardoh in Little Tibet is the wonderful gorge by which the river bursts through the western ranges of the Himâlayas, said to be 14,000 feet in depth. For about 120 miles the river passes south-west through the wilds of Kohistân until it reaches the Punjab frontier near Derbend.' A little way above Attock, in Rawâl Pindi district, it receives the Cabul river, which brings down to it the waters from Afghânistân via Jalâlâbâd and the Khyber Pass. The two rivers have about the same volume; both are. very swift, and are broken up with rocks. Their junction during floods is a scene of wild confusion of waters. At Attock the river has fallen from its elevation of 16,000 feet at its source in Tibet to under 2000 feet. After leaving Attock, the Indus flows almost due south down the western side of the Punjab, parallel to the Sulâimân hills. Just above Mithankot, in the south of the Derâ Ghâzi Khân district, the Indus receives the accumulated waters of the Punjab. Between the Indus and the Jumna (Jamunâ) flow the five great streams from which the Punjab (Panj-âb, literally “The land of the five rivers ”) takes its name. These are the Jhelum, the Chenâb, the Râvi, the Bids, and the Sutlej. After various junctions these rivers all unite to form the Panjnad, literally “The five rivers.” The Panjnad marks for a short space the boundary between the Punjab and Bahâwalpur, and unites with the Indus near Mithankot, about 490 miles from the sea. The breadth of the Indus above the confluence is about 600 yards, its velocity 5 miles an hour, its depth from 12 to 15 feet, and its estimated discharge 91,719 cubic feet per second. The breadth of the Panjnad above the point of junction is 1076 yards, with a depth of 12 to 15 feet, but a velocity of only 2 miles an hour. . Its estimated discharge is 68,955 cubic feet per second.

Below the junction the united stream, under the name of the Indus, has a breadth which varies from 2000 yards to several miles, according to the season of the year. The whole course of the river through the Punjab is broken up by islands and sandbanks. The Indus enters Sind in 28° 26' N. lat. and 69° 47' E. long., and empties itself by many mouths into the Arabian Sea, after a generally south-westerly course in this province of 580 miles. Its average width during the low season is 680 yards; its depth varies from 4 to 24 feet. Its velocity in the freshes averages 7 knots per hour, at ordinary times 3 knots. The discharge per second varies at the two periods from 446,086 cubic feet to 40,857. The average temperature is 10° lower than that of the air.

The delta of the Indus covers an area of about 3000 square miles, and extends along the coast-line for 125 miles. It is almost a perfect level, and nearly destitute of timber, the tamarisk and mangrove alone supplying fuel. In the marshy portions good pasturage is obtained, and in the drier rice grows luxuriantly. The climate of the delta is cool and bracing in the “winter” months, excessively hot in the “summer,” and most healthy during the floods.

The Indus begins to rise in March, attains its maximum depth and width in August, and subsides in September. The registered rise at Gidu-Bandar is 15 feet. Fish abound,—at the mouths, the salt-water varieties, notably the Clupea neowhii, a species of herring; the chief of the freshwater varieties is the pala. The local consumption and export of the dried pala are both very large. The boats of the Indus are the dundhi and zaurak (cargo boats), the kauntäl or ferry-boats, and the dûndo or fishing boats. The aggregate burthen of the native craft on the river in 1861-62 was as follows :—up-stream to Sukkur 20,232 tons, and beyond that town 16,317; down-stream to Sukkur 7694 tons, and beyond it 11,456. In 1874 the number of steamers plying was fourteen, and of barges forty-three, with an aggregate burthen of 10,641 tons; the receipts amounted to £83,370.
