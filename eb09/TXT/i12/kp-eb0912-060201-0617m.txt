I

I is one of those symbols which the Greeks employed differently from the Phoenicians. Tn Phoenician it denoted the palatal semi-vowel y, called in Hebrew yodh. The Greeks disliked this sound, and it vanished at an early time out of their language. Consequently they needed no symbol to represent it, and could use the Phoenician symbol to denote that for which the Phoenician alphabet gave them no help, namely, the vowel i. The symbol, however, had not at that time its present simple form, as may be seen by reference to the table at the end of the article Alphabet. It was made up of several lines, and so it appears in the oldest Greek inscriptions, e.g., in those of Thera, about the 40th Olympiad, in which it is not unlike the later form of sigma (⅜). In the old Corinthian alphabet it sometimes has this form; sometimes the angles to the left are rounded, so that it resembles an e. Generally, however, we find it in Greek simplified into the single straight line with which we are familiar. It has no other form in the Latin alphabet. In the last century before Christ, the Romans sometimes lengthened the symbol to denote the long vowel, so that it reached above the top of the line, while the short vowel was expressed by a line of the usual length. This took the place of the older method by which the symbol was doubled to denote the long vowel; as aa, ee, ii. But it never became universal, nor was the lengthened symbol always put to the same use; for about the same time we find it used to denote the y sound in words like Maia, cuius, where the Romans rightly thought it expedient to have a distinct mark for the semi-vowel. But this also was not permanent.

The value of the symbol is generally constant in all European languages, ancient or modern, with the exception of English. It is the vowel sound produced by raising the front of the tongue towards the palate, as high as it can be raised without touching. The lips are not rounded; by rounding them, when the tongue is in this position, we should produce the sound of the French u or the German Ü. The vowel may, however, be either open or close, and in either of these cases it may be short or long. Therefore we have four variations, of which, however, probably not more than two are found in any spoken language :—(1) the short open i, heard in English “sin”; (2) the long open i, which is not one of our spoken sounds, but can be produced in singing; (3) the short close i, which again is not English, but is the Italian short i ; (4) the long close i, which is the Italian long i, and is also common in English; but we denote the sound, not by i, but by ee, as in “seen.” It is generally supposed that the sound of ee stands to that of i in English as a long vowel to the corresponding short; but this is not so; there is a difference in quality as well; ee denotes (as has been just explained) a close vowel, whereas i is open. It is true that in ordinary English the open vowel i only occurs short, and the close vowel long, therefore the confusion is natural. A Scotchman, however, finds no difficulty in pronouncing “seen” short.

It is practically necessary in English to denote the simple long i sound by ee, because the English language has habitually altered the simple sound into a diphthong, and has retained for that diphthong the original spelling i. Thus in words like “pride,” “mine,” “fire,” &c., the vowel had once in England the same sound as it has on the Continent; but now it is sounded as the diphthong ai, though the spelling has not been changed. It appears from Mr Alexander J. Ellis’s investigations into the history of English pronunciation that i had become a diphthong in the 16th century; but the exact date of the change must remain uncertain. There can be little doubt that its nature has been correctly explained by the same philologist. It consists in pronouncing the long vowel without sufficiently raising the tongue at the beginning of the sound; hence the sound is at first too open, and is modified into the proper i sound before it is terminated. Changes of this sort are natural in long vowels, because there is time to vary the original sound, either as a refinement, or, more probably, through mere inattention and laziness.
