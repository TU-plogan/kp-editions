IGUANA (Iguanidae), a family of lizards belonging to the suborder Pachyglossae or “thick-tongued,” and comprising 56 genera and 236 species. With a single undoubted exception, all the genera of this extensive family belong to the New World, being specially characteristic of the Neotropical region, where they occur as far south as Patagonia, while extending northward into the warmer parts of the Nearctic region as far as California and British Columbia. The single non-American genus— Brachylophus —occurs in the Fiji Islands. The iguanas are characterized by the peculiar form of their teeth, these being round at the root and blade-like, with serrated edges towards the tip, resembling in this respect the gigantic extinct reptile iguanodon. The typical forms belonging to this family are distinguished by the large dewlap or pouch situated beneath the head and neck, and by the crest, composed of slender elongated scales, which extends in gradually diminishing height from the nape of the neck to the extremity of the tail. The latter organ is very long, slender, and compressed, while its vertebrae, in common with those of certain other lizards, possess thin unossified septa traversing their centres. It is owing to the weakness thus produced in their vertebral column that, when caught [9:12:701] by the tail, they are able to part so readily with the portion seized. The tongue is generally short and not deeply divided at its extremity, nor is its base retracted into a sheath; it is always moist and covered with a glutinous secretion. The prevailing colour of the iguanas is green; and, as the majority of them are arboreal in their habits, such colouring may be generally regarded as protective. Those on the other hand which reside on the ground have much duller, although as a rule equally protective hues; thus Darwin observed on the shore at Bahia a terrestrial member of this family, which from its mottled appearance could hardly be distinguished from the surrounding surface. Iguanas, however, possess to an extent only exceeded by the chameleon the power of changing their colours, their brilliant green becoming transformed in an instant, under the influence of fear or irritation, into more sombre hues and even into black. They differ greatly in size, from a few inches to several feet in length. One of the largest and most widely distributed is the common iguana (Iguana tul)erculata∖ which occurs in South America and the West Indies. It attains a length of 5 feet, and is of a greenish colour occasionally mixed with brown, while the tail is surrounded with alternate rings of those colours. Its food consists of vegetable substances, which it obtains from the forest trees among whose branches it lives and in the hollows of which it deposits its eggs. These are of an oblong shape, about an inch and a half in length, and are said by travellers to be very pleasant eating, especially when taken raw, as they usually are, and mixed with farina. They are timid, defenceless animals, depending for safety on the comparative inaccessibility of their arboreal haunts and their protective colouring, which is rendered even more effective by their remaining still on the approach of danger. Otherwise they exhibit few signs of animal intelligence. “The iguana,” says Bates (The Naturalist on the Amazon), “is one of the stupidest animals I ever met. The one I caught dropped helplessly from a tree just ahead of me; it turned round for a moment to have an idiotic stare at the intruder, and then set off running along the path. I ran after it and it then stopped as a timid dog would do, crouching down and permitting me to seize it by the neck and carry it off.” Along with several other species the common iguana is much sought after in tropical America; the natives esteem its flesh a delicacy, and capture it by slipping a noose round its neck as it sits in fancied security on the branch of a tree. Although chiefly arboreal, many of the iguanas take readily to the water; and there is at least one species, Oreocephalus cristatus, which leads for the most part an aquatic life. These marine lizards occur only in the Galapagos Islands, where they are never seen more than 20 yards inland, while they may often be observed in companies several hundreds of yards from the shore, swimming with great facility by means of their flattened tails. Their feet are all more or less webbed, but in swimming they are said to keep these organs motionless by their sides. Their food consists of marine vegetation, to obtain which they dive beneath the water, where they are able to remain, without coming to the surface to breathe, for a very considerable time. Though they are thus the most aquatic of lizards, Mr Darwin, who studied their habits during his visit to those islands, states that when frightened they will not enter the water. Driven along a narrow ledge of rock to the edge of the sea, they preferred capture to escape by swimming, while if thrown into the water they immediately returned to the point from which they started. A land species belonging to the allied genus Trachycephalus also occurs in the Galapagos, which differs from most of its kind in forming burrows in the ground.
