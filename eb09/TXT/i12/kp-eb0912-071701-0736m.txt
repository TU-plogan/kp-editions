IMOLA, the ancient Forum Cornelii, a town of Italy, capital of a circle in the province of Bologna, is situated in a fruitful and charming plain on the old Aemilian way, near the river Santerno (ancient Vatrenus), 21 miles southeast of Bologna and 46 north-west of Rimini, on the railway connecting those towns. It is the seat of a bishop and of a subprefecture. The town is surrounded by walls flanked with towers, and its streets are spacious and lined with arcades. It possesses a cathedral with an octagonal tower, an old castle, a gymnasium, a technical school, a school of music, a public library, orphanages for boys and girls, a hospital, and a corn exchange. The manufacture of wine is the principal industry, but a special kind of cream of tartar is also made, and there is considerable trade in corn, hemp, flax, rice, and silk. The population of the town in 1871 was 9355 and of the commune 28,398. In 1876 the population of the commune was 28,678.

The ancient Forum Comelii is said to have derived its name from its founder the dictator Sulla. According to Cicero, it was occupied by Octavian during the civil war which followed the death of Caesar, and Martial mentions it in the third book of his epigrains as the place where he was at that time residing. The modern name of the town is, according to Paulus Diaconus, derived from that of the old citadel. The town, after its destruction in 538 by Names, general of the emperor Justinian I., was rebuilt by the Lombards, after which it remained under the lordship of Bologna till the end of the 13th century. In 1272 it was taken possession of by the Pagani, and in 1292 by the Alidosii, from whom it was seized in 1472 by Duke Philip Maria Visconti of Milan. Under the pontificate of Alexander VI. it was incorporated with the States of the Church. In 1708 it was captured by the imperialists, and in 1797 by the French.
