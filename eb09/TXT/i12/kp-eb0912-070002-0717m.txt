IGLESIAS, a town of Sardinia, capital of a district in the province of Cagliari, is beautifully situated amongst limestone hills about 3 miles from the west coast, and at the terminus of a railway line from Cagliari, 34 miles westnorth-west from that town. It is the seat of the suffragan bishop of Cagliari, and possesses a cathedral, an episcopal palace, four convents, a Jesuit college, and the ruins of old fortifications. The town is abundantly supplied with water from various springs. The surrounding country is highly productive, and there is an active trade in wine, oil, fruits, cheese, corn, and other agricultural products. Lead and zinc are obtained in the neighbourhood. The population of the town in 1871 was 6630.
