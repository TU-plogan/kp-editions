IGUALADA, a town of Spain, in the province of Barcelona, is situated on the left bank of the Noya, in a rich agricultural and vinebearing country, 32 miles north-west of Barcelona. It consists of an old and a new town, the former dilapidated and dirty, with narrow and irregular streets and the remains of a fortress and ramparts, while the latter possesses regular and spacious streets and many fine houses. Among the public buildings are an old Gothic church, a town-hall, two conventual buildings, a clerical college, a hospital, and military barracks. The former commercial prosperity of Igualada has now much declined, but its industries are still considerable, and comprise cotton spinning, cotton and woollen weaving, and the manufacture of firearms, leather, hats, and brandy. There is also some trade in corn. Population in 1877, 11,882.
