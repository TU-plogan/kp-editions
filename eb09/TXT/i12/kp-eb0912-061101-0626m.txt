IBYCUS, a Greek lyric poet, who flourished about the 60th Olympiad—540 B.c.—was a native of Rhegium in Italy, but spent the greater part of his life at the court of Polycrates, tyrant of Samos. A curious story, not always accepted, is told in connexion with his death. While travelling in the neighbourhood of Corinth, the poet was waylaid and mortally wounded by robbers. As he lay dying on the ground, he saw a flock of cranes flying overhead, and called upon them to avenge his death. The murderers betook themselves to Corinth, and soon after, while sitting in the theatre, saw the cranes hovering above. One of them, either in alarm or jest, ejaculated, “Behold the avengers of Ibycus,” and thus gave the clue to the detection of the crime. The phrase, “the cranes of Ibycus,” passed into a proverb among the Greeks. Of the seven books of lyrics by Ibycus, which Suidas mentions, only a few fragments have come down to us, but these afford sufficient evidence to support Cicero’s estimate of the author whom he pronounces (Tusc., iv. 33) from his writings “maxime vero omnium flagrasse amore.” Even from his mythical and heroic pieces, in which he was less successful, Ibycus did not exclude the erotic element. The dialect in which he wrote partook both of the Doric and of the Aeolic peculiarities. The best edition of the fragments is lbyci Rhegini Carminum Reliquioe, edited by Schneidewin, and published at Göttingen in 1833.
