IGNORANTINES(Frères Ignorantius), as the Brethren of the Christian Schools (Frères des Écoles Chrétiennes) are commonly though improperly called, are a religious fraternity founded at Rheims in 1679, and formally organized in 1683, by the priest Jean-Baptiste de La Salle, for the purpose of affording a free education, especially in religion, to the children of the poor. The name Ignorantine was given either on account of the low class of the pupils, or from a clause in the rules of the order forbidding its members to learn or teach Latin. Other popular names applied to the order are Frères de Saint-Yon, from the house at Rouen, which was their headquarters from 1705 till 1770, Frères à quatre bras, from their hanging sleeves, and Frères Fouetteurs, from their former use of the whip (fouet) in punishments. The brethren, although not allowed by their rules to enter holy orders, take the usual vows of chastity, poverty, and obedience. They are distinguished by a peculiar coarse black dress, consisting of a cassock, a hooded cloak with hanging sleeves, and a broadbrimmed hat. The order, approved by Pope Benedict XIII. in 1725, rapidly spread over France, and although expelled after the Revolution of 1789, was recalled by Napoleon in 1803, and formally recognized by the French Government in 1808. Since then its members have penetrated into nearly every country of Europe, and into America, Asia, and Africa. In France alone they number more than 1300 schools for young and old, attended by upwards of 300,000 pupils, taught by some 8000 masters. See Histoire du Venerable J.-Β. de la Salle, by A. Ravelet, 2d ed., Paris, 1874.
