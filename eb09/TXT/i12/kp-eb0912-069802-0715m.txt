IDOLATRY. The word ∈tδωλoλατp∈iα (idololatria t afterwards shortened occasionally to ∈ιδoλατpeια, idolatria) occurs in all four times in the New Testament, viz., in 1 Cor. X. 14, Gal. v. 20, 1 Pet. iv. 3, Col. iii. 5. In the last of these passages it is used, obviously in a typical sense, to describe the sin of covetousness or “mammon-worship.” In the other places it is employed in its natural sense, but with the utmost generality, to indicate all the rites and practices of those special forms of Paganism with which Christianity first came into collision. It can only be understood by reference to the LXX., where ∈tδωλov (like the word “idol” in A.V.) occasionally translates indifferently no fewer than sixteen words by which in the Old Testament the objects of what the later Jews called “strange worship” (∣^QT π 7 ,3 S) are denoted (see Trommius, Concordantioe). In the widest acceptation of· the word, idolatry in any form is absolutely forbidden in the second commandment, which runs “Thou shalt not make unto thee a graven image; [and] to no visible shape in heaven above, or in the earth beneath, or in the water under the earth, shalt thou bow down or render service w (see Decalogue, vol. vii. p. 15). For some account of the various interesting questions connected with the many practical departures from this law which are recorded in the history of the Israelites the reader is referred to the article Jews; those differences as to the interpretation of the prohibition which have so seriously divided Christendom are discussed under the head of Image Worship.

In the ancient church, idolatry was naturally reckoned among those magna crimina or great crimes against the first and second commandments which involved the highest ecclesiastical censures. Not only were those who had gone openly to heathen temples and partaken in the sacrifices (sacrificati) or burnt incense (thuriticati) held guilty of this crime; the same charge, in various degrees, was incurred by the libellatici, whose renunciation of idolatry had been private merely, or who otherwise had used unworthy means to evade persecution, by those also who had feigned themselves mad to avoid sacrificing, by all promoters and encouragera of idolatrous rites, and by idol makers, incense sellers, and architects or builders of structures connected with idol worship. Idolatry was made a crime against the state by the laws of Constantius {Cod. Theod., xvi. 10. 4, 6) forbidding all sacrifices on pain of death, and still more by the statutes of Theodosius {Cod. Theod., xvi. 10. 12} enacted in 392, in which sacrifice and divination were declared treasonable and punishable with death; the use of lights, incense, garlands, and libations was to involve the forfeiture of house and land where they were used; and all who entered heathen temples were to be fined. See Bingham, Antigq., bk. xvi. c. 4.
