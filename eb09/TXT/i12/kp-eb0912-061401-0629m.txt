ICEBERG, a floating mass of ice, which has broken off from such ice-sheets as cover Greenland, Spitzbergen, and other polar lands, constituting vast glacier systems ever creeping out and down from the central heights to the shores. As the glacier is pushed out to sea, the lower margin is exposed to the destructive action of the waves, and breaks up into fragments of endless variety of form. These severed blocks, many of which are hundreds of millions of tons in mass, drift to lower latitudes under the influence of polar currents, and gradually melt away in the warmer water. Such is the natural history of icebergs, which, in their freshwater origin, are to be distinguished from the ice-fields, ice-floes, pack ice, and ice-hummocks, so familiar to the polar voyager. The iceberg, as it drifts along, melts most rapidly under water; and this unequal wasting must be accompanied by a change in the position of the centre of mass and a consequent shifting of the iceberg into its new position of equilibrium. Undermining and fracture also result; so that at length the mass of ice, however square-shaped or symmetrical it may have been originally, assumes a form irregular and fantastic in the extreme. The densities of ice and sea-water are nearly ∙92 and 1Ό3 respectively, so that only τ 1 π 1 κ or nearly ⅜th of the iceberg is above water and visible. An iceberg observed by Sir John Ross and Lieutenant Parry was 2j miles long, 2⅜ miles broad, and 153 feet high. Assuming the form to have been approximately a cone erected upon an elliptic base, the mass above water would be roughly 150 million tons—giving a total mass of nearly 15 hundred million tons. This iceberg, however, was by no means of extraordinary dimensions. In the southern seas, great fleets of icebergs have been observed as far north as the latitude of Cape Horn; and some of these ice masses have towered to a height of 700 or 800 feet. The limiting latitude to which icebergs drift is lower in the southern than in the northern hemisphere, probably because of the comparative scarcity of land in the south polar regions. Thus, icebergs have been observed off the Cape of Good Hope in 34° 8. lat., while none has been noticed in the northern hemisphere lower than the 36th parallel. Generally speaking, the limiting latitudes may be fixed at 40° N. lat. and 35° S. lat. In the North Atlantic the distribution of icebergs is very remarkable, and indicates, in its peculiar way, the general set of ocean currents. Icebergs, of course, can only drift along with some polar current,—such, for example, as the Labrador current, which flows in a generally southerly direction round the coasts of Newfoundland and Nova Scotia. To the east of this track, in which icebergs abound during the early summer months, lies the region which is warmed by the waters of the Gulf Stream as it flows to the Scandinavian coast, and here floating ice is rarely seen. The same considerations regarding prevailing currents determine the distribution and limit of icebergs in the southern oceans, the great antarctic current that cools the coasts of Chili and Peru bearing upon [9:12:615] its broad expanse the fragments of the shining ice-cliffs of South Victoria. The climatic effect of an iceberg is sometimes very marked; and not unfrequently the lowering of the temperature indicates to the mariner the presence of floating ice even before it is near enough to be visible. Geologically considered, icebergs, like glaciers, are great transporting agents, bearing away to the deep sea rocks, boulders, and stones, which are strewn along the ocean bed i?,s the ice gradually melts. By this cause, rather than by the glacier in its integrity, some erratic blocks may doubtless have been transported at a time when the land was under water and exposed to ice-drift.
