IMMACULATE CONCEPTION. The dogma of the immaculate conception of the Virgin Mary, as held by the Church of Rome, is to the effect that “the most blessed Virgin was, in view of the merits of Jesus Christ the Saviour of the human race, by the singular grace and favour of Almighty God, from the first moment of her conception in the womb of her mother, preserved free from all taint of original sin.” The “pious opinion” that the mother of Christ had during her life been preserved from sin in a way in which no other human being ever had been may be traced back to a comparatively early period: indeed, without it her cultus (for some account of the growth of which see Mary) as it hud developed itself long before the 9th century, would have been impossible. The actual history of an explicit doctrine of her immaculate conception, however, so far as has hitherto been discovered, may be said to begin, in the year 1140,^[1. The allegation that it was taught by Anselm of Canterbury ia based partly upon a spurious tract attributed to him and partly on unauthentic legend. His actual opinion is explicitly enough stated in the treatise Cur Deus Homo, c. 18:—“Virgo tamen ipsa, unde assumptus est, est in iniquitatibus concepta, et in peccatis concepit eam mater ejus.” ] with the letter of remonstrance which Bernard of Clairvaux wrote to the canons of the cathedral at Lyons (Ep. 174), who, without consulting the Roman see, had recently introduced into their church a festival in celebration of that doctrine. Bernard argued vigorously against this on the ground of its novelty, its unscripturalness (Ps. li. 5), and its absurdity :—“On the same principle,” said he, “you would be obliged to hold that the conception of her ancestors, in an ascending line, was also a holy one, since otherwise she could not have descended from them worthily, and there would then be festivals without number.” How the recipients, who, it is stated, claimed to have learned their peculiar rite from a document communicated by the Virgin herself, were affected by this letter, is not recorded. Among controversial treatises which appeared shortly afterwards are mentioned those of Potho of Prüm and the Abbot de la Celle against the doctrine, and that of the English monk Nicolas in its favour. In the 13th century all the leading theologians, such as Alexander Halensis (p. iii., qu. 10, membr. 2), Albertus Magnus (Ccmm. in Sent., iii. 3), Bonaventura (Comm. in Sent., iii. 3. 1, 2), and Thomas Aquinas (Summa, p. iii., qu. 27, art. 1-3), took the view of St Bernard, their contribution to the theology of the subject consisting in an accurate definition of the moment at which the Virgin’s sanctification in the womb must be held to have taken place. During the same century the feast of the Conception became very popular, and in 1263 it was accepted by a general chapter of the Franciscans at Pisa, without reference, however, to the question of immaculacy. Of great importance to the subsequent history of the dogmu was the appearance in the theological world, towards the beginning of the 14th century, of Duns Scotus, the “subtle doctor” of the Franciscans, who, as in so many other points, so also in this, came into conflict with the still more illustrious “Doctor Angelicus,” the Dominican Aquinas. In one part of his Commentary on the Sentences of Peter of Lombardy (lib. iii., dist. 3, qu. 1, sec. 9) he declares for the thinkableness and even probability of Mary’s having been preserved intact from original sin; in a later passage (dist. 18, qu. 1, sec. 13) the doctrine is categorically stated. It was upon this disputed point that the long and bitter controversy between the two great mendicant orders chiefly turned. In 1389, the Spanish Dominican Joannes de Montesono having maintained in a disputation at Paris that the view of the Scotists was unscriptural and heretical, the university, without committing itself on the main point, condemned his violent theses, and this condemnation was concurred in by the Avignon pope, Clement VII. The members of the entire [9:12:716] Dominican order, for their refusal to acquiesce, were for several years excluded from the privileges of the university. In the beginning of the 15 th century the famous chancellor, John Gerson, accepted the new dogma, and applied in its favour the well-known doctrine of development. At the council of Basel (in the 36th session, held September 17, 1439) it was defined and declared that the doctrine was consistent with faith, reason, and Scripture, and therefore to be approved and embraced; the contrary doctrine was not condemned, but it was forbidden to preach or to teach it. The university of Paris now made subscription to the doctrine of the Immaculate Conception a condition for its degrees, and various other universities entered into a solemn compact to use every exertion for its spread, but the controversy was far from having been brought to a close even by the action of Pope Sixtus IV., who in 1483 published a bull threatening with excommunication any one who should accuse of heresy either the advocates or the impugners of the doctrine, the point having not yet been decided by the apostolical see. In its fifth session (1546) the council of Trent, after formulating its decree on the subject of original sin, sought to effect a compromise between Dominicans and Franciscans by appending a declaration that it did not intend that this doctrine should be applied to the blessed and immaculate Virgin Mary, but that the constitutions of Sixtus IV. were still to be observed. In the beginning of the 17th century the field of battle was transferred to Spain, where, under the predominant influence of the Franciscans and Jesuits, medals were struck, pictures painted, statues erected, and persecutions set on foot in honour of the Virgin “sin pe-cado concebida”; and embassies were sent to Rome, both by Philip III. and by Philip IV., to obtain more explicit recognition of the popular doctrine. The popes continued for a long time, however, to maintain their attitude of reserve. Paul V. (1617) forbade all public dispute on the subject, and Gregory XV. (1622) extended the prohibition even to private discussions, except in the case of Dominicans “inter sef But gradually the papal sympathies became in >re pronounced under Jesuit influences; Clement IX. gave the feast of the Conception an octave; Clement XI., in 1708, made it a festival “de praecepto” for all Christendom; while Benedict XIV. endeavoured to reconcile St Bernard with the more modern tendencies of Roman Catholic theology, by insisting upon subtle distinctions between the “conceptio activa” and the “conceptio passiva” of Mary. In the pontificate of Gregory XVI. several prelates received papal permission to describe her conception as immaculate; and in 1849 Pius IX. was induced to address to his bishops from Gaeta an encyclical, inviting them to state how far the dogmatic definition of the dogma would meet their wishes and the wishes of those under their charge. A large majority declared themselves strongly in favour of the proposal, and the ultimate result was that in December 8, 1854, the pope, in presence of a numerous concourse of cardinals, patriarchs, archbishops, and bishops assembled in St Peter’s, Rome, solemnly promulgated the bull “Ineffabilis Deus,” by which the doctrine of the Immaculate Conception finally became for the Roman communion an article of faith, the denial of which is accounted to be heresy.^[2. The words are “Auctoritate Domini Nostri Jesu Christi, beatorum Apostolorum Petri et Pauli, ac Nostra, declaramus, pronuntiamus et definimus, doctrinam, quae tenet Beatissimam Virginem Mariam in primo instanti suae Conceptionis fuisse singulari Omnipotentis Dei gratia et privilegio, intuitu meritorum Christi Jesu, Salvatoris humani generis, ab omni originalis culpae labe praeservatam immunem, esse a Deo revelatam, atque idcirco ab omnibus fidelibus firmiter constanterque credendam. ]

The feast of the Immaculate Conception is observed in the Roman Church on December 8. In the Greek Church there is a festival in honour of the conception of St Anne

(the mother of Mary), for which December 9 was fixed by a constitution of the emperor Emanuel Comnenus in the 12 th century. Her deliverance from the reproach of sterility is what is celebrated; there is no reference to anything analogous to the Roman doctrine. It may be remarked that strong expressions as to the absolute purity of Mary are found in the Koran (iii. 37), and still more in later Mahometan writings; but the Christian doctrine of sin is so utterly foreign to Islam that no precise theological construction of these expressions is possible.
