    2. Filename Convention
        Filenames are designed so that (1) files are alphabetically ordered in their original
        sequence, and (2) the source can be easily located in the print edition. Names contain 
        information specifying edition, volume, page number, and sequence of items on the page 
        for each entry in the encyclopedia. Example: “kp-eb0901-009905-1114-v1.txt” 
            o	kp 	        = Knowledge Project
            o	-eb0901 	= Encyclopedia Britannica, 9th ed., print vol. 1
            o	-009905 	= print page 0099, 5th entry beginning on the page
            o	-1114 		= last 4 digits of the source image filename (insures URI uniqueness)
            o	.txt 		= plain text (or .xml for TEI)

METHODOLOGICAL INFORMATION

    1. This data set was generated using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) on page image files 
    of the encyclopedia. Further information about the sources and methods of OCR is online at 
    https://tu-plogan.github.io/source/c_ocr.html.

    2. The raw data was processed using Python and XSLT to produce individual TEI files for each
    entry in the encyclopedia. An automated system of OCR error-correction was done with Python 
    and PHP. Further information is online at 
    https://tu-plogan.github.io/source/c_processing_entry_files.html.
    
    3. Each TEI entry file has subject keywords for the entry in the <teiHeader>. Keywords 
    were generated using the RAKE algorithm with the HIVE2 vocabulary-server maintained by the 
    Metadata Research Center at Drexel University. Further information is online at 
    https://tu-plogan.github.io/source/c_master_files.html.
