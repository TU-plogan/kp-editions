    2. Filename Convention
        Filenames are designed so that (1) files are alphabetically ordered in their original
        sequence, and (2) the source can be easily located in the print edition. Names contain information specifying edition, volume, page number, and sequence of items on the page for each entry in the encyclopedia. Example: “kp-eb0702-010502-1174-v3.txt” 
            o	kp 		    = Knowledge Project
            o	-eb0702 	= Encyclopedia Britannica, 7th ed., print vol. 2
            o	-010502 	= print page 0105, 2nd entry beginning on the page
            o	-1174 		= last 4 digits of the source image filename (insures URI uniqueness)
            o	-v3 		= version 3
            o	.txt 		= plain text (or .xml for TEI)

METHODOLOGICAL INFORMATION

    1. This data set was generated using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) on page image files of
    the encyclopedia. Further information about the sources and methods of OCR is online at 
    https://tu-plogan.github.io/source/c_ocr.html.

    2. The raw data was processed using Python and XSLT to produce individual TEI files for each
    entry in the encyclopedia. An automated system of OCR error-correction was done with Python and
    PHP. Further information is online at https://tu-plogan.github.io/source/c_processing_entry_files.html.
    
    3. Each TEI entry file has subject keywords in the <teiHeader>. Keywords were generated using
    the RAKE algorithm with the HIVE2 vocabulary-server maintained by the Metadata Research Center
    at Drexel University. Further information is online at 
    https://tu-plogan.github.io/source/c_master_files.html.
