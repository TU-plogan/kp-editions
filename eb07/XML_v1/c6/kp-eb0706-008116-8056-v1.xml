                <p><label type="entry">CANNING, <hi rend="smallcaps">George</hi></label>, a
                    celebrated statesman and orator, was born in London on the 11th of April 1770.
                    His father by an imprudent marriage had drawn down upon himself the displeasure
                    of his parents, and was by them eut off with the seanty pittance of L.150 per
                    annum. The youth, thus discarded by his family, who possessed considerable
                    property in Ireland, left that country, and repaired with his wife to London.
                    His efforts to extend the means of their subsistence were, however, unavailing;
                    and exactly twelve months after the birth of his son he died, the victim, it is
                    said, of a broken heart. The mother of Canning, thus left comparatively
                    destitute, attempted the stage, but without success. Of her after history little
                    is known, except that she was twice married, and to the day of lier death
                    experienced the tender regards of her illustrious son, whose sueeess she lived
                    long enough to witness.</p>
                <p>The education of Canning, however, was not neglected. By the liberality of an
                    uncle he was plaeed at Eton, where he greatly distinguished himself, not only in
                    his seholastie exercises, but also as a literary aspirant. At the age of sixteen
                    we find him editor of a periodical miscellany entitled the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Microcosm,</hi> which was got up amongst his school associates. To this work he
                    contributed a variety of papers, distinguished for their elegance and taste, and
                    also for a playful humour, which afterwards beeame so formidable a weapon in his
                    hands. To this period likewise is assigned the composition of a poem entitled
                    <hi rend="italic">The Slavery of Greece,</hi> whieh displays a glowing fancy,
                    and a rare maturity of thought, whilst it breathes the warmest sentiments of
                    freedom. This was a happy presage. For he <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193348069?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0706-8069-0082"/> afterwards
                    rose to a situation which enabled him to mititigate the destiny he thus early
                    and feelingly deplored; and it is pleasing to add, that the fervour of the
                    youthful bard was never altogether quenched in the after calculations of the
                    statesman. In the year 1787 he left Eton for Christ Church, Oxford, where he
                    rapidly rose to distinction. He gained several prizes for his Latin essays, and
                    attracted "considerable notice by his orations. The general impression of his
                    compeers appears to have been, that he was destined to excel, and would rise to
                    the head of whatever profession he chose to adopt. Amongst his fellow collegians
                    was the Honourable Charles Jenkinson, with whom he contracted an intimacy which
                    was afterwards of great advantage to him. It became ncecessary for him, however,
                    to think of a profession, and he fixed upon the law as that most likely to
                    afford scope for his talents. He accordingly quitted Oxford for Lincoln’s Inn,
                    whither his fame had preceded him. It may be đoubted whether he was as laborious
                    a student of law as he had been of learning. His disposition was highly
                    soeíable, and his wit was the theme of general admiration. Hence his society
                    became courted by a numerous and rapidly extending circle of friends; and he
                    also began to attend debating clubs, where he frequently spoke. These trials of
                    skill gave him confidence as a public speaker, and tact and acuteness as a
                    debater, 'whilst at the same time they exercised his powers of elocution; thus
                    preparing him for contending with more powerful and expert antagonists in a more
                    exalted arena. At this period his principles were liberal. He had long been in
                    familiar intercourse with Sheridan, by whom he was introduced to Fox,-Burke,
                    Grey, and the other leading Whigs of the time, who looked upon him as the future
                    champion of their cause, and advised him to turn his thoughts from the bar to
                    the Senate; and this he accordingly determined upon. Buta change soon came over
                    the spirit of his politics. What motives induced him to’ abandon tlíe creed in
                    which he had hitherto believed, it is difficult to conjecture. Probably he felt
                    that even genius like his would not rise to the full growth of its ambition On
                    the opposition benches, or that the interests of his Country would be
                    better-served if he could infuse into the measures of his new associates a
                    portion of that liberality which distinguished those of his old. But whatever
                    may have determined the choice of the young politician, certain it is, that
                    after a friendly and candid explanation to Sheridan, he entered into terms with
                    Pitt, and in 1793 took his Seat in parliament under the auspices of that
                    minister. But it was not until 1794 that he ventured to address the house. The
                    occasion was by no means auspicious; it was iπ support of a large subsidy th the
                    king of Sardinia for prosecuting the war. He was brought into immediate
                    collision with Fox, whom he ventured to treat with a considerable degree of
                    levity; and it did not reflect muċh credit on Pitt, that he thus subjected his
                    great and generous rival to the flippant attack of a man so young and so
                    arrogant as Canning. Apart from this circumstance, the speech displayed
                    considerable tact and dexterity in the management of an argument. From this
                    period his support of the premier was close and undeviating, and he gradually
                    rose to distinction amongst the party to which he had allied himsfelf. In 1796
                    he was appointed one of the under secretaries Of State, and for the first two
                    years during which he held the situation he principally confined himself to the
                    laboribus duties connected with it. In 1798 he recorded his sentiments on the
                    sùbjeet of the slave-trade, being favourable to abblition; and in the same year
                    he electrified the house on a motion of Mr Tierney’s respecting a peace with the
                    French republie. It was a speeeh of masterly skill and eloquence, and fully
                    justified the partiality of his master. The same year his consequence was
                    materially increased by his union with Miss Joan Scott, one of the daughters and
                    co-heiresses of General Scott. Miss Scott’s two sisters were married to
                    noblemen; and Canning’s parliamentary interests were thus not only powerfully
                    strengthened, but he was furnished with a respeetable independence.</p>
                <p>In 1800 we find him discussing in parliament the overtures of peace made by the
                    consular government of France, the habeas corpus suspension bill, subsidies to
                    the Emperor of Germany, ånd the state of the nation,—subjects on all of which
                    he’Supported the minister, and in regard to some’of-which he displayed more
                    devotedness as a ρar-tizán than wisdom as a statesman. Out of doors also he
                    employed the formidable weapon of the press in the same warfare.- In conjunction
                    with his friends Mr Frere and Mr Ellis, he brought out the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Antijacobin Examiner,</hi> a weekly paper, alike distinguished for its wit and
                    talent and for its satire and ribaldry. The poetical compositions of Canning
                    formed the attic salt of this print; and, keeping out of view their malignant
                    invective and personality, they are unquestionably full of wit.</p>
                <p>The resignation of Pitt in 1801 deprived Canning of his situation; and the
                    ministry whieh succeeded he took every opportunity of strenuously opposing. The
                    return of the former to power in 1804 again restored him to office as treasurer
                    of the navy. From this period till the death of Pitt nothing remarkable occurred
                    to eall forth his energies, exeept the impeachment of Lord Melville, whose
                    cause* he warmly espoused. By the demise in 1806 of his illustrious preeeptor in
                    po!itics, Canning was again removed from offîee; and during the reign of the
                    ministry which succeeded, he conducted himself in the same manner as he had done
                    upon a like occasion before; strenuously opposing· all measures except those
                    which he considered as sanctified by the authority of Pitt. Nothing cdn more
                    forcibly exhibit the influence of party spirit over his mind, than the manner in
                    which he allowed the question of the abolition of the slave-trade to be carried
                    in parliament. Under other administrations it had received his powerful
                    advocacy, and all the resources of his genius were arrayed on the side of
                    humanity; but now he scarcely lifted his voice upon the occasion. What he did
                    say was cold and petulant. On a great moral question touching the rights of
                    human nature he could not subdue expressions of hostility to the existing
                    ministry. The latter having abandoned office, the Tory party eame again into
                    power, and Canning received the seals of the foreign department.</p>
                <p>The office of a minister of foreign affairs at the commencement of the Portland
                    administration was any thing but an enviable post. With the exception of the
                    short interval of the peace of Amiens, England had been engaged in a war of
                    fifteen years’ duration. Most of the continental powers, formerly her allies,
                    were now either leagued against her, or condemned to an inglorious neutrality.
                    The nation, whieh previously divided its belief between the two great leaders
                    now no more, looked in vain for one sufficiently prominent to command its
                    confidence. The mantle of cither prophet appeared to have aseended along with
                    him; for as yet Canning had not gathered all his fame, and was looked upon by
                    the eountŕy as a light and harassing skirmisher rather than a heavy man-at-arms.
                    The administration»just dissolved presented a formidable opposition; and a
                    number of the members of it, indeed, Canning had made personal enemies of by his
                    caustic raillery in parliament, and his reckless satire out of doors. In
                    circumstances of such difficulty the new ministry found themselves placed. It
                    was on Mr Ponsonby’s motion relative to the expedition to Copenhagen that their
                    strength was first properly put to trial. This attack could not be <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193348082?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0706-8082-0083"/>
                    justified on any principle of justice. Canning, however, fearlessly threw
                    himself into the arena, and delivered a defence of the conduct of ministers, at
                    least remarkable for its ability and eloquence. Both friends and opponents
                    regarded him with admiration. The former saw the value of the acquisition they
                    had made, and the latter the formidable talent with which they had to contend.
                    From this period Canning continued to rise in importance and increase in fame.
                    He was the most able and strenuous supporter of the administration to which he
                    belonged. In 1809 a political misunderstanding with Lord Castlereagh led to a
                    duel, in which Canning was wounded. Both secretaries resigned, and the
                    consequence was a dissolution of the ministry.</p>
                <p>During the two years which followed this event, Canning seldom appeared in the
                    stormy arena of debate. Two speeches, however, on the resumption of cash
                    payments by the bank of England, belong to this period, but are numbered amongst
                    his least successful exertions. In the beginning of 1812 he advocated the claims
                    of the Catholics to civil power, which he invariably supported, not as an
                    abstract question of right, but as a matter of expediency. On the assassination
                    of Mr Percival, overtures were made to him to accept a place in the cabinet; but
                    his favourite measure of Catholic emancipation forming no part of their
                    arrangements, he declined taking office. In this year he was chosen as
                    representative for Liverpool, which also returned him to other three successive
                    parliaments. In 1814 he accepted the situation of ambassador to Lisbon, and
                    continued there till 1816, when he returned, and soon afterwards joined the
                    ministry as president of the board of control. During the last two years great
                    events had taken place, in bringing about which Canning had no inconsiderable
                    share. “if there was any part of his political life,” he declared on one
                    occasion, “in which he gloried, fit was, that in the face of every difficulty,
                    discouragement, and prophecy of failure, his had been tlιe hand which had
                    committed England in an alliance with Spain.” Never,” said he on another
                    occasion, “ought we to relinquish our hold of the Peninsula. The ruler of France
                    has one grand object to which he stands pledged—the establishment of his
                    dominion there. If he fail in this, his defeat will be most signal.” The result
                    realized his prediction. By British policy and valour, which he animated and
                    encouraged, the tide of military despotism which had overflowed the Continent
                    was repelled beyond the Pyrenees, and the ancient landmarks of nations
                    re-appeared above the subsiding wave.</p>
                <p>As a member of the cabinet from 1816 till 1820, Canning was a strenuous supporter
                    of its measures. The celebrated six acts called forth all the resources of his
                    eloquence to prove their necessity, and to lessen the abhorrence with which a
                    large proportion of the community contemplated them. The manner in which he
                    treated the case of one Ogden, who was incarcerated for sedition under the
                    suspension of the habeas corpus act, was aggravated by opponents into a serious
                    crime, and in any view evinced a reckless and unfeeling levity, which it is easy
                    to palliate but impossible to justify.</p>
                <p>On the demise of George III. in 1820, parliament was dissolved, and Canning, at
                    the next election, was for the fourth time returned for Liverpool. On this
                    occasion he put forth all his strength in vindication of the proceedings of
                    ministers. During his speech he also took an opportunity of expressing his
                    unmeasured hostility to all parliamentary reform, which he afterwards reiterated
                    in parliament in 1822, in one of his most finished orations. On the return of
                    Queen Caroline to share the throne of her husband, Canning, who had formerly
                    been on terms of great intimacy with her, felt constrained to absent himself
                    from England during the progress of the proceedings which were instituted
                    against her. On his return from the Continent he resigned the presidency of the
                    board of control, and on his retirement, received the most flattering testimony
                    from the Court of Directors of the East India Company, of the value which they
                    attached to his services. The golden opinions which the members of that
                    influential body entertained of his character, and the universal conviction that
                    no man was, better qualified or entitled to occupy the highest official
                    situation which théy had it in their power to bestow, induced them ultimately to
                    confer upon him the appointment of governor-general of India. But just as he was
                    preparing to quit England, the Marquis of Londonderry died; and a vacancy having
                    thus been created in the cabinet, Canning was invited by his Sovereign to resume
                    the situation of secretary for foreign affairs. He accepted the offer, and
                    though second in office, in public opinion and in real efficiency he was
                    considered as the first. This took place in 1822.</p>
                <p>During the remainder of Canning’s life his history becomes so closely interwoven
                    with that of his country, that a minute detail is unnecessary. He infused into
                    the counsels of the cabinet a degree of liberality which, for a long period, had
                    not characterized them. The spell of the holy alliance it was his studious
                    endeavour to break; and without altogether alienating the continental powers
                    from Britain, he aimed at placing her in a situation where, untrammelled, she
                    might exercise her own free will. It was his desire that his country should
                    occupy a neutral station, and assume the character of mediator, not only between
                    conflicting kingdoms, but between the hostile factions of individual nations. He
                    strongly countenanced, both in theory and practice, that amelioration in regard
                    to commerce, navigation, and manufactures, which the force of circumstances and
                    the progress of information had rendered imperative. In June 1824 the cabinet
                    determined on recognizing the independence of Mexico, Colombia, and Buenos
                    Ayres. This measure was principally brought about by the exertions of Canning,
                    and in one of his speeches he claims the merit of it. In answer to the argument
                    that ministers had sanctioned the attack on Portugal, by having permitted the
                    occupation of Spain by France, he said, “Was it, necessary that we should
                    blockade Cadiz? No. I looked another way. 1 resolved that if France had Spain,
                    it should not be Spain with the Indies. I called the new world into existence to
                    redress the balance of the old.” In the autumn of 1826 he went to Paris, and was
                    received with great distinction. The treaty with France and Russia respecting
                    Greece, and the events at Navarino which followed closely after it, throw light
                    upon the object and intent of his visit. His highest powers were also called
                    forth on the occasion of the aggression of Spain upon Portugal. He warmly
                    maintained the necessity of England’s interference upon the occasion; and the
                    demonstrations which were made produced the desired results. These are the three
                    measures on which the fame of Canning, for liberal policy, principally
                    rests.</p>
                <p>In the beginning of 1827, at the funeral of the Duke of York, he caught a severe
                    cold, from the effects of which he never altogether recovered. Shortly after
                    this, the Earl of Liverpool, then, prime minister, was seized with paralysis;
                    and though he rallied afterwards, he was politically dead from the moment he was
                    struck. Canning was ultimately appointed first lord of the treasury.
                    Considerable opposition followed this appointment, and six members of the
                    former· cabinet resigned. The new premier, however, struggled manfully against
                    this rather unexpected opposition, and with great celerity completed the
                    com-plemεnt<pb break="no" facs="nls:193348095?mode=fullsize"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0706-8095-0084"/> of the cabinet. But the harassing contest which
                    he had to maintain against a virulent opposition visibly affected his health.
                    Towards the latter end of July 1827 he was invited to the seat of the Duke of
                    Devonshire at Chiswick, in hopes that the change of air might renovate his
                    constitution; and he did recover so far as to be able again to transact business
                    in Downing Street; but his malady, which was an inflammation of the kidneys,
                    returned, and he expired on the 8th of August, at the age of fifty-seven. His
                    remains were interred in Westminster Abbey, near to those of his great preceptor
                    Pitt, on the 16th of the' same month. The funeral, though private, was attended
                    by the Duke of Clarence, now William IV., and a number of noble and other
                    friends.</p>
                <p>The death of Canning was a circumstance rarely paralleled in interest amongst
                    civilized nations. In his foreign policy he had identified himself with the
                    march of independence. From Lima to Athens the effects of his friendly
                    interposition had been felt, and a sorrow corresponding to the benefits he -had
                    conferred was expressed when he fell. He was cut oft' in the midst of designs of
                    high enterprise, and before all his plans were completed; and thus lιis system,
                    and much of his fame, was left at the mercy of his successors. The great events
                    which have taken place since his death have also tended in some measure to
                    eclipse his popularity. His accomplishments as an orator were of the highest
                    order. His form was commanding, and his features handsome and impressive. His
                    voice was richly toned and highly musical, and his attitudes were elegant and
                    striking. His delivery was manly, and for the most part he was in complete
                    possession of himself. These qualities and accomplishments set off to double
                    advantage the more exalted gifts of intellect with which he was so richly
                    endowed. His diction was splendid, his reasoning acute and refined. He exercised
                    a sovereign command over language, and it flowed from him with classic elegance
                    and ease. His style, strictly speaking, was not ornate. Wit was an ingredient
                    with which he frequently seasoned his oratory, thereby imparting to it a high
                    relish. The vein was peculiarly his own; it was lively and playful, and
                    calculated more to ridicule than to lacerate. His poetical powers may be ranked
                    among his elegant accomplishments; and, for the most part, the productions which
                    resulted from them are the least worthy of his fame—not that they want the
                    requisite talent, but that they are in general disfigured by scurrility and
                    invective. “He was,” says Sir James Mackintosh, “a man of fine and brilliant
                    genius, of warm affections, of high and generous spirit; a statesman who at home
                    converted most of his opponents into warm supporters, who abroad was the sole
                    hope and trust of all who sought an orderly and legal liberty, and who was cut
                    off in the midst of vigorous and splendid measures, which, if executed by
                    himself, or with his own spirit, promised to place his name in the first class
                    of rulers, among the founders of lasting peace, and the guardians of human
                    improvement.”</p>
