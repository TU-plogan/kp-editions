                <p><label type="entry">HABEAS <hi rend="smallcaps">Corpus</hi></label>, the most
                    celebrated writ in the English law. Of this there are various kinds made use of
                    by the courts at Westminster, for removing prisoners from one court into another
                    for the more easy administration of justice. The <hi rend="italic">habeas corpus
                    ad respondendum</hi> is issued when a man has a cause of action against one who
                    is confined by the process of some inferior court, in order to remove the
                    prisoner, and charge him with this new action in the court above. The <hi
                    rend="italic">habeas corpus ad satisfaciendum</hi> issues when a prisoner has
                    had judgment against him in an action, and the plaintiff is desirous to bring
                    him up to some superior court to charge him with the process of execution. The
                    similar writs <hi rend="italic">ad prosequendum, testificandum,
                    deliberandum,</hi> issue when it is necessary to remove a prisoner, in order to
                    prosecute or bear testimony in any court, or. to be tried in the proper
                    jurisdiction in which the fact was committed. Lastly, the common writ <hi
                    rend="italic">ad faciendum</hi><hi rend="italic">et</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >recipiendum,</hi> issues out of any of the courts of Westminster Hall, when a
                    person is sued in some inferior jurisdiction, and is desirous to remove the
                    action into the superior court; commanding the inferior judges to produce the
                    body of the defendant, together with the day and cause of his caption and
                    detainer (whence the writ is frequently denominated an <hi rend="italic">habeas
                    corpus cum causa),</hi> to <hi rend="italic">do and receive</hi> whatsoever the
                    king’s court shall consider in that behalf. But the great and efficacious writ,
                    in all manner of illegal confinement, is that of <hi rend="italic">habeas corpus
                    ad subjiciendum,</hi> directed to the person detaining another, and commanding
                    him to produce the body of the prisoner, with a specification of tlιe day and
                    cause of his caption and detention, <hi rend="italic">ad faciendum,
                    subjiciendum,</hi><hi rend="italic">et</hi><hi rend="italic">recipiendum,</hi>
                    to do, submit to, and receive whatsoever the judge or court awarding such writ
                    shall consider in that behalf. This is a high prerogative writ, and therefore by
                    the common law issues out of the Court of King’s Bench, not only in term-time,
                    but also during the vacation, by a fiat from the chief-justice, or any other of
                    the judges, and runs into all parts of the king’s dominions, except Scotland;
                    for the king is at all times entitled to have an account why the liberty of any
                    of his subjects is restrained, wherever that restraint may be inflicted. If it
                    issues in vacation, it is usually returnable before the judge himself who
                    awarded it, and he proceeds by himself <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193640395?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0711-0395-0100"/> thereon;
                    unless the term should intervene, and then it may be returned in court. Indeed,
                    if the party were privileged in the Courts of Common Pleas and Exchequer, as
                    being an officer or suitor of the court, an <hi rend="italic">habeas corpus ad
                    subjiciendum</hi> might also have been awarded from thence; and if the cause of
                    imprisonment were palpably illegal, they might have discharged him. But if he
                    were committed for any criminal matter, they could only have remanded him, or
                    taken bail for his appearance in the Court of King’s Bench, which occasioned the
                    Common Pleas to discountenance such applications. It has also been said, and by
                    very respectable authorities, that the like <hi rend="italic">habeas corpus</hi>
                    may issue out of the Court of Chancery in vacation; but upon the famous
                    application to Lord Nottingham by Jenks, notwithstanding the most diligent
                    searches, no precedent could be found where the chancellor had issued such a
                    writ in vacation, and therefore his lordship refused it.</p>
                <p>In the Court of King’s Bench it was, and still is, necessary to apply for it by
                    motion to the court, as in the case of all other prerogative writs, such as <hi
                    rend="italic">certiorari,</hi> prohibition, <hi rend="italic">mandamus,</hi> and
                    the like, which do not issue as of mere course, without showing some probable
                    cause why the extraordinary power of the crown is called in to the party’s
                    assistance. For, as it was argued by Lord Chief-Justice Vaughan, <hi
                    rend="superscript"> α</hi> it is granted on motion, because it cannot be had of
                    course, and there is therefore no <hi rend="italic">necessity</hi> to grant it;
                    for the court ought to be satisfied that the party has a probable cause to be
                    delivered.” And this seems the more reasonable, because, when once granted, the
                    person to whom it is directed can return no satisfactory excuse for not bringing
                    up the body of the prisoner. So that, if it issued of mere course, without
                    showing to the court or judge some reasonable ground for awarding it, a traitor
                    or felon under sentence of death, a soldier or mariner in the king’s service, a
                    wife, a child, a relation, or a domestic, confined for insanity or other
                    prudential reasons, might obtain a temporary enlargement by suing out an <hi
                    rend="italic">habeas corpus,</hi> though sure to be remanded as soon as brought
                    up to the court. And therefore Sir Edward Coke, when chief-justice, did not
                    scruple (in 13 Jàc. I.) to deny a <hi rend="italic">habeas corpus</hi> to one
                    confined by the Court of Admiralty for piracy, there appearing, upon his own
                    showing, sufficient grounds to confine him. On the other hand, if a probable
                    ground be shown that the party is imprisoned without just cause, and therefore
                    has a right to be delivered, the writ of <hi rend="italic">habeas corpus</hi> is
                    then a writ of right, which “may not be denied, but ought to be granted to every
                    man that is committed, or detained in prison, or otherwise restrained, though it
                    be by the command of the king, the privy council, or any other.”</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Habeas Corpus Act</hi> is the famous act of 31 Car. II. c.
                    2, which is frequently considered as another <hi rend="italic">magna</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">charta</hi> of the kingdom. It enacts, 1. That the writ of <hi
                    rend="italic">habeas corpus</hi> shall be returned, and the prisoner brought up,
                    within a limited time according to the distance, not exceeding in any case
                    twenty days. 2. That such writs shall be indorsed, as granted in pursuance of
                    this act, and signed by the person awarding them. 3. That on complaint and
                    request in writing by or on behalf of any person committed and charged with any
                    crime, unless committed for treason or felony expressed in the warrant, or for
                    suspicion of the same, or as accessary thereto before the fact, or convicted or
                    charged in execution by legal process, the Lord Chancellor, or any of the twelve
                    judges in vacation, upon viewing a copy of the warrant, or affidavit that a copy
                    is denied, shall, unless the party has neglected for two terms to apply to any
                    court for his enlargement, award a <hi rend="italic">habeas corpus</hi> for such
                    prisoner, returnable immediately before himself or any other of the judges; and
                    upon the return made shall discharge the party, if bailable, upon giving
                    security to appear and answer to the accusation in the proper court of
                    judicature. 4. That officers and keepers neglecting to make due returns, or not
                    delivering to the prisoner or his agent, within six hours after demand, a copy
                    of the warrant of commitment, or shifting the custody of a prisoner from one to
                    another without sufficient reason or authority (specified in the act), shall for
                    the first offence forfeit L.100, and for the second offence L.200, to the party
                    grieved, and be disabled to hold his office. 5. That no person, once delivered
                    by <hi rend="italic">habeas corpus,</hi> shall be recommitted for the same
                    offence, under a penalty of L.500. 6. That every person committed for treason or
                    felony shall, if he requires it the first week of the next term, or the first
                    day of the next session of <hi rend="italic">oyer</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >terminer,</hi> be indicted in that term or session, or else admitted to bail,
                    unless the king’s witnesses cannot be produced at that time; and if acquitted,
                    or if not indicted and tried in the second term or session, he shall be
                    discharged from his imprisonment for such imputed offence; but that no person,
                    after the assizes shall be opened for the county in which he is detained, shall
                    be removed by <hi rend="italic">habeas corpus,</hi> until after the assizes are
                    ended, but shall be left to the justice of the judges of assize. 7. That any
                    such prisoner may, however, move for and obtain bis <hi rend="italic">habeas
                    corpus,</hi> as well out of the Chancery or Exchequer as out of the King’s Bench
                    or Common Pleas; and the Lord Chancellor or judges denying the same, on sight of
                    the warrant, shall, on oath that the same is refused, forfeit severally to the
                    party grieved the sum of L.500. 8. That the writ of <hi rend="italic">habeas
                    corpus</hi> shall run into the counties palatine, cinque ports, and other
                    privileged places, and the islands of Jersey and Guernsey. 9. That no inhabitant
                    of England, except persons contracting, or convicts praying to be transported,
                    or having committed some capital offence in the place to which they are sent,
                    shall be sent prisoners to Scotland, Ireland, Jersey, Guernsey, or any places
                    beyond the seas, within or without the king’s dominions, on pain that the party
                    committing, his advisers, aiders, and assistants, shall forfeit to the party
                    grieved a sum not less than L.500, to be recovered with treble costs, shall be
                    disabled from holding any office of trust or profit, shall incur the penalties
                    of <hi rend="italic">proemunire,</hi> and shall be incapable of the king’s
                    pardon.</p>
                <p>This is the substance of that great and important statute, which, however,
                    extends only to the case of commitments for such criminal charges as can produce
                    no inconvenience to public justice by a temporary enlargement of the prisoner;
                    all other cases of unjust imprisonment being left to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >habeas corpus</hi> at common law. But even upon writs at the common law it is
                    expected by the court, agreeably to ancient precedents and the spirit of the act
                    of parliament, that this writ should be immediately obeyed, without waiting for
                    any <hi rend="italic">alias</hi> or <hi rend="italic">pluries</hi> writ;
                    otherwise an attachment will issue. By these admirable regulations, judicial as
                    well as parliamentary, the remedy is now complete for removing the injury of
                    unjust and illegal confinement; a remedy the more necessary, because the
                    oppression does not always arise from the ill-nature, but sometimes from the
                    mere inattention, of government. For it frequently happens in foreign countries,
                    and has happened in England during the temporary suspension of the statute, that
                    persons apprehended upon suspicion have suffered a long imprisonment, merely
                    because they were forgotten.</p>
