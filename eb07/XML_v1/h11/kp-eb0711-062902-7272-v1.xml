                <p><label type="entry">HORTENSIUS, <hi rend="smallcaps">Quintus</hi></label>, one of
                    the most celebrated orators that Rome produced, the contemporary and rival of
                    Cicero, was born <hi rend="smallcaps">b. c.</hi> II4, and eight years before
                    Cicero. He was son of L. Hortensius, who had distinguished himself in his
                    praetorship in Rome, and proconsulship in Italy, by a strict adherence to
                    justice and the ancient laws of his country. His mother Sempronia was
                    grand-daughter to Tuditanus. Of the manner in which he spent his earlier years,
                    we have received no information; but we find him at the age of nineteen <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">(b. c.</hi> 95), at once taking a distinguished place amongst
                    the orators of his country. (<hi rend="italic">Cic. Br.</hi> 64.) The first
                    cause which he undertook was that of Africa, in which he was eminently
                    successful; and shortly afterwards he was employed by the king of Bithynia in
                    his defence before the senate. The breaking out of the Social War, <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.</hi> c. 90, so alarmed the Romans for the very existence of
                    their power, that all domestic proceedings were for a time suspended, and the
                    youth enrolled themselves for the defence of their country. Hortensius, like
                    others of his own age, joined the army, and in the second campaign was raised to
                    the rank of tribune. It does not appear, however, that he possessed military
                    talents, as we do not find him taking an active part in any warlike proceedings.
                    His aedileship was distinguished by the magnificence of his exhibition of the
                    public games, and by a gratuitous distribution of corn among the people. It was
                    in 70 <hi rend="smallcaps">b∙ c.</hi> that he was first directly opposed to
                    Cicero in the celebrated trial of Verres, but notwithstanding the utmost efforts
                    of his eloquence, Verres was brought in guilty of the charges which Cicero
                    brought against him. The following year <hi rend="smallcaps">(b. c.</hi> 69) wc
                    find him raised to the consulship, along with Q. Cecilius Metellus; but it was a
                    period during which Rome enjoyed profound peace at Rome, whilst she was
                    triumphing over Mithridates in the east by the arms of Lucullus. The conduct of
                    the war against the Cretans fell by lot to Hortensius, but feeling that the
                    proper arena for the display of his talents was in the peaceful contests of the
                    Forum, he refused to leave Rome, and gave up the commission to his colleague
                    Metellus, who derived the name of Creticus from the subjugation of the island.
                    <hi rend="italic">(Xiρhilin. Epit. Dion.</hi> tom. i. p. 75.) He amassed great
                    riches, and became remarkable for the magnificence of his villas, and his
                    sumptuous mode of living. He opposed with success a sumptuary law proposed by
                    Pompey and Crassus <hi rend="italic">(Dion.)</hi>; and resisted the proposals of
                    Gabinius and Manilius to invest Pompey with powers of so extraordinary a nature,
                    that they seemed calculated to annihilate the independence of Rome. Though the
                    most formidable rival of Cicero in the Forum, he was the intimate and
                    affectionate friend of that orator; and when Clodius threatened Cicero with
                    exile, Hortensius appeared in the assembly of the people in deep mourning, and
                    was attacked by the slaves of that factious tribune. <hi rend="italic">(Cic.
                    Mil.</hi> 14.) In his latter years, he did not exert himself to maintain the
                    rank to which he had attained, and allowed his glory to be eclipsed by the
                    wonderful powers of eloquence displayed by Cicero. A few days before his death,
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">b. c.</hi> 50, he defended the cause or Appius Claudius;
                    and it was in consequence of the exertions which he made in that case that he
                    broke a blood-vessel, which put an end to his life. <hi rend="italic">Cic.

                    celebrated Lutatius Catullus, by whom he had a son, whose conduct gave him great
                    cause of uneasiness, and a daughter, Hortensia, distinguished for her talents,
                    who married Valerius Messala. Hortensius afterwards contracted a second marriage
                    with Marcia, daughter of Philippus, and wife of Cato. This transaction was of a
                    very extraordinary nature, and was little to the honour of any of the parties;
                    but the details may be read in Plutarch <hi rend="italic">(Life of Cato).</hi>
                    As none of his writings have been preserved, we are without the means of forming
                    an opinion of his eloquence, except from the statements of the ancients. It was
                    highly ornamented, flowery, and even more Asiatic in its character than that of
                    Cicero. His style was full of animation, and his composition was extremely
                    polished. Hortensius also cultivated poetry with success. (Ovid. <hi
