                    xml:id="kp-eb0719-0698-0644"/> Galicia, of which it is the capital. It is about
                    six leagues from the sea, on a little river not navigable, called the Sar, which
                    unites with another called the Sancta, and then flows into the Ulla, and joins
                    the river Arosa, which has at its entrance to the ocean some secure harbours for
                    small vessels. This is an archiepiscopal city, and is one of the most richly
                    endowed of all the cathedrals of the kingdom. In former times this church was
                    the resort of pilgrims from every part of Spain, and a great part of the rest of
                    Europe. The votive offerings have therefore been prodigious, and though the
                    veneration for the shrine of St Iago has been on the decline for many years, yet
                    the accumulation of past periods now serves to keep in idleness, if not in
                    profligacy, a great number of ecclesiastics. The city contains a university of
                    considerable celebrity, a very large and well-regulated hospital, and several
                    smaller ones, besides other sumptuous public edifices. It contains about 25,000
                    inhabitants, the greater part of whom depend on the religious houses, especially
                    some thousands of poor, who are not disposed to work, because the donations in
                    food and in money from the different pious establishments are sufficient to keep
                    them alive, and allow them to indulge in their habitual indolence. There are
                    indeed some few manufactories of linens, laces, and tapes; they languish,
                    however, and give employment but to very few. The surrounding country is cold
                    and sterile, and therefore the donations of the pious are expended in obtaining
                    necessaries from the more distant parts of the province.</p>

                    capital of the republic of Chili, in South America, is delightfully situated in
                    an extensive plain on the southern shore of the river Mapocho, on each side of
                    which large mounds of stone have been raised as a security against inundation.
                    On the opposite side of the river lie the suburbs, of Chimba, Cannadilla, and
                    Renca, which are connected with the city by means of a beautiful bridge. The
                    streets are straight, wide, well paved, and cross each other at right angles,
                    which divides the city into quadras or solid squares. Water is conveyed from the
                    river by means of aqueducts, which not only supply the inhabitants, but, running
                    through the streets, keep the town very clean. The houses are flat-roofed, of
                    one story, and, being white-washed, give the town a very gay appearance. They
                    are built in a quadrangular form, and all the rooms may be entered from a square
                    court in the middle, or from doors of communication from one to the other. The
                    entrance from the street is by a broad porch, on either side of which are
                    stables, &amp;c. The great square is 450 feet on each side, in the middle of
                    which there is a fine bronze fountain. The north side is occupied by the
                    directorial palace, a splendid building, having the city prison under the same
                    roof. On the western side are the cathedral, and a mean-looking palace of the
                    bishop. The most remarkable edifices are the cathedral, the church of St
                    Dominick, the great college, which formerly belonged to the Jesuits, and the
                    town-hall. The mint is situated in an obscure part of the town. Being the centre
                    of the commerce of Chili, it abounds with all sorts of provisions, which are
                    very cheap. The inhabitants are gay, hospitable, more inclined to hold
                    intercourse with strangers, and less bigoted, than their countrymen generally
                    are. The population is about 45,000. It is thirty leagues distant from the
                    Pacific Ocean, seven from the Andes, and fifty-five miles eastsouth-east from
                    the port of Valparaiso. Long. 70. 44. W. Lat. 33. 26. S.</p>
