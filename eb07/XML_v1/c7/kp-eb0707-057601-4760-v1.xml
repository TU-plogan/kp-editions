                <p><label type="entry">CYPRUS</label>, an island situated in the Levant, or most
                    easterly part of the Mediterranean Sea, between the thirty-third and
                    thirty-sixth degrees of east longitude, and the thirty-fifth and thirty-sixth of
                    north latitude. In ancient times this island was known by the names of Aca-mis,
                    Cerastis, Aspalia, Amathus, Macaria, Cryptos, Colinia, Sphecia, Paphia,
                    Salaminia, AErosa, and Cyprus. The etymologies of these names are neither very
                    easily found, nor are they of much importance. The name by which it was most
                    generally known is that of <hi rend="italic">Cyprus,</hi> said to be derived
                    from <hi rend="italic">cypros,</hi> the name of a shrub or tree with which the
                    island abounds, and which is supposed to be the cypress.</p>
                <p>Cyprus, according to Eratosthenes, was first discovered by the Phoenicians, two
                    or three generations before the days of Asterius and Minos, kings of Crete; that
                    is, according to Sir Isaac Newton’s computation, about 2006 years before the
                    Christian era. It was at that time so full of wood that it could not be tilled,
                    and the Phoenicians first cut down the wood for smelting the copper, with which
                    the island abounded; and afterwards, when they began to sail without fear on the
                    Mediterranean, that is, after the Trojan war, they built great navies of the
                    wood produced on this island. Josephus, however, informs us that the descendants
                    of Cittim or Chittim, the son of Javan, and grandson of Japhet, were the
                    original inhabitants of Cyprus. According to his account, Chittim, seeing his
                    brother Tarshish established in Cilicia, where he built the city of Tarsus,
                    settled with his followers in the opposite island; and either he or his
                    descendants laid the foundation of the city of Chittim, which, according to
                    Ptolemy, was the most ancient in the island. As Cyprus was too narrow to contain
                    the great numbers who attended him, he left there as many as served to people
                    the country, and with the rest passed over into Macedonia.</p>
                <p>The island of Cyprus was divided among several petty kings till the time of Cyrus
                    the Great, who subdued them all, but left each in possession of his kingdom,
                    obliging them only to pay him an annual tribute, and to send supplies of men,
                    money, and ships when required. The Cyprian princes lived thus subject to the
                    Persians till the reign of Darius Hystaspes, when they attempted to shake off
                    the yoke, but without success, their forces being entirely defeated, and
                    themselves again obliged to submit. They made another more successful attempt
                    about the year before Christ 357; but, notwithstanding, they could never totally
                    free themselves from subjection. It is very probable that they submitted to
                    Alexander the Great, though historians are silent as to such an event. On the
                    death of the Macedonian conqueror, the dominion of Cyprus was disputed by
                    Antigonus, and Ptolemy the son of Lagus. At last Antigonus prevailed, and the
                    whole island submitted to him about 304 years before Christ. He and his son
                    Demetrius kept possession of it for eleven years, when it was recovered by
                    Ptolemy, and quietly possessed by him and his descendants till fifty-eight years
                    before Christ, when it was most unjustly seized by the Romans. <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 1</hi> In the time of Augustus it began to be ranked amongst
                    the proconsular provinces, and to be governed by magistrates sent thither by the
                    senate. In the year 648 it was conquered by the Saracens, but recovered by the
                    Romans in 957. The latter, however, held it but for a very short time, and the
                    barbarians kept possession of it till the time of the crusades. It was then
                    reduced and given by Richard I. of England to the princes of the Lusignan
                    family, who held it till the year 1570, and divided it into twelve provinces, in
                    each of which was a capital city, from which the province was denominated. So
                    considerable was the island at this time, that besides the cities above
                    mentioned, and others of less note, it contained about eight hundred villages.
                    In 1570 it was taken by the Turks, and, though it has ever since continued under
                    their yoke, is still so considerable as to be governed by a beglerbey, and seven
                    sangiacs under him.</p>
