                <p><label type="entry">CORNEILLE, <hi rend="smallcaps">Peter</hi></label>, the
                    celebrated dramatic author, was born at Rouen in the year 1606. He was educated
                    for the bar, which he soon abandoned for pursuits more congenial to his taste. A
                    little amorous adventure first developed his poetical talent, the incidents of
                    which are said to have formed the groundwork of <hi rend="italic">Mélite,</hi>
                    his first comedy, which contains some ingenious comic combinations, and met with
                    extraordinary success. <hi rend="italic">Mélite</hi> was succeeded by several
                    other pieces which seemed to indicate no great power; but the genius of
                    Corneille suddenly took a loftier flight, and produced the tragedy of <hi
                    rend="italic">Mé-dée.</hi> His fame, however, was not completely established
                    till the appearance of the <hi rend="italic">Cid</hi> in 1637, which at once
                    placed him in the first rank of dramatic writers, and drew down the envy and
                    persecution of Richelieu, who was as despotic in the realm of criticism as in
                    that of state policy'·. But the cardinal found taste to be more stubborn than
                    politics; and the man who swayed kingdoms could not crush the fame of a poet.
                    The <hi rend="italic">Cid</hi> was so universally admired, that it became
                    proverbial to say of any thing beautiful, <hi rend="italic">Cela est</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">beazt</hi><hi rend="italic">comme le</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Cid.</hi> This excellent tragedy was followed by the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Horace,</hi><hi rend="italic">Cinna,</hi><hi rend="italic">Pompée,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Polieucte,</hi> the comedy of <hi rend="italic">Le Menteur,</hi>
                    and numerous other dramatic pieces. Corneille, who is said to have been of a
                    devout and melancholy cast, wrote a translation in verse of Kempis’ <hi
                    rend="italic">Imitation of Jesus Christ,</hi> and some smaller poems. He died
                    dean of the French Academy in 1684, aged seventy-eight years.</p>
                <p>From the appearance of the <hi rend="italic">Cid</hi> the literary age of Louis
                    XIV. dates its commencement; and to Corneille is generally assigned the
                    honourable title of the inventor of dramatic art in France, which was afterwards
                    so successfully cultivated by Racine, Voltaire, and Molière. His best works
                    display forcible conception and delineation of character. He raises sentiment
                    into true poetical pathos and sublimity, and exhibits the contending passions,
                    affections, and interests of human nature in all their turbulence and impotency,
                    with great vigour of thought and expression. Many of bis descriptive passages
                    are marked with singular beauty; his dialogues are skilfully conducted, giving
                    rise to bold declamation, replete with rich imagery, and glowing with fervour
                    and energy. The vividness with which some of the replies are made has not
                    perhaps been equalled by any writer, ancient or modern. The celebrated
                    exclamation of the elder Horace, <hi rend="italic">quil</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >mourût,</hi> is a well-known illustration of this peculiar quality in the
                    colloquial power of Corneille. His style is occasionally rather formal and
                    pompous, and his sentiments forced and even refined. But in general he is true
                    to nature, and few writers have been more successful in re-animating and
                    reproducing on the stage the heroes of antiquity. The tragedies of Corneille
                    contain some of the best specimens of chaste diction, and varied and harmonious
                    versification, which are to be found in the French language. The dramatic works
                    of Corneille, with commentaries by Voltaire, were published at Geneva in 1764,
                    in 12 vols. 8vo. This edition has been several times reprinted. An edition of
                    his whole works, with observations by Palissot, was published at Paris in 1802,
                    in ten large octavo volumes. (z. z.)</p>

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Corneille,</hi><hi rend="italic">Michael,</hi> a celebrated
                    painter, was born at Paris in the year 1612, and instructed by his father, who
                    was himself a painter of great merit. Having gained a prize at the academy,
                    young Corneille obtained a pension from Louis XIV. and was sent to Home, where
                    that prince had founded a school for young artists of genius. Having studied
                    there for some t'∏ιe, he gave up his pension, and applied with great industry to
                    the study of the antique. He is said to have equalled Caracci in drawing, but in
                    colouring be was deficient. Upon his return from Rome he was chosen professor in
                    the academy of Paris, and was employed in all the great works then carrying on
                    at Versailles and Trianon, where are still to be seen some efforts of his
                    genius.</p>
