                <p><label type="entry">CORPORATION</label>, a body politic or incorporated, and so
                    called because the persons or members are joined into one body, and are
                    qualified to take, grant, convey, &amp;e.</p>
                <p>There is a great variety of subsisting corporations for the advancement of
                    religion, learning, and commerce, in order to preserve entire those rights and
                    immunities which, if they were granted only to the individuals of which the body
                    corporate is composed, would upon their death be utterly lost and extinct. To
                    show the characteristics <hi rend="italic">of</hi> these incorporations, let us
                    consider the case of a college in either of our universities, founded <hi
                    rend="italic">ad</hi><hi rend="italic">studendum et orandum,</hi> for the
                    encouragement and support of religion and learning. If this was a mere voluntary
                    assembly, the individuals who compose it might indeed read, pray, study, and
                    perform scholastic exercises together, as long as they could agree to do so; but
                    they could neither frame nor receive any laws or rules of their conduct which
                    wøuld have any binding force, for want of a coercive power to create a
                    sufficient obligation; neither could they be capable of retaining any privileges
                    or immunities; for, if such privileges were attacked, who of all this
                    unconnected assembly would have the right or ability to defend them? and when
                    they were dispersed by death or otherwise, how should they transfer these
                    advantages to another set of students, equally unconnected as themselves? So
                    also with regard to holding estates or other property, if land be granted for
                    the purposes of religion or learning to twenty individuals not incorporated,
                    there is no legal way of continuing the property to any other persons for the
                    same purposes, except by endless conveyances from one to the other, as often as
                    the hands are changed. But when they are consolidated and united into a
                    corporation, they and their successors are then considered as one person in law;
                    as one person they have a common will, which is collected from the sense of the
                    majority of the individuals; and this one will may establish rules and orders
                    for the regulation of the whole, which are a sort of municipal laws of this
                    little republic: or rules and statutes may be prescribed to it at its creation,
                    which are then in the place of natural laws. The privileges and immunities, the
                    estates and possessions, of the corporation, when once vested in them, are
                    vested for ever, without any new conveyance to new successions; and all the
                    individual members who have existed from the foundation to the present time, or
                    who shall hereafter exist, are but one person in law, a person that never dies;
                    in like manner as the river Thames is still the same river, though the parts
                    which compose it are changing every instant.</p>
                <p>The original invention of these political constitutions seems to belong entirely
                    to the Romans. They were introduced by Numa, who finding, upon his accession,
                    the city torn to pieces by the two rival factions of Sabines and Romans, thought
                    it a prudent and politic measure to subdivide these two into many smaller ones,
                    by instituting separate societies of every manual trade and profession. They
                    were afterwards much considered by the civil law, in which they were called <hi
                    rend="italic">universitates,</hi> as forming one whole out of many individuals;
                    or <hi rend="italic">collegia,</hi> from being gathered together. They were also
                    adopted by the canon law, for the maintenance of ecclesiastical discipline; and
                    from them our spiritual corporations are derived. But our laws have considerably
                    refined and improved upon the invention, particularly with regard to sole
                    corporations, consisting of one person only, of which the Roman lawyers had no
                    notion; their maxim being that <hi rend="italic">tres faciunt</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">collegium</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> though they held that if a
                    corporation, originally consisting of three persons, be reduced to one, <hi
                    rend="italic">si</hi><hi rend="italic">universitas</hi><hi rend="italic">ad
                    mum</hi><hi rend="italic">redit,</hi> it may still subsist as a corporation, <hi
                    rend="italic">et</hi><hi rend="italic">stet</hi><hi rend="italic">nomen</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">universitatis.</hi></p>
                <p>As to the several sorts of corporations, the first division of them is into <hi
                    rend="italic">aggregate</hi> and <hi rend="italic">sole.</hi> Corporations
                    aggregate consist of many persons united together into one society, and they are
                    kept up by a perpetual succession of members, so as to continue for ever. Of
                    this kind are the mayor and commonalty of a city, the head and fellows of a
                    college, the dean and chapter of a cathedral church. Corporations sole consist
                    of one person only and his successors in some particular station, who are
                    incorporated by law, in order to give them some legal capacities and advantages,
                    particularly that of perpetuity, which in their natural persons they could not
                    have possessed. In this sense the king is a sole corporation; so is a bishop; so
                    are some deacons and prebendaries, distinct from their several chapters; and so
                    is every parson and vicar. And the necessity, or at least use, of this
                    institution will be apparent, if we consider the case of a parson of a church.
                    At the original endowment of parish churches, the freehold of the church, the
                    church-yard, the parsonage-house, the glebe, and the tithes of the parish, were
                    vested in the then parson by the bounty of the donor, as a temporal recompense
                    to him for his spiritual care of the inhabitants, and with intent that the same
                    emoluments should ever afterwards continue as a recompense for the same care.
                    But how was this to be effected? The freehold was vested in the parson; and if
                    we suppose it vested in his natural capacity, on his death it might descend to
                    his heir, and would be liable to his debts and incumbrances; or, at best, the
                    heir might be compellable, at some trouble and expense, to convey these rights
                    to the succeeding incumbent. The law, therefore, has wisely ordained, that the
                    parson, <hi rend="italic">quatenus</hi> parson, shall never die, any more than
                    the king; and this has been effected by making him and his successors a
                    corporation. By these means all the original rights of the parsonage are
                    preserved entire to the successor; so that the present incumbent, and his
                    predecessor who lived seven centuries ago, are in law one and the same person;
                    and what was given to the one was given also to the other.</p>
                <p>Another division of corporations, either sole or aggregate, is into <hi
                    rend="italic">ecclesiastical</hi> and <hi rend="italic">lay.</hi> Ecclesiastical
                    corporations are, where the members are entirely spiritual persons, such as
                    bishops, certain deans and prebendaries, all archdeacons, parsons, and vicars,
                    which are sole corporations; deans and chapters at present, and formerly prior
                    and convent, abbot and monks, and the like, bodies aggregate. These were erected
                    for the furtherance of religion, and perpetuating the rights of the church. Lay
                    corporations, again, are of two sorts, <hi rend="italic">civil</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">eleemosynary.</hi> The civil are such as are erected for a variety
                    of temporal purposes. The king, for instance, is made a corporation, to prevent,
                    in general, the possibility of an <hi rend="italic">interregnum</hi> or vacancy
                    of the throne, and to preserve the possessions of the crown entire; and hence,
                    immediately upon the demise of one king, his successor is in full possession of
                    the regal rights and dignity. Other lay corporations are erected for the good
                    government of a town or particular district, as a mayor and commonalty, bailiff
                    and burgesses, or the like; some for the advancement and regulation of
                    manufactures and commerce, as the trading companies of London and other towns;
                    and others for the better carrying on of divers special purposes, as
                    church-wardens for conservation <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194752147?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0707-2147-0375"/> of the goods
                    of the parish; the College of Physicians and Company of Surgeons in London, for
                    the improvement of the medical science; the Royal Society, for the advancement
                    of natural knowledge; and the Society of Antiquaries, for promoting the study of
                    antiquities. The eleemosynary corporations are those constituted for the
                    perpetual distribution of the free.alms or bounty of the founder of them, to
                    such persons as he has directed. Of this kind are all hospitals for the
                    maintenance of the poor, sick, and impotent, and all colleges, both <hi
                    rend="italic">in</hi> our universities and <hi rend="italic">out</hi> of them.
                    These colleges are founded for two purposes: first, for the promotion of piety
                    and learning by proper regulations and ordinances; and, secondly, for imparting
                    assistance to the members of those bodies, in order to enable them to prosecute
                    their devotion and studies with greater ease and assiduity. And all these
                    eleemosynary corporations are, strictly speaking, lay, and not ecclesiastical,
                    even though composed of ecclesiastical persons, and although they in some things
                    partake of the nature, privileges, and restrictions of ecclesiastical
                    bodies.</p>
                <p>Having thus marshalled the several species of corporations, let us next proceed
                    to consider, first, how corporations in general may be created; secondly, what
                    are their powers, capacities, and incapacities; and, thirdly, how they may be
                    dissolved.</p>
                <p>1, Corporations by the civil law seem to have been created by the mere act and
                    voluntary association of their members; provided such convention was not
                    contrary to law, for then it was <hi rend="italic">illicitum</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">collegium.</hi> It does not appear that the prince's consent was
                    necessary to be actually given to the foundation of them, but merely that the
                    original founders of these voluntary and friendly societies (for they were
                    little more) should not establish any meetings in opposition to the laws of the
                    state.</p>
                <p>But in England the king’s consent is absolutely' necessary' to the erection of
                    any corporation, either implied or expressly given. The king’s implied consent
                    is to be found in corporations which exist by force of the common law, to which
                    our former kings are supposed to have given their concurrence; common law being
                    nothing else but custom, arising from the universal agreement of the whole
                    community. Of this sort are the king himself, all bishops, parsons, vicars,
                    church-wardens, and some others; who by common law have ever been held (as far
                    as our books can show us) to have been corporations, <hi rend="italic"
                    >virtute</hi><hi rend="italic">officii</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and this
                    incorporation is so inseparably annexed to their offices, that we cannot frame a
                    complete legal idea of any of those persons, but we must also have an idea of a
                    corporation, capable to transmit his rights to his successors, at the same time.
                    Another method of implication whereby the king’s consent is presumed, is as to
                    corporations by prescription, such as the city of London, and many others, which
                    have existed as corporations, time whereof the memory of man runneth not to the
                    contrary, and therefore are looked upon in law to be well created; for though
                    the members cannot show any legal charter of incorporation, yet in cases of such
                    high antiquity the law presumes there once was one; and that, by the variety of
                    accidents which a length of time may produce, the charter is lost or destroyed.
                    The methods by which the king’s consent is expressly given, are either by act of
                    parliament or charter. By act of parliament, of which the royal assent is a
                    necessary ingredient, corporations may undoubtedly be created; but it is
                    observable that most of those statutes which are usually cited as having created
                    incorporations, do either confirm such as have been before created by the king,
                    as in the case of the College of Physicians, erected by charter 10 FIenry VIII.
                    which charter was afterwards confirmed in parliament; or they permit the king to
                    erect a corporation <hi rend="italic">in</hi><hi rend="italic">futuro,</hi> with
                    such and such powers, as is the case of the Bank of England, and the Society of
                    the British Fishery. So that the immediate creative act is usually' performed by
                    the king alone, in virtue of his royal prerogative.</p>
                <p>All the other methods, therefore, by which corporations exist, by common law, by
                    prescription, and by act of parliament, are for the most part reducible to this
                    of the king’s letters patent, or charter of incorporation. The king’s creation
                    may be performed by the words <hi rend="italic">creamus, erigimus, fundamus,
                    incorporamus,</hi> or the like. Nay, it is held, that if the king grants to a
                    set of men to have <hi rend="italic">gil-dam</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >mercatorium,</hi> a mercantile meeting or assembly, this alone is sufficient to
                    incorporate and establish them for ever.</p>
                <p>The king, it is said, may grant to a subject the power of erecting corporations,
                    though the contrary was formerly' held; that is, he may permit the subject to
                    name the persons and powers of the corporation at his pleasure; but it is really
                    the king that ereets, and the subject is but the instrument; for though none but
                    the king can make a corporation, yet <hi rend="italic">qui facit</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">per</hi><hi rend="italic">alium,</hi><hi rend="italic">fac'd per
                    se.</hi> In this manner the chancellor to the university of Oxford has power by
                    charter to erect corporations; and has actually exerted it in the erection of
                    several matriculated companies, now subsisting, of tradesmen subservient to the
                    students.</p>
                <p>When a corporation is erected, a name must be given to it; and by that name alone
                    it must sue and be sued, and do all legal acts.</p>
                <p>2. After a corporation is so formed and named, it acquires many powers and
                    rights, which are next to be considered. Some of these arc necessarily and
                    inseparably incident to every corporation; which incidents, as soon as a
                    corporation is duly erected, are tacitly annexed of course. As, first, To have
                    perpetual succession. This is the very end of its incorporation; for there
                    cannot be a succession for ever without an incorporation; and therefore all
                    aggregate corporations have a power necessarily implied of electing members in
                    the room of such as go off. Secondly, To sue or be sued, implead or be
                    impleaded, grant or receive, by its corporate name, and do all other acts as
                    natural persons may. Thirdly, To purchase lands and hold them, for the benefit
                    of themselves and their successors, which two are consequents of the former.
                    Fourthly, To have a common seal; for a corporation being an invisible body,
                    cannot manifest its intention by any personal act or oral discourse; it
                    otherwise acts and speaks only by its common seal. Although the particular
                    members may express their private consent to any act by words or signing their
                    names, yet this does not bind the corporation; it is the fixing of the seal, and
                    that only, which unites the several assents of the individuals who compose the
                    community, and makes one joint assent-of the whole. Fifthly, To make bye-laws or
                    private statutes for the better government of the corporation, which are binding
                    upon themselves, unless contrary to the laws of the land, and then they are
                    void.</p>
                <p>3. Any particular member may be disfranchised, or lose his place in the
                    corporation, by acting contrary to the laws of the society, or the laws of the
                    land; or he may resign it by his own voluntary act. But the body politic may
                    also itself be dissolved in several ways, which dissolution is the civil death
                    of the corporation; and in this case their lands and tenements revert to the
                    person, or his heirs, who granted them to the corporation; for the law annexes a
                    condition to every such grant, that if the corporation be dissolved, the granter
                    shall have the lands again, beeause the cause of the grant has failed. The grant
                    is indeed only during the life of the corporation, which may endure for ever;
                    but when that life is determined to be the dissolution of the body politic, the
                    granter <pb break="no" facs="nls:194752160?mode=fullsize"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0707-2160-0376"/> takes it back by reversion, as in the case of
                    every other grant for life. The debts <hi rend="italic">of</hi> a corporation,
                    either to or from it, are totally extinguished by its dissolution; so that the
                    members thereof cannot recover, or be charged with them, in their natural
                    capacities: agreeably to that maxim of the law, <hi rend="italic">Si
                    quid</hi><hi rend="italic">universitati debetur,</hi><hi rend="italic">singulis
                    non</hi><hi rend="italic">debetur</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >nec,</hi><hi rend="italic">quod</hi><hi rend="italic">debet universitas,
                    singuli debent.</hi></p>
                <p>A corporation may be dissolved, first, by act of parliament, which is boundless
                    in its operations; secondly, by the natural death of all its members, in cases
                    of an aggregate corporation; thirdly, by surrender of its franchises into the
                    hands of the king, which is a kind <hi rend="italic">of</hi> suicide; and,
                    fourthly, by forfeiture of its charter through negligence or abuse of its
                    franchises, in which case the law judges that the body politic has broken the
                    conditions upon which it was incorporated, and therefore the incorporation is
                    void.</p>
