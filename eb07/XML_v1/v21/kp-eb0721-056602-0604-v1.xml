                    a celebrated Spanish poet, was the son of Felix de Vega and Francisca Fernandez,
                    who were both descended from honourable families, and lived in the neighbourhood
                    of Madrid. In that metropolis he was born on the 25th November 1562. He was,
                    according to his own expression, a poet from his cradle; and beginning to make
                    verses before he had learned to write, he used to bribe his elder school-fellows
                    with part of his breakfast, to commit to paper the lines which he had composed.
                    Having lost his father while he was yet still a child, he engaged in a frolic
                    very natural to a lively boy, and wandered with another lad to various parts of
                    Spain, till, having spent their money, and being conducted before a magistrate
                    at Segovia for offering to sell a few trinkets, they were sent home again to
                    Madrid. Soon after this adventure, the young poet was taken under the protection
                    of Geronimo Manrique, bishop of Avila, and began to distinguish himself by his
                    dramatic compositions, which were received with great applause by the public,
                    though their author had not yet completed his education; for, after this period,
                    he became a member of the university of Alcala, where he devoted himself for
                    four years to the study of philosophy. He was then engaged as secretary to the
                    duke of Alva, and wrote his Arcadia in compliment to that patron, who is
                    frequently mentioned in his occasional poems. He quitted that employment on his
                    marriage with Isabel de Urbina, a lady (says his friend and biographer Perez de
                    Montalvan) beautiful without artifice, and virtuous without affectation. His
                    domestic happiness was soon interrupted by a painful incident. Having written
                    some lively verses in ridicule of a person who had taken some injurious freedom
                    with his character, he received a challenge in consequence of his wit; and
                    happening, in the duel which ensued, to give his adversary a dangerous wound, he
                    was obliged to fly from his family, and shelter himself in Valencia. There he
                    resided a considerable time; but connubial affection recalled him to Madrid. His
                    wife died in the year of his return. His affliction at this event led him to
                    relinquish his favourite studies, and embark on board the Armada which was then
                    preparing for the invasion of England. He had a brother who served in that fleet
                    as a lieutenant; and being shot in an engagement with some Dutch vessels, his
                    virtues were celebrated by the afflicted poet, whose heart was peculiarly alive
                    to every generous affection. After the ill success of the Armada, the
                    disconsolate Lope de Vega returned to Madrid, and became secretary to the
                    marquis of Malpica, to whom he has addressed a grateful sonnet. From the service
                    of this patron he passed into the household of the count of Lemos, whom he
                    celebrates as an inimitable poet. He was once more induced to quit his
                    attendance on the great, for the more inviting comforts of a married life. His
                    second choice was Juana de Guardio, of noble birth and singular beauty. By this
                    lady he had two children, a son who died in his infancy, and a daughter named
                    Feliciana, who survived her father. The death of his little boy is said to have
                    hastened that of his wife, whom he had the misfortune to lose in about seven
                    years after his marriage. Having now experienced the precariousness of all human
                    enjoyments, he devoted himself to a religious life, still continuing to produce
                    an astonishing variety of poetical compositions. He undertook the very
                    unpoetical employment of secretary to the Inquisition, and shortly afterwards
                    entered into holy orders. In 1609 he became a kind of honorary member of the
                    brotherhood of St. Francis. His talents procured him many unsolicited honours.
                    Pope Urban VIII. sent him the cross of Malta, with a diploma of Doctor in
                    Divinity, and appointed him to a place of profit in the Apostolic Chamber. He
                    had dedicated his Corona Tragica (a long poem on the fate of Mary queen of
                    Scots) to that learned pontiff. In his seventy-third year he felt the approaches
                    of death, and prepared himself for it with the utmost composure and devotion.
                    His last hours were attended by many of his intimate friends, and particularly
                    his chief patron the duke of Sessa, whom he had made his executor; leaving him
                    the care of his daughter Feliciana, and of his various manuscripts. The manner
                    in which he took leave of those he loved was most tender and affecting. He
                    remarked to his friend Montalvan, that true fame consisted in being good; and
                    that he would willingly exchange all the applauses he had received to add a
                    single deed of virtue to the actions of his life. Having given his dying
                    benediction to his daughter, and performed the last ceremonies of his religion,
                    he expired on the 26th August 1635. The number of his works is immense, but
                    there is no complete and uniform edition. Fr. Cerda Rico superintended a
                    “Collecion de las Obras sueltas, assi en prosa como en verso.” Madrid, 1776-9,
                    21 tom. 4to. This collection does not include his comedies, which would occupy a
                    much larger number of volumes.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
