                <p><label type="entry">SWAMMERDAM, <hi rend="smallcaps">John</hi></label>, a
                    celebrated natural philosopher, was the son of John James Swammerdam, an
                    apothecary and naturalist of Amsterdam, and was born in 1637. His father
                    intended him for the church, and with this view had him instructed in Latin and
                    Greek; but thinking himself unequal to so serious a vocation, he prevailed with
                    his father to consent to his applying himself to physic. As he was kept at home
                    till he should be properly qualified to engage in that study, he was frequently
                    employed in cleaning his father’s curiosities, and putting every thing in its
                    proper place. This inspired him with an early taste for natural history; so
                    that, not content with the survey of the curiosities which his father had
                    purchased, he soon began to make a collection of his own, which he compared with
                    the accounts given of them by the best writers. When grown up, he seriously
                    attended to his anatomical and medical studies; yet spent part of the day and
                    the night in discovering, catching, and examining the flying insects proper to
                    those times, not only in the province of Holland, but in those of Guelderland
                    and Utrecht. Thus initiated in natural history, he went to the university of
                    Leyden in 1651; and in 1653 was admitted a candidate of physic in that
                    university. His attention being now engaged by anatomy, he began to consider how
                    the parts of the body, prepared by dissection, could be preserved, and kept in
                    constant order for anatomical dcmonstration; and here he succeeded as he had
                    done before in his nice contrivances for dissecting and managing the minutest
                    insects. He afterwards made a journey into France, where he spent some time at
                    Saumur, and where he became acquainted with several learned men. In 1667 he
                    returned to Leyden, and took the degree of M. D. The next year the grand duke of
                    Tuscany being in Holland in order to see the curiosities of the country, came to
                    view those of the father and the son; and on this occasion Swammerdam made some
                    anatomical dissections of insects in the presence of that prince, who was struck
                    with admiration at his great skill in managing them, especially at his proving
                    that the future butterfly lay with all its parts neatly folded up in a
                    caterpillar, by actually removing the integuments that covered the former, and
                    extricating and exhibiting all its parts, however minute, with incredible
                    ingenuity, by means of instruments of inconceivable fineness. On this occasion
                    the duke offered him 12,000 florins for his share of the collection, on
                    condition of his removing them himself into Tuscany, and coming to live at the
                    court of Florence; but Swammerdam, who hated a court life, declined his
                    highness’s proposal. In 1663, he published a General History of Insects. About
                    this time, his father began to take offence at his inconsiderately neglecting
                    the practice of physic, which might have supported him in affluence; and would
                    neither supply him with money nor clothes. This reduced him to some
                    difficulties. In 1675 he published his History of the Ephemeras; and his father
                    dying the same year, left him a fortune sufficient for his support; but he did
                    not long survive him, for he died in 1682. Gaubius gave a translation of all his
                    works from the orginal Dutch into Latin, from which they were translated into
                    English, and published in folio, in 1758. Boerhaave wrote his life.</p>
