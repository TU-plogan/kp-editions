                <p><label type="entry">BRACCIOLINI, <hi rend="smallcaps">Francis</hi></label>, an
                    Italian poet, a native of Pistoja, and the friend of Pope Urban VIII. was born
                    about the year 1566. Removing to Florence, he was admitted into the academy
                    there, and devoted himself to literature. At Rome he entered into the service of
                    Cardinal Maffeo Barberini, with whom he afterwards went to France. After the
                    death of Clement VIII. he returned to his own country, and for some years
                    prosecuted his studies in retirement. λVhen his patron Barberini was elected
                    pope, under the name of Urban VIH., Bracciolini repaired to Rome, where he was
                    well received, and made secretary to the pope’s brother, Cardinal Antonio. He
                    had also the honour conferred on him of taking a surname from the arms of the
                    Barberini family, which were bees; and he was afterwards known by the name of
                    <hi rend="italic">Bracciolini delľApi.</hi> He resided in Rome during the whole
                    of Urban’s pontificate, frequenting the most illustrious academies, and listened
                    to with general applause, but, at the same time, censured for his sordid
                    avarice. On the death of this pontiff he returned to his native city, where he
                    died in the year 1645. Bracciolini, was a copious writer. There is scarcely any
                    species of poetry, epic, dramatic, pastoral, lyric, or burlesque, which he did
                    not attempt. He is principally noted for his mock-heroic poem entitled <hi
                    rend="italic">Sclιerηo degli Dei,</hi> which disputes priority of date with
                    Tassoni’s <hi rend="italic">Sccchia Rapita.</hi> In merit, indeed, its
                    inferiority is acknowledged, yet it obtained considerable applause. Of his
                    serious heroic poems, the most celebrated is the <hi rend="italic">Croce
                    Racquistata,</hi> which by some is placed next to the great works of Ariosto and
                    Tasso, <hi rend="italic">sed magno intervallo.</hi> He celebrated the elevation
                    of his patron Urban VIII. in a poem of twenty-three books, which shows with what
                    facility he could write verses. His dramatic pastoral, entitled <hi
                    rend="italic">E Amoroso Sdcgno,</hi> is accounted one of the best productions of
                    the age in which it was written; and some of his tragedies met with much

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Brace</hi> is commonly taken for a couple or pair, and
                    applied by huntsmen to several kinds of game, as a brace of bucks, foxes, hares,
                    grouse, and the like.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Brace,</hi> in writing or printing, a crooked line inclosing
                    a passage, as in a triplet.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Braces,</hi> in the sea-language, are ropes belonging to all
                    the yards of a ship except the mizen, two on each yard, reeved through blocks
                    that are fastened to pennants, seized to the yard-arms. Their use is either to
                    square or traverse the yards. Hence t&lt;rbrace the yard is to bring it to
                    either side. All braces come aftward on. Thus the main brace comes to the poop;
                    the main-top-sail brace comes to the mizen-top, and thence to the main shrouds;
                    the fore and fore-top-sail braces come down by the main and main-top-sail stays;
                    and so of the rest. But the mizen-bowline serves to brace to the yard, and the
                    cross-jack braces are brought forwards to the main-shrouds, when the ship sails
                    close on a wind.</p>
