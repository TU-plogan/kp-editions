                    Auchinleck, in the county of Ayr, whose life of Dr Samuel Johnson entitles him
                    to a place among those who have contributed to the great stock of intellectual
                    wealth, was the eldest son of Alexander Boswell, styled Lord Auchinleck, one of
                    the judges of the supreme courts of session and justiciary in Scotland. He was
                    born in the year 1740, and, having received the rudiments of his education,
                    partly in his father’s house, and partly at Mr Mundell’s school in Edinburgh,
                    successively prosecuted his studies at the universities of that city and of
                    Glasgow. He was destined by his father for the Scottish bar; a pursuit with
                    which his own inclinations did not much accord, and instead of which he would
                    gladly have substituted one of greater activity and enterprise. His father’s
                    wishes, however, and his own sense of filial duty, prevailed; and, as the study
                    of civil law at one of the foreign universities was then included in the most

                    advocate, it was determined that Mr Boswell should repair for that purpose to
                    Utrecht, with a permission, before his return, to make the tour of Europe.</p>
                <p>Already, however, those traits of character might be observed which gave a
                    peculiar direction to his afterlife. He was very early ambitious of being
                    admitted into the society and friendship of men distinguished by talent and
                    public estimation, more especially those of eminence in the literary world; and
                    his natural urbanity, as well as gaiety of disposition, rendered it no difficult
                    matter to gratify his propensity. While at the university of Glasgow, he had
                    formed a particular intimacy with Mr Temple, the friend of Gray, afterwards
                    vicar of St Gluvias in Cornwall; and he was known to many of the conspicuous
                    characters at that time in Scotland, among others, to Lord Kames, Lord Hailes,
                    Dr Robertson, and Dr Beattie. But the most remarkable acquisition which he made
                    of this kind was his acquaintance with Dr Johnson, which commenced in 1763, and
                    was destined to prove at once the principal era in his own life, and the means
                    of adding not a little to the fame of the philosopher.</p>
                <p>Mr Boswell had visited London for the first time in 1760, when he accidentally
                    became acquainted with Derrick, afterwards <hi rend="italic">King</hi> Derrick,
                    as the master of ceremonies at Bath was then fantastically titled, and by him
                    was initiated into the arcana of London life. In 1763 he proceeded to Utrecht.
                    Having passed a year at that university, he travelled into Germany and
                    Switzerland, was entertained by Voltaire at his castle of Ferney, and conversed
                    with Rousseau in the solitudes of Neufchatel. He continued his route to Italy;
                    but, led by his natural enthusiasm, forsook the common lines of travel, and
                    passed over to Corsica, which, after a contest of more than thirty years, was
                    still struggling for independence with the republic of Genoa. He thus describes
                    his feelings while he approached the island: “As long as I can remember
                    anything, I had heard of the malcontents of Corsica: it was a curious thought
                    that I was just going to see them.” Rousseau had given him a letter of
                    introduction to the romantic Paoli; and his tide was suddenly at the full. In
                    the small court of this simple but dignified chieftain he found everything to
                    gratify his taste for the virtuous and sublime in natural character. He became a
                    favourite, too, in his turn; was caressed by the islanders, admitted at all
                    times to the society of their leader, and not only witnessed the movements of
                    their political machinery, but appeared to be himself an actor in the scene. Of
                    his visit to this island he published a narrative on his return to Scotland,
                    entitled <hi rend="italic">An Account of Corsica, ιvith Memoirs of General
                    Pasquale de Paoli,</hi> printed at Glasgow in 1768. This book was translated
                    into the Dutch, German, French, and Italian languages. He likewise printed, in
                    the following year, a collection of <hi rend="italic">British Essays in favour
                    of the Brave Corsicans;</hi> and made such attempts as he could to interest the
                    British government in favour of that people, before they were finally crushed by
                    the pressure of the French arms. His acquaintance and friendship with General
                    Paoli were afterwards renewed in London, when that chief, having escaped with
                    difficulty from his native isle, found an asylum in the British dominions.</p>
                <p>From Corsica Mr Boswell repaired to Paris; and, returning to Scotland in 1766, he
                    was admitted to the bar. Soon after, he published a pamphlet, under the title of
                    <hi rend="italic">Essence of thx Douglas Cause;</hi> written while that great
                    suit was depending in the Court of Session, with a view to excite the public
                    interest in favour of Mr Douglas. In 1769 he was married to Miss Montgomery,
                    daughter of David Montgomery, Esq.; an accomplished lady, in whose society he
                    enjoyed every domestic happiness.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>He had a family by her of two sons and three daughters. Mrs
                    Boswell died in 1790.</p></note></p>
                <p>In the year 1773 Mr Boswell was admitted into the Literary Club, which then met
                    at the Turk’s Head in Gerard Street, Soho, and of which Dr Johnson had been an
                    original member. Here he had the pleasure of associating with Burke, Goldsmith,
                    Reynolds, Garrick, and other eminent persons.</p>
                <p>Dr Johnson had long projected a tour to the Hebrides; and Mr Boswell at last
                    prevailed upon him, in the course of this year, 1773, to put the plan in
                    execution, and became the companion of his journey from Edinburgh. During this
                    excursion, they saw whatever was most remarkable in the Western Highlands and
                    Isles; and here Mr Boswell was again at large in his natural element. Conscious
                    of the advantages which he enjoyed, and aware of their value, he improved every
                    opportunity of knowledge and remark, and has preserved a faithful record of all.
                    His feelings were like those which Dante ascribes to the pilgrim, who, having
                    paid his vows,</p>
                <lg part="N">
                    <l part="N"> " Long gazes on the holy fane, and thinks </l>
                    <l part="N"> How he shall paint it when he reaches home.” </l>
                </lg>
                <p>Both travellers gave to the world an account of this tour. Mr Boswell’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Journal</hi> was published in 1785. In the course of this work he
                    has given a simple and very interesting narrative of some minute circumstances
                    attending the escape of Prince Charles Edward after the battle of Culloden,
                    collected from the information of persons on the spot, and privy to his
                    concealment; particularly from the celebrated Flora Macdonald, whom they visited
                    at Kingsburgh, in Sky, and from Malcolm Macleod, who had been the faithful and
                    intelligent companion of the Wanderer’s flight.</p>
                <p>Lord Auchinleck died in 1782; and, a few years after (1786), Mr Boswell, giving
                    up his law pursuits at Edinburgh, removed with his family to London, towards
                    which, as a great emporium of literature and theatre of varied life, his
                    inclinations had always tended. He had recently before been called to the
                    English bar. He did not, however, prosecute the profession, but gave himself up
                    to his natural bent for society and letters. After Dr Johnson’s death, in 1784,
                    he was occupied for several years in collecting and arranging, with
                    indefatigable diligence, the materials for a narrative, which he had long
                    projected, of that eminent man’s life.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>Besides the. works which have been already mentioned, he was the author of two
                    Letters addressed to the People of Scotland; being his only productions of a
                    political character. In the first of these, which was published in 1784, he
                    appeared as an advocate for the new administration, then recently formed. The
                    second Letter, written in 1785, was a strenuous appeal against a measure brought
                    forward under the sanction of the same ministry, for effecting a reform in the
                    Court of Session in Scotland, by reducing the number of the Judges.</p>
                <p>Mr Boswell died on the 19th June 1795. In his private character, he was loved by
                    his friends, as well as a favourite in the circles of social life; and, if his
                    attachments were often suddenly formed, they were not less durable on this
                    account. Whatever he has written is favourable to virtue; and, during a course
                    of living which naturally dissipates the mind, his moral principles remained
                    entire, and his religious faith unshaken. “Few men,” says his friend Sir William
                    Forbes, in a letter published in his <hi rend="italic">Life of Dr Beattie,</hi>
                    “possessed a stronger sense of piety, or more fervent devotion—perhaps not
                    always sufficient to regulate his imagination, or direct his conduct, yet still
                    genuine, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193733427?mode=fullsize"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0705-3427-0028"/> and founded both in his understanding and his
                    heart.” His talents would probably have been rated higher if they had not been
                    obscured by certain eccentricities of character; yet his writings bear
                    sufficient testimony to his natural abilities, and to the delicacy as well as
                    aptness of his intellectual touch. He has described himself as being of a
                    temperament inclined to melancholy; but in society he was remarkable for the
                    gaiety of his disposition, and his life was full of activity and stir. Tobe
                    distinguished was his ruling passion, and he indulged it freely. He sought those
                    whom the world, on whatever account, held in honour; and he was desirous of
                    being known as one with whom they assorted, and who possessed their friendship.
                    He was fond of his pedigree and family connections, and he aspired after
                    literary fame. While some of these propensities have been common to the great
                    and good in every age, others, it must be confessed, are more frequently
                    harboured than avowed. Mr Boswell adopted the latter and more unusual
                    course.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>“Egotism and
                    vanity,” says he, iu his Letter published in 1785, “are the indigenous plants of
                    my mind: they distinguish it. I may prune their luxuriancy, but I must not
                    entirely clear it of them: for then I should be no longer as I am and perhaps
                    there might be something not so good.”</p></note> He fairly owned his passion,
                    and, if not thus secured from attack, had all those advantages, at least, which
                    are gained by meeting an enemy in the field. But, in reality, he has dealt so
                    openly, and with such candour, on every occasion which touches himself as well
                    as others, that he wins not only our forgiveness,but our affection, and
                    maintains, by ingenuousness and complete truth of character, a kind of
                    superiority over any person who should feel desirous of assailing him. Nor was
                    evidence of a substantial sort wanting to show the independence of his mind.
                    For, however attached to individuals of extensive influence, and however
                    ambitious of exalted patronage, he was neither an instrument of party nor a
                    server of the time. λVhat he gave in attention he received back in kindness;
                    and, while he associated with the learned and the philosophical, he contributed
                    his share to the general stock of enjoyment. Of Dr Johnson’s sincere attachment
                    to him there are many and unequivocal proofs in their correspondence.</p>
                <p>But it is not on account of his private character, or of a certain domestic
                    celebrity which he enjoyed during his life, that he is to be distinguished in a
                    work of this kind. We commemorate him as an author, and particularly as a writer
                    of biography. Here he is almost an inventor; he has at least carried this
                    species of composition to a degree of accuracy and detail formerly unattempted.
                    Other writers, as the Abbé de Sade in L∙s <hi rend="italic">Memoirs of
                    Petrarch,</hi> and Mason in his <hi rend="italic">Life of Gray,</hi> had
                    conducted the course of their narratives partly by means of original letters.
                    But Mr Boswell has, more than any preceding biographer, made use of all the
                    varied means by which such a history admits of being dramatized. He paints the
                    whole man, presents the incidents of his life in their actual order of
                    succession, and preserves him as it were entire; fulfilling in the history of
                    the moral, what Bacon has assigned to philosophy as her genuine work in that of
                    the natural, world, faithfully to return its accents and reflect its image, not
                    to add any thing of her own, but to iterate only and repeat.</p>
                <p>The plan of keeping a Miscellaneous Journal had been recommended to him by Dr
                    Johnson on their first acquaintance; and he appears very early to have followed
                    it, as far as writing down what was remarkable in the conversation of those whom
                    he admired. From his frequent allusions to the discourses of Selden, commonly
                    called his <hi rend="italic">Table Talk,</hi> as preserved by Lilward, it is
                    probable that he had the example of that work in his view; and by long use he
                    acquired a great facility in this process. Of his first publication, containing
                    an account of Corsica, the Journal of his residence with General Paoli is by far
                    the most interesting part. It is a sketch remarkable for life and natural
                    colouring; and is one of those productions which, though enhanced by their
                    occasion, do not depend on this circumstance alone for the attraction which they
                    possess. In his <hi rend="italic">Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides,</hi> he
                    pushed to a still greater extent, and even beyond its just limits, his favourite
                    style of writing. Carried away by his natural enthusiasm, and delighting “to
                    pour out all himself, like old Montaigne,” he indulged in a more ample and
                    unqualified disclosure, both of his own sentiments and of the opinions of
                    others, than is consistent with a salutary prudence, or necessary for the
                    purposes of instruction. Of this he himself became sensible on cooler
                    reflection, and not only acknowledged it with candour, but, in his subsequent
                    and more laboured compositions, profited by the general opinion, and imposed a
                    greater restraint upon his pen.</p>
                <p>For the task of writing Johnson’s life he was in many respects peculiarly
                    qualified. He had lived in habits of intimacy with the sage for a period of
                    twenty years, had early conceived the plan of such <hi rend="italic">a</hi>
                    work, and received from Johnson himself, to,whom his intention was known, many
                    particulars of his early life and personal history. As the writer was thus
                    furnished for his undertaking, so there has seldom been a more fertile or
                    interesting subject for the biographer. Johnson was not a mere scholar, “deep
                    versed in books, and shallow in himself,” nor was he one of those unprofitable
                    misers who hoard without expending. He was a general and a minute observer, and,
                    while he possessed in a degree seldom equalled “the strenuous use of profitable
                    thought,” his talent for communicating knowledge was more remarkable even than
                    the large capacity of his mind, or the accumulation of his learning.</p>
                <p>According to Baker’s character of King James, in that passage which Mr Boswell
                    happily prefixed to his <hi rend="italic">Journal,</hi> “he was of an admirable
                    pregnancy of wit, and that pregnancy much improved by continual study from his
                    childhood, by which he had gotten such a promptness in expressing his mind, that
                    his extemporal speeches were little inferior to his premeditated writings. Many,
                    no doubt, had read as much, and perhaps more than he, but scarce ever any
                    concocted his reading into judgment as he did.” Johnson’s conversation,
                    accordingly, is the matter and substance of the book; and, as the philosopher
                    did not, in the midst of his studies, forget to cultivate his friends, nor gave
                    up the advantages and comfort of society, there was in his discourse a range and
                    diversity of subject not often found in combination with classical knowledge and
                    habits of profound thinking. Nor does this work exhibit a series merely of witty
                    and sententious sayings: it is interspersed alike with miscellaneous narrative
                    and criticism; and, which constitutes its principal feature, it contains a mass
                    of opinions on subjects of a more common nature, where the powers of reasoning
                    and illustration are applied to familiar topics, and the ordinary occurrences of
                    life. Valuable as a deposit of literary anecdote, it is still more so as a
                    collection of ethical discourses, to which its popular form gives a singular
                    currency and effect; so that there are few books extant where the religious and
                    social duties, as well as the love of science, in its largest acceptation, are
                    impressed more agreeably, or with greater force, upon the mind.</p>
                <p>Among the many circumstances which have conspired to heighten our interest in
                    this narrative, is the exhibition which it affords of illustrious characters in
                    different <pb break="no" facs="nls:193733440?mode=fullsize"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0705-3440-0029"/> walks of life. The period was distinguished by an
                    unusual measure of genius and talent; and we are not only introduced to the
                    closet of the philosopher, but carried with him also into assemblages of the
                    brilliant and the wise, with whom he associated. The tone of this society,
                    moreover, is highly pleasing, and in harmony with our best principles and
                    feelings; in which respect it is impossible to avoid contrasting it with those
                    more boasted Parisian societies during the same period, which were supposed to
                    be the centre of French literature and wit, as they are displayed to us by some
                    of the chief actors in that scene.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    its interest; the period is still too recent; but, to estimate its value in
                    after-times, we have only to consider what we ourselves should have gained if
                    such a volume had been preserved to us from the rolls of ancient life.</p>
                <p>In the great attainments of a biographer, which are the truth and minuteness of
                    his relation, Mr Boswell has been eminently successful. If, in this species of
                    writing, an author is exempted from the formality, as well as comprehensive
                    research, necessary in the higher classes of historical composition, it is well
                    known that he has his peculiar difficulties to encounter; difficulties, too,
                    which are the greatest where, by his intimate knowledge of the subject, he is
                    best qualified for the task of writing. Nor does the partiality to which he is
                    himself exposed constitute his only danger; since he is no less apt to bc led
                    away by the expectation of gratifying his readers. We are fond of seeing the
                    picture of character completed according to our fancy, and, whatever bc the
                    feeling which has commenced, we are impatient of any interruption to its train.
                    In the case of those whom we respect and love, the disappointment is doubly
                    ungrateful; we dislike being told of their fraiLies, because we are unwilling to
                    believe that they were Kail. But such is not the colour nor the tissue of human
                    characters; and the artist who would represent them truly, must do perpetual
                    violence to his inclination. The fidelity of Mr Boswell’s portrait may be
                    ascribed, in a great measure, to the form and method of his composition. Had he
                    given us only the results of his observation, the effort at impartiality could
                    scarcely have been preserved; but he has presented us with the whole materials
                    as he found them, and allows us to work them up for ourselves.</p>
                <p>In the other distinguishing quality of a biographical work, namely, the
                    minuteness of its information, he is so little deficient, that his observance of
                    this requisite has been converted into an accusation against him. And it is
                    certain, as already observed, that, in his early productions particularly, he
                    left some room for such a charge; and that, while his veracity and candour were
                    unimpeached, his prudence was not on all occasions equally conspicuous. Yet it
                    must be remembered that the great use of biography is to bring instruction home;
                    to give us examples, not of individual actionsand conduct merely, but of that
                    conduct as displayed in the common paths of. life. The history of nations is too
                    often a species of heroical romance. Its lessons are, at all events, of a
                    different nature from those now in question; and its moral is far too remote to
                    answer the necessities of individuals. General precepts, again, when delivered
                    without the aid of story, commonly fail to produce their effect, either because
                    they fail to excite attention, or because the power of applying them to
                    particular cases remains as difficult as before. Nor do works of fiction,
                    however excellent, and even where the scene is laid as it were at home, and the
                    characters are those of a private station, leave any very permanent impressions
                    on the mind. They do not carry with them a sufficient presence and authority;
                    for the writer’s first object is not to instruct, but to please; and, above all,
                    they want that great requisite, truth, for which, in the time of need, all
                    others are abandoned and forgotten. A manual of instruction for human conduct,
                    which, instead of being couched in general maxims, or calculated for situations
                    of unusual occurrence, should descend to particular cases, and to the ordinary
                    emergencies of private life, would certainly be one of the most valuable
                    presents which philosophy could offer to the bulk of mankind. Biography makes
                    the nearest approach towards the compilation of such a code; and, as a
                    commentary on moral duties, it is, when faithfully executed, invaluable. But it
                    is so in proportion only to the closeness of the resemblance and the exactness
                    of the detail. Minuteness, therefore, is the characteristic and soul of
                    biographical writing, if its proper uses are considered.</p>
                <p>That such a plan of delineation may be carried to excess, indeed, is undeniable.
                    He who is accustomed to set down whatever he sees and hears, may become
                    indiscriminate in his choice, and forget the value of his store in the pleasure
                    of collecting it. To ascertain the just medium in this respect, is one of the
                    many things for which rules are ineffectual. A sound judgment alone can
                    determine the limits. As to the license of publication, the biographer is under
                    one common restraint with authors of every class. He violates the due boundary
                    if he introduces into his work what is injurious to virtue, or if he discloses,
                    for the purposes of general information merely, any thing which may probably
                    affect the interests or wound the minds of the living. When that period has
                    arrived which secures against dangers of the latter description, even individual
                    characters become, to a certain extent, the property of mankind at large, and
                    may be employed as a vehicle for instruction, if exhibited with fidelity. On
                    this score Mr Boswell, notwithstanding his natural promptness and want of
                    reserve, has, in his latest and principal work at least, given little ground for
                    animadversion. His habitual quickness of feeling and liveliness of fancy appear
                    to have been corrected, where others were concerned, by his love of justice, and
                    a general benevolence of mind.</p>
                <p>With regard to his style of writing, a progressive improvement in it may be
                    discovered through his different productions. It is in general well suited to
                    his matter, is animated and easy where he is himself the narrator, and bears
                    evident marks of being true to the original, where, as commonly happens, hc is a
                    reporter merely. On the whole, whatever blemishes maybe found in it as a
                    literary composition, his <hi rend="italic">Life of Johnson</hi> is a very
                    valuable work, fraught with information at once useful and picasing. There are
                    few books which present learning in a more attractive'form; and few where the
                    seeds of knowledge are scattered more profusely.</p>
