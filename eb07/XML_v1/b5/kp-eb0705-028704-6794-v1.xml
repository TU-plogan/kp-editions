                <p><label type="entry">BRIGGS, <hi rend="smallcaps">Henry</hi></label>, one of the
                    greatest mathematicians of the sixteenth century, was born at Warley Wood, in
                    the parish of Halifax, Yorkshire, in the year 1556. In 1592 he was appointed
                    examiner and lecturer in mathematics, and soon afterwards reader of the physical
                    lecture founded by Dr Linacer. When Gresham College in London was established,
                    he was chosen the first professor of geometry there, about the beginning of
                    March 1596. In 1609 Mr Briggs contracted an intimacy with Usher, afterwards
                    archbishop of Armagh, which continued many years, and was kept up chiefly by
                    letters, two of which, written by the subject of this notice, are still extant.
                    In one of these letters, dated in August 1610, he tells his friend he was
                    engaged on the subject of eclipses; and in the other, dated in March 1615, he
                    acquaints him with his being wholly employed about the noble invention of
                    logarithms, then lately discovered, and in the improvement of which he had
                    afterwards a large share. In his lectures at Gresham College, he proposed the
                    alteration of the scale of logarithms, from the hyperbolic form which Napier had
                    given them, to that in which unity is assumed as the logarithm of the ratio of
                    ten to one; and soon afterwards he wrote to the inventor to make the same
                    proposal to himself. In 1616 Briggs paid a visit to Napier at Edinburgh, in
                    order to confer with that eminent person respecting the suggested change; and
                    next year he repeated his visit for a similar purpose. During these conferences
                    the alteration proposed by Briggs was agreed upon; andon the return of the
                    latter from his second visit in 1617, he accordingly published the first chiliad
                    of his logarithms. In 1619 he was appointed Savilian professor of geometry at
                    Oxford, and resigned his professorship of Gresham College on the 25th of July
                    1620. Soon after his settlement at Oxford he was incorporated master of arts in
                    that university, where he continued a laborious and studious life, employed
                    partly in discharging the duties of his office, and partly in the computation of
                    logarithms and in other useful works. In 1622 he published a small tract on the
                    “North-west Passage to the South Seas, through the continent of Virginia and
                    Hudson’s Bay;” and in 1624 he printed, at London, his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Arithmetica Logarithmica,</hi> in folio, a work containing the logarithms of
                    thirty thousand natural numbers to fourteen places of figures besides the index.
                    He also lived to complete a table of logarithmic sines and tangents for the
                    hundredth part of every degree to fourteen places of figures besides the index,
                    with a table of natural signs to fifteen places, and the tangents and secants
                    for the same to tcn places; all of which were printed at Gouda in 1631, and
                    published in 1633 under the title of <hi rend="italic">Trigonometria
                    Britannica.</hi> In the construction of these works, the author, besides immense
                    labour and application, displayed great powers of genius and invention; and in
                    his investigations may be detected the germs of discoveries in mathematics which
                    are generally considered as of later invention, namely, the binomial theorem,
                    the differential method and construction of tables by differences, the
                    interpolation by differences, together with angular sections, and several other
                    things of scarcely inferior importance. Mr Briggs terminated his laborious and
                    useful life on the 26th of January 1630, in the seventy-fourth year of bis age.
                    Dr Smith gives him the character of being a man of great probity, a contemner of
                    riches, and contented with his own station, preferring a studious retirement to
                    all the splendid circumstances of life. His works are, 1. A Table to find the
                    Height of the Pole, the Magnetical Declination being given, London, 1602, 4to;
                    2. Tables for the Improvement of Navigation, printed in the second edition of
                    Edward Wright’s treatise entitled “Certain Errors in Navigation detected and
                    corrected,” London, 1610, 4to; 3. A Description of an Instrumental Table to find
                    the part proportional, devised by Mr Edward Wright, London, 1616 and 1618, 12mo;

                    physician in the latter end of the seventeenth century, was the son of Augustin
                    Briggs, Esq. four times member for the city of Norwich, where our author was
                    born. He studied at the university of Cambridge; and his genius leading him to
                    cultivate physic, he travelled into France, where he attended the lectures of
                    the celebrated anatomist Μ. Vieussens at Montpelier. After his return he
                    published his <hi rend="italic">Ophthalmogra-phia</hi> in 1676. The year
                    following he was created doctor of medicine at Cambridge, and soon after was
                    made fellow of the College of Physicians at London. In 1682 he resigned his
                    fellowship in favour of his brother; and the same year his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Theory of Vision</hi> was published by Hooke. The ensuing year he sent to the
                    Royal Society a continuation of that discourse, which was published in their
                    Transactions; and the same year he was appointed by King Charles II. physician
                    to St Thomas’s Hospital. In 1684 he communicated to the Royal Society two
                    remarkable cases relating to vision, which were likewise printed in their
                    Transactions; and in 1685 he published a Latin version of his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Theory of Vision,</hi> at the desire of Mr, afterwards Sir Isaac Newton,

                    recommendatory cpistle from him prefixed to it. He was afterwards appointed
                    physician in ordinary to King William, and continued in great esteem for
                    professional skill till his death, which took place in September 1704.</p>
