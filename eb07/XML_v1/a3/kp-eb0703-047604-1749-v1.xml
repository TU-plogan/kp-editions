                    rend="smallcaps">Michaud d’,</hi> a French engineer and military writer of
                    eminence, and memorable as the inventor of the floating batteries employed
                    against Gibraltar, was born at Pontarlier in the year 1733. He was originally
                    destined for the church; ‘but, instead of em-ploymg himself in the studies
                    suited to that profession, he became wholly engrossed with plans of
                    fortifications, and was at length admitted, with the consent of his parents,
                    into the corps of engineers. He distinguished himself at several sieges during
                    the seven years’ war; and had acquired so much reputation by his professional
                    services and by his writings, that he was specially employed to assist in the
                    last grand effort made by France and Spain for the reduction of Gibraltar in
                    1782. It was about this period that he projected the famous floating batteries;
                    an invention which inspired the combined armies with the greatest hopes of
                    success, and which at first occasioned no small degree of alarm in the British
                    garrison. “The battering ships,” says Drinkwater, in his interesting account of
                    this memorable siege, <hi rend="superscript"> ii</hi> were ’ found to be no less
                    formidable than they had been represented. Our heaviest shells often rebounded
                    from their tops, whilst the 32 pound shot seemed incapable of making any visible
                    impression upon their hulls. Frequently we flattered ourselves they were on
                    fire; but no sooner did the smoke appear than, with the most persevering
                    intrepidity, men were observed applying wa.tcr, from their engines within, to
                    those places whence the smokc issued.” Of the ultimate fate of these expensive
                    and formidable engines of attack all British readers must be sufficiently
                    informed. Not one of the whole ten escaped destruction from the bombs and
                    red-hot balls poured upon them from the garrison. Μ. d’Arçon, however, published
                    a memoir to show that his batteries were wilfully exposed to destruction through
                    the envy and jealousy which the contrivance had excited among the Spaniards; and
                    this statement seems to have obtained the general concurrence of his countrymen.
                    But projectors do not readily admit umy inadequacy in their schemes; nor will a
                    vain-glorious people, who have been foiled in war, ever ascribe their disgrace
                    to the superior skill or constancy of their enemy.</p>
                <p>Μ. d’Arçon appeared in the capacity of a general in the first years of the
                    Revolution; and, in particular, was employed in the invasion of Holland, where,
                    in 1793, he besieged and took several fortified places. He soon afterwards
                    withdrew or was driven from public life, and remained in retirement till 1799,
                    when he was made a member of the Conservative Senate by Buonaparte. He died the
                    following year, aged sixty-seven. He was a member of the Institute, and author
                    of the following works :—1, Reflexions d’un Ingénieur, en réponse à un
