                <p><label type="entry">ROBERTSON</label> William, one of the greatest historians of
                    modern times, was the son of the Rev. William Robertson, minister of Borthwick,
                    in the county of Edinburgh, and of Eleanor, the daughter of David Pitcairne,
                    Esq. of Dreghorn. He was descended from the Robertsons of Gladney, a branch of
                    the family which for many fenerations has possessed the estate of Struan in
                    Perthshire.</p>
                <p>le was born at Borthwick in the year 1721, and received his early education at
                    Dalkeith school, under Mr Leslie, a classical teacher of much reputation. In
                    1733 his father became one of the ministers of Old Greyfriar’s Church in
                    Edinburgh, and towards the close of the same year, the son commenced his
                    academical studies. He speedily distinguished himself as a young man of superior
                    talents and attain ments. He obtained his license in 1741, and in 1743 he was
                    appointed minister of Gladsmuir in the county of Haddington. In 1758 he was
                    translated to Lady Yester⅛ parish in Edinburgh, and other preferments speedily
                    followed. In 1759 he was appointed chaplain of Stirling Castle; in 1761, one of
                    his Majesty’s chaplains in ordinary; and in 1762 he was elected principal of the
                    university. In 1764 the office of historiographer to the king for Scotland was
                    revived in his favour, and was accompanied with a salary of two hundred pounds a
                    year. The emoluments arising from this accumulation of offices far exceeded what
                    any Presbyterian clergyman in Scotland had previously enjoyed. About the period
                    of his translation to Edinburgh he was created D. D.</p>
                <p>We find it difficult to ascertain at what period were first unfolded the great
                    and singular talents which destined Dr Robertson to be one of the first writers
                    that rescued this island from the reproach of not having any good historians. We
                    are, however, assured, that before tbe publication of any of his literary
                    performances, even from his first appearance in public life, his abilities had
                    begun to attract the notice of observing men; and to his more intimate friends
                    he discovered marks of such high-minded ambition, as, seconded by those
                    abilities, could not have failed to carry him to tile first honours of his
                    profession, in whatever sphere he had been placed, and whatever opposition he
                    might have had to encounter.</p>
                <p>The first theatre tllat offered for the display of his talents was the General
                    Assembly of the Church of Scotland. It is the annual meetings of this court that
                    produce to view men who would otherwise remain in the deepest obscurity. There
                    the humble pastor, whose lot has been cast in the remotest corner of the
                    Highland wilds, feels himself, for a time, on a footing of equality with the
                    first citizen in the kingdom: he can there dispute with him the prize of
                    eloquence, the most flattering distinction to a liberal mind; a distinction
                    which is naturally sought after with the greater eagerness in that assembly, as
                    the simple establishment of the Church of Scotland has rendered it the only
                    pre-eminence to which the greatest part of its members can ever hope to
                    attain.</p>
                <p>From the moment Dr Robertson first appeared in this assembly, he became the
                    object of universal attention and applause. His speeches were marked with the
                    same manly and persuasive eloquence that distinguishes his historical
                    compositions; and it was observed by all, that while his young rivals in oratory
                    contented themselves with opening a cause, or delivering a studied harangue, he
                    showed equal ability to start objections or to reply; and that even his most
                    unpremeditated effusions were not unadorned with those harmonious and seemingly
                    measured periods which have been so much admired in his works of labour and
                    reflection. He soon came to be considered as the ablest supporter of the cause
                    which he chose to espouse, and was now the unrivalled leader of one of the great
                    parties which have long divided the church of which he was a member. When we
                    reflect upon this circumstance, and consider how much mankind are the same in
                    every society, we shall be the less surprised to find in the literary works of
                    Dr Robertson an acquaintance with the human heart, and a knowledge of the world,
                    which we in vain look for in many other historians. The man who has spent his
                    life in the difficult task of conducting the deliberations of a popular
                    assembly, in regulating the passions, the interests, the prejudices, of a
                    numerous faction, has advantages over the mere man of letters, which no ability,
                    no study, no second-hand information, can ever compensate.</p>
                <p>The first work which extended his reputation beyond the walls of the General
                    Assembly was a sermon preached at Edinburgh in 1758 before the Society for
                    Propagating Christian Knowledge, the subject of which was, “The State <pb
                    break="no" facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=311"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0719-0311-0301"/>of the World at the Appearance of Jesus Christ.”
                    The ingenuity with which a multiplicity of detached circumstances are there
                    collected, and shown to tend to one single point, afforded a fair promise of
                    those peculiar powers which he so conspicuously displayed in his historical
                    works. This sermon, which was immediately published, did great honour to the
                    author; and it is probably to the reputation which he thus acquired, that we are
                    to attribute the unanimity with which he was called to be one of the ministers
                    of Edinburgh.</p>
                <p>In 1759, he published, in two volumes quarto, “The History of Scotland during the
                    reigns of Queen Mary, and of King James VI. till his accession to the Crown of
                    England, with a Review of the Scots History previous to that period.” This work,
                    in its structure, is one of the most complete of all modern histories. It is not
                    a dry jejune narrative of events, destitute of ornament; nor is it a mere frothy
                    relation, all glow and colouring. The historian discovers sufficient powers of
                    imagination to engage the reader’s attention, with a due proportion of judgment
                    to check the exuberance of fancy. The arrangement of his work is admirable, and
                    his descriptions are animated. His style is copious, nervous, and correct. He
                    has displayed consummate skill in rendering such passages of our history as are
                    familiar to our recollection agreeable and entertaining. He has embellished old
                    materials with all the elegance of modern dress. He has very judiciously avoided
                    too circumstantial a detail of trite facts. His narratives are succinct and
                    spirited; his reflections copious, frequent, and generally pertinent. His
                    sentiments respecting the guilt of Mary have indeed been warmly controverted by
                    Tytler, Stuart, and Whitaker; and, till the publication of Mr Laing’s
                    Dissertation on the same subject, the general opinion seemed to be that their
                    victory was complete. Dr Robertson was no rancorous or malignant enemy of the
                    unfortunate queen. While relating what he doubtless believed, he makes every
                    possible allowance for Mary from the circumstances in which she was placed; and
                    his history will be read with pleasure by candid men of all parties as long as
                    the language in which it is composed shall continue to be understood.</p>
                <p>In 1769, Dr Robertson published, in three volumes quarto, “The History of the
                    Reign of the Emperor Charles V. with a View of the Progress of Society in Europe
                    from the Subversion of the Roman Empire to the beginning of the sixteenth
                    century.” The vast and general importance of the period which this history
                    comprises, together with the reputation which the historian had deservedly
                    acquired, cooperated to raise such high expectations in the public, that no work
                    perhaps was ever more impatiently expected, or perused with greater avidity. The
                    first volume, which contains an able and eloquent view of the progress of
                    society, is a very valuable part of the work; for it serves not only as a key to
                    the pages that follow, but may be considered as a general introduction to the
                    stu&lt;ly of the history of that period, in which the several powers of Europe
                    were formed into one great political system, in which each took a station, in
                    which it long remained, with less alterations than could have been expected,
                    after the shocks occasioned by so many internal revolutions and so many foreign
                    wars. Of the history itself, it may be sufficient to observe, that it has
                    secured to the author a place among the greatest historians of modern times. It
                    is distinguished by elegance of expression, depth of discernment, and
                    correctness of judgment. The characters are drawn with singular skill. They are
                    not contrasted by a studied antithesis, but by an opposition which results from
                    a very acute and penetrating insight into the real merits of each character,
                    fairly deduced from the several circumstances of his conduct exemplified in the
                    history. For this work the author received L.4500 sterling.</p>
                <p>In 1779, Dr Robertson published “The History of America,” in two volumes quarto.
                    This celebrated work may with great propriety be considered as a sequel to the
                    preceding history. From the close of the fifteenth century we date the most
                    splendid era in the annals of modern times. Discoveries were then made, the
                    influence of which descended to posterity; and events happened that gave a new
                    direction to the spirit of nations. To the inhabitants of Europe, America was in
                    every respect a new world. There the face of the earth changed its appearance.
                    The plants and trees and animals were strange, and nature seemed no longer the
                    same. A continent opened that appeared to have recently come from the hands of
                    the Creator, and which showed lakes, rivers, and mountains on a grander scale,
                    and the vegetable kingdom in greater magnificence, than in the other quarters of
                    the globe, but the animal tribes in a state of degradation, few in number,
                    degenerated in kind, imperfect, and unfinished. The human species in the
                    earliest stage of its progress, vast and numerous nations in the rudest form of
                    the savage state which philosophers have contemplated, and tw <hi
                    rend="superscript">,</hi> o great empires in the lowest degree of civilization
                    which any records have transmitted to our review, presented to the philosophic
                    eye at this period the most fruitful subject of speculation that was to be found
                    in the annals of history. The discovery of the New World, moreover, was not only
                    a curious spectacle to the philosopher, but, by the change which it effected, an
                    interesting spectacle to the human race. When Columbus set sail for unknown
                    lands, he little expected that he was to make a revolution in the system of
                    human affairs, and to influence the future destiny of Europe. The importance and
                    celebrity therefore of the subject bad attracted the attention of philosophers
                    and historians. Views and sketches of the New World had been given by able
                    writers, and splendid portions of the American story had been adorned with all
                    the beauties of eloquence. But previously to the appearance of Dr Robertson’s
                    history, no author had bestowed the mature and profound investigation which such
                    a subject required, or had exhibited that complete narration and perfect whole
                    which it is the province of the historian to transmit to posterity. And as the
                    subject upon which the author entered was grand, his execution was masterly. The
                    character of his former works was immediately discerned in this. They had been
                    read with uncommon admiration. When the History of Scotland was first published,
                    and the author altogether unknown, Lord Chesterfield pronounced it to be equal
                    in eloquence and beauty to the production of Livy, the purest and most classical
                    of all the Roman historians. His literary reputation w as not confined to his
                    own country: the testimony of Europe was soon added to the voice of Britain. It
                    may indeed be mentioned, as the characteristic quality of the author’s manner,
                    that he possessed in no common degree that supported elevation which is suitable
                    to compositions of the higher class; and in his History of America he displayed
                    that happy union of strength and grace which becomes the majesty of the historic
                    muse. In the fourth book of his first volume, which contains a description of
                    America when first discovered, and a philosophical inquiry into the manners and
                    policy of its ancient inhabitants, he displays moreover so much patient
                    investigation and sound philosophy, abounds in such beautiful or interesting
                    description, and exhibits such variety and copiousness of elegant writing, that
                    future times will probably refer to it as that part of his works which gives the
                    best idea of his genius, and is the most finished of all his productions.</p>
                <p>In 1787 appeared a translation of Clavigero’s History of Mexico; in which work
                    the author hazarded various reflections, tending in several instances to impeach
                    the credit of Dr Robertson’s History of America. This attack induced the learned
                    historian to revise his work, and to in<pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=312" xml:id="kp-eb0719-0312-0302"
                    />quire into the truth of the charges brought against it by the historian of New
                    Spain; and this he appears to have done with a becoming attention to the
                    importance of the facts that are controverted, and to the common interests of
                    truth. The result he published in 1788, under the title of “Additions and
                    Corrections to the former Editions of Dr Robertson’s History of America.” In
                    many of the disputed passages, he fully answered Clavigero and vindicated
                    himself; in others he candidly submitted to correction, and thus gave additional
                    value to his own work.</p>
                <p>The literary labours of Dr Robertson appear to have been terminated in 1791, by
                    the publication of “An Historical Disquisition concerning the Knowledge which
                    the Ancients had of India, and the Progress of Trade with that country prior to
                    the Discovery of the Passage to it by the Cape of Good Hope; with an Appendix,
                    containing Observations on the Civil Polity, the Laws, and Judicial Proceedings,
                    the Arts, the Sciences, and Religious Institutions of tbe Indians.” The perusal
                    of Major Rennell’s Memoir, for illustrating his map of Hindustan, suggested to
                    Robertson the design of examining more fully than he had done in his History of
                    America, into the knowledge which the ancients had of India, and of considering
                    what is certain, what is obscure, and what is fabulous, in their accounts of
                    that remote country. Of his various performances, this is not that of which the
                    design is the most extensive, or the execution the most elaborate; but in his
                    historical disquisition we perceive the same patient assiduity in collecting his
                    materials, the same discernment in arranging them, the same perspicuity of
                    narrative, and the same power of illustration, which so eminently distinguish
                    his other writings, and which have long rendered them the delight of the British
                    reader at home, and an honour to British literature abroad.</p>
                <p>His truly useful life was closed on the 11th of June 1793, at Grange-House near
                    Edinburgh, after a lingering illness, which be endured with exemplary fortitude
                    and resignation. He had attained the age of seventy-two. It may be justly
                    observed of him, that no man lived more respected, or died more sincerely
                    lamented. Indefatigable in his literary researches, and possessing from nature a
                    sound and vigorous understanding, he acquired a store of useful knowdedge, which
                    afforded ample scope for the exertion of his extraordinary abilities, and raised
                    him to the most distinguished eminence in the republic of letters. As a minister
                    of the gospel, he was a faithful pastor, and justly merited the esteem and
                    veneration of his flock. In a word, he may be pronounced to be one of the most
                    perfect characters of the age; and his name will be a lasting honour to the
                    island that gave him birth. His conversation was cheerful, entertaining, and
                    instructive; his manners affable, pleasing, and endearing.</p>
                <p>The account of his Life and Writings, published by Mr Dugald Stewart, is one of
                    the noblest pieces of biography that any language can boast of. It was published
                    in a separate form, and likewise accompanies the later editions of his
                    works.</p>
                <p>Dr Robertson left a widow and a numerous family in prosperous circumstances. In
                    1751 he had married Mary the daughter of Mr Nisbet, one of the ministers of
                    Edinburgh, and this domestic union had been productive of much happiness. His
                    eldest son, the late Lord Robertson, was for many years a judge of the Court of
                    Session. Two of his sons belonged to the military profession. His eldest
                    daughter was the wife of Mr Brydone the celebrated traveller, and the mother of
                    the present Countess of Minto. Another daughter married John Russell, Esq.
                    writer to the signet. Lord Brougham is the grandson of Dr Robertson’s
                    sister.</p>
