                <p><label type="entry">FOLARD, <hi rend="smallcaps">Jean-Charles de</hi></label>, a
                    distinguished French officer and military writer, descended of a noble but not
                    affluent family, was born at Avignon on the 13th of February 1669. Even in his
                    infancy he evinced a strong predilection for the profession of arms; and this
                    inclination was confirmed by the perusal of Caesar’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Commentaries,</hi> which he received as a prize at the age of fifteen. In fact,
                    he had scarcely attained his sixteenth year, when, making his escape from the
                    paternal roof, he enlisted iι&gt; a company of infantry which happened to be
                    passing through Avignon; and although his father obtained his discharge, and
                    shut him up in a convent, he again made his escape about two years thereafter,
                    and shouldered a musket as a common soldier in the regiment of Berri. But his
                    good conduct, as well as his birth, having soon brought him into notice, he
                    obtained a sub-lieutenancy; and it was in this grade, the lowest of commissioned
                    officers, that he saw service for the first time in the year 1688. Fortunately
                    for his own improvement, however, he was employed in a corps of partisans,
                    which, as all military men know, is the best school of instruction in great
                    operations. Folard had thus occasion to observe, and to study with advantage,
                    the most important branches of the military art. He examined all the
                    communications, calculated the means of attack and defence, reconnoitred
                    positions, constructed plans and maps, and thus, in short, prepared the
                    materials of his voluminous works. It was during this period that he composed a
                    little treatise entitled <hi rend="italic">De la Guerre de Partisan,</hi> which
                    has never been printed, but which Marshal de Belleisle long possessed in
                    manuscript. The Marquis de Guébriant, colonel of the regiment of Berri, having
                    taken a great interest in Folard, obtained for him a lieutenancy in his
                    regiment; and immediately afterwards this corps received orders to proceed to
                    Naples. It was during the long march which ensued that Folard, observing that
                    the enemy received provisions and ammunition by sea, conceived the idea of
                    surprising the post of Mesola, which protected the landing of the convoys. He
                    accordingly submitted his plan to Μ. de Guébriant, by whom it was forwarded to
                    the court, and there approved of; but another officer was charged with its
                    execution, and the author remained unknown. The Duke of Vendome, being informed
                    of this injustice, appointed Folard his aid-de-camp, and at the same time
                    procured for him the rank of captain. After giving him many proofs of confidence
                    and esteem, this prince reluctantly consented to give up Folard to his brother,
                    the Grand Prior, who then commanded in Lombardy. To the latter, Folard, ever
                    zealous and active, rendered important services; but his talents, and above all
                    his frankness, made him many enemies at head-quarters. He was at the taking of
                    the posts of Rovero and Ostiglia, and also at the defence of the Casino della
                    Bulino, where he distinguished himself greatly by his talents and his valour. It
                    was by his advice that the Grand Prior caused this important post to be
                    occupied; and Folard had, by the orders of his commander, repaired thither to
                    make tie necessary dispositions, when a numerous corps of the army of Prince
                    Eugène appeared before it, with instructions to carry it at all hazards. The <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193754501?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0709-4501-0711"/>
                    defensive preparations were still incomplete, and the garrison far from
                    numerous; but, encouraged by Folard, they withstood the reiterated and furious
                    attacks of the imperialists. The latter penetrated several times into the
                    interior of the Casino; but by the intrepidity of the French, directed by
                    Folard, they were each time repulsed, and ultimately compelled to discontinue
                    their attacks. This brilliant affair, which procured him the cross of St Louis,
                    is described by Folard in the notes to the third volume of his Polybius; and Ids
                    relation has been cited by all military writers, not only as a model in itself,
                    but also as containing one of the best lessons anywhere to be found on the
                    defence of field-posts. Having rejoined the Duke of Vendome, Folard rendered
                    himself not less useful to that commander than he had previously done to the
                    Grand Prior, and by his presence of mind, and the judicious advice which he gave
                    at the battle of Cassano, fought on the 15th of August 1705, where he received
                    two severe wounds, he acquitted himself as a brave soldier and skilful officer.
                    This battle, remarkable for great efforts on both sides, for movements of all
                    kinds, and for uncertain results, appears to have made a strong impression upon
                    the imagination of Folard; and it is even said that amidst the suffering caused
                    by his wounds he conceived his system of columns and deep formations. Soon after
                    the battle of Cassano, Vendome was ordered to proceed to Flanders, whither
                    Folard, who 'was much attached to the duke, wished to accompany him; but he was
                    retained with the army of Italy by the express desire of the Duke of Orleans,
                    who had just assumed the command. The confidence which this prince reposed in
                    him, and the freedom with which Folard continued to express his opinions,
                    careless whom they might offend, once more made him dangerous enemies amongst
                    the staff. From a note to Polybius it appears, indeed, that it was entirely
                    owing to their insinuations that he received orders to shut himself up in
                    Modena. It had become evident that this city would be attacked; and as the
                    command was then in the hands of a person named Bar, upon whom no reliance could
                    be placed, and who, in fact, had resolved to surrender the place at the first
                    summons, the chevalier, firmly resolved to do his duty, soon found himself
                    involved in serious disputes with this cowardly superior in command. In his <hi
                    rend="italic">Traité</hi><hi rend="italic">de la Defense des Places,</hi> he has
                    given a long recital of the indignities he experienced at the hands of this
                    miscreant, who even attempted his life; but although Folard unveiled his
                    proceedings without reserve, the traitor escaped with impunity. Soon after the
                    capitulation of Modena, the chevalier, to his great joy, received orders to join
                    the Duke of Vendome, who had in fact reclaimed his former aid-decamp; and having
                    taken Versailles in his way, he was there presented to the king, who received
                    him graciously, and granted him a pension of four hundred francs. Upon his
                    arrival in Flanders, Folard induced the Duke of Burgundy, then in command of the
                    army, to attack the isle of Cadsand. The enterprise succeeded beyond all
                    calculation, and its author was appointed commandant of the fort of Lettingen.
                    But the young prince, who had at first appreciated the advice of the chevalier,
                    afterwards paid as little regard to his opinions as to those of Vendome; and, in
                    spite of their joint remonstrances, he persisted in remaining inactive in
                    presence of the allies, whilst Prince Eugène was engaged in taking Lille. The
                    counsels which Folard gave to Marshal Villars for the relief of Mons were also
                    disregarded. But his services were nevertheless recognised and appreciated at
                    court; and it was about this time that the minister conferred on him a second
                    pension of six hundred francs; a new favour, which was the more considerate, as
                    he had been once more severely wounded at the battle of Malplaquet. Redoubling
                    his zeal and activity, though no longer able to take part in the movements of
                    the army, Folard followed them on the map and in his imagination, incessantly
                    dreaming of plans and operations, and sending all his ideas to the generals. One
                    day he caused himself be carried on a litter to the quarters of Marshal
                    Bouffiers, to give a piece of advice, which, however, was disregarded. Such zeal
                    was no doubt indiscreet; and the manners of Folard were, it seems, calculated to
                    injure the best observations. Thus Μ. de Montesquieu rejected the advice which
                    the chevalier gave him respecting the position occupied by him at Douai; and it
                    was only after his defeat that this general discovered his error in neglecting
                    the counsels of the uncourtly chevalier. Some months afterwards Folard found
                    Marshal Villars more docile; and he had the satisfaction of seeing the army put
                    in motion, in consequence of a plan which he had transmitted to that general.
                    Having subsequently been sent to Μ. de Guébriant, who occupied Aire, then
                    threatened with a siege, he was taken prisoner on the road by the light troops
                    of the enemy, who made vain attempts to discover the nature of his instructions.
                    Prince Eugène, indeed, had recourse to every means of seduction in order to
                    induce him to enter the service of the emperor; but Folard, immovable in his
                    fidelity, resisted all these attempts, and even found an opportunity during his
                    captivity of serving his sovereign, by misleading the prince as to the
                    operations of the French army. As soon as he was exchanged, which the Duke of
                    Burgundy lost no time in effecting, he obtained the command of the garrison of
                    Burburg, the title and appointment of which he retained until his death.</p>
                <p>The peace of 1712 having left him without active professional employment, Folard
                    commenced his commentaries; but being still of an age not to remain long in a
                    state of inaction, he profited by the alarms which the Ottomans occasioned to
                    the knights of Malta in 1714, and, with the permission of the court, repaired to
                    that island. The grand master received him with much cordiality; but Folard soon
                    gave way to his characteristic vanity and indiscretion towards the French
                    engineers, who, like himself, had come to offer the knights their best services
                    for the defence of the island. Dissatisfied because his opinion had not
                    prevailed, he refused the cross of the order, which was offered him, according
                    to the ordinary usage in such cases, and immediately returned into France. But
                    his warlike activity was not yet exhausted. The fame of the exploits of Charles
                    XII. then resounded throughout all Europe, and Folard eagerly desired to witness
                    the achievements of so celebrated a hero. Accordingly he embarked for Sweden on
                    board a vessel, which was shipwrecked almost at the moment of landing; and
                    having been saved in a sloop, he reached Stockholm destitute of every thing. The
                    king, however, received him favourably, and listened to his discourses upon
                    tactics with extreme complaisance. Nothing could possibly be more agreeable to
                    Folard, who, delighted with his royal pupil, at once preferred Sweden to France
                    as a place of residence for a soldier. Nevertheless he soon afterwards returned
                    into his own country, for the purpose of promoting the plans oí the Baron de
                    Goërtz. But the project with which the baron was entrusted having been
                    overthrown by his arrest, Folard returned to Stockholm, and accompanied the king
                    of Sweden in his expedition to Nonvay. Immediately after the death of Charles
                    before Frederickshall, he returned to France, and was promoted to the rank of
                    colonel in the regiment of Picardy. In this capacity he served his last campaign
                    in 1719, under the Duke of Berwick, in the short war which France had then to
                    maintain in Spain. A general peace speedily ensued, and Folard then saw himself
                    condemned to a state of repose, which as yet he had never known or enjoyed.</p>
                <p>From this time he devoted himself entirely to his literary pursuits, and was ere
                    long in a condition to present to the <pb break="no"

                    Orleans, then regent, his book entitled <hi rend="italic">Nouvelles Découvertes
                    sur la Guerre,</hi> published at Paris in 1724. His next aim was to find a
                    subject with which it might be possible for him to connect the results of his
                    lengthened observations, and also to combine the explanation of his new system.
                    And with this view he made choice of the history of Polybius. That work is,
                    without any doubt, the most exact, and at the same time the most judicious, in a
                    military point of view, of all the historical writings of antiquity; and hence
                    Folard could not possibly have made a better choice. But not being acquainted
                    with Greek, he was obliged to entrust the translation to Dorn Thuillier, whilst
                    he simultaneously laboured at his commentaries, which he placed in the form of
                    notes at the end of each chapter of Polybius. These commentaries are of an
                    unexampled prolixity, and the style frequently descends to triviality; in the
                    same page things the most incoherent are often jumbled together; and he makes
                    continual efforts to connect everything with his system of columns and deep
                    formations. But however imperfect the work of Folard may be considered in a
                    literary point of view, military men will find it in many respects eminently
                    useful; for, besides judicious remarks and learned researches respecting the
                    wars of the ancients, we meet with much valuable information, which we cannot
                    help regretting that the historians of this period should not have oftener
                    referred to. He explains the causes and the results of these events with a
                    frankness which was often hurtful to himself, but which will always be useful to
                    posterity. This frankness, indeed, which had raised up so many obstacles to his
                    advancement whilst he had arms in his hands, also created opposition to his
                    projects after he became author. When he had reached the sixth volume of his
                    Polybius he was ordered to refrain from indulging in the same sort of
                    discussions as in the preceding portion of the work. Of this injunction he
                    complains bitterly in the preface to the volume in question, and says that he
                    has been restrained precisely at the place where his author became more
                    interesting, and where he felt himself inspired by events more worthy of remark
                    and annotation.</p>
                <p>Folard has prefixed to this immense work his <hi rend="italic">Treatise on
                    Columns,</hi> and the deep order, which he regards as the basis of all good
                    tactics. His opinion in favour of deep formations encountered much opposition at
                    the time when it was first promulgated, and the controversy which it then
                    occasioned has not yet been altogether set to rest. The most judicious of his
                    critics was General Savornin, a Swiss officer in the service of Holland, who
                    published anonymously <hi rend="italic">Les Sentiments ď</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    the greatest respect in the prefaces to his volumes, which, as is well known, he
                    converted into a sort of field of battle, where he attacked <hi rend="italic">à
                    outrance</hi> those who had ventured to dispute his opinions. But the best part
                    of the commentaries on Polybius is undoubtedly that where Folard treats of the
                    tactics of the ancients, and particularly of their manner of attacking and
                    defending strong places. This is a subject which he had maturely considered,
                    with reference to the instruments of war in use amongst the ancients. He had
                    even caused to be constructed a catapult, the experiments made with which
                    transported him with admiration; and he did not hesitate to affirm, that if it
                    were possible for him, with the machines and means of the ancients, to attack a
                    place defended by the artillery of the moderns, he would make sure of taking it
                    in a very short time. Such an assertion, it may very easily be imagined, was
                    much better calculated to astonish than convince. His ideas on strategics were
                    scarcely, if at all, less extraordinary; and his system of columns and deep
                    formations will be sufficiently appreciated if we consider that, in the numerous
                    wars which have occurred since its publication, there is no sovereign nor
                    general who has deigned to put it fully in practice. It must be admitted,
                    however, that attacks in close columns, which have been so generally and so
                    successfully employed in our time, are in some sort an imitation of Folarďs
                    system. This method no doubt proves that the deep order is sometimes the best;
                    but attacks in close columns, by platoons, divisions, or battalions, such as
                    have latterly been practised, present advantages which Folard had never dreamed
                    of, namely, the power of deploying if necessary, of changing the front and
                    direction of the mass with extreme facility, and of passing rapidly from the
                    deep to the extended, and from the extended to the deep formation.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>“In general the formations of
                    a good military nation are extended, whilst those ofa bad one are deep.” So says

                    transi.); and the remark is undoubtedly well founded. At the same time, the
                    diminution of depth in the formation of modem armies has been a natural
                    consequence of the constantly augmenting power of artillery and of small arms.
                    In ancient times battles were generally decided by bodily strength; and as
                    armies had then no concentric fire to apprehend, they could with safety assume
                    that deep formation which was calculated .to overwhelm the enemy by impulsion
                    alone. But the invention of gunpowder, and the destructive effects of cannon
                    fire, arising from the improvement of artillery, necessitated in modern times a
                    departure from the dense formations of antiquity. This was strongly felt by
                    Gustavus Adolphus, who, whilst his opponents, Tilly and wallenstein, formed
                    their infantry in solid masses, drew up bis men six deep, and, in this extended
                    formation, overwhelmed the columns ofhis adversaries. If we may judge from
                    recent examples, however, deep formations are not even now so inappropriate as
                    may be imagined; and, absurd as the columns of Folard may appear, it was by the
                    employment of analogous masses, directed with a celerity which at once increased
                    their momentum and diminished the ravages of cannon fire, that Napoleon proved
                    so often successful. In the order of battle laid down by Jomini as combining in
                    the greatest degree mobility with solidity, the corps destined for the attack
                    are arranged in two lines of battalions, each battalion being formed in column
                    of grand ilivisions. “La troupe ďattaque,” says he, “aussi bien que la réserve,
                    ne sauraient être mieux disposées qu’en colonnes d’attaque par la centre; car la
                    réserve, devant être prête à tomber sur l'ennemi au moment décisif, doit la
                    faire avec force et vivacité, c’est-a-dire, en colonnes.” <hi rend="italic"

                    generally attacked with deployed lines; hut these, it is to be observed, were
                    sometimes of deep formation. The body of English guards which so successfully
                    attacked the columns of the imperial guard at the close of the battle of
                    waterloo was formed four deep; and the final charge <hi rend="italic">en
                    muraille</hi> executed by the British line on that day was also made in the same
                    formation. It is to be observed, however, that the columns of the imperial guard
                    were tom up and shattered by a close concentric fire of artillery, betöre the
                    English guards advanced to the attack. To this indeed columnar formations are
                    always more or less exposed; for though the evil may be lessened by celerity of
                    movement, it cannot be avoided, and a rapid advance is always of itself
                    productive of some confusion and disorder. Hence the attack in column has by no
                    means been attended with the results which the Chevalier Folard expected from
                    it. The Duke of wellington always deployed before battle, and at Waterloo
                    defeated an army drawn up in columns of attack, this being one of the few
                    instances where his lines exceeded the usual formation of two deep. The French
                    lost the battle of Essling by attacking the centre of the Austrian line in
                    column. Λ!assena’s columns failed at Busaco; victor’s were battled at Barossa;
                    and even the spaniards broke two columns of the French arp&gt;y at St Marcial.
                    At Waterloo, again, the repeated advances of Napoleon’s columns proved
                    unavailing against the linear formation of the British; and although at the
                    close of the day the chosen columns of the imperial guard advanced with a
                    determined bravery which would have done honour to the troops of any nation,
                    they had no better success. These facts naturally shake our faith in columns,
                    and serve to confirm the remark of Bismark, that the formations of the best
                    military nations are not deep, but extended. An undisciplined multitude suddenly
                    drawn together, or an army possessing little moral force, may be appalled by the
                    imposing appearance of <pb corresp="kp-eb0709-4527-0713" xml:id="pbn7713"/> a
                    column advancing to the attack, and give way from apprehension; but no such
                    effect can be produced where courage and discipline are found united. This was
                    signally exemplified at Λlbuera, where, in the attack on the key of the
                    position, the French columns, though momentarily successful, found it impossible
                    to deploy, under the incessant and dreadful vollies, which swept away the head
                    of every formation, and, after a desperate and unavailing struggle, were driven
                    headlong down the ascent.. Every order is good against troops who do not defend
                    themselves; in that case it is only necessary to march. But against troops who
                    do defend themselves, and who to natural courage unite that discipline which
                    teaches them to preserve unshaken the stability of their order, the attack in
                    column will seldom prevail, unless combined with extended formations. As much,
                    however, may be said on both sides, many writers have been led to maintain
                    extreme opinions on the subject, as the following passage, extracted from a very
                    ingenious essay on tactics, will abundantly testify. “The victories gained by
                    the natural gallantry and intelligence of the French soldiers, in spite of the
                    system under which they were supposed to fight, gave military opinion a bias in
                    favour of masses and solid formations, simply disgraceful to human
                    understanding, at a time when hundreds of pieces of artillery already frowned
                    destruction over every field of battle. Nothing but the most profound ignorance
                    of every principle of professional science, as well as the most callous
                    indifference to the lives and sufferings of men, could for a moment have
                    tolerated a system that tended to eradicate from the heart every feeling of
                    humanity, and to stifle military genius in the bud. It was well calculated for
                    ignorant, grasping, and ambitious leaders; it enabled such men, in the absence
                    of military talents, to gain battles by quenching with the blood of their own
                    soldiers the fires of the enemy, and literally to overwhelm the foe with the
                    mangled bodies of the human victims so lavishly placed at their di», posai by
                    ruthless ukases and conscriptions.” (Mitchell's <hi rend="italic">Enay on

                    infected with his system and his discoveries, that he saw everywhere the deep
                    order and columns of attack. He had read little of the Bible; but happening one
                    day to take up that sacred book, he exclaimed, on reading the first page, “Do
                    you know that Moses must have been a great captain. He has discovered my
                    column.”</p>
                <p>Count Saxe, who had known Folard in Sweden, appears to have attached much
                    importance to his opinions. The esteem which that able commander entertained for
                    him may be judged of from hi» letters, some of which are subjoined to the work
                    entitled <hi rend="italic">Mémoires pour servir à</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Γ</hi><hi rend="italic">Histoire de Μ. le Chevalier de Folard,</hi> Paris,
                    1753. Fo)ard was a good engineer, and excelled both in drawing and in the
                    construction of military plans. It was from designs by him that the Abbé Gédoyn
                    was enabled to give the plans of the different battles in his translation of
                    Pausanias. Folard has been denominated the French Vegetius; but he himself would
                    not have been much flattered by this tide, as he often speaks with contempt of
                    Vegetius. As he cites a great number of ancient authors, he has often rectified
                    their text, which had been altered by the copyists; and he has also sometimes
                    indicated mistakes in the translations of their works. The publication of his
                    Polybius procured him a great reputation in Europe, and was soon followed by his
                    admission into the Royal Society of London. The king of Prussia, Frederick the
                    Great, having desired to make trial of his system, the chevalier was invited to
                    repair to Berlin, to be a witness of the experiment; but his advanced age
                    prevented him from undertaking so long a journey. Nevertheless this warlike
                    monarch attached but little importance to the writings of Folard, which he has
                    even treated as visionary and extravagant in several passages of his
                    correspondence, and particularly in the volume which he caused to be printed in
                    1761, under the title of <hi rend="italic">L'Esprit</hi><hi rend="italic">du
                    Chevalier de Folard,</hi> in 8vo. In the preface to this compilation, Frederick
                    says, “Il (Folard) avait enfoui des diamants, au milieu du fumier; nous les
                    avons retirés. On a fait main basse sur le système des colonnes: on n’a conservé
                    que les manoeuvres de guerre, dont il donne une description juste; la critique
                    sage qu’il emploie sur la conduite de quelques généraux Français, certaines
                    règles de tactique, des exemples de defenses singulières et ingénieuses, et
                    quelques projets qui fournissent matière à des réflexions plus utiles encores
                    que ces projets mêmes.” Such was the opinion of the greatest captain of his time
                    respecting the writings of Folard. The literary labours of this tactician
                    impaired his health more rapidly than the fatigues of war, which, indeed, appear
                    to have made little or no impression on his constitution. Wishing once more to
                    visit his native city, Folard repaired to Avignon in 1750, and died there on the
                    23d of March 1752, at the advanced age of eighty-three.</p>
                <p>This able warrior failed to attain the first rank in the army, though he had
                    eagerly aspired to it; nevertheless he was content with his lot; and with a
                    small patrimony, and some pensions which had been granted him by the king, he
                    found means to do good. His last years would have been perfectly happy if he had
                    not recklessly disturbed their serenity by throwing himself <hi rend="italic"
                    >à</hi><hi rend="italic">corps perdu</hi> into an imprudent controversy, where,
                    from his great irascibility and excessive self-love, he often furnished arms
                    against himself. Another circumstance also served to embitter his declining
                    days. Having allowed himself to be drawn into the party of the Appellants, as
                    they were called, he was represented by the pamphleteers of the time as one of
                    those who had given themselves up to visionary convulsions upon the tomb of
                    Deacon Paris. The new sect was of course delighted to be able to refer to such
                    evidence in support of its absurd pretensions; and it is easy to conceive the
                    ridicule which this must have drawn down on the old chevalier. The Cardinal de
                    Fleury was in fact so much displeased with him that he ordered Folard to quit
                    Paris; and it was only at the earnest entreaty of several generals, who bore
                    testimony to his numerous and important services, that this order was recalled.
                    During his whole life Folard had enjoyed the most robust health. But a single
                    infirmity afflicted him from his youth, and increased with his age; we mean, a
                    natural deafness, which had often nearly proved fatal to him in the field of
                    battle. In his old age he was almost entirely destitute of the sense of
                    hearing.</p>
                <p>Folard’s military opinions, which had excited so much discussion during his
                    lifetime, occasioned a great deal more long after his death. His system of

                    his critics. The commentaries on Polybius have been abridged and printed
                    separately by Chabot, Paris, 1757, in three vols. 4to. There are two German
                    translations, one printed at Berlin, and the other at Vienna. The observations
                    on the battle of Zama, and on the history of Epaminondas, which had been
                    published separately in 1738 and 1739, form part of the commentaries on
                    Polybius; and, as already stated, the author has also combined with these
                    commentaries his <hi rend="italic">Traité de la Colonne,</hi> as well as that on
