                <p><label type="entry">FABRICIUS, <hi rend="smallcaps">George</hi></label>, a Latin
                    poet and historian, was born at Kemnitz, in Germany, on the 24th April 1516. He
                    began his studies in his native place, and completed them at Freyberg and at
                    Leipsic, where he was preceptor to Wolfgang, and also to Philip and Antony
                    Werter. He travelled into Italy with the elder of his pupils, and on his return
                    to Germany in 1553, was appointed director of the college of Meissen, where he
                    died on the 13th July 1571. In his poetical compositions, which obtained for
                    their author considerable distinction, he aftected not to employ any word which
                    had the slightest flavour of paganism; and he blamed those poets who had in
                    their works introduced the pagan divinities. All that he wrote on the history of
                    his country is, in the judgment of Niceron, estimable for research and accuracy;
                    and Lenglet Dufresnoy pronounces a similar opinion. The following list includes
                    the principal works which he published, either as author or as editor: 1. <hi

                    having been a native of the episcopal city of that name, in Italy, where he was
                    born in 1537. His parents, though poor, were desirous to give their son an
                    excellent education, and with this view sent him to Padua, where the young
                    Fabricius soon found powerful protectors to assist in the cultivation of his
                    talents. After completing his course of philosophy, he applied himself to
                    medicine, which he studied under the celebrated Fallopius, and soon became the
                    most distinguished pupil of that learned professor, whom he afterwards
                    succeeded. Fallopius having died in 1562, Fabricius, then only twenty-five years
                    of age, was at first employed merely to give anatomical demonstrations; but he
                    discharged this duty with so much zeal and ability that, in 1565, he was
                    formally promoted to the chair of surgery, whilst that of anatomy, which had
                    hitherto been considered as merely a dependence or accessory of the other, was
                    declared primary in favour of Fabricius, to whom were also assigned very
                    considerable appointments. And to these preferments the senators of Venice added
                    the highest distinctions which it was in their power to bestow. They granted him
                    privileges not less extraordinary than flattering, gave him precedence of the
                    professors of philosophy, named him citizen of Padua, honoured him with a statue
                    and a gold chain, decorated him with the order of knight of St Mark, constructed
                    a superb anatomical theatre for his accommodation, and assigned him a liberal
                    retired allowance, with the right of naming his successor. Fabricius practised
                    his profession with much dignity and with rare disinterestedness. Persons of
                    high rank, who were indebted to him for the re-establishment of their health,
                    made up by rich presents for the fees which the generous physician refused; and
                    these Fabricius collected in a cabinet, on the door of which he caused to be
                    inscribed the words <hi rend="italic">Lucri neglecti</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >lucrum.</hi> He possessed a beautiful country-house, situated on the delightful
                    banks of the Brenta, and still known by the name of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Moηtogηuola d' Acquapendente,</hi> where, sound in body and mind, loaded with
                    riches, generally esteemed, and enjoying a brilliant reputation, he calculated
                    on spending a happy old age. But his expectations were cruelly disappointed, and
                    his repose was disturbed by envy and ingratitude. It is even said that he was
                    sometimes obliged to employ the knife for other purposes than surgical
                    operations and dissections. Relations on whom he had never ceased to lavish
                    favours, unworthily betrayed his confidence, and are suspected, not without
                    reason, of having abridged his days by means of poison. Having attained the age
                    of cighty-two, he dicd suddenly in an agony of vomiting, on the 21st May 1619,

                    of the different treatises, which Bohn had unaccountably suppressed. All the
                    writings of Fabricius are truly classical, and fully jug. tify the high
                    reputation of their author. His style is pure, and even elegant; the language of
                    Hippocrates was as familiar to him as that of Celsus; and lucid order pervades
                    all his writings. In regularity of plan and clear luminous method he is
                    unsurpassed, <hi rend="superscript"> ii</hi> On a reproché à ce grand chirurgien
                    trop de timidité dans l’exercice de son art, et pourtant nous le voyons,” says
                    his French biographer, “pratiquer et perfectionner le trépan, employer avec
                    autant de hardiesse que de talent le bistouri, l’aiguille, le trois-quarts, la
                    rugine et même le fer rouge, quoiqu en dise Severino. Haller, qui, certes, ne le
                    juge pas avec bienveillance, est forcé de lui rendre justice sur ces divers
                    points.” In a word, Fabricius was one of the greatest ornaments of the
                    university of Padua, and one of the most celebrated anatomists and surgeons of
                    the sixteenth century. <hi rend="smallcaps">(a.)</hi><hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Fabricius,</hi><hi rend="italic">John Albert,</hi> one of the most learned,
                    laborious, and useful of bibliographers, was born at Leipsic on the 11th of
                    November 1668. He lost his mother in 1674, and five years afterwards his father,
                    Werner Fabricius, director of music in the church of St Paul at Leipsic, and
                    author of several works, particularly <hi rend="italic">Delicioe</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Harmoniere,</hi> published in 1657. The subject of this notice
                    commenced his studies under his father, who, on his deathbed, recommended him to
                    the care of Valentine Alberti. He studied during five years under Wencelaz Buhl,
                    then for some time under Ĵ. S. Herrichen; and, in 1684, he was sent to
                    Quedlinburg, there to continue his studies under Samuel Schmidt. From this
                    period the <hi rend="italic">Adversaria</hi> oí Barthius formed his delight; and
                    when, in 1687, he saw the first volume of Morhof’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Polyhistor,</hi> the desire which he had already felt of devoting himself to
                    letters greatly increased. Having returned to Leipsic in 1686, he was the same
                    year admitted bachelor in philosophy, and, in the beginning of 1688, he took the
                    degree of master in the same faculty; soon after which he published his first
                    work, consisting of only one sheet in quarto. He then applied himself to the
                    study of medicine, which, however, he relinquished for that of theology; and
                    having gone to Hamburg in 1693, he proposed to travel into several countries,
                    when the unexpected and not very agreeable information which now reached him,
                    that the expense of his education had absorbed his whole patrimony, and even
                    left him in debt to his trustee, forced him to abandon his project. He therefore
                    remained at Hamburg, where J. F. Mayer employed him in the capacity of
                    librarian. In 1696 he accompanied his patron to Sweden, and, on his return to
                    Hamburg, not long afterwards, he competed for the chair oflogιc and philosophy.
                    The suffrages being equally divided between Fabricius and Sebastian Edzardi, one
                    of his opponents, recourse was had to chance, which decided in favour ofEdzardi;
                    butin 1699 Fabricius succeeded Vincent Flaccius in the chair of eloquence and
                    practical philosophy, after which he took the degree of doctor in theology at
                    Kiel. From 1692 to 1697 he had preached regularly every Friday; but after he
                    received his appointment of professor, he devoted the greater part of his time
                    to the duties of that office. In 1701, J. F. Mayer having established himself at
                    Greifswald, caused the chair of theology in that city to be offered to
                    Fabricius, who, however refused it on account of his health. But in 1708 he ha
                    accepted the situation of professor of theology, logic, an metaphysics, and was
                    preparing to enter on his new oπιce, when the senate of Hamburg induced him to
                    remain, by adding to his charge as professor that of rector oí t <hi

                    father-in-law, Schultz, whom Fabricius was very willing to assist in the
                    discharge of his duties. Schultz died in 1709, but Fabricius retained the
                    rectorship two years longer. In 1719 the landgrave of Hesse Cassel made him so
                    advantageous an offer, that Fabricius was on the point of accepting it; but this
                    time also the magistrates, by a seasonable increase of salary, prevailed on him
                    to remain amongst them. An attempt was subsequently made to draw him to
                    Wittenberg. But Fabricius refused to listen to the proposals which were made to
                    him, and died at Hamburg on the 30th of April 1736. Besides the time which he
                    had devoted to the duties of his office, Fabricius spent a considerable portion
                    in maintaining an extensive correspondence, and in receiving the visits of
                    foreigners; but he was so laborious that he was nevertheless the author of a
                    great number of works, the list of which, according to Niceron and Reimar,
                    includes as many as a hundred and twentyeight. It will be sufficient here,
                    however, to indicate the most remarkable of these, which are, 1. <hi

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Fabricius,</hi><hi rend="italic">Vincent,</hi> born at
                    Hamburg on the 13th of eptember 1612, studied at Leyden, and there took his <hi
                    rend="superscript"> e</hi> S&gt;ees in medicine in 1634. He had already made
                    himself known by his talent for Latin poetry; and two years befoιe this, had
                    published a collection of verses, at the solicitation of his friend and patron
                    Daniel Heinsius. He t ιen applied himself to the study of law, in which his
                    progress was not less rapid than it had been in the other sciences, and in due
                    time he became a learned civilian. 1he bishop of Lubec conferred on him the
                    title of counsellor, with suitable appointments; but he did not hold this
                    situation for any length of time; and having established himself with his family
                    at Dantzic, he was soon afterwards named syndic, and then burgomaster, of that
                    city. The knowledge which he had acquired of the interests of the republic, and
                    the talent for public speaking which he displayed upon occasions of importance,
                    caused him to be thirteen times returned by the senate as their deputy to the
                    Polish diet. He died at Warsaw, during one of the sessions of that body, on the
                    11th September 1667. The first edition of the poems of Fabricius appeared at
                    Leyden in 1632; and the second, corrected and augmented by the author, in 1638.
                    But his son, Frederic Fabricius, published a third at Leipsic, 1685, in 8vo,
                    containing several pieces which had been omitted in the preceding editions,
                    besides the <hi rend="italic">Harangues</hi> pronounced by him in the Polish
                    diet, a discourse <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Obsidione et
                    Liberatione urbis Leidensis,</hi> delivered at Leyden in 1632, and the medical
                    theses maintained by him in the same city.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Fabricius,</hi><hi rend="italic">John-Christian,</hi> the
                    most celebrated entomologist of the eighteenth century, was born at Tundern, in
                    the duchy of Sleswick, in 1742. After having completed his studies, at the age
                    of twenty, he repaired to the university of Upsal, to attend the prelections of
                    Linnaeus. How long he remained there is uncertain. But no pupil was ever more
                    indebted to the lessons of his master than Fabricius. All his works on
                    entomology, which have secured to him a well-merited reputation, indicate the
                    precepts, the method, and even the forms of Linnaeus, applied to the development
                    of a single new idea, not more fortunate in conception than fruitful in its
                    consequences. Far from disguising the obligations which he owed to his master,
                    Fabricius delighted to expatiate on the happy moments which he had passed in the
                    society of Linnaeus; and the grateful scholar has transmitted to us those
                    biographical details, which are not only the most interesting in themselves, but
                    at the same time best fitted to give us an insight into the character of the
                    great naturalist. It was in studying under the latter that Fabricius conceived
                    the idea of his system, and formed the project of his labours on insects. The
                    first insect s mouth which he dissected was that of a cockchafer <hi
                    rend="italic">(scarabaeus</hi><hi rend="italic">stridulus)</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi> he showed it to Linnaeus, with the description he had made of it, and
                    proposed to him to employ the organs of the mouth, in order to establish the
                    characters of insects, in the new edition of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Systema</hi><hi rend="italic">Naturae</hi> which Linnaeus was then preparing.
                    The latter encouraged his pupil to pursue this course, but refused to enter on
                    it himself, because, as he said, he was too old to change his method. Forced to
                    choose a profession, Fabricius studied medicine, and at the age of twenty-five
                    took the degree of doctor in physic; but being soon afterwards appointed
                    professor of natural history in the university of Kiel, he devoted himsclŕ
                    entirely to his favourite pursuits, and, in 1775, published his system of
                    entomology. This work gave anew aspect to the science. Swammerdam and Ray had
                    classed insects according to their metamorphoses; Lister, Linnaeus, and
                    Geoffroy, according to the organs of motion; and some entomologists, as Reaumur,
                    Scopoli, and even Linnaeus himself, had employed the nutritive organs in order
                    to characterize distinctively certain genera. But before the time of Fabricius
                    no one had thought of makiner these <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193751420?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0709-1420-0474"/> the basis of a
                    general classification. This idea was at once new and bold, and the author
                    evolved it with singular ability. In a second work, which he published two years
                    afterwards, he developed the characters of the classes and genera, showing in
                    the preface the advantages of his method, and, at the same time, excusing its
                    inconveniences. Lastly, in 1778, he published <hi rend="italic">Entomological
                    Philosophy,</hi> in imitation of the <hi rend="italic">Botanical Philosophy</hi>
                    oí Linnaeus; and from this period till his death, that is, during the space of
                    more than thirty years, he was incessantly occupied in extending his system,
                    which he reproduced under different forms in the various works which, from tiπfe
                    to time, he gave to the world. But in proportion as the number of species
                    increased, the characters of the <hi rend="italic">genera,</hi> and even of the
                    classes, became more and more uncertain and arbitrary; and, with reference to
                    this fundamental point, his later wa itings are perhaps inferior to those which
                    preceded them. The basis which he had assumed was excellent; but it could only
                    conduct him to a <hi rend="italic">natural method,</hi> not, as he supposed, to
                    a <hi rend="italic">system</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and this misconception
                    led him to neglect other considerations which would have furnished more exact
                    means of classification. Fabricius had a very extensive knowledge of botany, and
                    of the other branches of natural history. He had been appointed counsellor of
                    state to the king of Denmark, and professor of rural and political economy, in
                    which capacity he published, in German and in Danish, several useful works,
                    though much less celebrated than those which appeared from his pen on the
                    subject of entomology. Fabricius died in 1807, at the age of sixty-five, of a
                    melancholic affection, produced, as is alleged, by the bombardment of
                    Copenhagen. The following is a list of his works: 1. <hi rend="italic"
