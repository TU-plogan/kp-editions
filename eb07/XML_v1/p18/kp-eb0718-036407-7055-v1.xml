                <p><label type="entry">POOR-LAWS</label>.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Until</hi> very recently, the great interest felt in the
                    body of laws comprehended under the above title, was derived from the
                    consciousness of the danger with which the manner of their administration in
                    England threatened the property of the rich, and the morality of the whole
                    people. As the law continues fundamentally the same as it was before the
                    adoption of an improved administration, that source of interest in these
                    institutions remains; but the present sense of security renders possible a
                    calmer and more dispassionate examination of their merits and demerits than
                    could previously to the year 1834 have been made by the most candid persons
                    acquainted with the rapid progress of the evils of the system.</p>
                <p>It was generally, and is now frequently, assumed by English writers, that a legal
                    system of compulsory relief to the poor was peculiar to the polity of England.
                    No assumption could be less justified by the facts, as will presently be shown.
                    Wherever inquiry has been made, it has been found that the same objects as were
                    sought by the institution in England have been sought by means which more
                    strictly resemble those adopted in England, in proportion as the condition of
                    the community resembles that of England in the complexity of its social
                    relations, and the progress of its legal polity.</p>
                <p>So general an adoption of analogous institutions amongst independent communities
                    was, of course, not fortuitous, nor the mere result of imitation; and these
                    institutions are everywhere of too distinct and recent an origin to be traceable
                    to any of the primitive laws or customs of those people who have descended from
                    one common race.</p>
                <p>On the contrary, it was the development of the like evils in the progress of the
                    civilization of each country which suggested the adoption of the like remedy.
                    The evils, which were sufficient to induce nations to try a remedy so obviously
                    fraught with great dangers both to the givers and to the receivers, and
                    requiring sacrifices so immediate and so incapable of disguise, appear to have
                    been at least as pressing elsewhere as in England. The description of these
                    evils shows that they were and must be of universal prevalence, and that they
                    have their origin in the constitution of mankind, and not in any such incidents
                    as the dissolution of monasteries, or in any other local or temporary
                    incident.</p>
                <p>There never was a time or place in which there were not to be found men anxious
                    to avoid labour, and yet to live in ease and enjoyment. There never was a time
                    in which other men were not, from their sympathy, from their superstition, and
                    from their fears, ready with thcir bounty to assist the necessitous, and liable
                    to be imposed upon and intimidated, according as the beggar was crafty or bold.
                    No community is so poor as not to suffer in some degree from the existence of a
                    body of idle and worthless persons, subsisting profligately on the benevolence,
                    the folly, or the fears of its members.</p>
                <p>And as the condition of the people is found to improve, as progress is made in
                    the arts and commodities of life, there is, of course, found a greater disparity
                    in the condition of the people, and destitution more violently contrasted with
                    opulence. Such a state of things, whilst it increases the means at the disposal
                    of the benevolent and fortunate, increases the sympathy with the unfortunate, or
                    those who appear to be so, and at the same time presents wealth iu such masses
                    as to serve as a temptation to those who may prefer to live by fraud or
                    violence. Mendicancy and depredation, which are nearly impossible where a
                    population is scattered, and its moveable wealth in small quantity, become easy
                    in the contrary state of things.</p>
                <p>It is accordingly found, in the progress of the civilization of every country,
                    that a period arrives when beggary in its many forms, and with its whole train
                    of consequences, appears in an alarming extent, usually even professed by large
                    fraternities having some character of organization; sometimes connected by
                    religious profession, like palmers, pilgrims, and various orders of mendicant
                    friars, faquirs, dervishes; sometimes connected by supposed identity of race, as
                    the people known throughout the continent of Europe, and largely in Asia, as
                    Zingari, Gypseys, Bohemians: these, with the unfortunate and dissolute of all
                    classes, find a means of living by practising various arts of amusement, and
                    more frequently by operating on the superstitious credulity, and often on the
                    fears, of the more wealthy and industrious part of the community. All accounts
                    of such a state of things, wherever it may have prevailed, agree in showing that
                    predatory habits almost invariably accompany, where occasion offers, the habit
                    of mendicancy.</p>
                <p>Great as were the evils obviously connected with the existence of such a mass of
                    idlers, impostors, and depredators, there were not wanting motives to the other
                    classes to perpetuate and increase the evil. Individual benevolence, even where
                    accompanied by intelligence and prudence, although its objects may be
                    immediately selected from the really unfortunate, would not withhold its
                    indirect aid to this bad effect, its respectable example seducing many to
                    imitate the act, without using the due precautions.</p>
                <p>But a much greater share of the effect must always be attributed to the
                    incautious benevolence of the great mass of those who have the power to give. It
                    requires great knowledge and sagacity to distinguish the cases in which alms can
                    be given without directly encouraging idleness, or <pb break="no"

                    vice; and to direct these qualities effectively to each application would, in
                    the state of things described, require an amount of industry, and an expenditure
                    of time, seldom or never possible. The ignorance and indolence, therefore, of
                    the benevolent, afford the largest encouragements to the idle. Other influences
                    are not wanting, especially ostentation and the love of popularity, which, where
                    many live in idleness, never fail to create dependents and retainers to the full
                    extent of the power or the will to maintain them. Superstition, too, has in all
                    times enforced almsgiving as a virtue, and, operating upon the consciences of
                    great criminals, has throughout the world created and endowed the largest and
                    most magnificent of the so-called charities.</p>
                <p>In the above description will be recognised a state of things partially
                    exemplified, either in one set of its details or in another, in every country in

                    states, Ireland, and other countries, no public or well-controlled and
                    systematic provision for the poor has been established.<note anchored="true"

                <p>These observations will be well instanced in England during the progress of the

                <p>CHAPTER I.</p>
                <p>GENERAL OBJECTIONS TO PUBLIC RELIEF AND TO PRIVATE ALMS-GIVING.</p>
                <p>The fact was adverted to in the beginning of this article, that the existing
                    state of the poor-laws enables us to take a more dispassionate view of the
                    abstract merits and defects of a system of public relief than was formerly
                    possible.</p>
                <p>Hitherto the question has been embarrassed by the consciousness of the evils
                    which we were suffering, and of those towards which we were visibly making a
                    rapid progress. On the other hand, the evils of general mendicancy, and the
                    other painful and dangerous circumstances which are everywhere found to prevail
                    where a public law of relief has not been established, are so little known in
                    England, from whence our poor-laws have long excluded them, that little of the
                    good really derived from our poor-laws was acknowledged, whilst the whole of
                    their positive mischief was so apparent as to form almost alone the matter of
                    every discussion of the merits of the system.</p>
                <p>Before great accumulations of moveable wealth have taken place in any community,
                    depredation to any large extent is scarcely possible, and mendicancy as a trade
                    cannot be followed in such a community, especially where its population is
                    widely scattered. Alms-giving, in the usual sense of the term, does not exist;
                    but its place is often supplied by hospitality to the stranger and traveller,
                    and by the readiness to share with friends or relatives the means of enjoyment
                    which individuals may possess. But in countries where comparatively great
                    accumulations of wealth have taken place, and where poor-laws have not been
                    introduced, or where, as in Ireland, they have not taken root, alms-giving and
                    begging are either avowedly permitted or connived at. And, for reasons hereafter
                    to be shown, the alternative of a regulated system of <hi rend="italic">public
                    relief,</hi> or the practical permission, whether avowed or not, to solicit <hi
                    rend="italic">private alms,</hi> appears inevitable.</p>
                <p>It would be an evasion of the question to compare a well-devised system of
                    poor-laws with a system in which almsgiving was to be substituted. It is
                    necessary, in order to do full justice to the comparison, to assume a system of
                    poor-laws fraught with all the evils known to be derivable from such a system,
                    and administered with a degree of laxity not less than that of which we have had
                    a practical experience. A system of public relief may be bad in principle, and
                    yet judiciously administered; or it may be good in its principle, and ill
                    administered. For the present purpose, a system shall be assumed, bad in its
                    principle and bad in its administration.</p>
                <p>In this view, the law may give a claim to all persons not having means of
                    independent subsistence, to be relieved, without subjecting the claimant to any
                    harsh or disagreeable condition. Such a claim, though never in fact countenanced
                    by the law, was practically allowed for above a quarter of a century in many
                    parts of England. A law of this kind would obviously render all those who by
                    their exertions could at the utmost earn but a bare subsistence, averse to
                    industry, which in such a case would be a sacrifice of ease without any
                    increased advantage. If present industry were rendered useless, so would thrift
                    and forethought become a folly, an abandonment of present enjoyment without an
                    object. Every present indulgence which the law allowed would wisely be enjoyed;
                    good moral habits and bodily skill would have little merit if the law should
                    place those with them and those without them in the enjoyment of the like
                    benefits. What appears desirable for a man’s advantage, it is a virtue in him to
                    do also for his progeny. The paupers’ children would be themselves paupers, and
                    the law would present to them every inducement to beget other paupers, and no
                    inducement to refrain. Such we have seen the English pauper, slothful,
                    thoughtless but of his parish pay, sometimes living to see three generations of
                    his progeny paupers, like to or worse than himself.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See Extracts from evidence received by the
                    Commissioners of Inquiry: “We have cases of three generations of paupers,” p.
                    204. See at p. 218 an amusing instance of three generations of the same stock
                    contemporaneously relieved, at the rate of L. 100 per year, by a parish; see
                    also pp. 220, 228, 358.</p></note></p>
                <p>But the idle pauper cannot be supported except from those funds which must
                    otherwise employ and reward the industrious. Every pauper, for his support,
                    consumes that which would maintain or nearly maintain an industrious labourer;
                    with this difference, that the consumption of the pauper is never repaid, whilst
                    the value of the labourer’s consumption is always reproduced with a profit,
                    which again affords the means of employing other industry. The pauper,
                    therefore, is constantly drawing those above him into his own rank. The
                    misfortune of those reluctantly becoming paupers produces a sympathy which
                    extends to the voluntary pauper, and the unfortunate and the idle become less
                    and less distinguishable.</p>
                <p>If the law increases its bounty with the number of the paupers’ offspring, all
                    these evils are aggravated and accelerated. If the law, like the English
                    bastardy law, renders the reward for having a bastard child greater than the
                    allowance to a legitimate child, another source of immorality is opened, female
                    virtue is at a disadvantage, and unchastity, becoming a source of profit,
                    becomes respectable.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See
                    Extracts from the information received by the Commissioners of Inquiry into the
                    Poor-Laws. A clergyman in Cumberland speaks thus of the practice of that county:
                    “A very different description of women have of late years become the mothers of
                    bastard <pb corresp="kp-eb0718-7081-0366" xml:id="pbn7366"/> children. Formerly
                    it was confined to the daughters of cottagers, and girls employed in
                    farm-husbandry; but of late <hi rend="italic">very respectable farmers’
                    daughters</hi> have been in that situation, and have applied to have their
                    offspring taken care of by the parish.” (Captain Pringle’s Report, p. 404.) The
                    next extract is from the evidence of an overseer in the same county. “We at this
                    time, in our parish, are supporting two bastard children, whose <hi
                    rend="italic">mothers have landed property of their own,</hi> and would not
                    marry the fathers of their children.” <hi rend="italic">(Ibid.)</hi> “<hi
                    rend="superscript"> r</hi> ihe daughters of some <hi rend="italic">farmers, and
                    even landowners,</hi> have bastard children. These farmers and landowners, and
                    children with them, regularly kept back their poor-rate, to meet the parish
                    allowance for their daughter’s bastard.” (íôíd.) “Captain Pringle states, that
                    in the neighbourhood of Carlisle, it was not unusual for the daughters of small
                    farmers, or statesmen as they are here called (men farming their own property),
                    to have bastard children, and to come to the parish for allowance.” <hi
                    rend="italic">(Ibid.</hi> p. 403.)</p></note></p>
                <p>If the law takes the yet more insidious course of providing <pb corresp="pbn7366"
                    facs="nls:193537081?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0718-7081-0366"/> relief to
                    those who live partly by regular industry, the evils described are enormously
                    increased. In this way the whole industrious population may be destroyed, almost
                    without rendering the recipients conscious of their degradation. In this way the
                    forethought of the industrious man becomes of as little value to him as it is to
                    the pauper, and the whole of the restraints on population are destroyed in the
                    great bulk of the people.</p>
                <p>But relief to his workman is in fact for the moment relief to the master; the
                    public undertaking a portion of the maintenance of the servant, saves to that
                    extent the wages of the employer. The corruption of the system thus reaches the
                    master as well as the labourer, and each is equally induced, by his immediate
                    interest, to secure and continue to himself his portion of the benefit, unless
                    we presume them to be more provident than the law itself.</p>
                <p>That such bad principles might be involved in a poor-law, is undoubted; for
                    although the English law never, either in letter or spirit, contained all these
                    elements together, yet it at one period or another in succession contained them
                    all, and a loose and in some measure a corrupt administration gave, for a long
                    time, prevalence to all their influences together.</p>
                <p>This brings into view the evils of a bad administration of the law. Suppose its
                    execution intrusted to officers who must, in a majority of cases, be necessarily
                    ignorant of its complicate objects, being ignorant of the common rudiments of
                    education;<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See as to the
                    illiterateness, general ignorance, and inefficiency of overseers, the volume of
                    Extracts before cited, at the passages referred to in the index, under the title
                    “Overseers.” ∙ ∕</p></note> and let such officers be in no way distinguished by
                    their interests being made to accord with the interests of the community in a
                    good administration; the obvious consequence must be such as we have seen in
                    England, that the best portions of the law must be badly administered, whilst
                    the bad parts, by such instruments, can scarcely be expected to have these evils
                    softened by a good administration. But a certain consequence would be, that
                    those whose interests were identical with the welfare of the community, would be
                    reluctant to serve the office, which would thus be left to others who could best
                    employ its provisions to their own advantage. Thus in England the overseer was
                    generally found, even when zealous in the discharge of his duty, blindly giving
                    effect to the most pernicious part of the system. When merely weak, without
                    being corrupt, we find him a tool in the hands of those whose object it was to
                    procure labour at a low price, at the expense of the other ratepayers, and at
                    the peril of the gradual though certain deterioration of the labourer and his
                    posterity. Such an overseer was also subject, as a matter of course, to the
                    cajolery or intimidation of the pauper, to the seduction of popularity, readily
                    to be got by the expenditure in mis-called charity of other people’s
                    contributions. But the natural operation of the system was to find or to make
                    its officers corrupt, as it was natural that that class of men should be
                    readiest to execrate the officer, whose circumstances best allowed them to avail
                    themselves, for their own advantage, of the law. In England we found that the
                    more pauperized the district, the more certainly was the overseer an employer of
                    pauper labour, or a supplier to the paupers, on his private account, of the
                    objects of their daily consumption, or the owner of the habitations in which
                    they lived, and for which the parish guaranteed a certain and exorbitant
                    rent.</p>
                <p>Even these evils might be aggravated by parcelling the country out into districts
                    too small to allow of the procuring of the necessary means even of an economical
                    administration. In England, few parishes or townships were large enough to
                    afford a workhouse or to contract for the supply of the articles of consumption
                    for the poor. Many were so small, that the cost of purchasing small books of
                    account was considered as an extravagance.</p>
                <p>We have another important example of the way in which the administration could be
                    carried to the extreme of badness; namely, by the provision of a control which
                    could by its nature operate only to enforce an improvident administration, and
                    which should have no authority to check it. England, again, affords us an
                    example of such a device in the authority of the justices of the peace. The
                    justice was enabled to enforce the giving of relief where the overseer from any
                    motive had refused it; but the justice of the peace had no authority to
                    interfere when the overseer was profligately allowing relief.</p>
                <p>. The effects of such a system, then, would inevitably be the same as we have
                    witnessed in England. Such have been, perhaps, too indiscriminately attributed
                    to poor-laws generally. These effects were, in a former article in this
                    publication, very distinctly and ably described and elucidated. They were
                    described, first, as a disturbance of the natural course of population, which
                    they increased without reference to the means of support; and, indeed, in the
                    inverse direction, inasmuch as every addition to the number of the
                    non-produotive or the partially productive paupers diminished the means of
                    living of the other portions of the community. Secondly, as increasing the very
                    pauperism which it was their object to relieve. Thirdly, as productive of
                    improvidence in the poor, who saw no worse consequence of a dissolute and idle
                    life, than an eventual reliance, in common with millions of their
                    fellow-subjects, upon the parish for their support in sickness or old age, or in
                    the visitation of those calamities against which it is the task of prudence to
                    provide. A fourth effect, much dwelt upon, was the misapprehension caused by
                    these institutions as to the real cause of poverty and distress, and the
                    operation of this misapprehension in producing a discontented spirit in those
                    who encourage the notion that they have a right to relief, but entertain no
                    equally definite notion of their duty to provide for themselves. The fifth evil
                    was the encouragement which the system, as administered, was found to give to
                    every species of immorality: idleness in the day, encouraging depredation,
                    poaching, and smuggling by night, facilitating the resort to the beer-shop again
                    by day: particularly the law of bastardy was observed to be rapidly destroying
                    the virtue of the females, and, by producing ill-assorted marriages, the whole
                    of those domestic virtues, both of parents and children, which depend mainly on
                    a happy home. And it was also remarked, that the law of settlement had a large
                    effect in lowering the character of all who claimed a maintenance from the
                    parish; it being notorious that the most steady, industrious, and moral workmen,
                    upon whom the employer can place his surest reliance, are those who do not
                    legally belong to the parish in which they are living.</p>
                <p>Such is the description of an extensive system of poor-laws, framed on a bad
                    principle, and badly administered; and such are their observed effects.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193537094?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0718-7094-0367"/>
                <p>But it does not thence follow, that a poor-law well devised and well administered
                    should find no place in the polity of a nation.</p>
                <p>There appear to be at least two resources besides that of adopting bad principles
                    in such a law, or adopting a bad constitution of officers for its
                    administration. The first resource is to exclude such an institution
                    altogether.</p>
                <p>Some few countries taking their place by common estimation amongst civilized
                    nations, have made no public provision for the poor. Ireland was practically,
                    before the session of 1837-1838, without such a provision. England was in the
                    same condition until the reign of Elizabeth. In all such countries rigorous
                    enactments exist against mendicancy, but everywhere such enactments are defeated
                    by the common co-operation of the whole people. It will be seen, that in England
                    the most ferocious penal enactments were repeated, with every variation that
                    ingenuity could devise, for the purpose of suppressing mendicancy and vagrancy;
                    and yet at every stage of legislation it is avowed that the evil was still
                    increasing. Ireland had, up to the time of Henry VIII. the English laws in this
                    respect; and the sanguinary laws of Henry VIII. are still the laws of Ireland.
                    Until this day, a criminal who evades conviction for some greater offence is
                    occasionally transported under the vagrancy laws; in all other cases the public
                    opinion revolts against the application of the penalty; and the law, though in
                    the statute-book, is without effect.</p>
                <p>It appears a preposterous expectation, that any people will generally sympathise
                    or co-operate with the law which, whilst it leaves the unfortunate to perish,
                    pretends to render mendicancy a crime. So common is the sentiment against such
                    an attempt, that many systems of jurisprudence avowedly admit necessity, or the
                    extreme danger of perishing for want, as a legal excuse for some offences, and
                    as a palliation of any offence directly incited by the pressure of such
                    necessity. There appears, therefore, no means of preventing mendicancy, but by a
                    recognised provision of public relief.</p>
                <p>Mendicancy is often expressly permitted by law; sometimes it is allowed to
                    particular classes of persons, as discharged soldiers and sailors and their
                    families, poor students, discharged prisoners, and such like. Sometimes a limit
                    is assigned to begging, a given route on the way homewards, or a given district
                    in which a party may have been born or may have become otherwise domiciled. Even
                    in England, both these kinds of license and restriction have, till within these
                    few years, formed part of our statutelaw, and both species are still leading
                    features in the law of Ireland. The effect of such restrictions has nearly
                    everywhere been the same as in our own country, viz. to give authority to
                    mendicancy, without in any way operating to diminish it.</p>
                <p>Let us now examine the effects of mendicancy, whether permitted by the law or
                    not; comparing it throughout with the operation of a bad system of poor-laws. In
                    the <hi rend="italic">first</hi> place, it, like pauperism, destroys industry,
                    but the mendicant is wholly and entirely idle, with no one responsible to see
                    him set to work, and, being for the most part unknown to those who relieve him,
                    is under no necessity even to affect, like tlιe pauper, a readiness to work. The
                    mendicant’s progeny is like himself in this respect, except that, being early
                    bred to the parent’s habits, industry becomes nearly impossible to them; whilst
                    the occupation of both is such, that even on the supposition that an inclination
                    to adopt a life of industry should be excited, few occupations could be found to
                    which they would be fitted, and still fewer employers who would engage them. In
                    respect of the influences upon <hi rend="italic">industry,</hi> therefore, the
                    individual mendicant is under worse influences than the individual pauper
                    relieved by the <hi rend="italic">worst</hi> system of poor-laws. So with
                    respect to the general <hi rend="italic">morality</hi> of the mendicant. The
                    pauper is under some restraints, owing to his being settled amongst neigh bours
                    upon whose good opinion he is at least in some measure dependent; he must be
                    known to the officers of his parish, and by this alone is kept in contact with
                    and in fear of the law. The local sphere for the exercise of his vices is one of
                    narrow limits. These restraints keep the pauper under considerable subjection,
                    both to law and to opinion. But no such restraints operate upon the mendicant.
                    No irregularity of conduct, no vice, can exclude him more from general society
                    than his daily mode of life already does; even if, amongst his fellows, any vice
                    should be recognised as sufficiently repulsive to exclude him from their
                    companionship, their unsettled life renders it impossible that the reputation or
                    the knowledge of his odious qualities could very closely attend him. Add to this
                    absence of restraint the positive encouragement given by their more various and
                    adventurous life, the zest with which its frauds and its darings are performed,
                    and the glory with which they are recounted; these accompaniments have rendered
                    the beggar’s life popular, as the subject of romance, and occasionally as the
                    object of imitation amongst even the better educated and more fortunate members
                    of society. A pauper was never yet, as the beggar often is, the romantic hero of
                    a ballad or a legend. Here, again, the influences on the individual mendicant
                    arc more pernicious than those on the pauper.</p>
                <p>The same disadvantageous comparison exists when we consider the unlimited
                    opportunities afforded by the mendicant’s mode of life for every species of
                    petty theft and depredation, habits which appear invariably to accompany that of
                    vagrancy.</p>
                <p>In England we have a difficulty in conceiving the extent to which the habits of
                    mendicancy may be carried on, and the varieties in its practice. It would be
                    comparatively a small evil that a few mendicants should be found to be
                    preeminently vicious characters; and this evil would bear no comparison with the
                    evil of a pauperism spread as widely as that formerly in England. But some
                    estimate may be formed of the extent to which mendicancy may be carried where
                    there are no poor-laws, by a reference to the state of Ireland, in which it is
                    represented that, in a population of eight millions, not less than 200,000
                    habitua! mendicants and vagrants exist, and where this number is annually
                    reinforced by the accession of the wives and families of those labourers who
                    have left their homes in search of work elsewhere, and which are represented, in
                    the evidence collected by the Commissioners of Poor-Laws Inquiry in Ireland, to
                    exceed a million of persons.</p>
                <p>The evil of mendicancy, therefore, may even bear a comparison in the extent and
                    number of those practising it, with the evil of pauperism even under a bad
                    poor-law.</p>
                <p>Now, let the operation upon the distributors in both cases be compared. No
                    regular machinery is devised for the supply of the mendicant, but he is let
                    loose upon the whole of society, to procure his living by every means by which
                    the sympathies, the virtues, the follies, the weaknesses, or the vices of man
                    may be attacked. Though much of the relief given to the mendicant is prompted by
                    the benevolence of the giver, much also has its origin in sympathies falsely
                    excited; in folly, and especially in the vanity and ostentation of him who
                    dispenses the alms. Much, too, of the alms given to mendicants, in alms-giving
                    countries, is given with the object of acquiring power over a disorderly and
                    reckless class. In all countries, in times of commotion, we have seen this class
                    unscrupulous instruments in the hands of those who, by their largesses, or by
                    the exciting of expectations, had attached a large number of these classes. An
                    example is seen in Spain, where the merit chiefly professed by the distributors
                    of the alms of enormous charities is that of relieving the wants of armies of
                    mendicants.</p>
                <p>No instrument in the hands of ambitious and designing persons has ever been found
                    more effective than that of retaining large classes of ready-formed mendicants,
                    and of <pb break="no" facs="nls:193537107?mode=fullsize"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0718-7107-0368"/> bringing the poorer classes, under specious
                    names, as near as possible to the condition of receivers of alms.</p>
                <p>The effects upon the distributors has been equally to the disadvantage of the
                    practice of alms-giving, inasmuch as the appointment of officers to administer
                    the public fund has not been, and cannot be conceived to be, as pernicious as
                    the innumerable institutions and fraternities of idle men brought together for
                    the purpose chiefly of distributing alms. A portion of this operation may be
                    seen and appreciated in the comparison between an ordinary overseer and the
                    trustees who usually have distribution of private charities, the masses of which
                    in England and Wales are shown by the Reports of the Commissioners of Charity to
                    have been diverted from their proposed objects for the benefit of those who had
                    the control in their hands.</p>
                <p>Another advantage which a system of poor-laws has over alms-giving is this:
                    Poor-laws are subject to the control of the legislature. Their evils, as
                    discovered, may one by one be pruned away by the power which has created the
                    whole institution; and they can also, at the will of the legislature, if such
                    should appear to be an advisable course, be at any time totally abolished.
                    Mendicancy, on the other hand, and alms-giving, arc beyond the effective control
                    of the law. Where once established by habit, no interference of the legislature
                    can effectively modify them, no prohibition of the legislature can abrogate
                    them. The sole corrective appears to be a retreat from private alms, by the
                    adoption of a system of public relief as a means of discountenancing the
                    mendicant’s claim.</p>
                <p>Thus far have been compared bad poor-laws with mendicancy; and it has been
                    attempted to show that, even in this comparison, private alms-giving is exposed
                    to disadvantages greater than those attached to a system of public relief. The
                    comparison thus far with poor-laws has, as an abstract question, become unfair,
                    because it seems possible, and recent experience appears to confirm the
                    conclusion, that a poor-law may be so devised and so administered as to take
                    away all plea for guilt founded upon absolute necessity; to diminish no man’s
                    present motives to labour, and bring up his offspring to industry; to offer the
                    least possible inducements to improvidence, so far as improvidence is involved
                    in neglecting to make accumulations against old age and other calamities. This
                    appears to be rendered possible by the administration of such relief that those
                    capable of working would reject it, as less desirable than independent industry
                    in the time of their health and vigour, and less desirable than provisions
                    secured by prudence for their old age.</p>
                <p>CHAPTER II.</p>
                <p>HISTORY OF ENGLISH POOR-LAWS TILL THE YEAR 1834.</p>
                <p>The most authentic accounts, at least those which prove most incontestibly the
                    prevalence of the habits of mendicancy and vagrancy in England, and give the
                    best evidence of the extent to which their evils were recognised, may be found
                    in the expressions of our early statutes.</p>
                <p>It will not be possible to give a detailed description, either of the contents of
                    the series of our statutes, or of their effects. The number of statutes passed
                    for the suppression of vagrancy, mendicancy, and idleness, and for the relief of
                    the poor, amount at the least to a hundred and <hi rend="superscript"> e</hi>
                    ighty-seven 5 those now in force, commencing with the statute 43 Elizabeth, and
                    including only the modifications of that law, amount to a hundred and eighteen,
                    and contain matter of itself about equal to four average volumes of the statutes
                    at large. None, therefore, but the most salient points in the legislation of the
                    last four centuries and a half will be adverted to in the following summary of
                    the progress of legislation upon these subjects.</p>
                <p>We first find indications of a general relaxation of the industry of our
                    population in the reign of Richard II. Civil discord had unquestionably its
                    effect in producing the result; but a change in the habits of the population had
                    been produced by the increase of commerce and of communication with other
                    countries, and a large accession had at this time been made to the disposable
                    wealth of the community. The large system of vagabondage, sanctified by the name
                    of pilgrimage, of which the expeditions known as the Crusades were the most
                    salient instance, had begotten a spirit of restlessness and idleness in Europe,
                    infecting even our insular population. It was not so much the habit of beggary,
                    as the desire of change and restlessness of life, that the statute of the 12th
                    Richard II. chap. 7, passed in the year 1388, was intended to repress. This
                    statute, though entirely directed against habits characterized in that day ε,s
                    vagabondage, scarcely recognises beggary as an habitual pursuit. Its main
                    provisions are confined to the object of restraining labourers from changing
                    their abodes. It prohibits any labourer from departing from the hundred, rape,
                    wapentake, city, or borough, where he is dwelling, without a testimonial showing
                    reasonable cause for his going, to be issued under the authority of the justices
                    of peace. Any labourer found wandering without such letter is to be put in the
                    stocks till he find surety to return to the town from whence he came. So far are
                    its enactments from affording any evidence that able-bodied persons of either
                    sex exercised by choice to any large extent the trade of mendicancy, that the
                    only other class besides labourers which it recognises are the impotent. As to
                    impotent persons, it provides that they are to remain in the towns in which they
                    be dwelling at the time of the act; or if the inhabitants are unable or
                    unwilling to support them, they are to withdraw to other towns within the
                    hundred, rape, or wapentake, or to the towns where they were born, and there
                    abide during their lives.</p>
                <p>From the earliest periods, but from this time especially, begging was an offence;
                    yet the chief enactments of the two succeeding centuries are rather confined to
                    the object of restraining the movements of labourers than to the restraining of
                    able-bodied beggars. The provisions of the 1 lth Henry VII. chap. 2, however,
                    require beggars not able to work to go to the hundred where last they dwelt, or
                    were best known, or born, without begging out of the hundred. The 19th Henry
                    VII. chap. 12, passed eight years afterwards (in 1504), requires them to go to
                    the town, city, or hundred where they were born, or to the place where they last
                    abode for the space of three years, without begging out of the said city, town,
                    hundred, or place.</p>
                <p>The legislation affecting the classes of poor least able to provide for
                    themselves, had thus far been entirely restrictive, and contained that clement
                    of the poor-laws by which they are connected with police, almost to as great an
                    extent as is to be found in our most recent institutions. They also indirectly
                    contain a complete settlement law; for, by confining the labourers, but
                    especially the impotent poor and beggars, to the places in which they dwelt at
                    the time of the act being passed, or in which they had been born, or to the
                    places of their last abode, they directly settled such persons on the places
                    thus defined, and rendered the districts chargeable with the burden, at least to
                    the extent to which the endowments of the church and the benevolence of
                    individuals could be applied to the purpose. At length, especially after all the
                    revenues of the church were diverted from the purpose of maintaining the poor,
                    legislation becomes of a severe penal character, and is more immediately
                    directed against those who practise mendicancy as a trade, viz. “able-bodied,
                    sturdy, and valiant beggars.” At the same time, the distinction becomes more
                    apparent <pb break="no" facs="nls:193537120?mode=fullsize"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0718-7120-0369"/> between the impotent poor and those whom the
                    legislature evidently regarded as voluntary poor, and whom the law now subjects
                    to heavy and even sanguinary penalties. The 22d Henry VII. chap. 12, passed in
                    the year 1531, directs the justices to assign to the impotent poor a limit
                    within which they arc to beg. An impotent person begging out of his limit is to
                    be imprisoned for two days and nights in the stocks, fed on bread and water, and
                    then sworn to return to the place in which he was authorized to beg. An
                    able-bodied beggar is to be whipped, and sworn to return to the place where he
                    was bom, or last dwelt for the space of three years, and there put himself to
                    labour.</p>
                <p>Thus far restrictions upon vagrancy, whether originating in misfortune or
                    idleness, or more serious vice, had proved unavailable. The evil had not been
                    repressed; it had evidently increased, and at length drove the legislature to
                    the adoption, not only of severer penalties, according to the old policy, but of
                    a new expedient.</p>
                <p>With imperfect machinery for giving effect to its intentions, without security
                    that where its intention was carried into effect evils greater than those
                    against which it was intended to provide might not arise, a system was now
                    created which, in all its policy, is identical with that which now exists in
                    England, and is about to be introduced into Ireland. The means employed, and not
                    the policy itself, alone distinguish the legislation of the two periods. In the
                    first place, beggary and vagrancy-are still to be repressed, but no one is to be
                    driven, by absolute destitution, to an infraction of the law; all excuse is to
                    be taken away from the beggar. In the next place, the sympathy of the community
                    with the law is to be secured by a provision at the public expense against the
                    evil consequences of individual destitution. In the last place, the compulsory
                    provision thus made by the community is to be protected by compelling those
                    capable of exertion, and seeking to avail themselves of it, to accept it subject
                    to the condition of working for the maintenance thus secured to them; a
                    condition obviously intended to be as hard or harder than that upon which the
                    independent man obtains his own support, and rendering the alternative of
                    independent industry preferable to that of dependence on the public
                    charity.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>With regard to
                    the erroneous impression until recently prevalent in England, that poor-laws
                    were institutions peculiar to this country, it is important to observe, that the
                    system of law for repression of mendicancy and relief of the poor here
                    described, was a direct and palpable imitation of a continental institution. Six
                    years before the enactment of the 27th Henry VIII. (that is, in the year 1530),
                    the magistrates of Ypres, in Belgium, enacted a set of regulations, which, as
                    stated by Mr Hallam, manifestly form the model which was followed a few years
                    afterwards by the legislature of this country. The regulations in question
                    appear to have been adopted in the adjacent provinces of the Netherlands, under
                    the sanction of an edict of Charles V. See a paper by Mr Hallam in the first
                    volume of the Transactions of the Statistical Society.</p></note></p>
                <p>The 27th Henry VIII. chap. 25, passed in the year 1536, recites the act last
                    mentioned, and adds, that no provision is made for the support of the impotent,
                    nor for the setting and keeping in work of valiant beggars; and then enacts,
                    that the land-officers of every city, shire, town, and parish, to which such
                    poor creatures or sturdy vagabonds shall repair, in obedience to that act, shall
                    most charitably receive the same, and shall keep the same poor people by way of
                    voluntary and charitable alms, within the respective cities, shires, towns,
                    hundreds, hamlets, and parishes, by their discretion, so that none of them, of
                    very necessity, shall be compelled to beg openly, and shall compel the said
                    sturdy vagabonds and valiant beggars to be kept to continual labour, in such
                    wise as they may get their own living by the continual labour of their own
                    hands, on pain that every parish making default shall forfeit twenty shillings a
                    month. Almsgiving otherwise than to these common boxes, or common gatherings, or
                    to fellow-parishioners, or prisoners, is prohibited on forfeiture of ten times
                    the amount given. A sturdy beggar is to be whipped the first time, his right ear
                    cropped the second time; and if he again offend, he is to be sent to the next
                    jail till the quarter-sessions, and there to be indicted for wandering,
                    loitering, and idleness; and if con victed, <hi rend="italic">shall suffer
                    execution of death as a felon,</hi> and an enemy of the commonwealth.</p>
                <p>As far as the policy of the succeeding legislation is concerned, its intention
                    appears to bc fully expressed by the terms of this statute. In all the
                    succeeding period, we find a very large variety of means adopted for the purpose
                    still of giving effect to the same policy; sometimes an increase of severity,
                    even beyond the rigour of this statute, against the beggar and vagrant;
                    sometimes an improved machinery for succouring the impotent, especially for the
                    assessment and levying of the funds, and for producing an effective
                    responsibility in the officers charged w ith this duty; and eventually a more
                    comprehensive system devised for effectuating the whole of the objects clearly
                    contemplated by the statute of Henry, without the adoption of any other than
                    those objects, but intended merely to prevent the evils resulting from the
                    defective means and instruments previously employed for their attainment.</p>
                <p>Accordingly we find in the statutes of the reign of Edward V. “the foolish pity
                    and mercy of them which should have seen to the execution of the goodly laws
                    before enacted, and the perverse nature and long-accustomed idleness of persons
                    long given to loitering,” inveighed against in the usual declamatory manner of
                    preambles of that period; but we find indications of the growth of a conviction
                    that the excessive penalties of the previous legislation had defeated the
                    operation of the law. The enactments against vagrancy are therefore rendered
                    somewhat milder; an able-bodied poor person who does not apply himself to some
                    honest labour, or offer to serve, though only for meat and drink, if nothing
                    more is to be obtained, shall be taken for a vagabond, branded on the shoulder
                    with the letter V, and adjudged a slave for two years to any person who shall
                    de^ mand him, to be fed on bread and water and refùse meat, and caused to work
                    by beating and chaining, or otherwise. If he run away within that period, he is
                    to be branded on the cheek w ith the letter S, and <hi rend="italic">adjudged a
                    slave for life</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> if he run away again, he is to
                    suffer <hi rend="italic">death as a felon.</hi> If no one demand such loiterer,
                    the place where he is bom is to keep him as a slave, and is to see him set to
                    work; and if it fail in this, it is to be mulcted in a penalty, a city
                    forfeiting five pounds, a borough forty shillings.</p>
                <p>By this statute the old settlement law had ingrafted on it a law of removal. The
                    taking surety of the impotent poor, that they would repair to the places where
                    they were born, or had dwelt for the last three years, had been found
                    ineffectual; the officers were therefore directed to convey the impotent poor on
                    horseback, in cart, chariot, or otherwise, to the next constable, and so from
                    constable to constable, till they be brought to the place where they were born,
                    or most conversant for the space of three years, there to be kept and nourished
                    of alms.</p>
                <p>Gradual improvements were introduced in the detail by several successive
                    statutes. The 3d and 4th Edward VI. provides for the keeping of a book in every
                    city, corporate town, and parish, containing the names of householders, and of
                    the impotent poor. It makes some approach to a special organization of officers
                    for the objects. The minister and churchwardens are to appoint collectors of
                    alms; the alms, however, are voluntary, except to the extent to which they can
                    be enforced by the exhortation of the minister and bishop; it being provided,
                    that if any one able to further this charitable work do obstinately and
                    frowardly refuse to give, or do discourage others, the minister and
                    churchwardens<pb break="no" facs="nls:193537133?mode=fullsize"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0718-7133-0370"/> are to exhort him gently. If he will not be so
                    persuaded, the bishop is to send for him to induce and persuade him by
                    charitable ways and means, and so, according to his discretion, to take order
                    for the reformation thereof. These provisions being made, beggary is still
                    prohibited, upon the pains limited in the previous statutes.</p>
                <p>As might be expected, the gentle askings of the collectors, and the exhortations
                    of the minister, the charitable ways and means of the bishop, appear to have
                    been without effect in persuading the parishioners to intrust to the collectors
                    the distribution of their alms. We find, therefore, twelve years afterwards (5th
                    Elizabeth, chap. 3, passed in 1563), an attempt made to give additional effect
                    to these provisions, by enabling the bishop to bind any person to appear at the
                    next sessions, if his froward and wilful mind should obstinately refuse to give
                    weekly relief to the poor according to his ability. Here the justices are to
                    come in to the aid of the bishop, and are charitably and gently to persuade and
                    move the said obstinate person to extend his charity. If he will not be
                    persuaded, the justices with the churchwardens may tax the obstinate person
                    according to their discretion; and on his refusal to pay, the justices, on the
                    complaint of the churchwardens, are to commit him to jail until he does pay the
                    sum taxed, and arrears. Thus was created a compulsory tax, though at first only
                    as an alternative where voluntary contributions were refused.</p>
                <p>The important statute, 14th Elizabeth, represents in its recitals, that “all
                    parts of this realm of England and Wales be presently with rogues, vagabonds,
                    and sturdy beggars exceedingly pestered, by means whereof daily happeneth in the
                    same realm horrible murders, thefts, and other great outrage.” The sense of
                    these evils seems to have dictated a resort to a new variety of punishments; all
                    persons defined in the act as rogues and vagabonds, or sturdy beggars, are for
                    the first offence to be grievously whipped and burned to the gristle of the
                    right ear with a hot iron, of the compass of an inch about; for the second, they
                    are to be deemed felons; for the third, to suffer death as felons, without
                    benefit of clergy. But now chiefly is to be observed the improvements in
                    assessing the burthen; the justices having power to settle the poor for their
                    abidings, and to set down what portion the weekly charge towards the relief and
                    sustentation of the poor people would amount unto, and that done, shall by their
                    good discretions tax and assess all the inhabitants dwelling within the
                    divisions limited for the settling of the poor.</p>
                <p>This statute contained, like some of its predecessors, an enactment giving a
                    limited license for begging, provided that the poor people ask relief of
                    victualling only in the same parish where they do dwell, so the same be at the
                    time and in the manner directed by the churchwardens and overseers of the poor.
                    This license has been extended, modified, and restrained, but still kept in
                    existence, especially in the case of discharged soldiers and prisoners, up to
                    recent times.</p>
                <p>So far we have seen the gradual accumulation of all the elements contained in the
                    poor-laws up to the time of the last amendment in the system made in the reign
                    of the late King William IV. The statute, which permanently fixed all these
                    elements in one system was passed in the last year of the reign of Elizabeth,
                    the celebrated statute the 43d Elizabeth, chap. 2. In this statute we find
                    extreme severity abandoned, and its place supplied with a reasonable test of
                    destitution of such as may be presumed to be voluntary beggars or idlers. The
                    able-bodied, married or unmarried, are to be set to work; children may be
                    apprenticed; only the “lame, impotent, old, blind, and such others among them,
                    being poor and not able to work,” are to have “necessary relief,” without being
                    set to work. For the latter class of poor, habitations may be provided at the
                    expense of the parish, on the waste or common; and for the support of these, but
                    not of any who are able to work, natural relations, that is, father, mother,
                    grandfather, grandmother, and children, may be compelled to contribute.</p>
                <p>The voluntary contribution, and the co-operation of the minister and bishop, are
                    abandoned. A tax upon the inhabitants, and upon the occupiers of property,
                    strictly defined, and upon the parson or vicar, is directed to be levied in
                    every parish; effectual means are given for the assessment, collection, and levy
                    of the tax; for appeal for remedy against its unjust assessment; for the
                    contribution of adjoining parishes and hundreds, where the means of the single
                    parish failed; above all, a special authority is created for giving effect to
                    the provisions of the law. Overseers, not less than two, nor more than four, are
                    to be appointed in every parish yearly, in Easter week, to act with the
                    churchwardens, subject to the orders of the justices, and liable to penalties
                    for neglect of their office.</p>
                <p>Such was the system in operation for above two centuries and a quarter, from 1601
                    to 1834, without material modification: its whole provisions were extended in
                    the reign of Charles II. to town-lands; the law of settlement was also extended
                    and refined, in the same and subsequent reigns; and the provision for setting
                    the able-bodied to work was rendered more effectuai by the 9th George I. chap.
                    7, which enabled every parish to provide a workhouse, or, if too small or too
                    poor, to combine with others for the purpose of maintaining a workhouse, and
                    which rendered the offer of relief in a workhouse a sufficient bar to the claim
                    to any other relief.</p>
                <p>These statutes, aided by all those other causes which operated upon the morals
                    and the general prosperity of the people, had produced the effect intended by
                    their authors; and whatever may have been the portion attributable to any of the
                    several causes in operation, the result unquestionably was, that vagabondage and
                    idleness were found in the last half of the last century to prevail in England
                    to a less extent than in any of the larger states of Europe, with the single
                    exception of Holland. As the extremity of the evil had formerly produced
                    severity in the law, so the disappearance of the evil produced a disastrous
                    relaxation in the restrictions of which the experience and prudence of the
                    previous times had discovered the necessity.</p>
                <p>About the middle of the last century, there began to be indicated in the acts of
                    the legislature a growing opinion, that the severity of the tests applied to the
                    recipients of public charity required to be diminished. In the 7th year of the
                    reign of George IIL, guardians were especially appointed in the city of London,
                    the city of Westminster, the bills of mortality, the liberties of the Tower, not
                    with any administrative or executive powers, but “to guard against the dangerous
                    consequences which may arise from the false parsimony, negligence, inadvertency,
                    or the annual change of parish officers.” These guardians were to protect the
                    poor children of the metropolitan districts’to which the act applied, by
                    visiting the places in which they were kept, reporting on their condition, and
                    calling on the assistance of the magistracy where it might seem necessary.</p>
                <p>Throughout the whole of the reign of George III. the example thus set was
                    followed by constantly succeeding and increasing relaxations of the rigour of
                    the old law; some of the most conspicuous instances of which are to be found in
                    Gilbert’s act, passed in the twenty-second year of that reign, 1782, which,
                    instead of rendering the workhouse a means of testing voluntary pauperism, by
                    employing the able-bodied, thereby deterring them from habits of pauperism, by
                    rendering their state less eligible than one of independence, reverses this
                    principle entirely. It confines the use of the workhouse to that of a mere
                    receptacle for the aged, impotent, and infant poor; and provides, that the
                    able-bodied shall not be required to enter it; and proceeds to the absurd extent
                    in favour of the able-bodied pauper, of compelling<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193537146?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0718-7146-0371"/> the guardians
                    appointed under the act to find work near their own houses, for all applicants
                    able and professing to be willing to work, but unable to get employment; and to
                    make up atιy supposed deficiency of wages out of the poor-rates.</p>
                <p>The evils of able-bodied pauperism were now proceeding with alarming rapidity.
                    The consummation of the false policy of the legislature during this reign was
                    attained in East’s act, 55 Geo. III. chap. 137 (passed 1815). It consists of a
                    complete abrogation of almost all the salutary portions of the 9th Geo. I. chap.
                    7. The relief was no longer required to be received in the workhouse, it was to
                    be <hi rend="italic">paid</hi> to any poor person or persons at his or her or
                    their home or homes, house or houses. Justices were empowered to order this
                    relief for any time they might be pleased to define, not exceeding three months;
                    and two justices might make subsequent orders for relief for a period not
                    exceeding six months. The preambles and recitals in this statute consist, as
                    might have been anticipated from the previous course of legislation, of
                    descriptions of the grossest disorders on the part of those maintained by the
                    public charity.</p>
                <p>The insolence andgeneral demoralization of the pauper, the most alarming
                    deterioration in the industry of the labouring classes, especially the
                    agricultural labourers ∩f the south of England, the unscrupulous interference of
                    the employers with the wages and the mode of remuneration of the employed, were
                    abundantly shown by the committees of both houses of parliament, appointed to
                    inquire into the progress of the poor-laws, especially by that appointed on the
                    motion of Mr Sturges Bourne (in 1817), and upon the report of which the act
                    known as Sturges Bourne’s act, passed in the last year but one of this reign
                    (the 59th Geo. III. c. 12), was founded. This act does not entirely abandon the
                    views which dictated the dangerous provisions of East’s act. Generally, however,
                    it was a salutary measure, providing for the election of bodies of persons
                    called select vestries, who were to supersede the’overseers, and, in some
                    measure, the justices, more effectually to avoid the evils consequent upon the
                    administration being intrusted to annual and unpaid officers. It made provision
                    also for the performance of the overseers’ duties, by paid and permanent
                    assistant overseers.</p>
                <p>From the end of George III.’s reign to the year 1834, though legislative changes
                    were not unfrequent, they were confined to matters of detail, involving neither
                    the abandonment nor the adoption of any important principle.</p>
                <p>CHAPTER III.</p>
                <p>EFFECTS OF POOR-LAWS IN ENGLAND.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Commission of Inquiry.</hi></p>
                <p>In the course of the foregoing description of some of the principal statutes, the
                    useful or injurious principles involved in them have been shortly referred to;
                    the effects operated by the working out of those principles have been less
                    remarked upon. In the main, the <hi rend="italic">good effects</hi> had
                    consisted in reclaiming from a vagrant and profligate course of life a large
                    proportion of the population. The settlement laws especially had been
                    instrumental in this; for we find that the creation of the claim to relief from
                    the parish funds had so far attracted the idle and dissolute from the practice
                    of common begging, that, in the reign of Charles II., after a period of great
                    commotions, when many disbanded soldiers and sailors, and others, who, in a
                    period of turmoil, are either forced upon or voluntarily resort to an unsettled
                    life, had much swelled the mass of those who in previous times would have been
                    found in the ranks of sturdy and valiant beggars, the same order of people were
                    now found to be systematic though rapacious paupers, making the parish fund the
                    means of levying their contributions on society.</p>
                <p>We find in a statute of Charles II. in the second year of the Restoration (13 and
                    14 Car. II. cap. 12), a multifarious law of settlement created, upon reasons
                    thus expressed in the recital: “Whereas, by reason of some defects in the law,
                    poor people are not restrained from going from one parish to another, and
                    therefore <hi rend="italic">do endeavour to settle themselves in those parishes
                    where there is the best stock,</hi> the largest commons or wastes to build
                    cottages, and the most woods for them to bum and destroy; and when they have
                    consumed it, then to another parish; and at last become rogues and vagabonds, to
                    the great discouragement of parishioners to provide stocks, where it is liable
                    to be devoured by strangers.” From this period the whole of the efforts of the
                    legislation are incessantly made to prevent the too easy settling of the poor
                    upon the parish; but they all equally prove that settled pauperism had more and
                    more taken the place of vagrant mendicancy.</p>
                <p>If to the poor-laws can be attributed this good effect, they must also
                    necessarily have the credit of preventing that train of evils which follows upon
                    the existence of a large mass of mendicants and vagrants in any community. The
                    corruption, the demoralization, the inevitable bodily misery, to the mendicant
                    himself, his connections, and his offspring; the extortion, depredation, and the
                    more violent crime which such a class have almost unlimited opportunity and
                    frequent temptation to commit; next the deterioration in the feelings and habits
                    of those whom circumstances may bring <hi rend="subscript"> ι</hi> in contact
                    with them; the refuge which they afford to all who are inclined or tempted to
                    fall off from the more steady and respectable occupations of life, many of whom
                    are even tempted by the mere spirit of adventure to become recruits; add to
                    these the alarm and practical annoyance, which renders the industry and morality
                    of all other classes less a security for enjoyment; and we have some idea of the
                    train of evils the prevention of which was cut off when vagrancy on the great
                    scale was at length, in England, successfully suppressed, though to be replaced
                    in a great measure by voluntary and resolute pauperism.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">bad effects,</hi> as they arose in detail, usually led to
                    the successive modifications which we find the law in its progress undergoing
                    from time to time. Many of the evils temporarily and partially felt might even
                    now be described with advantage, and as warnings to future legislators; but
                    generally their interest would at present be greater to the historian and
                    antiquary than in a practical point of view. At no period had these laws
                    attained such an influence on the interests of the community of England and
                    Wales, as about the years 1831 and 1832, when the effects of the whole system
                    had reached a greater height than had ever yet been attained.</p>
                <p>In these years many of the anticipations of those who had seen the evil tendency
                    of the poor-laws, and had prophesied that the results of the system must be
                    disastrous, were realized in such a way as to produce a conviction in the most
                    supine, that either a remedy must be applied, or a wide-spread ruin be submitted
                    to. In an article in this work, written in the year 1823, by one of the most
                    humane and enlightened men who had ever given their attention to the subject, it
                    was shown that a crisis was impending, and could not be far removed; that, as
                    the law then stood, the poor-rates were increasing in the same ratio in which
                    the prudence and forethought of the receivers of relief were being destroyed. It
                    was shown, that “whenever the charge upon the land in support of those who do
                    not add enough to the annual produce of the country to support themselves is so
                    great that the land can be no longer cultivated with profit, then of course it
                    will be thrown up.” In 1832 was seen the phenomenon of whole parishes of fertile
                    land being abandoned, “the landlords giving up their rents, the farmers their
                    tenancy, the clergyman his glebe and the tithes.” We find the paupers assembled
                    and refusing to accept of the offer <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193537159?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0718-7159-0372"/> of the whole
                    land of the parish, avowing that “they liked the present system better.”<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See, as to the parish of
                    Cholesbury in Berkshire, the Report from his Majesty’s Commissioners for

                    Appendix (A).</p></note></p>
                <p>In the article referred to, it had been shown that the system then in operation
                    was fraught with the danger of discontented turbulence. “Every one is brought up
                    with the belief that the state is bound to provide him with employment and
                    support. When, therefore, the employment assigned him is such as he does not
                    approve, and the recompense awarded him falls bclow his expectations (and when
                    the employment is a loss to the public, the recompense must often be below even
                    reasonable expectations), he becomes an irritated and uneasy subject; and,
                    unless he is restrained by the fear of detection, or by the better influence of
                    moral principles, he vents his spleen by any mischief that is in his power, and
                    the burning of stackyards, or the destruction of machinery, results from an
                    unsatisfactory interview with the overseer, or an ineffectual appeal to the
                    bench of magistrates.”</p>
                <p>In the winter of 1831-1832 we find the practical exemplification of these
                    remarks. In a period of great general prosperity, we find that portion of
                    England in which the poor-laws had had their greatest operation, and in which by
                    much the largest expenditure of poor-rates had been made, the scene of daily
                    riot and nightly incendiarism; and we discover a state of things which, in the
                    sober language of statistics, is thus described: “Of ninety-three parishes in
                    four ill-administered counties, the population is 113,147, and the expenditure
                    L.81,978, or fourteen and fivepence per head; and of eighty parishes in three
                    well-administered counties, the population is 105,728, and the expenditure
                    L.30,820, or five and ninepence per head; and those counties in which the
                    expenditure is large are those in which the industry and skill of the labourers
                    are passing away, the connection between the master and servant has become
                    precarious, the unmarried are defrauded of their fair earnings, and riots and
                    incendiarism have prevailed. The three counties in which it is comparatively
                    small are those in which scarcely any instance of fire or tumult appears to have
                    occurred; in which mutual attachment exists between the workman and his
                    employer; in which wages depend not on marriage, but on ability, and the
                    diligence and skill of the labourers are unimpaired or increased.”</p>
                <p>The danger had become too real to be neglected if a remedy could be found; but
                    parliamentary inquiries, both in the upper and lower house, had repeatedly taken
                    place comparatively without result, the largest effect produced by any committee
                    of either house being that of the committee appointed in 1817, which in the year
                    1819 produced Sturges Bourne’s act; an act, as events proved, almost wholly
                    unproductive of effect in checking the course of pauperism.</p>
                <p>An effort of another kind was now felt to be necessary, and was accordingly made.
                    A Commission of Inquiry was appointed, consisting of individuals remarkable
                    alike for their interest in the subject and their knowledge of its principles
                    and details; its powers, though only those of ordinary commissioners of inquiry,
                    far exceeding, for useful purposes, those of a parliamentary committee. Its
                    labours were continued incessantly for two years, uninterrupted by the vacation
                    or recess. Nor were these confined alone to the examination of witnesses
                    summoned from different parts of the country. The commission were enabled to
                    examine the locality itself, the documentary evidence, the living witnesses, and
                    the actual operation of the system on the spot, and this by the members of their
                    own body, as well as by assistant-commissioners appointed to visit and examine
                    all parts of the country, some of whom extended their inquiries into Scotland,
                    France, Flanders, and Guernsey, whilst they also collected a vast mass of
                    interesting evidence from our ambassadors and diplomatic agents in different
                    countries of Europe and America.</p>
                <p>The result was a scrutinizing and minute inquiry; which was followed by the

                    experience, yet so systematic, that their operation could be calculated almost
                    with certainty, and which were, therefore, proportionally to be relied upon. As
                    the success in inquiring had been great, so was the confidence of the
                    legislature readily given; and the most important statute upon the subject
                    passed since the statute of Elizabeth was carried through both houses by large
                    and confident majorities.</p>
                <p>A description of the evils found in operation at the time of the inquiry, of the
                    remedies proposed for those evils, and of the enactments actually adopted, will
                    afford the most complete and consistent view of the present system of English
                    poor-laws. The statement of the operation of the previous law, and of the
                    remedies proposed, will be condensed from the Report of the Commissioners of
                    Inquiry; that of the enactments passed, from the Act for the Amendment and
                    better Administration of the Laws relating to the Poor in England and Wales,

                    are impotent through old age or bodily infirmity, through infancy, through
                    accident, or through mental infirmity; and, <hi rend="italic">secondly,</hi> of
                    the able-bodied poor.</p>
                <p>I. RELIEF OF THE ABLE-BODIED.</p>
                <p>It was in the relief of the able-bodied that the greatest pecuniary expenditure,
                    and, above all, that the greatest moral evils, were incurred. The relief granted
                    was in a great measure unconditional; in many districts it had superseded the
                    necessity of practising even the thrift and husbandry necessary in expending the
                    funds placed at the pauper’s disposal.</p>
                <p>The great source of abuse was found to be the out-door relief afforded to the
                    able-bodied on their own account, or on that of their families. This was given
                    either in kind or in money.</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Out-Door Relief of the Able-Bodied in Kind.</hi></p>
                <p>The out-door relief of the able-bodied, when given in kind, was found to consist
                    rarely of food, rather less unfrequently of fuel, and still less unfrequently of
                    clothes, particularly shoes; but its most usual form was that of relieving the
                    applicants, either wholly or partially, from the expense of obtaining
                    house-room. This last mode of relief was extensively prevalent, and productive
                    of important consequences, both direct and indirect.</p>
                <p>Partial relief from the expense of obtaining house-room was given, or professed
                    to be given, whenever the occupant of a cottage or an apartment was exempted on
                    the ground of poverty from the payment of rates. In a great number of cases the
                    labourer, if a parishioner, was not only exempted from rates, but his rent was
                    paid out of the parish funds.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Out-Door Relief of the Able-Bodied in Money.</hi></p>
                <p>The out-door relief afforded in money to the able-bodied on their own account or
                    on that of their families was found to be still more prevalent. This was
                    generally effected by one or other of the five following expedients, which may
                    be concisely designated as, first, relief without labour; secondly, the
                    allowance system; thirdly, the roundsman system; fourthly, parish employment;
                    and, fifthly, the labour-rate system.</p>

                <p>Sometimes relief, to an amount insufficient for a complete subsistence, was
                    afforded, without imposing any further condition than that the applicant should
                    shift, as it was called, for himself, and give the parish no further trouble. In
                    a still greater number of instances the relief was found to have been given on
                    the plea that the applicant had not been able to obtain work, that he had lost a
                    day or a longer period’, and was entitled, therefore, to receive from the
                    unlimited resources of the parish what he had not been able to obtain from a
                    private employer.</p>

                <p>In some places allowance was found to have been given only occasionally, or to
                    meet occasional wants; to buy, for instance, a coat or a pair of shoes, or to
                    pay the rent of a cottage or an apartment. In others, it was considered that a
                    weekly sum, or more frequently the value of a certain quantity of flour or
                    bread, was to be received by each member of a family.</p>
                <p>The latter practice was found to have been sometimes matured into a system,
                    forming the law of a whole district, sanctioned and enforced by the magistrates,
                    and promulgated in the form of local statutes. <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi>

                <p>“The <hi rend="italic">bread-money</hi> was hardly looked upon by the labourers
                    in the light of parish relief. They considered it as much their right as the

                <p>It was further to be observed, that even in those parishes in which the amount of
                    allowance was supposed to depend upon that of the applicant’s earnings, the
                    inquiry as to the amount of those earnings was never carried back further than
                    the current or the previous week or fortnight. The consequence was, that many of
                    those who at particular periods of the year received wages far exceeding the
                    average amount of the earnings of the most industrious labourer, received also
                    large allowances from the parish.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Mr Bishop found a parish in the Bedford Level, in which a
                    recently drained tract of fertile land requires more labour than the settled
                    inhabitants can provide, and the average yearly earnings of a labourer’s family
                    are from L.60 to L.7θi but during a frost, and generally from November to March,
                    almost every labourer comes on the parish. When they commented on these facts in
                    their conversation with a resident magistrate, his answer was, “Why, what are we
                    to do? they spend it all, and then come and say they are starving; and you must
                    relieve them.” “In our vestry,” says Mr Russell, “which meets every Monday, the
                    calculation is confined to the earnings of the past fortnight. No further
                    retrospect is ever taken either for or against the claimant. In some parishes I
                    believe the account is settled once a week instead of once a fortnight.”
                    Sometimes the inquiry does not go back even to the beginning of the week at the
                    end of which the claim is made. <hi rend="italic">(Ibid.</hi> p.

                <p>Again, there were other parishes in which no sort of inquiry whatever was made
                    respecting earnings; but the birth of a child endowed the parent with an

                    Mr Villiers, “The practice of granting allowance for children is so general and
                    confirmed, that the pauper is in the habit of giving formal notice to the
                    overseer of the pregnancy of his wife. Should the overseer refuse the
                    application for the fixed sum allowed for the second, third, or fourth child,
                    the magistrates’ single inquiry, on his appearance before them under a summons,
                    would have been as to the custom of the parish or the hundred. ‘ At what number
                    does allowance begin with you ?’ was the common mode of putting the question, as
                    I was repeatedly assured by overseers. The previous or present earnings of the
                    pauper, or of any of his family, were never mentioned.” <hi rend="italic"

                    independent claimant for relief, and entitled to it, though residing with his
                    parents, and though they might have been at full work on high wages.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>At Friston, Suffolk, Mr
                    Stuart states that “a child is entitled to relief at the rate of three shillings
                    a week on his own account from the age of fourteen.” “At Bottisham, Cambridge,”
                    says Mr Power, “a boy of sixteen receives two shillings and sixpence for the
                    week; he lives at home with his father; the family consists of his father,
                    mother, brother, and himself. Seventeen is the age at which a young man is
                    considered entitled to separate relief as an unemployed labourer; his pay then
                    is three shillings and sixpence. The allowance to our single young men out of
                    employ used to be two shillings and tenpence; according to scale, four quartern
                    loaves, present price eightpence-halfpenny. Last November they came to the
                    sessions in a body to complain of the insufficiency, and it was then raised to
                    three shillings and sixpence. This sum they receive when above a certain age,
                    although residing with their families.” <hi rend="italic">(Ibid.</hi> p.

                    of the applicants, the employer being repaid out of the poor-rate all that he
                    had advanced in wages beyond a certain sum. This was the houserow, or roundsman,
                    or billet, or ticket, or stem, system.</p>
                <p>According to this plan, the parish in general made some agreement with a farmer
                    to sell to him the labour of one or more paupers at a certain price, and paid to
                    the pauper out of the parish funds the difference between that price and the
                    allowance which the scale, according to the price of bread and the number of his
                    family, awarded to him. It had received the name of the billet or ticket system,
                    from a ticket signed by the overseer, which the pauper in general carried to the
                    farmer as a warrant for his being employed, and took back to the overseer,
                    signed by the farmer, as a proof that he had fulfilled the conditions of relief.
                    In other cases the parish contracted with some individual to have some work
                    performed for him by the paupers at a given price, the parish paying the
                    paupers. In many places the roundsman system was effected by means of an
                    auction.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Mr Richardson

                    the year, from one shilling and sixpence a week to three shillings; that at
                    Yardley-Hastings, all the unemployed men are put up to sale weekly; and that the

                    part of the statute had been neglected, its validity was still recognised by the
                    judges. In the King <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> Collett, 2, Barnewell and
                    Cresswell, 324, Lord Tenterden decided it to be the duty of overseers to provide
                    work, if possible, before they afforded relief. And whatever might have been the
                    difficulty of finding <hi rend="italic">profitable</hi> work, one could scarcely
                    suppose the existence of a parish in whidι it would not be <hi rend="italic"
                    >possible</hi> to provide some work, were it merely to dig holes and fill them
                    again. But though such was the law, it appears, from the parliamentary returns,
                    that payment for work was the most unusual form in which relief was
                    administered. The poor-rate returns for the year ended the 25th of March 1832
                    state, that out of L.7,036,968 expended in that year for the relief of the poor,
                    less than L.354,000, or scarcely more than one twentieth part, was paid for
                    work, including work on the roads and in the workhouses. This might easily be
                    accounted for.</p>
                <p>In the first place, to afford relief gratuitously proved less troublesome to the
                    parochial authorities than to require work in return for it. Wherever work was
                    to be paid for, there must have been superintendence; but where paupers were the
                    work-people, much more than the average degree of superintendence was necessary.
                    In ordinary cases, all that the superintendent inquired was, whether the workmen
                    had performed an average day’s work; and where the work was piece-work, he
                    needed not make even that inquiry. The practice of his trade fixed the
                    market-price of the work, and he paid it without asking whether the workman had
                    been one hour or one day in performing it, or whether it exceeded or fell below
                    his wants. But the superintendent of pauper labourers had to ascertain, not what
                    was an average day’s work, or what was the market-price of a given service, but
                    what was a fair day’s work for a given individual, his strength and habits
                    considered; at what rate of pay for that work, the number of his family
                    considered, he would be able to earn the sum necessary for his and their
                    subsistence; and, lastly, whether he had in fact performed the amount which,
                    after taking all these elements into calculation, it appeared that he ought to
                    have performed. It will easily be anticipated that this superintendence was very
                    rarely given; and that in far the greater number of instances in which work was
                    professedly required from paupers, in fact no work was done. In the second
                    place, collecting the paupers in gangs for the performance of parish work was
                    found to be more immediately injurious to their conduct than even allowance or
                    relief without requiring any work at all. Whatever might have been the general
                    character of the parish labourers, all the worst of the inhabitants were sure to
                    be amongst the number; and it is well known that the effect of such an
                    association is always to degrade the good, not to elevate the bad. It was
                    amongst these gangs, who had scarcely any other employment or amusement than to
                    collect in groups, and talk over their grievances, that the riots of 1830 appear
                    to have originated. And, thirdly, parish employment did not afford direct profit
                    to any individual. Under the greatest part of the other systems of relief, the
                    immediate employers of labour could throw on the parish a part of the wages of
                    their labourers. They preferred, therefore, those modes of relief which they
                    could turn to their own account, and out of which they could extract profit
                    under the mask of charity.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>“Either the work was completed by two or three o’clock, and the rest of the
                    day spent in idleness, or the men consumed the whole day in the lazy performance
                    of the work of a portion of the day.”...“In Pollington, Yorkshire, they send
                    many of them upon the highways, but they only work <hi rend="italic">fοιιr</hi>
                    hours per day. This is because there is not employment sufficient in that way;
                    they sleep more than they work, and if any but the surveyor found them sleeping,
                    they would laugh at them. In l∙ancliffe they employed a man in the winter of
                    1830-1831 to look over them; but they threatened <hi rend="italic">to drown</hi>
                    him, and he was obliged to withdraw.”...“In the parish of Mancetter, in the
                    county of Warwick, the overseer stated that young able men received two
                    shillings and sixpence a week, and the magistrates would not allow the parish to
                    employ them more than three days in the week, in order that they might get work
                    for themselves. Upon inquiry, it appeared that their characters soon became so
                    infamous, that no person would employ them, having devoted their spare time to
                    thieving and poaching. In the township of Atherstone, Mr Wellday, a
                    manufacturer, impatient of contributing his property to the encouragement of
                    vice and idleness by paying men without exacting labour, purchased some
                    water-carts himself for the purpose of giving employment to paupers. The
                    magistrates refused to allow them to be used after twelve o’clock in the day, in
                    order that these men might procure work for themselves. They were also described
                    as becoming the most worthless characters in the town.” (Report, p. 37,
                    38.)</p></note></p>
                <p>In some of the agricultural districts, the prevalent mismanagement in this
                    respect had created in the minds of the paupers a notion that it was their right
                    to be exempted from the same degree of labour as independent labourers. But in
                    many places, whilst the labour required by the parish was trifling, the pay
                    equalled or exceeded that of the independent labourer.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Eastbourne, in Sussex, was a striking
                    example. In that place, in which the average wages earned from individuals by

                    much as sixteen shillings a week. Two families alone received from it, in the
                    year ended Lady∙day 1832, L.92. 4s.; and the wives of the few independent

                <p>II. OUT-DOOR RELIEF OF THE IMPOTENT.</p>
                <p>The out-door relief to the impotent, using that word as comprehending all except
                    the able-bodied and their families, was subject to less abuse. The great source
                    of poor-law mal-administration was the desire of many of those who regulated the
                    distribution of the parochial funds, to extract from it a profit to themselves.
                    The out-door relief to the able-bodied, and all relief which was administered in
                    the workhouse, afforded ample opportunities for effecting this purpose; but no
                    use could be made of the labour of the aged and sick, and there was little room
                    for jobbing if their pensions were paid in money. Accordingly, it was found that
                    even in places distinguished in general by the most wanton parochial profusion,
                    the allowances to the aged and infirm were moderate.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">General Remarks on Out-dοor Relief.</hi></p>
                <p>We have dwelt at some length on out-door relief because it appears to be the
                    relief which was most extensively given, and because it appears to have
                    contained in itself the elements of an almost indefinite extension; of an
                    extension, in short, which might ultimately have absorbed the whole fund out of
                    which it arose. Amongst the elements of extension were the constantly
                    diminishing reluctance to claim an apparent benefit, the receipt of which
                    imposed no sacrifice, except a sensation of shame, quickly obliterated by habit,
                    even if not prevented by example; the difficulty, often amounting to
                    impossibility, on the part of those who administered and awarded relief, of
                    ascertaining whether any and what necessity for it existed; and the existence in
                    many cases of positive motives on their parts to grant it when unnecessary, or
                    themselves to create the necessity.</p>
                <p>From the evidence collected by the Commissioners, it will be seen how zealous
                    must be the agency, and how intense<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193537198?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0718-7198-0375"/> the vigilance,
                    to prevent fraudulent claims from crowding in under such a system of relief. But
                    it would require still greater vigilance to prevent the <hi rend="italic">bona
                    fide</hi> claimants from degenerating into impostors; and it was an aphorism
                    amongst the active parish-officers, that “cases which are good today are bad
                    to-morrow, unless they are incessantly watched.” A person obtained relief upon
                    the ground of sickness; but when he became capable of returning to moderate
                    work, he was tempted, by the enjoyment of subsistence without labour, to conceal
                    his convalescence, and fraudulently extend the period of relief. When it really
                    depended upon the receivers whether the relief should cease with its occasion,
                    it was too much to expect of their virtue that they should, in any considerable
                    number of instances, voluntarily forego the pension.</p>
                <p>Another evil connected with out-door relief, and arising from its undefined
                    character, was the natural tendency to award to the deserving more than was
                    necessary, or, where more than necessary relief was afforded to all, to
                    distinguish the deserving by extra allowances. The scale which we have already
                    referred to, promulgated by the magistrates for the town of Cambridge, as well
                    as several others, all directed the parish-officers to reward or encourage the
                    deserving. The whole evidence showed the danger of such an attempt. It appeared
                    that such endeavours to constitute the distributors of relief into a tribunal
                    for the reward of merit, out of the property of others, had not only failed in
                    effecting the benevolent intentions of their promoters, but had become sources
                    of fraud on the part of the distributors, and of discontent and violence on the
                    part of the claimants.</p>
                <p>A common consequence was, that to satisfy the clamours of the undeserving, the
                    general scale of relief was raised; but the ultimate result of such a proceeding
                    appears always to have been to augment the distress which it was intended to
                    mitigate, and to render still more fierce the discontent which it was intended
                    to appease. Profuse allowances excited the most extravagant expectations on the
                    part of the claimants, who conceived that an inexhaustible fund, was devoted to
                    their use, and that they were wronged to the extent of whatever fell short of
                    their claims. Such relief partook of the nature of indiscriminate alms-giving in
                    its effects, as a bounty on indolence and vice; but the apparently legal
                    sanction to this parochial alms-giving rendered the discontent on denial the
                    most intense. Wherever, indeed, public charities are profusely administered, we
                    hear, from those who are engaged in their administration, complaints of the
                    discontent and disorders introduced.</p>
                <p>It appeared from all the Commissioners’ returns, that in every district the
                    discontent of the labouring classes was proportioned to the money disbursed in
                    poor-rates or in voluntary charities. The able-bodied unmarried labourers were
                    discontented, from being put to a disadvantage as compared with the married. The
                    paupers were discontented, from their expectations being raised by the ordinary
                    administration of the system, beyond any means of satisfying them.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>“They, as well as the
                    independent labourers, to whom the term poor is equally applied, are
                    instructed,” says Mr Chadwick, “that they have a right to ‘ a <hi rend="italic"
                    >reasonable</hi> subsistence,’ or ‘ <hi rend="italic">⅛fair</hi> subsistence,’
                    or ‘au <hi rend="italic">adequate</hi> subsistence.’ When I have asked of the
                    rate-distributors what <hi rend="italic superscript"> l</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >fair,'</hi> or <hi rend="italic">‘ reasonable,'</hi> or ‘ <hi rend="italic"
                    >adequate'</hi> meant, I have in every instance been answered differently; some
                    stating they thought it meant such as would give a good allowance of ‘ meat
                    every day,’ which no poor man (meaning a pauper) should be without; although a
                    large proportion of the rate-payers do go without it.” It is abundantly shown in
                    the course of this inquiry, that where the terms used by the public authorities
                    are vague, they are always filled up by the desires of the claimants, and the
                    desires ≡s wait on the imagination, which is the worst regulated and the most
                    vivid in the most ignorant of the people. In Newbury and ing, the money
                    dispensed in poor-rates and charity is as great as could be desired by the
                    warmest advocate either of compulsory or of voluntary relief; and yet, during
                    the agricultural riots, many of the inhabitants in both towns were under strong
                    apprehensions of the rising of the very people amongst whom the poor-rates and
                    charities are so profusely distributed. The violence of most of the mobs seems
                    to have arisen from an idea that all their privations arose from the cupidity or
                    fraud of those intrusted with the management of the fund provided for the poor.
                    (Report, p. 50.)</p></note></p>
                <p>Those who worked, though receiving good wages, being denominated <hi
                    rend="italic">poor,</hi> and classed with the really indigent, thought
                    themselves entitled to a share of the “poor funds.” Whatever addition was made
                    to allowances under these circumstances excited the expectation of still further
                    allowances, increased the conception of the extent of the right, and insured
                    proportionate disappointment and hatred if that expectation were not satisfied.
                    On the other hand, wherever the objects of expectation had been made definite,
                    where wages, upon the performance of work, had been substituted for eleemosynary
                    aid, and those wageshad been allowed tore-main matter of contract, employment
                    had again produced content, and kindness became once more a source of
                    gratitude.</p>
                <p>III. IN-DOORS RELIEF.</p>
                <p>In-doors relief, that which was given within the walls of the poor-house, or, as
                    it was usually, but very seldom properly, denominated, the workhouse, was also
                    subject to great mal-administration. But in by far the greater number of cases
                    it was a large alms-house, in which the young were trained in idleness, and
                    ignorance, and vice; the able-bodied maintained in sluggish and sensual
                    indolence; the aged and more respectable exposed to all the misery incident to
                    dwelling in such a society, without government or classification; and the whole
                    body of inmates subsisting on food far exceeding, both in kind and in amount,
                    not merely the diet of the independent labourer, but that of the majority of the
                    persons who contributed to their support.</p>
                <p>The progress of pauperism, as far as it can be inferred from the progress of
                    expenditure, had been such as is exhibited in the following table; to which the
                    prices of wheat, and the quantities which might have been purchased by the total
                    sums expended, are added, for the purpose of checking, in some measure, the
                    misapprehension which might otherwise arise as to the true value of the sums
                    expended through the fluctuating values of money during the interval to which
                    the table extends.</p>

                <p>The foregoing table, however, can by no means be adopted as indicating with any
                    accuracy the real progress of the evil. In the first place, the progress in the
                    amount expended only indicates an increased proportion of pauperism, inasmuch as
                    the increase in the sums expended exceeds the increase in the population. Thus,
                    from the year 1803 to the year 1823, the population increased from nine to
                    twelve millions, whilst the sums expended for relief of the poor increased from
                    four to five and three-fourth millions. This indicates but a small increase in
                    pauperism relatively to the increase of population, and the number of paupers in
                    every hundred persons might have been nearly the same at the two periods
                    compared. We find, however, that the increase in the value of the money
                    expended, as reckoned in the wheat purchaseable by it, was as fourteen to
                    twenty-two, that is, an increase in pauperism which would have exceeded the
                    progress of the population in the proportion of twenty per cent.; and in this
                    period it is to be supposed, either that the numbers of paupers may have
                    increased in the proportion of twenty per cent., or that the effective relief,
                    that is, the quantity of commodities given on the one side and received on the
                    other, had at least. increased in the proportion of twenty per cent. But, during
                    all this period, other necessaries and commodities of life had diminished in
                    price in a still greater proportion. Thus it is calculated by Mr Porter,<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See the Progress of the
                    Nation, by G. R. Porter, Esq. small 8vo, 183G, p. 83.</p></note> from the
                    extensive data contained in his tables, that the sum of nine shillings and
                    ninepence, the amount of relief per head, in the year 1831, would have purchased
                    as much as seventeen shillings would have bought in 1801.</p>
                <p>The sums returned as expended in poor-rates, though, since 1834 and at present,
                    they represent the whole amount of the burthen, did, in fact, up to the year
                    1834, include but a small part of the whole charge. Of the various modes in
                    which relief was given to the able-bodied labourer, or rather extorted from a
                    portion of the parishioners, two of those above described, viz. relief on the
                    roundsman system, and that on the labour-rate system, were means of casting the
                    burthen of a man’s support upon a parishioner, without the levying or expending
                    of any rate. No means exist to enable us to calculate the amount of the burthen
                    thus incurred by the occupiers; and of course the means of calcu lating the
                    sacrifices of landlords, who made deductions of rate in regard of these charges,
                    are equally wanting. We however find, that amongst the most conspicuous
                    instances in which the rents of a parish had been nearly or entirely absorbed in
                    the relief afforded by these two systems, very small rates had been levied upon
                    the occupiers in money. The Commissioners’ evidence, particularly their
                    Appendix</p>
                <p>(D), is full of instances of this source of indirect and unrecorded loss.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Mr Cowell’s Report contains
                    the examination of a large farmer and proprietor at Great Shelford, who, on 500
                    acres, situated in that parish, pays ten shillings peracre poor-rate, or L.250 a
                    year. In addition, though he requires for his farm only sixteen regular
                    labourers, he constantly employs twenty or twenty-one. The wages of these
                    supernumerary labourers amount to L.150 a year, and he calculates the value of
                    what they produce at L.50 a year; so that his real contribution to the relief of
                    the poor is not L.250, the sum which would appear in the parliamentary returns,
                    but L.350. In the same Report is to be found a letter from Mr ΛVedd of Royston,
                    containing the following passages:</p><p>“An occupier of land near this place
                    told me to-day that he pays L.100 for poor-rates, and is compelled to employ
                    fourteen men and six boys, and requires the labour of only ten men and three
                    boys. His extra labour at ten shillings a week, which is the current rate for
                    men, and half as much for boys, is L.130.</p><p>“Another occupier stated
                    yesterday that he held 165 acres of land, of which half was pasture. He was
                    compelled to employ twelve men and boys, and his farm required the labour of
                    only five. He is about to give notice that he will quit. Every useless labourer
                    is calculated to add five shillings an acre to the rent of a farm of 100
                    acres.”</p><p>It contains also a letter from Mr Nash of Royston, the occupier of
                    a farm in a neighbouring parish, stating that “The overseer, on the plea that he
                    could no longer collect the money for the poor-rates without resorting to
                    coercive measures, and that the unemployed poι.r must be apportioned amongst the
                    occupiers of land in proportion to their respective quantities, had required him
                    to take two more men. Mr Nash was consequently obliged to displace two excellent
                    labourers, and of the two men sent in their stead one <hi rend="superscript">
                    wa</hi> ≡ a married man with a family sickly, and not much inclined to work; the
                    other a single man addicted to drinking.”</p><p>The subsequent history of these
                    two men appears in Mr Power’s Report. One killed a favourite blood mare of Mr
                    Nash’s, and the other he was obliged to prosecute for stealing his corn.
                    (Report, p. 55.)</p></note></p>
                <p>It must also be borne in mind, that in proportion as these modes of relief to the
                    able-bodied were extended, and as the real amount of the burthen was thus
                    concealed, the deterioration of the labourer’s habits of industry, involving,
                    not a loss of the particular year, but a permanent destruction of his utility as
                    a labourer, as well as of his prudence and morality, were proceeding in a ratio
                    even more rapid than the progress of these insidious forms of relief.</p>
                <p>It might have been hoped, that, under such circumstances, a general feeling would
                    have arisen that these abuses were intolerable, and must be put an end to at any
                    risk or at any sacrifice. But many who acknowledged the evil seemed to expect
                    the cure of an inveterate disease without exposing the patient to any suffering,
                    or even discomfort. They exclaimed against the burthen as intolerable, but
                    objected to any amendment, if it appeared that it must be, or might be, attended
                    with any inconvenience. And amongst all parties, labourers, employers of
                    labourers, and owners of property, many were to be found who thought that they
                    would suffer some immediate injury from any change which should tend to throw
                    the labouring classes on their own resources.</p>
                <p>The labourer felt that the existing system, though it generally gave him low
                    wages, always gave him easy work. It gave him likewise, strange as it may
                    appear, what he valued more, a sort of independence. He needed not bestir
                    himself to seek work, he needed not study to please his master, he needed not
                    put any restraint upon his temper, he needed not ask relief as a favour. He had
                    all a slave’s security Tor subsistence, without his liability to punishment. As
                    a single man, indeed, his income did not exceed a bare subsistence; but he had
                    only to marry, and it increased. Even then it was unequal to the support of a
                    family, but it rose on the birth of every child. If his family were numerous,
                    the parish became his principal paymaster; for, small as the usual allowance of
                    two shillings a-head might be, yet, when there were more than three children, it
                    generally exceeded the average wages given in a pauperised district. A man with
                    a wife and six children, entitled, according to the scale, to have his wages
                    made up to sixteen shillings a week, in a parish where the usual wages paid by
                    individuals did not exceed ten shillings or twelve shillings, was almost an
                    irresponsible being. All other classes of society were exposed<pb break="no"

                    vicissitudes of hope and fear; he alone had nothing to lose or gain.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Even in Barnard Castle, in
                    Durham, Mr Wilson states, that if any remonstrance is made on account of the
                    applicant’s bad character, the reply of the magistrate commonly is, “the
                    children must not suffer for it.”</p><p>The following answers are specimens of
                    the feeling and conduct in the southern districts :—“The answer given by the
                    magistrates, when a man’s bad conduct is urged by the overseer against his
                    relief, is, ‘ We cannot help that; his wife and family are not to suffer because
                    the man has done wrong.’”</p><p>“Too frequently petty thieving, drunkenness, or
                    impertinence to a master, throw able-bodied labourers, perhaps with large
                    families, on the parish funds, when relief is demanded as a right, and, if
                    refused, enforced by a magistrate’s order, without reference to the cause which
                    has produced his distress, viz. his own misconduct, which remains as a barrier
                    to his obtaining any fresh situation, and leaves him a dead weight upon the
                    honesty and industry of his parish.”</p><p>Mr Stuart states, that in Suffolk,
                    children deserted by their parents are in general well taken care of, and that
                    the crime of deserting them is largely encouraged by the certainty that the
                    parish must support the family. Even the inconvenience which might fall on the
                    husband by the punishment of his wife for theft, is made the subject of
                    pecuniary compensation at the expense of the injured parish. Under what other
                    system could there be a judicial instrument concluding thus;—</p><p>“And whereas
                    it appears to us that the wife of the said Robert Reed is now confined in the
                    house of correction at Cambridge, and that he is put to considerable expense in
                    providing a person to look after his said five children, we do therefore <hi

                <p>It appeared to the pauper, that the government had undertaken to repeal, in his
                    favour, the ordinary laws of nature; to enact that the children should not
                    suffer for the misconduct of their parents, the wife for that of the husband, or
                    the husband for that of the wife; that no one should lose the means of
                    comfortable subsistence, whatever might be his indolence, prodigality, or vice;
                    in short, that the penalty which, after all, must be paid by some one for
                    idleness and improvidence, should fall, not on the guilty person, or on his
                    family, but on the proprietors of the lands and houses encumbered by his
                    settlement. Can we wonder if the uneducated were seduced into approving a system
                    which aimed its allurements at all the weakest parts of our nature, which
                    offered marriage to the young, security to the anxious, ease to the lazy, and
                    impunity to the profligate?</p>
                <p>The employers of paupers were attached to a system which enabled them to dismiss
                    and resume their labourers according to their daily or even hourly want of them,
                    to reduce wages to the minimum of what would support an unmarried man, and to
                    throw upon others the payment of a part, frequently of the greater part, and
                    sometimes almost the whole, of the wages actually received by their labourers.
                    And even if they paid in rates what they would otherwise pay in wages, they
                    preferred the payment of rates, which occurred at intervals, and the payment of
                    which might from time to time be put off, to the weekly readymoney expenditure
                    of wages. High rates, too, were a ground for demanding an abatement from rent;
                    but high wages w ere not.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>In Air Richardson’s instructive statement of the reforms effected by Air
                    Litchfield, in Farthingoe, Northamptonshire, we find that Air Litchfield has
                    been opposed, not only by the labourers, but by the farmers; first, because they
                    grudged giving the labourer with no children eight shillings a week; secondly,
                    because they were afraid to displease the labourer who had two children, and
                    preferred head-money; and, thirdly, because they were fearful lest, if the rates
                    were lowered, their rents would be raised; and that they encouraged the
                    labourers, at first openly, and afterwards covertly, in their attempts to deter
                    Air Litchfield by menaces and insult.</p><p>“When a valuer,” says Mr Cowell,
                    “values a farm to an in∙coming tenant, or fixes the rent from time to time (in
                    these parts they have no leases), he savs, ‘ What are your poor-rates ?’ If the
                    tenant answer, ‘ Rates are low, but wages are high, the valuer says, ‘ I have
                    nothing to do with <hi rend="italic">wages,</hi> that is your affair; but <hi
                    rend="italic">rates</hi> are a <hi rend="italic">positive thing,</hi> and I
                    allow for <hi rend="italic">them.</hi> This Mr Ellman considers as a bad custom,
                    as it holds out an inducement to the farmer to prefer low wages and high rates.
                    Tenants at will, says Air Cogshill, too often think, the more poor-rates the
                    less rent Confidence between landlord and tenant seems quite lost. I have
                    witnessed a good deal of this.”</p><p>The following replies to question 36 of
                    the Commissioners’ Rural Queries are further testimonies to the same
                    effect.</p><p>“I think the poor-laws have not diminished the capital, but rather
                    the rent of the landlord, as the tenant considers rents and rates as payment for
                    the farm, and one can only be increased at the expense of the other.”</p><p>“The
                    farmers are aware that, excepting in cases of long tenures and very sudden
                    augmentation of rates, the burden does not at all affect them. It is a rent paid
                    to the parish instead of the landowner.”</p><p>“It should be understood that
                    poor-rates are deducted in all calculations for rent; and that landlords pay
                    them, and not the farmers.”</p><p>« Capital is decreasing, from the loose manner
                    in which the laws are administered, and the tenants feeling that they αo not in
                    effect pay the rates, but the landlord. I cannot otherwise account for Jhe
                    apathy with which they view, and the tenacity with which, in many instances,
                    they defend abuses.” (Report, pp. 60, 61, 62.)</p></note></p>
                <p>The owners of rateable property might, at least, have been expected to be
                    favourable to any change which should avert their impending ruin. But of the
                    property liable to poor-rates, there is a portion, and a portion of considerable
                    importance, less from its value, than from the number of rate-payers amongst
                    whom it is divided, and their influence in vestries, which not only is, in
                    practice, exempted from contributing to the parochial fund, but derives its
                    principal value from the mal-administration of that fund. This property consists
                    of cottages or apartments inhabited by the poor. In almost all places the
                    dwellings of the poor, or at least of the settled poor, were exempted from
                    rates, and, besides, the rent was, in a very large proportion, paid by the
                    parish. The former practice enabled the proprietor often to in - crease the rent
                    by the amount of rate remitted, and always to be an owner of real property, and
                    yet escape the principal burdens to which such property was subjected. The
                    latter practice gave him a solvent tenant, and, if he had influence with the
                    vestry or with the overseer, a liberal one.</p>
                <p>Of the higher classes of landlords, those who reside in towns seldom took much
                    part in parochial government, or had any distinct ideas as to the extent or the
                    effects of its mismanagement; and the majority of those who had become
                    familiarized with the abuses of the villages seem to have acquired habits of
                    thinking and feeling and acting which unfitted them to originate any real and
                    extensive amendment, or even to understand the principles upon which it ought to
                    be based. To suppose that the poor are the proper managers of their own
                    concerns; that a man’s wages ought to depend on his services, not on his wants;
                    that the earnings of an ordinary labourer are naturally equal to the support of
                    an ordinary family; that the welfare of that family naturally depends on his
                    conduct; that he is bound to exercise any sort of prudence or economy; that
                    anything is to be hoped from voluntary charity; are views which many of those
                    who have long resided in pauperised rural districts seem to have rejected as too
                    absurd for formal refutation.</p>

                <p>Yet were tlιe effects of the system such, that it might reasonably have been
                    expected that any plan affording a reasonable prospect of a remedy would have
                    been welcomed by all classes. The proprietors, who had been mulcted <hi

                    income, were not only deprived of the benefits to their property naturally
                    dependent on a constant increase of the population and in the consumption of
                    produce, each such increase bringing with it an accumulating charge of
                    pauperism. Instances of the total abandonment of the land had not yet become
                    numerous, but the approach towards it was in many cases imminent, and in all
                    certain and rapid;<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See
                    the Commissioners’ Report, page 65, where instances like the following are given
                    from all parts of the country. The present is taken from Leicestershire, a
                    county not within the range of the extreme operation of pauperism. “Mr
                    Pilkington’s description of several places in Leicestershire is equally
                    alarming. In Hinckley he found the poor-rate exceeding one pound an acre, and
                    rapidly increasing, and a general opinion that the day is not distant when rent
                    must cease altogether. On visiting Wigston Magna, in November 1832, he was
                    informed that the value of property had fallen one half since 1820, and was not
                    saleable even at that reduction. It does not appear, indeed, that it ought to
                    have sold for more than two or three years’ purchase, the net rental not
                    amounting to L.4000 a year, and the poor-rate expenditure growing at the rate of
                    L∙1000 increase in a single year. And on his return to that neighbourhood, three
                    months afterwards, the statement made to him was, that property in land was
                    gone; that even the rates could not be collected without regular summons and
                    judicial sales; and that the present system must insure, and very shortly, the
                    total ruin of every individual of any property in the parish. We cannot wonder,
                    after this, at the statement of an eminent solicitor at Loughborough, that it is
                    now scarcely possible to effect a sale of property in that neighbourhood at any
                    price.”</p><p>The following answers, taken from a multitude of others of a
                    similar nature, contained in Appendix (B), are to the same effect:— “Annual
                    value of the real property, as assessed April 1815, L.3390; annual value of the
                    real property, as assessed November 1829, L.1959. 5s. It has undoubtedly fallen
                    in value since the last valuation, i. <hi rend="italic">e.</hi> in the last two
                    years; and the population has been more than trebled in thirty years—1801, 306;
                    1811, 707; 1821, 897; 1831, 938; and that in sp’te of an emigration of
                    considerable amount, at the parish expense, in 1829. The eighteen-penny children
                    will eat up this parish in ten years more, unless some relief be afforded us.”
                    (Report, pp. 65, 66.)</p></note><hi rend="superscript"> l</hi> whilst every
                    diminution of cultivation was seen to have a double effect in increasing the
                    rate on the remaining cultivation, the number of unemployed labourers being
                    increased at the same instant as the fund for payment of rates was diminished;
                    and the abandonment of property once begun, gave induced cause to proceed at an
                    accelerated ratio.</p>
                <p>The employers found the services of their labourers deteriorated both by the loss
                    of industry, skill, and intelligence, which can only be secured by a
                    recognition, on the part of the labourer, of the value to himself of such
                    qualities; and they had to contend with many other habits of insolence and
                    insubordination, the natural results of the labourer’s ceasing to depend upon
                    his good character.</p>
                <p>But by far the severest, sufferers were those for whose benefit the system was
                    supposed to have been introduced and perpetuated; we mean the labourers and
                    their families. Amongst these, the effects were not confined to those actually
                    relieved. Instances were everywhere found in which the prudence and forethought
                    of a labourer became his punishment instead of a reward. So onerous was the
                    entire support of a man with a large family, and entirely destitute, that the
                    rate-payers in agricultural parishes were generally agreed in employing such a
                    one, so as to keep his family off the rates, in preference to another who had
                    not married, or who had no family, or who had the means, by greater prudence or
                    by any good fortune, for a while to support himself.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See striking evidences of these influences in
                    the Report, page 78· <hi rend="superscript"> t ic</hi> Will it be believed that
                    such is not merely the cruelty, but the folly, of the rate-payers in many
                    places, that they prohibit this conduct (the anxiety of an independent labourer
                    to make provisions for his family by his own exertions)—that they conspire to
                    deny the man who, in defiance of the examples of all around him, has dared to
                    save, and attempts to keep his savings, the permission to work fur his bread?
                    Such a statement appears so monstrous, that we will substantiate it by some
                    extracts from our evidence.”</p><p>Sir Harry Verney, in a communication which
                    will be found in Appendix (C), says, “In the hundred of Buckingham, in which I
                    act as a magistrate, many instances occur where labourers are unable to obtain
                    employment, because they have property of their own. For instance, in the parish
                    of Steeple Claydon, John Lines, formerly a soldier, a very good workman, is’
                    refused employment because he receives a pension. The farmers say that they
                    cannot afford to employ those for whom they are not bound by law to
                    provide.”</p><p><pb corresp="kp-eb0718-7250-0379" xml:id="pbn7379"/> “The effect
                    of allowance,” says Mr Stuart, “is to weaken, if not to destroy, all the ties of
                    affection between parent and child. Whenever a lad comes to earn wages, or to
                    receive parish relief on his own account” (and this we must recollect is at the
                    age of fourteen), “although he may continue"to lodge with his parents, he does
                    not throw his money into a common purse, and board with them, but buys his own
                    loaf and piece of bacon, which he devours alone. The most disgraceful quarrels
                    arise from mutual accusations of theft; and as the child knows that he has been
                    nurtured at the expense of the parish, he has no filial attachment to his
                    parents. The circumstances of the pauper stand in an inverted relation to those
                    of every other rank in society. Instead of a family being a source of care,
                    anxiety, and expense, for which he hopes to be rewarded by the filial return of
                    assistance and support when they grow up, there is no period in his life in
                    which he tastes less of solicitude, or in which he has the means of obtaining
                    all the necessaries of life in greater abundance; but as he is alwavs sure of
                    maintenance, it is in general the practice to enjoy life when he can, and no
                    thought is taken for the morrow. Those parents who are thoroughly degraded and
                    demoralized by the effects of ‘ allowance,’ not only take no means to train up
                    their children to habits of industry, but do their utmost to prevent their
                    obtaining employment, lest it should come to the knowledge of the
                    parish-officers, and be laid hold of for the purpose of taking away the
                    allowance.”</p><p>“At Princes Risborough, we turned over the minute-book of the
                    Select Vestry, and found the following entries:</p><p>“ ‘ Samuel Simmons’s wife
                    applied to be allowed something for looking after her mother, who is confined to
                    her bed; the mother now receives 3s. Cd. weekly. To be allowed an additional 6d.
                    for a few weeks.’</p><p>“ ‘ David Walker’s wife applied to be allowed something
                    for looking after her father and mother (old Stevens and his wife), now ill, who
                    receive Cs. weekly. To be allowed 1 s. weekly.’</p><p>“ ‘ Mary Lacy applies for
                    something for waiting on her mother, now ill. Left to the governor.* ,</p><p>' “
                    ‘ Elizabeth Prime applies to have something allowed for her sister looking after
                    her father, now ill. Left to the governor.’ “ (Report, pp. 96, 97∙) -</p></note>
                    The system, in short, was this.</p>
                <p>Piece-work was refused to the single man, or to the married man, if he had any
                    property, because they could exist upon day-wages; it was refused to the active
                    and intelligent labourer, because he could earn too much. The enterprising man,
                    who had fled from the tyranny and pauperism of his parish to some place where
                    there was a demand and a reward for his services, was driven from a situation
                    which suited him, and an employer to whom he was attached, by a labour-rate or
                    some other device against non-parishioners, and forced back to his settlement to
                    receive as alms a portion only of what he was obtaining by his own exertions. He
                    was driven from a place where he was earning, as a free labourer, twelve or
                    fourteen shillings a week, and was offered road-work as a pauper, at sixpence a
                    day, or perhaps to be put up by the parish authorities to auction, and sold to
                    the farmer who would take him at the lowest allowance.</p>
                <p>Can we wonder, then, if the labourer abandoned virtues of which this was the
                    reward; if he gave up the economy in return for which he had been proscribed,
                    the diligence for which he had been condemned to involuntary idleness, and the
                    prudence, if it can be called such, which diminished his means just as much as
                    it diminished his wants? Can we wonder if, smarting under these oppressions, he
                    considered the law, and all who administered the law, as his enemies, the fair
                    objects of his fraud or his violence? Can we wonder if, to increase his income,
                    and to revenge himself on the parish, he married, and thus helped to increase
                    that local excess of population which was gradually eating away the fund out of
                    which he and all the other labourers of the parish were to be maintained?</p>
                <p>But though the injustice perpetrated upon the man who struggled, as far as he
                    could struggle, against the oppression of the system, who refused, as íàr as he
                    could refuse, to be its accomplice, was at first sight the most revolting, the
                    severest sufferers were those that had become callous to their own degradation,
                    who valued parish support as their privilege, and demanded it as their right,
                    and complained only that it was limited in amount, or that some sort of labour
                    or confinement was exacted in return. No man’s principles can be corrupted
                    without injury to society in general; but the person most injured is the person
                    whose principles have been corrupted. The constant war which the pauper had to
                    wage with all who employed or paid him, was destructive of his honesty and his
                    temper; as his subsistence did not depend on his exertions, he lost all that
                    sweetens labour, its association with reward, and got through his work, such as
                    it was, with the reluctance of a slave. His pay, earned by importunity or fraud,
                    or even violence, was not husbanded with the carefulness which would be given to
                    the results of industry, but wasted in the intemperance to which his ample
                    leisure invited him. The ground upon which relief was ordered to the idle and
                    dissolute was, that the wife and children must not suffer for the vices of the
                    head of the family; but as that relief was almost always <pb corresp="pbn7379"
                    facs="nls:193537250?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0718-7250-0379"/> given into the
                    hands of the vicious husband or parent, this excuse was obviously absurd. It
                    appears from the evidence that the great supporters of the beer-shops were the
                    paupers.</p>
                <p>The worst of results, however, are still to be mentioned. In all ranks of
                    society, the great sources of happiness and virtue were the domestic affections,
                    and this was particularly the case amongst those who had so few resources as the
                    labouring classes. Now pauperism seems to have become an engine for the purpose
                    of disconnecting each member of a family from all the others, and of reducing
                    all to the state .of domesticated animals, fed, lodged, and provided for by the
                    parish, without mutual dependence or mutual interest. <hi rend="superscript">

                <p>CHAPTER IV.</p>
                <p>REMEDIAL MEASURES PROPOSED AND ADOPTED.</p>
                <p>It has been a frequent subject of public remark, that the remedial measures
                    proposed by the Commissioners of Inquiry were the result of a process more
                    deliberately and completely inductive than was to be found in any other instance
                    of English, or indeed of any legislation. It is impossible to give any
                    impression of the extent and value of the evidence upon which their conclusions
                    were supported, otherwise than by a repetition of nearly the whole of the Report
                    in which their remedial measures were detailed. This is impossible in the space
                    allotted to this article; but to those interested, not only in the present
                    question, but in acquainting themselves with a most masterly example of
                    legislative investigation, no greater service can be done than to refer them to
                    the document itself, which has been eharaeterized by one of the most eminent,
                    candid, and experienced of our statesmen, as one of the ablest state-papers he
                    ever read.</p>
                <p>The following description will exhibit a mere summary of the remedies proposed
                    and adopted, with little more than hints of the reasonings upon which they were
                    founded.</p>
                <p>The Commissioners by no means adopted the opinion that a poor-law could, in a
                    community like ours, be dispensed with. They found that the most pressing of the
                    evils of the poor-laws were those connected with the relief of the able-bodied,
                    and to these they suggested their first remedies. They assumed as their
                    principle of administration, that the public is warranted in imposing such
                    conditions on the individual relieved, as are conducive to the comfort either of
                    the.individual himself, or of the country at large at whose expense he is
                    relieved.</p>
                <p>' They proposed, then, as the first and most essential of all conditions of
                    relief, that the situation of the pauper, upon the whole, should not be made
                    really or apparently so eligible as the situation of the independent labourer of
                    the lowest class. It was shown throughout the evidence, that as the condition of
                    the pauper class was elevated, the condition of the independent class was
                    depressed, their industry impaired, their employment rendered unsteady, and its
                    remuneration diminished. Sueh persons, therefore, were under the strongest
                    inducements to quit the <hi rend="italic">less eligible class of labourers,</hi>
                    and enter the <hi rend="italic">more eligible class of paupers.</hi> The
                    Commissioners maintained that the converse would be, and was found to be, the
                    effect of placing the pauper class in its proper position below the condition of
                    the independent labourer. They found, on a large examination of the eases of
                    strict administration of relief on the principle of letting the labourer find in
                    the parish the hardest taskmaster and the worst paymaster he ean have, that the
                    parish had always become his last, and not his first, resource; and they found
                    largely exemplified those specific results which invariably ensue from sueh an
                    administration.</p>
                <p>The first and immediate effect, was the conversion of the able-bodied paupers
                    into independent labourers. The second result, indeed a corollary of the first,
                    was the reduction of the parochial expenditure, constituting an increase of the
                    fund for the employment of independent labourers. The third effect, closely
                    connected with and following the absorption of able-bodied paupers, and their
                    conversion into independent labourers, was the rise in .wages. The fourth class
                    of the observed specific effects was the diminution, not only of
                    pauper-marriages, but of those imprudent marriages contracted with the knowledge
                    and confidence that the worst result to be apprehended was an eventual
                    dependence upon the poor-rate. The fifth and last specific effect dwelt upon by
                    the Commissioners, and illustrated by their evidence, was the diminution of
                    crime, and the contentment of the labourers increasing with their industry.</p>
                <p>The Commissioners, in endeavouring to obtain thegeneral adoption of this
                    principle, cautiously avoided the recommendation of speculative remedies; they
                    dwelt anxiously and emphatically upon the necessity and the safety of adopting a
                    course of legislation which may be considered as wholly experimental. They
                    propose, therefore, no changes in the principle of the law, but confine their
                    recommendations to this, that the means which have been found the most effective
                    in practice, should be applied wherever it was found applicable with the
                    prospect of a beneficial result.</p>
                <p>To secure this operation, they recommend the adoption of a new and more
                    responsible agency to co-operate with and control that which had been found for
                    the most part inefficient, or greatly efficient for mischief. Some excrescences
                    in the law they propose to lop off, but no additions beyond the improvement of
                    the agency were proposed to be introduced in the principle of the statute of
                    Elizabeth, and the succeeding legislation. They recommend, therefore, “that
                    those modes of administering relief which have been <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193537263?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0718-7263-0380"/> tried and
                    found beneficial, be generally enforced” (Report, p. 261); and “that the
                    practice of giving relief in well-regulated workhouses, and the abolition of
                    partial relief to the able-bodied, having been tried and found beneficial, be
                    extended to all places.” <hi rend="italic">(Ibid.</hi> p. 262.)</p>
                <p>The first and chief specific measure recommended by them was thus described
                    :—“<hi rend="italic">First,</hi> That, except as to medical attendance, and
                    subject to the exception respecting apprenticeship hereinafter stated, all
                    relief whatever to able-bodied persons, or to their families, otherwise than in
                    well-regulated workhouses <hi rend="italic">(i. e.</hi> places where they may be
                    set to work according to the spirit and intention of the 43d of Elizabeth),
                    shall be declared unlawful, and shall cease, in manner and at periods hereafter
                    specified; and that all relief afforded in respect of children under the age of
                    sixteen shall be considered as afforded to their parents.” <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Ibid.</hi> p. 262.)</p>
                <p>This adoption of the workhouse and its restrictions as the condition upon which
                    relief was to be administered, was advised, because it would operate, in the
                    first place, as a self-acting test of the claim of the applicant, it being urged
                    “That it is demoralizing and ruinous to offer to the able-bodied of the best
                    characters more than a simple subsistence. The person of bad character, if he be
                    allowed anything, could not be allowed less. By the means which we propose, the
                    line between those who do, and those who do not, need relief, is drawn, and
                    drawn perfectly. If the claimant docs not comply with the terms on which relief
                    is given to the destitute, he gets nothing; and if he does comply, the
                    compliance proves the truth of the claim, namely, his destitution. If, then,
                    regulations were established and enforced with the degree of strictness that has
                    been attained in the dispauper - ised parishes, the workhouse doors might be
                    thrown open to all who would enter them, and conform to the regulations. Not
                    only would no agency for contending against fraudulent rapacity and perjury, no
                    stages of appeals (vexatious to the appellants and painful to the magistrates),
                    be requisite to keep the able-bodied from the parish; but the intentions of the
                    statute of Elizabeth, in setting the idle to work, might be accomplished, and
                    vagrants and mendicants actually forced on the parish, that is, forced into a
                    condition of salutary restriction and labour. It would be found that they might
                    be supported much cheaper under proper regulations than when living at large by
                    mendicity or depredation.” <hi rend="italic">(Ibid.</hi> p. 264.)</p>
                <p>In the <hi rend="italic">second</hi> place, it was observed by the Commissioners,
                    that “Little need be said on the next effect of the abolition of partial relief
                    (even independently of workhouse regulations), in drawing a broad line of
                    distinction between the paupers and the independent labourers. Experience has
                    shown, that <hi rend="subscript"> k</hi> it will induce many of those whose
                    wants arise from their idleness, to earn the means of subsistence; repress the
                    fraudulent claims of those who have now adequate means of independent support;
                    and obtain for others assistance from their friends, who are willing to see
                    their relations pensioners, but would exert themselves to prevent their being
                    inmates of a workhouse.” <hi rend="italic">(Ibid.</hi> p. 276.)</p>
                <p>In the <hi rend="italic">third</hi> place, it was relied on to remove much of the
                    evil arising from the situation of the distributors of relief, who, having many
                    modes of relief at their disposal, were rendered liable to odium and revenge
                    when they chose a more strict mode of administration, and were liable to be
                    seduced by all the motives which the love of popularity, fear, or the cajolery,
                    importunity, or mènaces of the applicant presented, to adopt a lax
                    administration.</p>
                <p>These reasons appear to have entirely prevailed with the legislature, who
                    accordingly adopted them in principle, only modifying them thus far in their
                    form. Combining the effect of this recommendation with the one subsequently to
                    be described, the institution of a central board, the legislature—not fixing any
                    determinate period, but bearing in mind the magnitude of the amount of the
                    existing out-door relief to able-bodied men and their families, with the
                    possibility that the means might not suffice at the periods to be specified, for
                    affording all the workhouse relief that might be required upon a sudden
                    cessation of all other relief—adopted the plan of leaving the determination of
                    the period at which out-door relief should cease, and relief in the workhouse
                    become the invariable rule, to the judgment of the central board; that board
                    having power to adopt a different course in different districts, to adopt the
                    workhouse relief entirely and at once where the means existed, and in others to
                    prepare the way by procuring workhouses, and the gradual substitution of relief
                    in kind for relief in money, and by other intermediate and preparatory
                    operations. (See the Act, sect. 52.) As a consequence of adopting this course,
                    all restrictions imposed by previous acts upon officers, with a view of
                    preventing them from applying the workhouse to able-bodied men, are repealed
                    (sect. 53); and authority to direct the purchase, the furnishing, and the
                    management of workhouses is given to the central board.</p>
                <p>The legislature adopted, without change, except by way of addition, so much of
                    this recommendation as has the effect of identifying the relief to an
                    unemancipatcd child with the relief to the parent; the intended effect being to
                    render the parent as responsible for providing for his children as for himself,
                    and subject to the same consequences of neglect in either case, so that he
                    cannot seek relief for his child, without submitting to the condition upon which
                    alone he could obtain it for himself, or otherwise. The legislature adopted with
                    this recommendation these expansions and additions: Relief of the wife is made
                    relief to the husband; of the child, to the parent, to the father if living, or
                    otherwise to the widow (sect. 56); and of the bastard child, to the mother
                    (sect. 71). Moreover, a man marrying since the act, is made liable to maintain
                    the children which his wife has at the time of her marriage, until they attain
                    the age of sixteen, or until her death (sect. 57); this last provision being
                    made with the view that the man is liable to all the civil obligations of his
                    wife existing at the time of her marriage, excepting this obligation, which must
                    commonly have been of all her obligations the most notorious. As the law stood,
                    a woman’s family, legitimate or illegitimate, was, by her marriage, cast on the
                    parish for support, and the allowances made to them constituted an annuity to
                    the married couple, forming an inducement of extraordinary frequency to
                    marriages in all other respects the most improvident.</p>
                <p>The Commissioners’ second specific measure was thus proposed :—“We recommend,
                    therefore, the appointment of a central board to control the administration of
                    the poor-laws, with such assistant commissioners as may be found requisite; and
                    that the commissioners be empowered and directed to frame and enforce
                    regulations for the government of workhouses, and as to the nature and amount of
                    the relief to be given and the labour to be exacted in them; and that such
                    regulations shall, as far as may be practicable, be uniform throughout the
                    country.” (Report, p. 296.)</p>
                <p>The reasons for the establishment of this agency are eloquently and most
                    instructively stated in the Report; especially the reasons for relying rather
                    upon a constantly acting agency, with the means of judging at every moment of
                    the extent to which its measures would then apply, in preference to relying upon
                    a mere legislative enactment, however valuable the principle involved, or
                    stringent its provisions might be. Instances of the most striking kind are
                    given, not only of the failure of such enactments, but of their conversion to
                    purposes directly contrary to their object, where no authority was erected
                    responsible for conducting their operations. The other grounds for this
                    recommendation were chiefly the impossibility of choosing a succession of
                    overseers or other annual officers with appropriate<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193537276?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0718-7276-0381"/> knowledge,
                    still less with the enlarged experience of the means to be used, or an
                    enlightened appreciation of the objects to bc attained; next, the short duration
                    of the office, which, even where able officers are occasionally found, prevents
                    the continued application of their experience, precisely at the time when their
                    efficiency has become the greatest; next, the division of the districts for
                    which they served, preventing co-operation or the dispersion of the knowledge
                    obtained on one spot over the others to which it might be applicable. Scarcely
                    an instance was found of a parish being dispauperised, the example of which was
                    followed even by a single adjoining parish. Reference was also made to the
                    inadequacy of the motives of any officer to support a sound administration: his
                    responsibility little or none,—his gain no more than that of every other
                    rate-payer occupying as largely as himself,—the loss of time and of energy,—the
                    danger of misapprehension by those he sought to serve, and of failure in the
                    whole object, great,—the certainty of odium from the pauper and from the
                    prejudiced amongst his fellow-parishioners, and ofjealousy from rival officers,
                    being inevitable,—whilst, on the other hand, the strength of the interests in
                    abusive administration, by which one man may make to himself a gain of the
                    losses of many, whilst by the best administration he can only save himself from
                    the loss falling to the share of one,—the confederacy of those who recognise
                    their interest in such corrupt gain,—the popularity to be acquired by liberality
                    in the disposal of funds contributed by others,—form some few of the motives to
                    uphold the prevailing abusive administration. In these views the Commissioners
                    adopted the conclusion, that whatever might be the intentions of the
                    legislature, they would be best carried out by a permanent authority,
                    accumulating experience in itself, independent of local control, uninterested in
                    favour of local abuse, but responsible for carrying into effect the law which it
                    was appointed to execute. This recommendation was adopted by the legislature,
                    according to the spirit in which it was made. A board of three commissioners was
                    to be appointed by the king (sects. 1 to 11), themselves appointing assistant
                    commissioners, capable of receiving the powers of the commission by delegation
                    (sects. 8 to 13); the commission having power to direct and control the whole
                    administration of relief throughout England and Wales, and especially the
                    government of workhouses, and it being left to them to determine the extent to
                    which the measures to be carried out should be rendered uniform.</p>
                <p>But the districts for the administration of relief, that is, parishes by the
                    statute of Elizabeth, and town-lands by the 13th and Í4th Charles II., had been
                    fortuitously created, sometimes containing but one householder, sometimes
                    containing a population exceeding 100,000. There were in 1831, in England and W
                    <hi rend="superscript"> τ</hi> ales, fifty-six parishes containing less than ten
                    persons, and which may be therefore calculated, one with the other, to contain
                    but two adult <hi rend="subscript"> λ</hi> males; a hundred and forty-eight
                    parishes containing but from ten to twenty persons, the largest of these on the
                    average containing five adult males; and five hundred and thirty-three parishes
                    containing from twenty to fifty persons, the largest of which would give less
                    than twelve adult males per parish. Taking into consideration the small number
                    of our adult male population who can read and write, a conception may be formed
                    of the absurdity of the expectation, that every parish can adequately supply a
                    constant succession of annual officers competent to perform the very complicate
                    and difficult duties of the levier and collector of rates, and distributor of
                    relief.</p>
                <p>The evidence shows a large proportion of the overseers exercising these
                    functions, though unable otherwise to sign their accounts than by their mark,
                    attested by the justice’s clerk. But if it was difficult to find a supply of
                    officers for these districts, it would have been preposterous to expect that
                    each district should supply itself withan efficient workhouse, however
                    indispensable that should be as a means of protection to its population. It was
                    found, on an examination of the largest, of the smallest, and of the
                    intermediate parishes, in the seven first counties in England, taken in
                    alphabetical order, that the largest districts gave the lowest cost per head,
                    the smallest gave the greatest cost per head, and those of intermediate size an
                    intermediate cost. The results are thus stated in the Report: The sixty-seven
                    largest parishes gave 9s. 0∣d. per head in population; the sixty-six
                    intermediate gave 14s. 4d. per head in population; the sixty-seven least gave
                    14s. 11^d. per head in population; whilst, if we take all England, there are the
                    still more striking results, viz. the hundred absolutely largest parishes,
                    containing a population of 3,196,064, gave 6s. 7d. per head; the hundred
                    intermediate parishes, containing a population of 19,841, gave 15s. per head;
                    the hundred least parishes from which poor-rate returns are made, with a
                    population of 1708, gave L.l. Ils. H½d. per head.</p>
                <p>Such are the results as tested by the cost of administration in the larger and in
                    the smaller districts; but the moral effects in producing pauperism were as
                    disastrous in the smaller districts. The Commissioners observe, that they “have
                    no recent returns of proportions of paupers in the parishes referred to in the
                    preceding statement; but on referring to the parliamentary returns of the number
                    of paupers in each parish in the years 1803 and 1813, it appears that the number
                    of persons relieved in the large and small parishes bore some proportion to
                    their relative amount of rates. In the three hundred parishes of which the
                    comparative amount of the poor’s rates on the population has been stated, the
                    average number of persons relieved was, in the hundred largest parishes, in
                    1803, 1 in 16, or 6½ per cent.; in 1813, 1 in 13, or 7∣ per cent.: in the
                    hundred intermediate ditto, in 1803, 1 in 10, or 10 per cent.; in 1813, 1 in 8,
                    or 12∣ per cent.; and in the hundred smallest ditto, in 1803, 1 in 6, or 16∣ per
                    cent.; in 1813, 1 in 4, or 25 per cent.” And the progress of the disaster was
                    shown to be most rapid in the smallest districts: thus, “the increase of
                    pauperism on population, from 1803 to 1813, was, in the hundred largest
                    parishes, l½ per cent.; in the hundred intermediate ditto, 2½ per cent.; and in
                    the hundred smallest ditto, 8½ per cent.” The economy of extended management was
                    thus experimentally proved in every possible direction, and the moral interests
                    were shown to be the same with the pecuniary.</p>
                <p>The Commissioners entered largely into the examination of this subject in all its
                    bearings, and ended by recommending “that the central board be empowered to
                    cause any number of parishes which they may think convenient, to be incorporated
                    for the purpose of workhouse management, and for providing new workhouses where
                    necessary; to declare their workhouses to be the common workhouses of the
                    incorporated district, and to assign to those workhouses separate classes of
                    poor, though composed of the poor of distinct parishes, each distinct parish
                    paying to the support of the permanent workhouse establishment, in proportion to
                    the average amount of the expense incurred for the relief of its poor for the
                    three previous years, and paying separately for the food and clothing of its own
                    paupers.” This recommendation was adopted by the legislature in all points. The
                    common workhouses are provided for by sections 23, 24, 26; the maintenance of
                    the workhouse and establishment charges is fixed in the proportion of the
                    average expenditure of the three previous years by section 28, with the power of
                    taking future averages; the cost <hi rend="italic">of</hi> the maintenance of
                    its individual paupers being borne by each parish, under section 26.</p>
                <p>The necessity of providing for a clear and uniform system of accounts was shown
                    in an extraordinary manner in the inquiries of the Commission; but it is too
                    obvious to re<pb break="no" facs="nls:193537289?mode=fullsize"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0718-7289-0382"/>quire further remark, and the previous
                    observations show in some measure the difficulty of obtaining efficient
                    parochial officers, and the necessity of resorting to further means to attain
                    the object.</p>
                <p>The Commissioners recommended “that the central board be empowered and required
                    to take measures for the general adoption of a complete, clear, and, as far as
                    may be practicable, uniform system of accounts.” This recommendation was also
                    adopted in full by tlιe legislature, the Commissioners’ powers being given by
                    section 15, the audit being provided for by sections 46 and 89.</p>
                <p>Upon the subject of officers, the Commissioners recommend, “that the central
                    board be empowered to incorporate, for the purpose of appointing and paying
                    permanent officers, and for the execution of works of public labour ;” and “that
                    the central board be directed to state the general qualifications which shall be
                    necessary to candidates for paid offices connected with the relief of the poor,
                    to recommend to parishes and incorporations proper persons to act .as paid
                    officers, and to remove any paid officers whom they shall think unfit for their
                    situations.”</p>
                <p>This also is adopted in the 46th section of the act, except that the
                    Commissioners have no power to recommend the persons to act as paid officers,
                    but have ample powers to determine, by regulation, the qualification and remo-
                    .val of all paid officers. The chief remaining recommendation affecting the
                    general administration of the law by the Commissioners was, “that the board be
                    required to submit a report annually to one of your majesty’s principal
                    secretaries of state, containing, 1. an account of their proceedings; 2. any
                    further amendments which they may think it advisable to suggest; 3. the evidence
                    on which the suggestions are founded; 4. bills carrying those amendments, if
                    any, into effect, which bills the board shall be empowered to prepare with
                    professional assistance.”</p>
                <p>This is also adopted, as far as the annual report is concerned, without, however,
                    any definition in the act of the subjects upon which the Commissioners are to
                    report, that being left to their discretion and to the condition of affairs to
                    determine, section 5; they are to make a current record of their proceedings,
                    section 4; and they are bound to give any information respecting their
                    proceedings which the secretary of state may at any time call for, section
                    6.</p>
                <p>The remaining recommendations of the Commissioners relate chiefly to the law of
                    settlement and that of bastardy. These subjects were more important when all who
                    could gain a settlement might claim the benefit of that settlement, without any
                    check. The improved administration, especially the inducements which now act as
                    restraints upon the applications for relief, have diminished the motives to the
                    voluntary pauper to fix his settlement in a good parish, and have proportionally
                    diminished the danger to parishes, both from the attempts of the pauper, and
                    from the exertions of the officers of other parishes to shift their burthens, by
                    giving to their own poor the means to acquire a new settlement elsewhere. The
                    most important change in the settlement law recommended and adopted, was that
                    which repealed the settlement by hiring and service; a settlement which impeded
                    the free circulation, the effects of which in restraining labourers to their
                    parishes, and creating a reliance on their parishes, was shown to constitute the
                    great plague-spot of the poor-law system as it then existed.<note

                    chaplain to the Tower, who has had extensive opportunities of observing the

                    rend="superscript"> ς</hi> Can you give any instances within your own knowledge,
                    of the operation of the existing aw of settlement? I was requested by Colonel
                    Bogson, Kesgrove House, to furnish him with a farming bailiff’. I found a man in
                    all respects qualified for his situation; he was working at nine shillings a
                    week in the parish where I lived. The man was not encumbered by a family, and he
                    thankfully accepted my offer; the situation was, in point of emolument, and
                    comfort, and station, a considerable advance; his advantages would have been
                    doubled. In about a week he altered his mind, and declined the situation, in
                    consequence, as I understood, of his fearing to remove from what was considered
                    a good parish to a bad one, the parish to which it was proposed to remove him
                    being connected with a hundred house, in which there is more strict management.
                    I was requested by a poor man, whom I respected, to find a situation for his son
                    in London. The son was a strong young man, working at that time at about eight
                    shillings a week. I eventually succeeded in getting him a good situation of one
                    guinea per week in London, where his . labour would have been much less than it
                    was in the country; but when the period arrived at which he was expected in
                    London, he was not forthcoming. It appeared he had altered his mind, and
                    determined not to take the place; as I understood, his reason for refusing to
                    accept it arose from a reluctance to endanger his settlement in his parish. Such
                    are the instances which are continually presented to my observation with respect
                    to the operation of the present system of settlement.’</p><p>“Among our present
                    modes of conferring a settlement,” says Mr Russell, in the replies to which we
                    have already adverted, “that by hiring and service is incomparably the most
                    pernicious; it tells the poor man that he shall encounter a prohibitory duty .in
                    <hi rend="italic">every</hi> market in which he attempts to dispose of the only
                    commodity he must live by selling; it shuts the door against the most
                    respectable and advantageous employment in which a servant can engage; by
                    abridging the term, it impairs the strength of the connection between him and
                    his master; and it not only drives the servant from his place, but often betrays
                    him, during the interval between his being discharged from one house and hired
                    at another, into bad company, dissipation, and vice. (Report, p.
                    155-G.)</p></note> This law of settlement was repealed by the 64th and 65th
                    sections, as were the settlement by occupation of a tenement without payment of
                    poor-rates by the 66th, and that by apprenticeship to the sea-service by the
                    67th; and improvements in the whole law of removal, by which great wrong had
                    been mutually done by parishes one to the other, were introduced by the 79th and
                    following sections.</p>
                <p>The bastardy law, which had made it a more prudent speculation for a woman to
                    have a family of bastard children than to have an equal number of legitimate
                    children, by enabling her to cast off the burthen of the children, which the
                    widow could not do, and thus to enforce from the parish, and through the parish
                    from whomsoever she charged as the father, such a contribution as would induce
                    her to keep them. This law, also, by subjecting the person charged as the
                    father, and who could not give security to pay, to imprisonment, was a means of
                    terror by which a woman was often enabled to compel a marriage; a means to which
                    recourse was had to an extent almost incredible.<note anchored="true"

                    as to the operation of the act, given in a letter from the overseer of Llanasa,
                    in the county of Flint, m answer to an inquiry from the board, “Why the bastards
                    in the parish are so few now? I can only observe, that, in the first place, we
                    never force the putative father to marry the mother; and we compel the mother,
                    as well as the father, to pay her quota towards the maintenance of the child.
                    This was our simple mode of treating the business. One thing I must observe, and
                    it tells well for the new poor-law act, that in our parish we have from fifteen
                    to twenty weddings in the year, and it seldom happened that at the ceremony the
                    bride did not think it decent and requisite (I am now speaking of the lower
                    order of persons) to conceal her shape under a cloak. But in the eighteen
                    marriages which we have had since last August, all the ladies, except one,
                    retained their virgin shape, and appeared without the mantle.” (First Annual

                    legislature. Other provisions were also adopted, necessary, indeed, to give
                    effect to these more important purposes, but not of sufficient importance, or
                    sufficiently characteristic of any great principle, to require remark here.</p>
                <p>CHAPTER V.</p>
                <p>EFFECTS OF THE AMENDED SYSTEM.</p>
                <p>It has been seen that one of the duties with which the Commissioners were charged
                    was that of reporting annually to the secretary of state. The Commissioners
                    having superintended the administration for four years from August 1834, have
                    made four Reports, and have circulated them largely. From them our chief
                    information must be drawn; for although much discussion has taken place with
                    respect both to the principle of the measure and the mode in which effect has
                    been given to it, no enlarged examination of its working has, with but one
                    exception, been made. This exception is found in the inquiry by the committees
                    of the House of Commons appointed to inquire into certain charges made against
                    the administration of the Commissioners. The evidence of these committees, taken
                    during the two sessions of 1836-37 and 1837-38, and the Report made by the last,
                    though they contain much valuable matter, and especially a very detailed account
                    of the operation of the measure upon the morals and the condition of the
                    labouring poor, are in the main corroborative of the Commissioners’ own Report,
                    and in disaffirmance of the charges made against the principle of the act, and
                    the manner of its execution. This evidence, therefore, has also the effect of
                    referring us again for information to the Reports of the Commissioners, f It
                    appears from the Reports of the Commissioners, that in four years they have
                    succeeded in uniting 14,811 parishes, which they have arranged in 565 unions;
                    and in placing thirteen parishes under boards of governors, organized and acting
                    in a like manner as in unions. Of these, a hundred and eleven were declared and
                    organized in the first year, two hundred and fifty-two in the second, two
                    hundred and five in the third year, and seventeen in the fourth year. These
                    unions have since become the districts of administration of the act for the
                    registration of births, deaths, and marriages. The presidency of the boards of
                    guardians has been taken by the nobility and leading gentry in their respective
                    unions.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See List of
                    Officers, &amp;c. in the Fourth Annual Report, Appendix (C), No. 2, pp. 209, <hi
                    rend="italic">el supra.</hi></p></note> Each union is administered by a board of
                    guardians, one guardian at least being elected for each parish or town-land.
                    This board meets in most cases weekly; but many instances exist where, by
                    improved skill in the performance of their functions, and by diminished
                    pauperism, they are enabled to perform their duties efficiently by meeting once
                    a fortnight. Three hundred and twentyeight unions have workhouses completed and
                    in operation; a hundred and forty-one have workhouses building or in course of
                    alteration. Of the remaining unions, thirty-eight boards of governors have taken
                    no steps for providing themselves with this requisite for good management. Each
                    union is provided with the following officers: A clerk, usually a professional
                    man, auditor, chaplain, medical officers, relieving officers, master and matron
                    of the workhouse, schoolmaster and schoolmistress, and porter.</p>
                <p>These arrangements involve a large expenditure, but are indispensable to secure
                    the advantages of an improved administration, and of the vastly preponderating
                    saving derivable only from a better system. Before the Poor-Law Amendment Act
                    was passed, the Commission of Inquiry had excited universal attention to the
                    abuses in the poor-laws. The dispersion of their searching inquiries throughout
                    the kingdom; the visits of their assistant Commissioners; above all, the
                    startling picture of abuse contained in the extracts from their information, and
                    the inviting account contained in the same extracts, of the effects, pecuniary
                    and moral, resulting in Cookham, Uley, Southwell, Bingham, Swallowfield,
                    Hatfield, and some few other dispauperised parishes; had produced a wide-spread
                    inclination, a sanguine hope, and in many places a vigorous effort, to reduce
                    the abuses everywhere recognised as now prevailing. The magistracy and clergy
                    especially aided this movement. We find, therefore, the effects of the inquiry
                    developing themselves before the act was passed, and in some measure in the very
                    way in which the act itself was intended to operate. The years 1833 and 1834
                    thus presentareduction below the previous years, as will be seen in the table at
                    page 375, which is here repeated, and completed up to the present year.</p>

                    L.6,856,626, as compared with the year ended March 1834.</p>
                <p>The two following statements will show the amount of money expended for the
                    relief and maintenance of the poor during the years ended Easter 1803, and 25th
                    March 1818 and 1837, respectively, specifying the amount, rate per cent., and
                    rate per head, of decrease in 1837, as compared with the years 1803 and 1818
                    respectively; the former being the year in which the smallest, and the latter
                    the year in which the largest sum of money was expended for the relief of the
                    poor, for which authentic parliamentary returns have been received:</p>
                <p>Population in 1801, 8,872,980; expended for relief, &amp;c. of the poor during
                    the year ended Easter 1803, L.4,077, 891.</p>
                <p>Population in 1821, 11,978,875; expended for relief, &amp;c. of the poor during
                    the vcar ended 25th of March 1818, L.7,870,801.</p>
                <p>Population in 1831, 13,897,187; expended for relief, &amp;c. of the poor during
                    the year ended 25th of March 1837, L.4,044,741.</p>
                <p>From this statement of the population and the expenditure at the periods
                    described, the following results were obtained. The tables show, what is a
                    striking exemplification of the operation of the new system, that the amount
                    expended in 1837 was one percent, less than that of the lowest year for which
                    any official returns exist, apparently the lowest year in the present century.
                    But when the increase of population is considered, this comparison becomes
                    vastly more favourable to the improved administration. The expenditure in the
                    year 1803, in comparison with the population of 1801, was as nine shillings and
                    twopence per head, whilst that of 1837 was, with comparison of the population of
                    1831, only five shillings and tenpence.</p>
                <p>Amount of decrease in the year ended 25th of March 1837, compared with 1803,
                    L.33,150; ditto compared with 1818, L.3,826,060.</p>
                <p>Decrease per cent, in 1837. compared with 1803, one; ditto compared with 1818,
                    forty-nine.</p>
                <p>Expenditure per head in 1803, with reference to population in 1801, nine
                    shillings and twopence; ditto in 1818, with reference to population in 1821,
                    thirteen shillings and twopence; ditto in 1837, with reference to population in
                    1831, five shillings and tenpence.</p>
                <p>Decrease per head in 1837, compared with 1803, three shillings and fourpence;
                    ditto compared with 1818, seven shillings and fourpence.</p>
                <p>This, however, is still a very unfavourable view of the operations of the new
                    system, as it does not allow for the great increase of population between the
                    years 1831 and 1837. Estimating the population between the years 1801 and 1803
                    as increasing at the same rate per cent, as the increase shown in the census
                    taken in 1811, and estimating in like manner the increase between 1831 and 1837,
                    in accordance with the rate of increase as shown at the census of 1831, we have
                    these results.</p>

                <p>The means of comparison between the state of the pauper and of the labouring
                    population in the two periods preceding and succeeding the passing of the act,
                    are not by any means so abundant as those of making the comparison of
                    expenditure. It is nevertheless clearly apparent, that in proportion as the
                    expenditure is diminished, the number of paupers maintained has diminished; and
                    that the reliance on the rate, the idleness which it rendered possible, and the
                    indulgence which it afforded, must have been on the whole proportionally
                    diminished. We have full evidence that the diminution in enjoyment has not been
                    at the expense of the aged, the infirm, or the impotent. The restrictive rules
                    applied by the Commissioners (see Appendix to their First Report, p. 85) to
                    various classes of able-bodied paupers, with various degrees of strictness,
                    carefully preserved to the aged and impotent the benefits of the relief, such as
                    might have been given them under the old system, but which, as shown by the
                    Commissioners of Inquiry’, was refused to them, and lavished on the insolent and
                    reckless of the able-bodied. Now the returns show, that precisely in the places
                    where able-bodied pauperism most prevailed, there, at the same time, the relief
                    of the aged was least cared for; and they equally <pb break="no"

                    with the diminution of relief to the able-bodied, that to the aged and infirm
                    has become more liberal. (See Appendix to the Second Annual Report, p. 309, 311,

                    the Westhampnett Union, gave much valuable evidence on the beneficial working of
                    the amended system before the committee of the House of Commons in session
                    I83G-37, from which we make the following extracts:</p><p>“With reference to the
                    aged and infirm, have you been in the habit of giving them relief out of the
                    house? Certainly.</p><p>“Have you ordered them into the house on any occasions,
                    refusing them relief out of it ?—The order to an aged or infirm person to come
                    into the house has been an exception; the general rule has been to give the
                    relief out.</p><p>“What was the state of things in that respect before the new
                    poor-law came into operation ?—The allowances to the aged and infirm have been,
                    generally speaking, increased since the union.</p><p><hi rend="superscript">
                    u</hi> With regard to going into the house or not?—I think there have been less
                    aged and infirm ordered into the house since the union than previously.”
                    (3165-G8.)</p><p>In the parish of Graff ham, in the same union, the payments
                    made to aged persons under the old law are stated by Mr Sadler to have been as
                    follows :—</p><p>“By reference to the poor-book I will describe the former
                    payments; the former allowance to this same couple, who now receive five
                    shillings a week, was two shillings a week; the widow woman who now receives two
                    shillings and sixpence a week used to receive one shilling a week; and the
                    single man who now receives two shillings and sixpence, used to receive two
                    shillings.</p><p>“Then in the parish of Graff’ham the payment to the aged
                    appears to have increased?—Doubled, exactly.’’ (17,503—4.)</p><p>The extracts
                    from the evidence of Mr Ellis, Mr Butt, and Mr Ford, each of whom is
                    unfavourable to the regulations of the amended system, all relate to the
                    Petworth Union :—</p><p>“How has it (the new law) affected the aged and
                    infirm?—The aged are taken care of now in their own parish, the same as they
                    were before the union.</p><p>“Have many of the aged and infirm been removed into
                    the workhouses?—Very few; not more than we had before the union.” (349; Mr
                    Ford.)</p><p>“Upon the aged and infirm paupers what do you think has been the
                    effect of the act ?—I should think that they are full as well off, and perhaps
                    better, than they were before.</p><p>“Do they receive out-door relief?—Yes,
                    mostly; and if I might be allowed to say, that is one of the arguments that I
                    make use of when I ask that we may have the discretion with respect to the
                    labourers with large families. λVe have the discretion with respect to the aged,
                    and therefore have used it, and enabled them to receive that comfort under this
                    poor-law that they had before, or perhaps more.” (1490-1.)</p><p>“You have
                    stated that you consider the condition of the aged poor to be improved; in what
                    respect? I hardly stated that they were improved; I said that they were as well
                    off, if not better. In the case of aged persons, we give them the choice whether
                    they will live out at a certain allowance, about two shillings and sixpence a
                    week, or come into the old poor-house. If they have a child to live with, or any

                <p>The evidence as to the improvement of the labourer is too abundant to allow us
                    even to refer the reader to all the passages in the Commissioners’ Reports; but
                    conclusive evidence will-be found in the passages referred to under the title
                    “Labourers” in the index of the Second Annual Report. These show a great
                    improvement in the general conduct of labourers when made dependent upon the
                    good opinion or good will of their employers; a manifest improvement in the
                    labour of workmen when wages were substituted for relief, and, what might be
                    expected, a parallel increased demand for the improved labour. Equally strong is
                    the evidence of the decrease of crime, and particularly of those petty offences,
                    such as poaching, snaring, and the smaller kinds of depredation, for which tire
                    former unsteady occupation of the farm-labourer afforded him facilities. The
                    illustration of these subjects will be found most abundant, and in greatest
                    detail, in the evidence given before the Select Committees of the House of
                    Commons in the sessions 1836-37 and 1837-38. There will also be found evidence
                    of the diminution of improvident habits generally; the increase of benefit
                    clubs, and of deposits in savings’ banks, though shown here, is made even more
                    manifest by the returns collected and observed upon by Nir Tufnell in the
                    Appendix to the Fourth Annual Report (p. 220-222), extracts from which are here
                    given.</p>
                <p>“With so many circumstances tending to retard the prosperity of the labouring
                    classes, it is gratifying to have to observe, that, so far as can be collected
                    from statistical documents (and to figures, as being less capable of error, I am
                    always desirous of referring), their welfare seems to have been upon the whole
                    in a state of steady advancement since the enforcement of the regulations of the
                    new poor-law. As one proof of this I beg to refer to the following table, which
                    shows the deposits during the last seven years in the savings’ banks in the two
                    counties of Kent and Sussex, from friendly societies, and from the depositors of
                    sums under L.20. I have selected these two classes of depositors, as amongst
                    them, more than in any other class, the labouring population are chiefly to be
                    found.</p>

                <p>“The increase of forethought in the labourers is perhaps still more strikingly
                    manifested by the increase of members in friendly societies, which are now far
                    more generally established on principles calculated to secure a certain
                    provision in sickness and old age, instead of those injurious institutions,
                    hitherto so prevalent, which seem intended only to minister to the profit of
                    publicans, and which are usually founded on principles that must inevitably
                    cause their dissolution when old age overtakes the members, and consequently
                    when the utility of such societies would be most apparent, and their benefits
                    most needed.</p>
                <p>“I have received the numbers that have annually belonged to three benefit
                    societies, and these I give below. The first is a friendly society in the county
                    of Sussex.</p>
                <p>“Number of members in 1831, 84; in 1832, 64; in</p>
                <p>1833, 56; in 1834, 48 ;-in 1835, 49; in 1836, 64; in 1837, 98.</p>
                <p>“The following are the returns from two Kentish friendly societies :—</p>
                <p>“Number of members in 1832, 378; in 1833, 363; in 1834, 356; in 1835, 353; in
                    1836, 420; in 1837, 478.</p>
                <p>“Number of members in 1831,461; in 1832,477; in 1833, 519; in 1834, 533; in 1835,
                    609; in 1836, 611; in 1837, 770.</p>
                <p>“It will be perceived that these figures indicate either a very slow increase or
                    an actual diminution previous to the passing of the new law, and a rapid
                    advancement since.</p>
                <p>“These contrasts, however, are far less favourable to the present system than
                    they would appear, had not the failure of the crops and the hardness of the
                    seasons during the last year and a half pressed with peculiar severity on the
                    labouring classes of this district. Every natural circumstance seems to have
                    combined to test to the utmost the soundness of the principles of the poor-laws,
                    and put their efficacy to the proof. In the two counties of Kent and Sussex
                    referred to in the above table of the deposits in savings’ banks, <hi
                    rend="italic">upwards of a million of money has been subtracted from the
                    poor-rates since the regulations of the Poor-Laιo Amendment Act came into
                    opeιation</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and if, in the face of this large
                    reduction, and of many adverse circumstances, we are enabled to refer, not to
                    obscure deductions and conjectures, but to the unimpeachable testimony of facts
                    like the above, are we not entitled to assume that the effect of the measure has
                    not been hurtful to the interests of the labourers or of society in general, and
                    that the apprehensions entertained of it are not justified by the result ?”</p>
                <p>The most impressive proof that strong motives must have been given to the
                    able-bodied to resume the habits of honest and independent industry, may be
                    found in a return of the operation of the law in the county of Sussex, a county
                    in which able-bodied pauperism appeared to have had the firmest root, and the
                    circumstances of which county afforded, at the passing of the act, the least
                    hope of eradicating this evil. It will be seen in the table, that almost in
                    proportion as the rate of savings in the year are large, is the effect most
                    strikingly shown upon the able-bodied paupers.</p>

                <p>One of the moral effects most to be desired was the rendering marriage no longer
                    a consideration of policy as regarded the chances of the couple to relief, or as
                    a means of obtaining an annuity with a family of ante-nuptial children; an
                    effect sought by the recommendations of the Commissioners and the enactments
                    described, and one which appears to have been abundantly realised in the
                    operation of the measure-Dr Kay, assistant poor-law commissioner, in his
                    examination before the Committee of the House of Commons in the last session,
                    gave some valuable evidence relative to the decrease, in the number of marriages
                    in the counties of Norfolk and Suffolk, the counties under his superintendence,
                    from which we have made some extracts.</p>
                <p>“Have you any return relative to marriages which have taken place in Norfolk and
                    Suffolk ?—Last spring I instructed the relieving officers of a great number of
                    unions to apply for returns of the marriages w hich occurred in the parishes in
                    their districts in the years 1833, 1834, 1835, and 1836. A considerable
                    difficulty was experienced in procuring those returns. W’here they were procured
                    they were given by the clergymen of the parishes very kindly, as a favour to the
                    relieving officers; but they did not comprise, in consequence of certain
                    difficulties which were experienced, every parish in every officer’s district,
                    but only certain of the parishes; but in every case in which the return was
                    obtained from any parishes, it included all those years.</p>
                <p>“From the return do you find that the number of marriages has increased or
                    decreased in the period ?—I find in this return that the marriages in the year
                    1833, in the districts to which it relates, were 762; in 1834 they were 771; in
                    1835, 663; and in 1836, 549; w hich I believe may be taken as evidence that
                    there has been a considerable diminution of improvident marriages in these
                    districts.”</p>
                <p>Unfortunately the question of pauper-marriage was too much connected with the
                    operation of the law of bastardy (marriages sometimes brought about by the bribe
                    of the allowance to a family of such children, sometimes by the threat of the
                    jail directed against the man accused of being the father) to allow the effects
                    of the law in diminishing marriages and in diminishing bastardy to be separated
                    or clearly distinguished; but the direct operation of the law in checking
                    unchastity will be seen in the extracts from the Commissioners’ Second Annual
                    Report, as inserted below.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>“The Rev. Thomas Pitman, minister of Eastbourne, says, ‘ Among the labouring
                    classes there is a decided and progressive alteration. Even the farmers
                    themselves have observed to me, that there is in the general conduct of the
                    agricultural labourers a civility of manner, and attention to their masters’
                    wishes, which of late years has been little perceptible. Perhaps the most marked
                    difference in the lower orders, observable by us as clergymen, is the almost
                    total cessation of early and improvident marriages. I should not forget also to
                    mention, that, as far as I can form a judgment, there is also a decided
                    improvement in the marriages that do take place. The altar is not now, as
                    heretofore, disgraced by the appearance of a woman, to take upon her the solemn
                    obligation of matrimony, in the last stage of pregnancy; a fact which, I think,
                    goes far to show, that the morals of the people are undergoing.a change for the
                    better, and promises that ere long we may hope for all that domestic happiness
                    among our poorer neighbours which results from a match of pure affection, in the
                    place of all that wretchedness, discord, and misery which are the too sure
                    produce of a marriage commenced iu sin, and fostered only by a hope of procuring
                    a means from the parish of carrying on from time to time sinful
                    indulgences.’</p><p>“Reverend John Austin, minister of Pulborough, states that ‘
                    We now begin to look for moral and religious improvement, as the hard-working
                    men engaged in industry are become civil and attentive to their masters. Only
                    two marriages have been solem, nized since December last, the yearly average
                    being fifteen; and only one bastard has been christened between July 12, 1835,
                    and May 17, 1836. (The population of this parish is 1976, according to the
                    census of 1831.)’</p><p>“It is satisfactory to us to observe, that the practice,
                    which was at one time almost universal, of dealing with the mothers of bastard
                    children differently from other paupers, is rapidly giving way; and the sounder
                    course of giving them relief only according to the measure and character of
                    their wants is more generally adopted.</p><p>“The information which we have
                    received on the subject of the clauses in the new act, with relation to
                    bastardy, is confirmatory of the facts and conclusions stated upon the subject
                    in our last Annual Report. From the returns which we have received, it appears
                    that the whole number of bastards chargeable to the parishes of England and
                    Wales was, in the year 1835, 71,298; the number chargeable in the year 1836 was
                    61,826; being a decrease of 9472, or of thirteen per cent.</p><p>“But the
                    progressive operation of the bill appears in the numbers affiliated during the
                    two years, which numbers were, in 1835, 12,381; in 1836, 7686; being a decrease
                    of 4695, or of thirty-eight per cent.</p><p>“We endeavoured to obtain an account
                    of the numbers born during those years chiefly, as shown in the baptismal
                    registers; but our respondents declare that these returns are extremely
                    imperfect, and are so much at variance with other testimony, that no reliance
                    can be placed upon them for accuracy. In some parishes very many of the bastard
                    children are never baptized; and in many other parishes, where they have not
                    been accustomed to baptize them before the passing of the act, children have
                    been baptized subsequently, in consequence of the fact of a woman being known to
                    have had a bastard not rendering her liable to the interference of the
                    parish-officer where she does not claim relief.</p><p>“The evidence of midwives
                    and parish-officers, and other witnesses, speaking upon their own knowledge of
                    their respective parishes, would prove that the diminution of the number of
                    births was considerable.</p><p>“The number returned as born in the year 1835,
                    was 17,036; and in the year ended 25th March 1836, was 17,578. This variation
                    between the two years is attributed to the more full registration in the last
                    year.</p><p>“According to the population returns, the number of bastards boru in
                    the year 1831 was 20,039, which, if allowance were made for the increase of
                    population since that year, would show a decrease of between 4000 and 5000 born
                    in the last year.” (Second Annual Report, pp. 17, 18, 19.)</p></note></p>
                <p>An important indication of the improved working of the law, proving also an
                    increased cordiality and recognition of common interests between parishes, and
                    showing still more incontestably the benefit of the improvements in the
                    settlement laws, is to be found in the rapid decrease of law-expenses. The sums
                    expended in law-charges and the removal of paupers amounted in the years ended
                    25th March 1834 to L.258,604, in 1835 to L.202,527, in 1836 to L.172,482, in
                    1837 to L.126,951, and in 1838 to L.93,982.</p>
                <p>This, however, does by no means give a sufficiently favourable view of the effect
                    of the law; for as the amount stated includes all law-expenses, it comprises the
                    expenditure, which has since the passing of the act been very large, in the
                    preparation and execution of contracts, and more particularly of the
                    conveyancing expenses connected with the purchase and hire of lands for
                    workhouses, and with the sales of parish property, which have taken place to a
                    large extent, but which cannot be repeated.</p>
                <p>It has often been asserted that the diminished cost and improved administration
                    were owing, not so much to the enactment of the Poor-Law Amendment Act, and the
                    new' organization introduced by it, as to other general causes; a general
                    improvement in intelligence being sometimes assigned, the increase of certain
                    modes of employment of the people at other times, and innumerable other causes,
                    according to the views of the person offering the explanation. The Fourth Report
                    of the Commissioners affords a very convincing instance of the fact, that where
                    the improved organization has not been effected, all the causes which formerly
                    operated to render the administration stationary, or to make it retrograde,
                    still operate with full effect. Birmingham and Aston are adjoining parishes,
                    with populations of the same habits, and equally participating in -every element
                    of prosperity or decline. The year 1837 severely tried the operation of the act.
                    A great failure in many branches of trade and commerce, and two severe winters,
                    had contributed to render the distress of the poor more urgent and <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193537367?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0718-7367-0388"/>
                    more general than at any period since the passing of the act. The high price of
                    provisions during a very large part of the period enhanced these effects. The
                    result has been, that although on the entire operations of the last year every
                    reason appears for entertaining the belief that the improvements in the
                    administration had not been less progressive than in preceding years, the saving
                    in money is, upon the whole, very little greater than that of the year ending
                    March 1837. B irmingham has not yet been placed under the control of the
                    Commissioners’ regulations. Aston has been placed under a beard of guardians,
                    and is governed under the Commissioners’ regulations. It is difficult to suppose
                    that Birmingham has not had its full share of any advantage derivable from
                    increased intelligence or increased prosperity; at all events, it is difficult
                    to suppose that Aston, usually regarded as a part of Birmingham, can have the
                    advantage of any such general influence, and Birmingham be deprived of it. The
                    account shows that, under the trial of circumstances to which each has been
                    equally subjected, the parish of Birmingham has been driven to an increased
                    expenditure of forty-one per cent., while the parish of Aston has successfully
                    withstood the operation of the like circumstances, and has effected a diminution
                    upon its previous expenditure of thirty-five per cent. The comparison, the whole
                    of the details of which are given in the Commissioners’ Fourth Annual Report,
