                    river of Colombia, in South America. Like all great rivers, its upper waters
                    separate into several branches, and it does not appear that the main source has
                    been ascertained with any degree of certainty. According to La Cruz d’Olmedilla,
                    it issues from a small lake called Ypava, situated in north latitude 5° 5',
                    whence, by a bend of a spiral form, it enters the lake Parima; but although the
                    existence of this sheet of water has been determined, doubts are entertained
                    whether it may not owe its origin only to the temporary overflowings of the
                    river. From this lake it is said to issue by two mouths; and after a very
                    circuitous course of upwards of fifteen hundred miles, including its windings,
                    it flows into the Atlantic Ocean, opposite to the island of Trinidad, by about
                    fifty mouths, seven of which are navigable. The Grande Boca, or principal mouth,
                    which is six leagues wide, is south-east of Trinidad, in latitude 8° 30'north,
                    and longitude 59° 50' west. A soft mud bank, formed by the debris brought down
                    by the river, and of course just an extension of the delta of the Orinoco, which
                    will one day be clothed with vegetation, stretches a considerable way into the
                    ocean on the left of the grand mouth, forming one line of the channel to the
                    entrance of the river. The other side of this channel consists of hard ground,
                    covered with shells and shingles, and on which the water deepens and shoals
                    continually. At its estuary it presents the appearance of a boundless lake, and
                    for a great extent its fresh waters penetrate into the bosom of the ocean,
                    almost uncontaminated by saline matter. “Its green-coloured stream,” says
                    Humboldt, “and its waves dashing over rocks in milk-white foam, are strongly
                    contrasted with the deep blue of the sea, which is separated from them by a
                    strongly marked line.” Such is the force of the stream formed by the Ori-' noco
                    between the main land and the island of Trinidad, that vessels overcome it with
                    great difficulty, even when favoured by a fresh breeze from the west. This
                    solitary and dreadful place, perpetually tormented as if by a whirlpool, is
                    called the Melancholy Gulf, the entrance to which is formed by the Dragon’s
                    Mouth. There, in the midst of furious waves, says the great traveller just
                    quoted, enormous rocks raise their isolated heads, the remains of that ancient
                    dike which formerly joined the island of Trinidad to the coast of Paria. It was
                    the aspect of these places which first convinced Columbus of the existence of
                    the continent of America. The unrivalled navigator reasoned admirably when he
                    concluded that such an immense body of water must have accumulated during a very
                    lengthened course, and that the country through which it flowed must be a
                    continent, and not an island. Fie, however, supposed it to be a continuation of
                    the coast of Asia; and, from the ethereal clearness of the sky, the refreshing
                    mildness of the evening air, and the aromatic odours which came wafted by
                    breezes from the land, the Orinoco appeared to him to be one of the four streams
                    which issued from the terrestrial paradise to fructify and divide the earth, and
                    he believed that he was about to set foot in the garden of Eden.</p>
                <p>Within the bar of the Orinoco the water gradually deepens, the force of the
                    current continuing very considerable, and sometimes during the rainy season
                    running at the rate of six miles an hour, so that navigation upwards is
                    exceedingly difficult, except by steam-boats. At some distance within the Grande
                    Boca of the river there is an island very thickly wooded, and forming the
                    segment of a large circle. Indeed the magnificence of the scenery on the banks
                    of the Orinoco is the astonishment of every traveller. Forests of boundless
                    extent expand on either side, and, being filled with aromatic herbsand flowers
                    that diffuse the most delightful odours, and all alive with birds of beautiful
                    and glancing plumage, from the lovely mocking-bird to the grand vulture and
                    fiery-red flamingo, together with hordes of monkeys, which disport from bough to
                    bough, exhibit a richness, grandeur, and variety of scene which defies
                    description. Passing these forests, enormous plains stretch out like oceans of
                    verdure, far beyond the horizon embraced by the eye; and the sublimity of the
                    scenery on the Orinoco is enhanced by several cataracts, of which Humboldt has
                    distinguished and described those of Maypuresand Atures. Their elevation is
                    inconsiderable, and both owe their existence to an archipelago of little islands
                    and rocks. The appearance of these rapids, however, is exceedingly picturesque
                    and beautiful. “When the traveller descends from the village of Maypures to the
                    brink of the river, after clearing the rock of Manimi, he enjoys a truly
                    astonishing prospect. At once a sheet of foam stretches out before him, to fully
                    a mile in extent. Masses of rock, of an iron-black colour, rear their rugged
                    fronts, like towers, out of this misty cloud. Every island, every rock, is
                    ornamented with luxuriant trees, closely grouped together. A thick smoke
                    constantly hangs suspended over the water; and through this foggy vapour, which
                    rises from the foam, shoot up the tops of lofty palm-trees. As soon as the
                    burning rays of the setting sun mingle with this humid cloud, the optical
                    phenomena which are produced actually give an air of enchantment to the scene.
                    The coloured arches successively appear and disappear, and their image
                    incessantly hovers before the eye at the mercy of the wind. During the long
                    season of the rains, the murmuring waters have accumulated little islands of
                    vegetable earth round the naked rocks. Adorned with the drosera, the mimosa with
                    its foliage <hi rend="italic">of</hi> silver white, and a multitude of other
                    plants, these form beds of flowers in the midst of frowning rocks.” <pb

                    Orinoco is navigable, without difficulty, for two hundred and sixty leagues, to
                    the rapids of Atures, where its mean height above the sea is, according to the
                    traveller just quoted, not more than three hundred and fifty feet, and thence,
                    after two short portages, for one hundred leagues more, to the point near
                    Esmeraldo, where the celebrated bifurcation of this river takes place, and a
                    portion of its waters descends along the natural Canal of Casiquiari, to join
                    the Rio Negro and the Amazon. The communications which exist between the Orinoco
                    and the Amazon constitute one of the most astonishing phenomena of physical
                    geography. More than half a century has elapsed since the fact was made known by
                    the Portuguese; but for a long period after this it was pertinaciously
                    maintained by systematical geographers, that such conjunctions of rivers were
                    impossible. By the enterprise and perseverance of recent travellers, however, it
                    has been proved that this is no anomaly; and we no longer stand in need of
                    either analogies or critical reasoning to support the fact. Μ. de Humboldt has
                    navigated both these rivers, and examined and described this singular
                    arrangement of the land. It is now put beyond a doubt, that the Orinoco and the
                    Rio Negro flow along a plateau, which at this part has no actual acclivity. A
                    valley then intervenes, their waters flow into it, and there unite, thus forming
                    the celebrated Casiquiari, by means of which MM. Humboldt and Bonpland passed
                    from the Rio Negro into the Orinoco. It is believed that there are also other
                    communications between the Rio Negro and the different tributaries of the
                    Amazon. On both sides along its course the Orinoco receives many tributary
                    streams, of which three in particular, the Apure, the Meta, and the Guaviare,
                    flowing from the westward, have also long navigable courses. The Apure falls
                    into the Orinoco about four hundred and forty miles from the mouth of the latter
                    river, in latitude 7. 36. 23. north, and longitude 69. 7. 29. west. The course
                    of the Apure is as serpentine as that of the Orinoco, only on a much smaller
                    scale, the tributary being in no part of its course much more than a musket-shot
                    across. At rather more than one hundred miles from the confluence of the two
                    rivers is San Fernando de Apure, a considerable town in the province of Apure,
                    and a place of some commerce. From thence the navigation is continued, partly on
                    the Apure and partly on the river Santo Domingo, to Toruno and Varinas, at a
                    distance of above two hundred miles farther. The line of navigation of this
                    branch of the commerce of the Orinoco extends, therefore, nearly eight hundred
                    miles from the mouths of the river to the extremity of the province of Varinas.
                    About sixty miles below the cataracts, the Orinoco receives the Meta, a river
                    which, issuing from the paramos of Cundinamarca, keeps its course parallel to
                    them for a hundred and fifty miles, receiving in its progress their tributary
                    streams; and then bending to the east, crosses the llanos of Casanare, and
                    completes a course of more than four hundred miles before its confluence with
                    the great river.</p>
                <p>At some future period the navigation of the Meta will become an object of very
                    great importance to Guiana, and; all the other eastern departments of the
                    republic. The Guaviare is also a very considerable navigable river, formed by a
                    number of streams which flow down the eastern declivities of the Andes. It joins
                    the Orinoco at San Fernando de Atabapo, in latitude 4° 3' north, and longitude
                    68° 10' west, which is the point where the Orinoco takes a great bend to the
                    north. W hen steam navigation shall have become common in this quarter of the
                    world, the river Guaviare will prove of immense advantage to some of the
                    interior provinces of Colombia, as a medium through which their produce may be
                    conveyed to the sea-ports of the republic. There are a great number of other
                    streams, tributary to the Orinoco, no less than three hundred being enumerated.
                    Many of the upper streams of this river display the singular phenomenon which
                    has been called “black waters.” Under the shadow of the palm-trees their colour
                    becomes of a deep black, but, in transparent vessels, it assumes a yellow hue.
                    The absence of crocodiles and fish (which are very plentiful farther down), a
                    greater degree of coolness, a smaller number of musquitoes, and a more
                    salubrious atmosphere, distinguish the region of the black waters. Humboldt
                    surmises that they derive their colour from a solution of carburet of hydrogen,
                    resulting from the decomposition of the multitudes of plants that cover the soil
                    through which they flow. With regard to the breadth, depth, and quantity of
                    water discharged by the Orinoco, as well as the size of the delta which it has
                    formed, our information is by no means precise. At six hundred miles from the
                    ocean it is said to be from five to six hundred yards across, and at Angostura
                    or St Thomas’s, situated two hundred and forty miles from its mouth, to be
                    nearly eight hundred yards across. Its depth appears to be very great; even when
                    the waters are at the lowest, it is no less than sixty-five fathoms in some
                    parts; and during the rainy season it inundates the immense plains through which
                    it flows, extending during the highest floods from eighty to ninety miles on
                    either side, and thus presenting to the eye the appearance ofavast inland sea,
                    rather than ariver. These facts, together with that of the vast extent to which
                    the current of the river may be traced in the ocean, are sufficient to prove
                    that the quantity of water brought down by the Orinoco is inferior to that of
                    few rivers on the face of the globe. The annual swell of the Orinoco commences
                    in April and ends in August. At the distance of thirteen hundred miles from the
                    ocean the rise is about thirteen fathoms. In the beginning of October the water
                    begins to fall, and, quitting the deluged plains, continues to diminish till
                    March, when it is at the lowest ebb. This river abounds in fish of various
                    descriptions. Amphibious animals are also found in great numbers on its shores;
                    the cayman or alligator frequents its waters, and is very formidable. From one
                    of the best maps of Colombia which have been published, it appears that its
                    delta extends above one hundred and fifty miles in length at the base, and that
                    from the middle of this line to the apex of the triangle it is above one hundred
                    miles in depth. <hi rend="smallcaps">(r. b. r.)</hi></p>
