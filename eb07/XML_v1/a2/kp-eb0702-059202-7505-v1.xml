                    variegated like marble, remarkably light, rugged, and uneven in its surface, and
                    of a fragrant odour when heated. It does not effervesce with acids; it melts

                <p>Ambergris is found swimming upon the sea, on the seacoast, or in the sand near

                    and the Molucca Islands; but most of the ambergris which is brought to England
                    comes from the Bahama Islands, from Providence, &amp;c. where it is found on the
                    coast. It is also sometimes found in the abdomen of whales by the
                    whale-fishermen, always in lumps of various shapes and sizes, weighing from half
                    an ounce to a hundred and more pounds. The piece which the Dutch East India
                    Company bought from the king of Tydore weighed 182 pounds. An American fisherman
                    from Antigua found, about fifty-two leagues south-east from the Windward
                    Islands, a piece of ambergris in a whale, which weighed about 130 pounds, and
                    sold for L.500 sterling.</p>
                <p>There have been many different opinions concerning the origin of this substance.
                    It has been supposed to be a fossil bitumen or naphtha, exuding from the bowels
                    of the earth in a fluid form, and distilling into the sea, where it hardens and
                    floats on the surface. But having been frequently found in the bellies of
                    whales, it has by others been considered as entirely an animal production. The
                    most satisfactory account of the real origin of ambergris is that given by Dr
                    Swediaur in the 73d volume of the <hi rend="italic">Philosophical
                    Transactions.</hi></p>
                <p>We are told by all writers on ambergris, that sometimes claws and beaks of birds,
                    feathers of birds, parts of vegetables, shells, fish, and bones of fish, are
                    found in the middle of it, or variously mixed with it. Of a very considerable
                    number of pieces, however, which Dr Swediaur examined, he found none that
                    contained any such thing; though he allows that such substances may sometimes be
                    found in it: but in all the pieces of any great size, whether found on the sea
                    or in the whale, he constantly found a considerable quantity of black spots,
                    which, after the most careful examination, appeared to be the beaks of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Sepia Octopodia ļ</hi> and these beaks, he thinks, might be the
                    substances which have hitherto been always mistaken for claws or beaks of birds
                    or shells. The presence of these beaks in ambergris proves evidently that all
                    ambergris containing them is in its origin, or must once have been, of a very
                    soft or liquid nature, as otherwise those beaks could not so constantly be
                    intermixed with it throughout its whole substance.</p>
                <p>That ambergris is found either upon the sea and seacoast, or in the bowels of
                    whales, is a fact universally credited. But it has never been satisfactorily
                    determined, whether the ambergris found upon the sea and sea-coast is the same
                    as that found in the whale, or whether they are different; whether that found on
                    the sea or sea-coast has some properties, or constituent parts, which that found
                    in the whale has not; and, lastly, whether that found in the whale is superior
                    or inferior in its qualities and value to the former.</p>
                <p>It is likewise of consequence to know, whether ambergris is found in all kinds of
                    whales, or only in a particular species of them; whether it is uniformly to be
                    met with <pb break="no" facs="nls:193037518?mode=fullsize"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0702-7518-0593"/> in those animals; and if so, in what part of
                    their body it is to be found.</p>
                <p>All these questions we find very fully discussed by Dr Swediaur. According to the
                    best information that he could obtain from several of the most intelligent
                    persons employed in the spermaceti whale-fishery, and in procuring and selling
                    ambergris, it appears that this substance is sometimes found in the belly of the
                    whale, but in that particular species only which is called the <hi rend="italic"
                    >spermaceti whale,</hi> and which, from its description and delineation, appears
                    to be the <hi rend="italic">Physeter</hi><hi rend="italic">AIacroceplιalus</hi>
                    of Linnaeus.</p>
                <p>The New England fishermen, according to their account, have long known that
                    ambergris is to be found in the spermaceti whale; and they are so convinced of
                    this fact, that whenever they hear of a place where ambergris is found, they
                    always conclude that the seas in that part are frequented by that species of
                    whale.</p>
                <p>The persons who are employed in the spermaceti whale-fishery confine their views
                    to the physeter macrocephalus. They look for ambergris in all the spermaceti
                    whales they catch, but it seldom happens that they find any. Whenever they hook
                    a spermaceti whale, they observe that it constantly not only vomits up whatever
                    it has in its stomach, but also generally discharges its faeces at the same
                    time; and if this latter circumstance takes place, they are commonly
                    disappointed in finding ambergris in its belly. But whenever they discover a
                    spermaceti whale, male or female, which seems torpid and sickly, they are always
                    pretty sure to find ambergris, as the whale in this state seldom voids its
                    faeces upon being hooked. They likewise generally meet with it in the dead
                    spermaceti whales, which they sometimes find floating on the sea. It is observed
                    also, that the whale in which they find ambergris often has a morbid
                    protuberance, or, as they express it, a kind of gathering in the lower part of
                    its belly, in which, if cut open, ambergris is found. It is remarkable that all
                    those whales in whose bowels ambergris is found, seem not only torpid and sick,
                    but arc also constantly leaner than others; so that, if we may judge from the
                    constant union of these two circumstances, it would seem that a larger
                    collection of ambergris in the belly of the whale is a source of disease, and
                    probably sometimes the cause of its death. As soon as they hook a whale of this
                    description, torpid, sickly, emaciated, or one that does not dung on being
                    hooked, they immediately either cut up the above-mentioned protuberance, if
                    there be any, or they rip open its bowels from the orifice of the anus, and find
                    the ambergris sometimes in one, sometimes in different lumps, of generally from
                    three to twelve and more inches in diameter, and from one pound to twenty or
                    thirty pounds in weight, at the distance of two, but most frequently of about
                    six or seven feet from the anus, and never higher up in the intestinal canal,
                    which, according to their description, is in all probability the intestinum
                    caecum, hitherto mistaken for a peculiar bag made by nature for the secretion
                    and collection of this singular sub-, stance. That the part cut open to come at
                    the ambergris is no other than the intestinal canal, is certain, because they
                    constantly begin their incision at the anus, and find the cavity everywhere
                    filled with the faeces of the whale, which, from their colour and smell, it is
                    Impossible to mistake. The ambergris found in the intestinal canal is not so
                    hard as that which is found on the sea or sea-coast, but soon grows hard in the
                    air. When first taken out, it has nearly the same colour, and the same
                    disagreeable smell, though not so strong, as the more liquid dung of the whale;
                    but on exposing it to the air, it by degrees not only grows greyish, having its
                    surface covered with a greyish dust, like old chocolate, but it also loses its
                    disagreeable smell, and, when kept for a certain length of time, acquires the
                    peculiar odour which is so agreeable to most people.</p>
                <p>The gentlemen the doctor conversed with confessed, that if they knew not from
                    experience that ambergris thus found will in time acquire the above-mentioned
                    qualities, they would by no means be able to distinguish ambergris from hard
                    indurated faeces. This is so true, that whenever a whale voids its faeces upon
                    being hooked, they look carefully to see if they can discover among the more
                    liquid excrements (of which the whale discharges several barrels) some pieces
                    floating on the sea, of a more compact substance than the rest. These they take
                    up and wash, knowing them to be ambergris.</p>
                <p>In considering whether there be any material difference between the ambergris
                    found upon the sea or sea-coast, and that found in the bowels or among the dung
                    of the whale, the doctor refutes the opinion that all ambergris found in whales
                    is of an inferior quality, and therefore much lower in price. Ambergris, he
                    observes, is only valued for its purity, lightness, compactness, colour, and
                    smell. There are pieces of ambergris found on different coasts, which are of a
                    very inferior quality; whereas there are often found in whales pieces of it of
                    the first value; nay, several pieces found in the same whale, according to the
                    above-mentioned qualities, are more or less valuable. All ambergris found in
                    whales has at first, when taken out of the intestines, very nearly the same
                    smell and blackish colour as the liquid excrements pf that animal; sometimes it
                    is quite hard, sometimes softish, but never so liquid as the natural faeces. By
                    being accumulated after a certain length of time in the intestinal canal, it
                    seems even there to become of a whiter colour, and less ponderous, and to
                    acquire its agreeable smell. The only reason why ambergris found floating on the
                    sea generally possesses this agreeable smell and hardness in a superior degree
                    is, because it is commonly older, and has been longer exposed to the air. It is
                    more frequently found in males than in females: the pieces found in females are
                    generally smaller than those found in males, and inferior in quality. The
                    disproportionately high price obtained for the larger pieces, therefore,
                    proceeds from an intrinsic value in respect to quality, rather than a fictitious
                    value on account of their rarity.</p>
                <p>It is known that the <hi rend="italic">sepia octopodia,</hi> or cuttle-fish, is
                    the constant and natural food of the spermaceti whale, or <hi rend="italic"
                    >physeter</hi><hi rend="italic">macrocephalus.</hi> Of this the fishers are so
                    well persuaded, that whenever they discover any recent relics of it swimming on
                    the sea, they conclude that a whale of this kind is, or has been, in that part.
                    Another circumstance which corroborates the fact is, that the spermaceti whale,
                    on being hooked, generally vomits up some remains of the sepia. Hence it is easy
                    to account for the many beaks, or pieces of beaks, of the sepia, found in all
                    ambergris. The beak of the sepia is a black horny substance, and therefore
                    passes undigested through the stomach into the intestinal canal, where it is
                    mixed with the faeces; after which it is either evacuated with them, or if these
                    latter be preternaturally retained, forms concretions with them, which render
                    the animal sick and torpid, and produce an obstipation, which ends either in an
                    abscess of the abdomen, or becomes fatal to the animal; in either case, on the
                    bursting of its belly, that hardened substance known under the name of <hi
                    rend="italic">ambergris</hi> is found swimming on the sea or thrown upon the
                    coast.</p>
                <p>From the preceding account, and his having constantly found the above-mentioned
                    beaks of the sepia in all pieces of ambergris of any considerable size, Dr
                    Swediaur concludes, with great probability, that all ambergris is generated<pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193037531?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0702-7531-0594"/> in
                    the bowels of the physeter macrocephalus or spermaceti whale, and there mixed
                    with the beaks of the sepia octopodia, which is the principal food of that
                    whale. He therefore defines ambergris to be the preternaturally hardened faeces
                    of the physeter macrocephalus, mixed with some indigestible relics of its
                    food.</p>
                <p>The opinion of Dr Swediaur, with regard to the origin of ambergris, has been
                    confirmed by the information of Captain J. Coffin, master of a ship employed in
                    the southern whale-fishery, given to a Committee of Privy Council in the year
                    1791. According to Mr Coffin’s information, American ships had sometimes found
                    small quantities of ambergris; but none, that he knew of, had ever been found by
                    British ships. The quantity which he had brought home amounted to 362 ounces;
                    and it was taken from the body of a female spermaceti whale on the coast of
                    Guinea, which was lean, sickly, and old, and yielded but a small proportion of
                    oil. While the people were employed in cutting up the blubber, ambergris was
                    discovered coming from the fundament of the whale, and a piece of it was seen
                    floating on the surface of the sea. More was observed in the same passage, and
                    the rest was found in a bag a little below the passage and communicating with
                    it. Mr Coffin supposes that the spermaceti whale feeds almost wholly on the
                    sepia or <hi rend="italic">squid;</hi> for when the whale is dying, a quantity
                    of this fish, sometimes whole, sometimes in pieces, is thrown up. The bills of
                    the squid were found, some on the outside adhering to it, and some mixed with
                    it. The ambergris of the whale taken by Mr Coffin was mostly sold at 19s. 9d.
                    per ounce; and a small part of it, when it was scarce, at 25s. It was bought
                    partly for home consumption, and partly for exportation to Turkey, Germany, and
                    France. <hi rend="italic">(Philosophical Transactions,</hi> vol. lxxxi.)</p>
                <p>The use of ambergris in Europe is now nearly confined to perfumery, though it has
                    formerly been recommended in medicine by several eminent physicians. In Asia and
                    part of Africa ambergris is not only used as a medicine and a perfume, but
                    considerable use is also made of it in cookery, by adding it to several dishes
                    as a spice. A great quantity of it is also constantly bought by the pilgrims who
                    travel to Mecca, probably to offer it there, and make use of it in fumigations,
                    in the same manner as frankincense is used in Catholic countries. The Turks make
                    use of it as an aphrodisiac. Our perfumers add it to scented pillars, candles,
                    balls, bottles, gloves, and hairpowder; and its essence is mixed with pomatums,
                    for the face and hands, either alone or united with musk, &amp;c. though its
                    smell is to some persons extremely offensive.</p>
                <p>Ambergris may be known to be genuine by its fragrant scent when a hot needle or
                    pin is thrust into it, and its melting like fat of a uniform consistence;
                    whereas the counterfeit will not yield such a smell, nor prove of such a fat
                    texture. One thing, however, is very remarkable, that a resemblance to the smell
                    of this drug, which is the most agreeable of all the perfumes, should be
                    produced by a preparation of one of the most odious of all substances. Mr
                    Homberg found that a vessel in which he had made a long digestion of human
                    faeces acquired a very strong and perfect smell of ambergris, insomuch that any
                    one would have thought a great quantity of essence of ambergris had been made in
                    it. The perfume was so strong and offensive, that the vessel had to be removed
                    from the laboratory.</p>
