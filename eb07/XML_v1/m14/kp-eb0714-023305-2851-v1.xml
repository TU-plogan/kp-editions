                    the Philippines, on the island of Lucon, situated on a bay of the same name,
                    which is seventy-five miles in circumference, and into which several rivers pour
                    their waters. At its entrance are several small islands, on one of which, called
                    the Corregidor, an officer with a party of troops is stationed, to examine the
                    ships coming in, and to guard against the introduction of contraband goods, or
                    of disease. It is, perhaps, one of the most happily situated towns in the world,
                    at the mouth of the river Pasig, which is navigable as far as the lake, about
                    nine miles eastward of the town, out of which it flows. It is a large and
                    handsome citv, <pb break="no" facs="nls:194202864?mode=fullsize"

                    magnificent churches, though they are liable to be overthrown by earthquakes.
                    Monasteries and convents’compose the finest parts of the town. The houses of the
                    native Indians are poor, being made of bamboos covered with leaves, and
                    extremely combustible. On account of the frequency of earthquakes, many of the
                    Spanish houses are built in the same manner and of the same materials. They are
                    raised on wooden pillars, eight or ten feet from the ground, the entrance to
                    them being by a ladder, which is pulled up at night. Most of the houses have
                    flights of steps leading to the river, which winds through the town; and many,
                    where the breadth of the river will admit, have baths. There is a number of
                    small canoes with awnings constantly plying for hire, by means of which the
                    inhabitants are enabled to visit one another with great convenience. Including
                    the suburbs, the population of the town is estimated at 38,000, of which 1200
                    are Spaniards. The remaining inhabitants are mulattoes, Indians, and Chinese,
                    who devote themselves to agriculture and to industry. Although the Spaniards are
                    averse to the settlement of the Chinese near them, and although the latter have
                    been several times cruelly expelled, yet there were in 1800 from 15,000 to
                    20,000 of that industrious nation settled on the island of Lucon. The country
                    around Manilla is delightful, being watered by a fine river which branches into
                    different streams. An intercourse is carried on between Manilla and the Chinese
                    port of Amoy, as well as with the north-eastern parts of China, by means of
                    seven or eight junks, which bring with them about 300 or 400 adventurers
                    annually from China. Manilla, though regularly fortified, is but feebly
                    garrisoned; and the native inhabitants have been so oppressed by the Spaniards,
                    that it is not likely they would offer any effectual aid against an invading
                    enemy. Under a wise and enlightened policy, Manilla, from its situation in
                    regard to India, China, and America, might rise into great importance as an
                    emporium of commerce; but the inhabitants are so harassed by Spanish tyranny,
                    and all sorts of absurd restrictions, that industry is greatly discouraged. The
                    chief exports are cordage, resinous substances, pitch and tar, cloths, rushes,
                    rattans, indigo of an excellent quality, rice, cotton, and tobacco, which is
                    manufactured into excellent cigars. The sugar-cane thrives well, but it is
                    little cultivated. Cocoa is produced, and of an excellent quality; and copper is
                    exported to Bengal, with indigo, cochineal, and a large quantity of treasure.
                    Three leagues south-west from Manilla lies the port of Cavite, defended by an
                    indifferent fort. A castle or fort stands at the west end of the city, and is
                    styled the citadel of St James. It is strong; and some additional works, which
                    still remain, were thrown up when the island was threatened, during the last
                    war, with an attack by the English. But notwithstanding the strength of the
                    works, it would have soon been taken if the attack had been made, as the
                    garrison was totally deficient in discipline. In 1645 great part of this eity
                    was destroyed by an earthquake, and 3000 people perished in the ruins. It was
                    taken in 1762 by the English, and, to save it from destruction, it was agreed to
                    pay a ransom of a million sterling. The viceroy is captaingeneral of the
                    Philippines; but the military strength which he possesses does not exceed 1500
                    men, mostly Mexicans, of whom 150 are cavalry. Long. 120. 54. E. Lat. 14. 38. N∙
