                <p><label type="entry">SOUNDING</label>, the operation of trying the depth of the
                    sea and the nature of the bottom, by means of a plummet sunk from a ship to the
                    bottom. There are two plummets used for this purpose; one of which is called the
                    <hi rend="italic">hand·lead,</hi> weighing about eight or nine pounds; and the
                    other the <hi rend="italic">deep-sea lead,</hi> which weighs from twenty-five to
                    thirty pounds; and both are shaped like the frustum of a cone or pyramid. The
                    former is used in shallow waters, and the latter at a great distance from the
                    shore, particularly on approaching the land after a seavoyage. Accordingly the
                    lines employed for this purpose are called the <hi rend="italic">deep-sea lead
                    line,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">handlead line.</hi> The handlead line,
                    which is usually twenty fathoms in length, is marked at every two or three
                    fathoms; so that the depth of the water may be ascertained either in the day or
                    night. At the depth of two or three fathoms there are marks of black leather; at
                    five fathoms, there is a white rag; at seven, a red rag; at ten, black leather;
                    at thirteen, black leather; at fifteen, a white rag; and at seventeen, a red
                    rag.</p>
                <p>Sounding with the handlead, which by seamen is called <hi rend="italic">heaving
                    the lead,</hi> is generally performed by a man who stands in the main chains to
                    windward. Having the line quite ready to run out without interruption, he holds
                    it nearly at the distance of a fathom from the plummet; and having swung the
                    latter backwards and forwards three or four times, in order to acquire the
                    greater velocity, he swings it round his head, and thence as far forward as is
                    necessary; so that by the lead’s sinking while the ship ad vances, the line may
                    be almost perpendicular when it reaches the bottom. The person sounding then
                    proclaims the depth of the water, in a kind of song resembling the cries of
                    hawkers in a city. Thus, if the mark of five fa thoms is close to the surface of
                    the water, he calls, “By the mark five ;” and as there is no mark at four, six,
                    eight, &amp;c&lt; he estimates those numbers, and calls, “By the dip four,”
                    &amp;c. If he judges it to be a quarter or an half more than any particular
                    number, he calls, “And a quarter five, and a half four,” &amp;c. If he conceives
                    the depth to be three more than a particular number, he calls it a quar ter less
                    than the next: thus, at four fathoms and three fourths he calls, “A quarter less
                    five.”</p>
                <p>The deep-sea lead is marked with two knots at twenty fathoms, three at thirty,
                    and four at forty, and so on to the end. It is also marked with a single knot in
                    the mid<pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=553"

                    thirtyfive, forty-five fathoms, &amp;c. To use this lead more effectually at
                    sea, or in deep water on the seacoast, it is usual previously to bring to the
                    ship, in order to retard her course: the lead is then thrown as far as possible
                    from the ship on the line of her drift, so that, as it sinks, the ship drives
                    more perpendicularly over it. The pilot, feeling the lead strike the bottom,
                    readily discovers the depth of the water by the mark on the line nearest its
                    surface. The bottom of the lead being also well rubbed over with tallow, retains
                    the distinguishing marks of the bottom, as shells, ooze, gravel, <hi

                    and the nature of the ground, which is called the <hi rend="italic"
                    >soundings,</hi> are carefully marked in the logbook, as well to determine the
                    distance of the place from the shore, as to correct the observations of former
                    pilots.</p>
