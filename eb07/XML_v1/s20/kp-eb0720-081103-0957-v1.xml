                <p><label type="entry">SUPERSTITION</label>, a word that has been used so
                    indefinitely that it is difficult to determine its precise meaning. From its
                    resemblance in sound to the Latin word <hi rend="italic">superstes,</hi> a
                    survivor, it is evidently derived from it, and different attempts have been made
                    to trace their connection in signification. In the dialogue of Cicero “De Natura
                    Deorum,” Balbus says that they who prayed and sacrificed whole days that their
                    children might <hi rend="italic">surrιι∙e</hi> them, were called superstitious.
                    Lactantius censures this etymology, and avers that they were not called
                    superstitious who wished that their children might survive them (for this we all
                    wish), but because they who survived their parents worshipped their images.
                    Others again affirm that superstition is derived from <hi rend="italic"
                    >superstes,</hi> because it consisted in considering the dead as if they were
                    alive. But these etymologies are solely conjectural, and we consider conjectures
                    as absurd in philology as we do in science; they may mislead, but are seldom of
                    any benefit. The usual meaning affixed to the word superstition, both in the
                    Latin and English languages, is so different from <hi rend="italic"
                    >superstes,</hi> that its change of meaning must be owing to some accident after
                    which it is in vain to inquire. If we had not known that the word <hi
                    rend="italic">paganus,</hi> a pagan, was derived from <hi rend="italic"
                    >pagus,</hi> a village, because the heathens in a certain period of the
                    Christian history lived in villages, the whims and fancies of etymologists would
                    not have thrown much light on the subject.</p>
                <p>Without labouring, from the aid of etymology, to define superstition, which is a
                    word of a very extensive signification, we shall consider to what objects it is
                    applied; and then, by observing what is common to them all, we shall be enabled
                    to fix with some degree of precision the meaning of the term. We apply it to the
                    idolatry of the heathens; we apply it also to the Jews, who made the will of God
                    of no effect by their traditions, and substituted ceremonies in place of the
                    religion of their fathers. We say also that Christians are guilty of
                    superstition; the Romanists, who believe in transubstantiation and in the
                    efficacy of prayers to saints; and those Protestants who esteem baptism and the
                    Lord’s Supper, and the punctual performance of other ceremonies, without regard
                    to morality, as sufficient to ensure salvation. Those persons are also reckoned
                    superstitious who believe, without any evidence, that prophecies are still
                    uttered by divine inspiration, and that miracles are still performed. The word
                    is also extended to those who believe in witchcraft, magic, and apparitions, or
                    that the divine will is declared by omens or augury; that the fortune of
                    individuals can be affected by things indifferent, by things deemed lucky or
                    unlucky, or that diseases can be cured by words, charms, and incantations.</p>
                <p>Through all the particulars which we have enumerated, there runs one general
                    idea, the belief of what is false and contrary to reason. From this, however, we
                    must not suppose that whatever is false and contrary to reason may be
                    denominated superstition. Superstition has always a reference to God, to
                    religion, or to beings superior to man. We do not however distinguish all false
                    and irrational opinions in religion by the name of superstition. We do not, for
                    instance, apply this name to the opinions which some of the ancients
                    entertained, that God is the soul of the world, and that men are only portions
                    of him separated for a time; or that the soul after death lives successively in
                    different bodies. If we examine the subject with more attention, we shall
                    discover that the foundation of superstition is ignorance of the moral
                    attributes of God; for we never say a man is superstitious for entertaining
                    erroneous opinions of the natural attributes of God. Some of the Socinians have
                    denied the prescience of God; and a French philosopher has not only rejected the
                    belief that he is a spirit, but has presumed to say that he is composed of a
                    species of crystals. The first of these opinions discovers very imperfect ideas
                    of God, and the second is the height of impiety and absurdity; yet the Socinians
                    have not been accused of superstition, nor can this French philosopher be
                    suspected of it. We do not call every false opinion concerning the unity or
                    moral attributes of God by the name of superstition, as, for instance, the
                    opinion which some sceptics have supported, that God is not good; for, as was
                    mentioned before, superstition always involves the idea of credulity. It does
                    not consist in falsely denying that God possesses any particular moral
                    attributes, but in believing more than what is true concerning them; in forming
                    mean, unworthy ideas of them; in supposing that he is guided by blind passion
                    like mankind, and enjoins upon his creatures commandments which are irrational
                    and absurd.</p>
                <p>As superstition arises from ignorance and credulity in the understanding, so it
                    has also a seat in the passions. Fear has been commonly considered as a passion
                    of the human mind, from which it chiefly derives its origin; and there is no
                    doubt that more superstition has arisen from fear united with ignorance and
                    credulity, than from any other passion; yet it would certainly be improper to
                    exclude all other passions. We cannot account for the superstition of the
                    Egyptians, without supposing that much of it arose from gratitude. They
                    worshipped the Nile, because it distributed fertility and abundance over the
                    land of Egypt; and they worshipped some animals, merely because they prevented
                    the increase of other animals which were noxious. Thus they adored the ibis,
                    because it destroyed the eggs of the crocodile.</p>
                <p>Having thus endeavoured to analyse the ideas comprehended under the word
                    superstition, we may sum them up in a few words. It respects God and beings
                    superior to man, and extends to our religious opinions, worship, and practices;
                    and may be defined absurd opinions and actions arising from mean and defective
                    ideas of the moral attributes of God. Let us apply this definition to the
                    different species of superstition already mentioned.</p>
                <p>But before entering upon this application, it may be proper to observe, that
                    superstition involves the idea of a blameable inattention to reason, or a
                    credulity arising from an indolence of understanding. We generally make a
                    distinction between the imperfect opinions which a savage, from the necessary
                    effects of his situation, forms of the attributes of God, and those which
                    civilized nations entertain. We say the savage is ignorant, and we ascribe his
                    ignorance to bis situation; but we call the Roman Catholic superstitious, and we
                    blame him for not having those just ideas of God which he might have obtained by
                    opening his Bible, or by the exercise of his understanding in the favourable
                    situation in which he is placed. Superstition, then, does not originate so much
                    from the natural weakness of the human understanding, as from a misapplication
                    or a neglect of ft.</p>
                <p>We cannot therefore with any propriety apply the name <hi rend="italic"
                    >superstition</hi> to polytheism in general; for what all the ancient
                    philosophers, after much study and reflection, concluded to be true, could never
                    proceed from credulity and inattention, but from their situation. We speak very
                    properly, however, when we call idolatry by the name of superstition; because
                    there is no man so devoid of understanding as not to be capable of discovering
                    that a piece of<pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=958"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0720-0958-0812"/> metal, or wood, or stone, can neither hear nor
                    answer petitions. Superstition was a name which the ancient philosophers gave to
                    those who entertained mean opinions of the gods, or did foolish things to obtain
                    their favour. According to Theophrastus, the superstitious man is one who,
                    having washed his hands, and sprinkled himself all round, leaves the temple with
                    a laurel leaf in his mouth, with which he walks about the whole day. Or, if a
                    weasel should cross his path, he will not advance a step till he has thrown
                    three stones over the road. If he find a serpent in his house, he rears a place
                    of devotion on the spot. He often purifies his house, will not sit upon a grave,
                    or touch a dead person. He is anxious about the interpretation of his dreams,
                    will not offer a sacrifice unless his wife go along with him, or, if she is
                    engaged, he takes the nurse and the little children. He purifies himself with
                    onions; and when he sees a mad or an epileptic person, he spits in his bosom.
                    Such was the character of superstition in the days of Theophrastus. All these
                    whimsical ceremonies were performed in order to prevent mischief, and to avert
                    the wrath of the gods; and therefore perfectly correspond with the definition
                    given above.</p>
                <p>It is only necessary to consider a little the superstitious opinions and
                    practices among Jews and Christians, to be sensible that they have all arisen
                    from mean and absurd ideas of the moral attributes of God; for they have
                    generally entertained noble opinions of his natural attributes. The Jews
                    considered God as a partial being, who had a predilection for their nation in
                    preference to all others, and preferred external homage and ceremony to moral
                    purity. If the Romanists think consistently, they must esteem God as a being who
                    can be prevailed upon by the importunity of one dead man to assist another, or
                    as a being whose patience would be fatigued with hearing prayers constantly.
                    Hence their practice of praying to saints. They in effect believe, however they
                    may deceive themselves, that God is unjust, or they could not believe
                    transubstantiation; for it supposes that God can give commands directly contrary
                    to those principles of belief with which he has endued the human mind. They
                    consider a strict adherence to a variety of ceremonies, to forms, pomp, and
                    show', as essential to the worship of God; and thus they evidently betray most
                    inadequate conceptions of the creator and governor of the universe. They thought
                    it their duty to extirpate heretics: this was supposing God a cruel and
                    revengeful being. Even among Protestants, we are sorry to say, a great deal of
                    superstition remains: we have not yet learned to consider God as a spirit, who
                    is to be worshipped in spirit and in truth, as a pure, moral, benevolent being;
                    and hence arise all the superstitious practices which prevail in some Protestant
                    churches.</p>
                <p>Besides those superstitious opinions and practices which entirely respect our
                    duty to God, there arc others which may be termed vulgar superstitions. These
                    also arise from imperfect and mean ideas of the moral attributes of God. To
                    believe vulgar prophecies, which are always the effusions of madness or knavery,
                    is to suppose that God, who has drawn a veil over futurity, and only delivers
                    prophecies to accomplish some great moral purpose, sometimes gives them for no
                    purpose at all, or to gratify idle curiosity, or to disclose such a knowledge of
                    what is to happen as is inconsistent with the free agency of man and the moral
                    administration of the world. Nor is it less superstitious to believe in vulgar
                    miracles. To believe in them, is to believe that God suspends the laws of nature
                    for the most trivial purposes, or to countenance fraud and worldly ambition: it
                    is to receive the most extraordinary facts upon the most unsatisfactory
                    evidence. The belief of witchcraft, of apparitions, and the second sight, may be
                    resolved into the same principle. 'Γo suppose that God would communicate the
                    power of doing mischief, and of controlling his laws, to crea tures, merely for
                    gratifying their own passions, is unworthy of God. The belief of apparitions is
                    equally inconsistent with the goodness of God. The same objection rises against
                    the second sight as against the belief of vulgar pro-phecics, and may also be
                    extended to omens, to astrology, to things lucky and unlucky, and to
                    fortune-telling. As to the different devices and charms for preventing and
                    curing disorders, they resemble in every respect false miracles.</p>
                <p>A judicious history of superstition would be a curious and entertaining work, and
                    would exhibit the human character in a remarkable point of view. Superstition is
                    most prevalent among men of weak and uncultivated minds; it is more frequent in
                    the female sex than among men, and abounds more in the rude than in the refined
                    stages of society. The general features of it have been the same in all ages;
                    but it assumes certain peculiarities, according to the diversity of character in
                    different nations. It gained admission into the science of medicine at an early
                    period. He who was endowed with superior genius and knowledge was reckoned a
                    magician. Dr Bartolo was seized by the inquisition at Rome in the seventeenth
                    century, because he unexpectedly cured a nobleman of the gout. Diseases were
                    imputed to fascination, and hundreds of poor wretches were dragged to the stake
                    for being accessory to them. Mercatus, physician to Philip II. of Spain, a
                    writer of uncommon accuracy and information, appears strongly inclined to deny
                    the existence of fascinatory diseases; but he is constrained to acknowledge them
                    for two reasons; 1st, because the inquisition had decided in favour of their
                    reality; 2dly, because he had seen a very beautiful woman break a steel-mirror
                    to pieces, and blast some trees by a single glance of her eyes.</p>
                <p>As the opinions concerning the cause of diseases were superstitious, those
                    concerning the method of curing them were not less so. In the Odyssey we read of
                    a cure performed by a song. Josephus relates, that he saw a certain Jew, named
                    Eleazar, draw the devil out of an old woman’s nostrils by the application of
                    Solomon's seal to her nose, in presence of the Emperor Vespasian. Many different
                    kinds of applications were used for expelling the devil. Flagellation sometimes
                    succeeded admirably: purgatives and antispasmodics were other modes of
                    discharging him. Dr Mynsight cured several bewitched persons with a plaster of
                    assafoetida. How the assafoetida was so efficacious, was much disputed. Some
                    thought the devil might consider so vile an application as an insult, and run
                    off in a passion; but others very sagely observed, that as devils are supposed
                    to have eyes and ears, they might likewise have noses.</p>
                <p>Nor was it only in medicine that these superstitious opinions were entertained,
                    they also prevailed in natural philosophy. The pernicious effects in mines,
                    which we now know are occasioned by noxious air, were confidently imputed to the
                    demons of the mine. Even Van Hehnont, Bodin, Strozza, and Luther, attributed
                    thunder and meteors to the devil. Chemists were employed for centuries in search
                    of the philosopher’s stone, with which they were to perform miracles. It was a
                    common question among philosophers in the seventeenth century, whether the
                    imagination could move external objects; a question generally decided in the
                    affirmative.</p>
                <p>Though superstition be generally the mark of a weak mind, such is the infirmity
                    of human nature, that we find many instances of it among men of the most sublime
                    genius and most enlightened minds. Socrates believed that he was guided by a
                    demon. Lord Bacon believed in witchcraft; and relates that he was cured of warts
                    by rubbing them with a piece of lard with the skin on, and then nailing it with
                    the fat towards the sun on the post of a chamber window facing the sun. Henry
                    IV., one of the most illustrious of monarchs, was very uneasy before his
                    assassination, on account of some prophecies. Sully declares,<pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=959" xml:id="kp-eb0720-0959-0813"/>
                    that one of the considerations that kept him faithful to his master in the most
                    unpromising state of his affairs, was a prediction of La Brosse, that Henry
                    would make his fortune. The astrologer Morin directed Cardinal de Richelieu’s
                    motions in some of his journeys. The enlightened Cudworth defended prophecies in
                    general, and called those who opposed the belief of witchcraft by the name of
                    atheists; and the predictions of Rice Evans were supported in the eighteenth
                    century by the celebrated names of Warburton and Jortin. Dr Hoffmann, the father
                    of the modern theory and practice of medicine, in a dissertation published in
                    the large edition of his works in 1747, says, that the devil can raise storms,
                    produce insects, and act upon the animal spirits and imagination; and, in fine,
                    that he is an excellent optician and natural philosopher, on account of his long
                    experience. Dr Johnson is supposed to have believed in the second sight.</p>
                <p>With respect to the effects of superstition on the human mind, they are indeed
                    deplorable. It chains down the understanding, and sinks it into the most abject
                    and sordid state, and keeps it under the dominion of fear, and sometimes of
                    cruelty. Where once it takes possession, it has a tendency to become extreme,
                    and generally becomes so intolerable, that men of reflection and learning
                    conspire its destruction. The Christian religion gave a violent shock to the
                    heathen superstition; the reformation in a great measure demolished the
                    superstition of the church of Rome; and the superstition which remained among
                    Protestants after their separation from that church has been gradually yielding
                    to the influence of enlightened reason, or to the bold and daring attacks of
                    infidelity and deism. We behold the prospect of its ruins with pleasure, and
                    thank the deists for their zeal; but it is from the firm hope that the religion
                    of Jesus will arise in all its beauty and simple majesty, and be admired and
                    respected as it deserves; for, mean and contemptible as superstition certainly
                    is, we would rather see men do what they reckon their duty from superstitious
                    principles, than see anarchy and vice prevail, even though attended with all the
                    knowledge and liberality of sentiment which deism and infidelity can
                    inspire.</p>
