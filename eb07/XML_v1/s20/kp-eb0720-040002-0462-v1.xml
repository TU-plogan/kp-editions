                <p><label type="entry">SMELLIE, <hi rend="smallcaps">William</hi></label>, a learned
                    and ingenious printer, was born at Edinburgh in the year 1740. His father,
                    Alexander Smellie, who followed the occupation of a master-builder, is said to
                    have been a classical scholar, and a writer of Latin verses. He belonged to the
                    sect of reformed Presbyterians, more commonly described as Cameronians. He left
                    two sons and three daughters. John, the elder son, followed his father’s
                    employment, and married a sister of the late James Ferrier, Esq. clerk of
                    session. Two of his daughters were likewise married. Residing in the suburban
                    street called the Pleasance, he sent his younger son to Duddingstone school,
                    which is scarcely a mile distant. William Smellie was there initiated in the
                    ordinary branches of education, including the Latin language; but he left school
                    at the early age of twelve, and was destined to follow some mechanical
                    employment. It was his father’s original intention to bind him an apprentice to
                    a staymaker, but some difference occurred as to the terms of the indenture; “and
                    the young scholar was preserved from the mortifying drudgery of scraping
                    whalebone, and stitching coats of armour to force the female form into every
                    shape save that of natural elegance.” On the first of October 1752, he was bound
                    an apprentice, for six years and a half, to Hamilton, Balfour, and Neill,
                    printers to the university.</p>
                <p>To this occupation he applied himself with great assiduity, and he soon became
                    conspicuous for the rapidity, as well as the correctness, with which he
                    dispatched his work. With equal assiduity he devoted his evenings to the
                    acquisition of knowledge. Two years before the expiration of his apprenticeship,
                    his masters appointed him a corrector of the press, with a weekly allowance of
                    ten shillings, which at that period was no despicable remuneration. His father
                    was now dead, and two of his sisters were materially indebted to him for their
                    support. During his apprenticeship, he was permitted to attend some of the
                    academical lectures. The printing-office was within the precincts of the
                    university buildings; “and he generally continued at work till he heard the bell
                    ring for lecture, when he immediately laid down his composing-stick, shifted his
                    coat, ran off with his note-book under his arm, and returned to his work
                    immediately after lecture.” The Edinburgh Philosophical Society having offered a
                    silver medal for the most accurate edition of a Latin classic, Smellie set and
                    corrected an edition of Terence, which obtained this prize for his employers.
                    His edition, which bears the date of 1758, but was actually printed during the
                    preceding year, has been described as immaculate; but of the literal accuracy of
                    this description, we entertain some doubt. It is very elegantly printed, and is
                    in all respects creditable to the Edinburgh press of that period. His
                    apprenticeship was completed on the first of April 1759; and in the ensuing
                    month of September, he agreed to transfer his services to the office of Murray
                    and Cochrane. Here he was not only to perform the ordinary work of a corrector,
                    but was likewise to collect articles for the Scots Magazine, and to make
                    abstracts, extracts, or transcripts of such pieces as his employers should
                    direct. He was moreover to lend his aid “in writing accounts, and, in cases of
                    hurry in printing, in composing or case-work and in return for these various
                    services, he was to receive a weekly salary of sixteen shillings.</p>
                <p>It was one advantage of his new situation, that his employers allowed him three
                    hours a-day for the prosecution of his academical studies; and thus, under
                    peculiar circumstances, he was enabled to obtain a regular education. He not
                    only studied the Latin, Greek, and Hebrew languages, but likewise mathematics,
                    logic, rhetoric, moral, and natural philosophy. He besides attended all the
                    medical courses, including the lectures on chemistry and botany. The Hebrew
                    class he attended in the year 1758, with the immediate view of preparing himself
                    to superintend the printing of Dr. Robertson’s Hebrew Grammar. His course of
                    study had thus been so regular and complete, that he was in a state of mature
                    preparation for more than one of the learned professions. Some of his friends
                    recommended the study of divinity; Dr. Buchan urged him to betake himself to the
                    practice of physic; but the hazard of relinquishing a certain though small
                    income for a very uncertain experiment, must have served to mancipate him to his
                    original avocation. An early marriage fixed him more completely in the
                    printing-office. His wife, Jane Robertson, was the daughter of an army-agent in
                    London, who had once been opulent, but who finally left his family in indigent
                    circumstances. Her mother was the cousin of Mrs. Oswald of Dunikier, and there
                    were other family connexions described as genteel, but they do not appear to
                    have rendered any service to Smellie or his children. The marriage took place in
                    1763, when he had only attained the twenty-third year of his age.</p>
                <p>In the mean time, his love of learning suffered no abatement. In the year 1760 he
                    had become a member of the Newtonian Society, a literary association chiefly
                    composed of young men educated in the university. They held their weekly
                    meetings in one of the class-rooms. At each meeting an essay was read by one of
                    the members; and a subject, previously assigned, was discussed in due form. The
                    essays were restricted to subjects of natural science, but the debates extended
                    to a wider range. The list of members included various names which were
                    afterwards conspicuously known; and among others, we find that of Robert Blair,
                    the late president of the court of session. To this association likewise
                    belonged Thomas Blacklock, Robert Hamilton, Alexander Adam, Henry Hunter, Samuel
                    Charters, and William Buchan. After the interruption of their regular meetings
                    as a society, some of the members continued for several years to hold a weekly
                    meeting in a tavern, where they partook of a sober repast, and spent their
                    evenings in literary and social conversation. With two very estimable members of
                    this club, Dr. Hamilton of Aberdeen, and Dr. Charters of Wilton, Smellie always
                    retained a friendly connexion. A new association, of which he acted as
                    secretary, was formed in the year 1778, under the denomination of the Newtonian
                    Club. Most of the other members were connected with the medical profession, and
                    five of them either then were or afterwards became medical professors in the
                    university. In the list of these associates we find the names of Dugald Stewart
                    and James Gregory. No person was eligible unless he was a member of the
                    Philosophical Society; and the meetings of the club were appointed to take place
                    immediately after the close of each meeting of the society. The number of
                    members was not to exceed twenty; and a single black ball was to exclude any
                    candidate. The last of their regulations stands thus: “As this club consists
                    entirely of philosophers, it would therefore be ridiculous to make any laws for
                    its internal police.”</p>
                <p>For the different branches of natural history Smellie had evinced an early
                    predilection. To the study of botany he devoted so much attention, that in 1765
                    his Dissertation on the Sexes of Plants gained the gold medal given by Dr. Hope.
                    In this dissertation, which was inserted in the first edition of the
                    Encyclopaedia, he strenuously opposed the<pb break="no"

                    ><p>Smellie’s Philosophy of Natural History, vol. i. p. 245.</p></note> The
                    substance of it was incorporated in his Philosophy of Natural History; and his
                    opinions were then controverted by Dr. Rotheram, afterwards professor of natural
                    philosophy at St. Andrews. Of his proficiency in these studies we find a more
                    conspicuous proof. While he was attending the botanical class, the professor
                    sprained his leg so severely that for a considerable interval he was unable to
                    meet his students; and on this occasion he selected Smellie to continue the
                    course of lectures. In a botanic garden, lectures cannot be servilely read from
                    papers, either written by the lecturer himself, or supplied by others.</p>
                <p>On the 25th of March 1765 he commenced business as a printer, in conjunction with
                    two brothers named Robert and William Auld, the former of whom was a solicitor.
                    His private resources were obviously scanty; and two of his friends, Dr.
                    Robertson, professor of oriental languages, and Dr Hope, professor of botany,
                    advanced to him the sum of seventy pounds, which we reckon equivalent to two
                    hundred in our present currency. This copartnery was dissolved within the space
                    of less than two years, by the retirement of Robert Auld; but a new company,
                    consisting of Baltbur, W. Auld, and Smellie, commenced business on the 22d of
                    December 1766. John Balfour, who was likewise a bookseller, had been apartner in
                    the house of Hamilton, Balfour, and Neill. The new house published the Journal,
                    a newspaper supposed to have been unprofitable. Their connexion only continued
                    till the month of November 1771; and the modified firm of Balfour and Smellie
                    continued the business from the twelfth of that month. Beside his share of the
                    profits, the junior partner was to receive ninety pounds a-year, and he was
                    bound to conduct the entire business of the office. His average income amounted
                    to about L.200. After an interval of more than two years, he easily obtained
                    from Lord Kames the favour of his becoming surety to the Royal Bank for a
                    cash-account to the extent of two or three hundred pounds. Their acquaintance
                    had arisen from a series of anonymous strictures which he communicated to his
                    lordship when the Elements of Criticism were passing through the press of Murray
                    and Cochrane. The author requested the acquaintance of his nameless critic, and
                    afterwards honoured him with various marks of his friendly attention. He
                    incidentally mentions his supping with Lord Kames, in company with Hume and
                    other guests. He was likewise a guest at the learned suppers of Lord Monboddo;
                    and he reckoned Lord Hailes, as well as Lord Gardenstone, among the number of
                    his friends and well-wishers.</p>
                <p>Balfour and Smellie were appointed printers to the university. The chief
                    advantage which attended this appointment was the profit of printing the
                    dissertations written by candidates for medical degrees. Smellie likewise
                    printed the theses written by candidates for admission to the Faculty of
                    Advocates; and his knowledge of the Latin language was in both cases found very
                    serviceable to the writers. He rendered material assistance to his friend Dr.
                    Buchan, in the composition of a work which attained to very extensive
                    popularity. This work, entitled “Domestic Medicine, or, a Treatise on the Cure
                    and Prevention of Diseases,” was published at Edinburgh in the year 1770. In the
                    course of forty years, it is said to have passed through twenty editions, each
                    consisting of 6000 copies, besides many pirated editions in Ireland and America,
                    and some even in Britain. Of this treatise, Smellie was sometimes represented as
                    the sole author; but it appears with sufficient evidence that the manuscript was
                    placed in his hands, and that in preparing it for the press, he made many
                    essential alterations in its form and style. It was so diffuse and redundant,
                    that a single chapter, as originally written, would nearly have equalled the
                    size of the entire book, as at first printed. These services were compensated
                    with a bill for one hundred pounds.</p>
                <p>Of Smellie’s life, we have now arrived at an era which recommends him to the more
                    particular regard of the wτiters and readers of the present work. The first
                    edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica consisted of only three volumes, which
                    began to be printed in the year 1771. The principal articles were written,
                    compiled, or devised by him, and he prepared and superintended the entire
                    publication. “As you have informed me,” says a letter of Andrew Bell, the chief
                    proprietor, “that there are fifteen capital sciences which you will undertake
                    for, and write up the subdivisions and detached parts, conform[ably] to your
                    plan, and likewise to prepare the whole work for the press, &amp;c. &amp;c., we
                    hereby agree to allow you L.200 for your trouble.” If his capital sciences had
                    not exceeded the old number of seven, this remuncration could scarcely have been
                    considered as extravagant. One of his original articles, contributed to this
                    edition, was that on <hi rend="italic">AEther,</hi> which attracted a
                    considerable degree of attention, and gave no small offence to Dr. Cullen, whose
                    theory was there exposed, though without any mention of his name. From internal
                    evidence, he was convinced that the article must have been written by his
                    colleague Dr. John Gregory. He at length ascertained the real author; and this
                    discovery, says the late Dr. Gregory, “gave occasion to the complete alteration
                    and softening of the article AEther in the second and all the subsequent
                    editions of the Encyclopaedia; so that nothing of it was allowed to remain that
                    could give offence to Dr. Cullen.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>Of the second edition of this work Smellie was offered a share, apparently a
                    third, conjoined with the charge of editorship. This offer he unfortunately
                    declined, and thus lost the only golden opportunity that fortune ever presented
                    to him. “At the death of Mr. Macfarquhar, printer, in April 1793, the whole work
                    became the property of Mr. Bell. It is well known that Mr. Macfarquhar left a
                    handsome fortune to his family, all or mostly derived from the profits of the
                    Encyclopaedia; and that Mr. Bell died in great affluence, besides possessing the
                    entire property of that vast work; every shilling of which may be fairly stated
                    as having grown from the labours of Mr. Smellie in the original fabrication of
                    the work, which is confessedly superior, and all of which he and his family
                    might have shared in equally with Mr. Bell and the other proprietor, if he had
                    not been too fastidious in his notions, and perhaps too timid in his views of
                    the risk which might have been incurred in the mercantile part of the
                    speculation.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>• Kerr’«

                    objection is stated, not with much probability, to have arisen from a difference
                    of opinion as to the general plan: “because the other persons concerned, it has
                    been said upon the suggestion of a very distinguished nobleman of the highest
                    rank and most princely fortune, insisted upon the introduction of a system of
                    general biography; which Mr. Smellie objected to, as by no means consistent with
                    the title." If this statement is accurate, we consider the nobleman as decidedly
                    right, and Smellie as decidedly wrong; inasmuch as the historical and
                    biographical part of the work has recommended it to many readers, who do not
                    feel an equal degree of interest in the arts and sciences. The perfection of
                    such a work is to render it agreeable as well as instructive to the greatest
                    possible number of readers. The second edition, consisting of 1500 copies, began
                    to be published in 1776. The third, extending to no fewer than 10,000 copies of

                    informed, the two proprietors “are said to have cleared a net profit of
                    L.42,000, besides being each paid for their respective work in the conduct of
                    the publication as tradesmen; Mr. Bell as engraver of all the plates, and Mr.
                    Macfarquhar as sole printer.”</p>
                <p>Smellie afterwards embarked in a speculation which did not prove so lucrative.
                    This was “The Edinburgh Magazine and Review,” of which the first number appeared
                    in the month of October 1773. The editor was Dr. Stuart, whose temper and
                    discretion were not equal to his talents and learning. Smellie was one of five
                    partners, including the editor; and besides printing the work at the ordinary
                    rates, he “was regularly to compile the last half-sheet of every number, to
                    consist of foreign and domestic occurrences, or the news-department, and other
                    articles; to keep the accounts of the concern; to answer all letters relative to
                    the concern; and to review certain articles, as should be agreed upon between
                    him and Dr. Stuart.” The work only extended to five volumes, closing with the
                    number for August 1776. It was conducted with so much ability, that it might
                    have run a more prosperous career, if the personalities of the editor, displayed
                    within so narrow a field, had not excited a degree of hostility with which it
                    was hopeless to contend. But the history of this work will be resumed in our
                    notice of Gilbert Stuart.</p>
                <p>Of the Society of Antiquaries, instituted at Edinburgh in 1780, Smellie was an
                    original member. In 1781 he was elected Superintendent of the Museum of Natural
                    History, which they proposed adding to their antiquarian cabinet. He afterwards
                    published an “Account of the Institution and Progress of the Society of the
                    Antiquaries of Scotland.” Edinb. 1782, 4to. To this account he added a second
                    part in 1784. He was elected to the office of secretary in 1793. This new
                    institution excited the jealousy of some other learned bodies. The senate of the
                    university presented a memorial to the lord advocate, remonstrating against the
                    grant of a royal charter to the Society of Antiquaries, on the allegation that
                    Scotland was too limited a country for two literary Societies; and proposing,
                    that instead of granting such a charter, the king should incorporate a society
                    under the designation of the Royal Society of Scotland. They further suggested
                    “that the Society of Antiquaries would intercept the communication of many
                    specimens and objects of natural history, which would otherwise be deposited in
                    the museum of the university, and of many documents tending to illustrate the
                    history, antiquities, and laws of Scotland, from being deposited in the library
                    of the Faculty of Advocates. They likewise noticed that the possession of a
                    museum of natural history might enable and induce the Society of Antiquaries to
                    institute a lectureship of natural history, in opposition to the professorship
                    in the university.” Nor did the curators of the Advocates Library remain
                    inactive. They represented to the lord advocate that the grant of a charter to
                    the Antiquaries “might prove injurious to that magnificent library, by
                    intercepting ancient manuscripts and monuments illustrative of the history and
                    antiquities of Scotland, which would be more useful when collected into one
                    repository than in a state of division.” To all these representations the
                    Society returned an elaborate answer, in the form of a memorial addressed to the
                    lord advocate; and the royal charter was finally ratified in the month of May
                    1783. It is scarcely necessary to add, that few or none of the multifarious
                    evils which had thus been predicted, were found to result from the incorporation
                    of this Society, which has proved almost as harmless as any institution in the
                    kingdom. The Royal Society of Edinburgh soon afterwards obtained its charter;
                    and as a member of the Philosophical Society, Smellie was incorporated on the
                    23d of June 1783.</p>
                <p>At the request of the Society of Antiquaries, he had in 1781 digested the plan of
                    a statistical account of all tl&gt;e parishes of Scotland. The circulation of
                    this plan did not excite much industry; but, at no distant period, it was
                    followed by an extensive and important work. As superintendent of the museum, he
                    was authorized to deliver in their hall a course of lectures on natural history.
                    “His object was to deliver lectures on the philosophy of natural history, which
                    is a subject totally different from what a public professor is obliged to teach.
                    A professor must instruct his students in the technical and elementary part of
                    the science; but the private lecturer was to confine himself to general views of
                    the economy of nature.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Smellie's Account of the Society of Antiquaries, part ii. p. 21.</p></note>
                    The professor of natural history, who certainly had reason to fear such a rival,
                    was alarmed at what he considered as an encroachment on his province, und this
                    plan of lectures was reluctantly abandoned. On the death of Dr. Ramsay in the
                    year 1775, Smellie had offered himself as a candidate for the professorship; but
                    his claims were disregarded, and it was bestowed upon Dr. Walker, at that time
                    minister of Moffat, and afterwards of Colinton.</p>
                <p>Smellie however continued to prosecute his favourite study, and he published
                    “Natural History, general and particular, by the Count de Button: translated
                    into English. Illustrated with above 200 copper-plates, and occasional notes and
                    observations by the Translator.” Edinb. 1781, 8 vols. 8vo. “Much the greater
                    portion of this extensive work,” says Mr. Kerr, “was executed in a small
                    correcting room or closet connected with his printing-office, where he was
                    continually liable to interruption, from the introduction of proof-sheets for
                    correction, and revises for comparison, and to the almost perpetual calls of
                    customers, authors, and idle acquaintances: yet such was his accuracy of
                    self-possession, that, as usual with almost every thing he wrote, he gave it out
                    page by page, as fast as written, to his compositors, and hardly ever found it
                    necessary to alter a single word after the types were set up from his first
                    uncorrected manuscript. Although, to have enabled him to execute this
                    translation in the excellent manner in which it is done, Mr. Smellie must
                    necessarily have possessed a very thorough knowledge of the French language, it
                    appears that he had acquired this entirely by means of his own private study,
                    and without the assistance of any teacher; for we have been assured by those who
                    knew him very intimately, that he was quite unacquainted with the pronunciation
                    of French.” A second edition of his translation, in nine volumes, followed in
                    the year 1785. Other three editions, all of them extensive, were afterwards
                    published; so that the work may be considered as having been eminently
                    successful. The translator’s notes were allowed to have added no inconsiderable
                    value to the text; and the chief fault imputed to him was the use of provincial
                    idioms. He was honoured with the correspondence of Buffon, and likewise of
                    Pennant.</p>
                <p>The firm of Balfour and Smellie having been dissolved, that of Creech and Smellie
                    began business on the 14th of September 1782, and continued it till the close of
                    the year 1789- Creech, well-known as a bookseller, was in all cases difficult to
                    bring to a settlement of accompts, when he had any reason to believe the balance
                    to be on the wrong side. The affairs of this copartnery, being somewhat
                    intricate, were submitted to arbitration, and a balance was ultimately found due
                    to Smellie; but the decision was so long deferred, that it was not pronounced
                    till some time after his death. After the termination of these different
                    partnerships, he continued the business on his own account. Lord Kames died in
                    the year 1782; and he was now indebted to the kindness of Lord Gardenstone, who
                    became his surety to the banking-house of Sir W. Forbes and Co.<pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=465" xml:id="kp-eb0720-0465-0403"/>
                    His next publication was “An Address to the People of Scotland, on the Nature,
                    Powers, and Privileges of Juries. By a Juryman.” Edinb. 1784, 8vo. This tract is
                    entitled to particular notice, because it contains a clear and judicious
                    exposition of legal principles, very important in themselves, and at that period
                    very little understood. “It is,” he remarks, “a common notion that jurymen are
                    judges of the <hi rend="italic">fact</hi> only, and not of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >law.</hi> This absurd, and often fatal prejudice is much more prevalent than
                    might be expected, in a city like this, where general knowledge ought to be
                    pretty widely diffused. It has perhaps been too much fostered by the injunctions
                    of judges and magistrates. It is exceedingly natural that plain simple jurymen
                    should look up with veneration to the high rank, and superior abilities of those
                    men who are appointed by their sovereign to dispense justice over the nation.
                    For this reason it is, that the English judges are so extremely solicitous not
                    to inculcate their own opinions on the minds of jurymen, but to leave their
                    determinations solely to the dictates of their own consciences. But from
                    whatever source this prejudice may have derived its origin, I shall endeavour to
                    shew that it has neither law nor common sense for its support.” A further
                    specimen may very satisfactorily be produced. “I know it to be the opinion of
                    many jurymen, that after the court admits a <hi rend="italic">relevancy,</hi>
                    they are bound by their oaths to find the libel either <hi rend="italic"
                    >proved</hi> or <hi rend="italic">not proved.</hi> But these gentlemen should
                    consider, that their business is to give a verdict of a very different kind.
                    They are to judge both of the criminality of the culprit, and of his exculpatory
                    evidence. The words <hi rend="italic">proved</hi> or <hi rend="italic">nor
                    proved</hi> should be for ever banished from the verdicts of juries. A relevancy
                    may be found, when the jurymen, who hear the indictment impugned, are of an
                    opposite opinion from the court. A crime may be libelled, when the facts related
                    in the indictment, though completely proved, do not constitute the essence of
                    the crime charged. Hence, whenever the minds of jurymen are convinced that a
                    relevancy has been improperly found, their verdict, however the proof may stand,
                    should be <hi rend="italic">Not guilty.</hi> Indeed, the expressions, <hi
                    rend="italic">Guilty</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Not guilty</hi> ought alone to be
                    employed in verdicts.” This tract excited a considerable degree of attention;
                    and it was quoted with much approbation by Lord Erskine, in his famous speech in
                    defence of Dr. Shipley, dean of St. Asaph. He published several other pamphlets,
                    which chiefly related to local politics.</p>
                <p>But the most elaborate of his works is “The Philosophy of Natural History.”
                    Edinb. 1790, 4to. This is an ingenious book, written in a very pleasing style,
                    and it accordingly experienced a favourable reception. It was reprinted at
                    Dublin and Philadelphia. Lichtenstein published a German translation, to which
                    some notes were added by C. A. W. Zimmermann. For the original volume, Charles
                    Elliot agreed to pay one thousand guineas, at six, twelve, and eighteen months,
                    as well as a certain sum for every edition after the first. This enterprising
                    bookseller died before the work was ready for publication; but the agreement was
                    honourably fulfilled by his trustees, though the benefit accrued, not to the
                    author himself, but to his family. “This,” says Mr. Kerr, “was probably the
                    largest sum that had ever been given, at least in Edinburgh, for the literary
                    property of a single quarto volume, and evinced both the liberality of the
                    bookseller, and the high estimation in which he very justly held the fame and
                    talents of the author.”</p>
                <p>His plan however was not yet completed, and he immediately applied himself to the
                    preparation of a second volume. He lived to bring it to a conclusion, though not
                    to make any arrangement for its publication. During the last years of his life,
                    his health appears to have been infirm and precarious. In June 1793, he stated
                    to his friend Dr. Hutton, that he had for several months been distressed with a
                    debility in his limbs, accompanied with a want of appetite; and to another
                    medical friend, Dr. Gardiner, we find him stating very unfavourable symptoms in
                    the course of the following year. After a long illness, he died on the 24th of
                    June 1795, at the age of sixty-five. He left a widow, with four sons and four
                    daughters; two sons and three daughters having died before their father. His
                    eldest daughter was married to Mr. George Watson, an eminent portrait-painter in
                    Edinburgh. Smellie had never been in affluent circumstances, but he left to his
                    family the means of prosperity; and the printing business has been more
                    successfully conducted by his son Mr. Alexander Smellie.</p>
                <p>Of his Philosophy of Natural History, the second volume was published by this son
                    in the year 1799. Another posthumous work speedily followed: “Literary and
                    characteristical Lives of John Gregory, M.D., Henry Home, Lord Kames, David
                    Hume, Esq., and Adam Smith, LL.D. To which are added a Dissertation on Public
                    Spirit, and three Essays.” Edinb. 1800, 8vo. His original plan comprehended the
                    lives of other twenty-five men of literary eminence, with whom he was personally
                    acquainted. One of these was his friend Dr. Stuart, with whose private history
                    he was sufficiently familiar, and of which he could have supplied very curious,
                    though perhaps not very edifying details. It is not however a subject of much
                    regret that his plan was never completed. In the specimen with which we have
                    thus been presented, there is too little biography, and too much discussion.
                    This remark is more particularly applicable to the life of Dr. Gregory, which
                    extends to 118 pages, but is almost entirely occupied with an account, not of
                    the writer, but of his writings. The other lives are of less extent. In his
                    account of Hume, he relates, without any symptom of disapprobation, the indecent
                    levity with which he sported on the verge of another world; and in the same
                    manner he likewise repeats the declaration of Dr. Smith as to the character of
                    that philosopher, “I have always considered him, both in his lifetime and since
                    his death, as approaching as nearly to the idea of a perfectly wise and virtuous
                    man, as perhaps the nature of human frailty will permit.” This ingenious printer
                    may himself have been somewhat too anxious to be classed among philosophers.</p>
                <p>Smellie appears to have been a man of excellent talents, and of extensive
                    knowledge. His disposition was social, his habits were convivial, and he was
                    distinguished by a sarcastic vein of wit and humour. According to the
                    description of his biographer, he “was about the middle size, and had been in
                    his youth well-looked and active; but when rather past the middle of life, he
                    had acquired from almost constantly stooping at his desk to write or correct, a
                    rather lounging gait and appearance; and from a long-continued series of
                    difficulties in his affairs, and much disappointment in matters of affectionate
                    moment, he had become careless and rather slovenly in his dress and appearance;
                    wearing his hair long and bushy, his ordinary black and wide-made clothes ill
                    brushed, and well sprinkled with snuff, and his usual old-fashioned cocked hat
                    for the most part rusty.” Burns describes him as “a man positively of the first
                    abilities and greatest strength of mind, as well as one of the best hearts and
                    keenest wits, that he had ever met with.” And in the following lines, which
                    allude to a club called the Crochallan Fencibles, he has exhibited a graphic
                    delineation of Smellie:</p>
                <p>To Crochallan came</p>
                <p>The old cock’d hat, the brown surtout the same;</p>
                <p>His bristling beard just rising in its might,</p>
                <p>'Twas four long days and nights to shaving-night; His uncomb’d grizzly locks,
                    wild staring, thatch'd A head for thought profound and clear unmatch’d; And
                    though bis caustic wit was biting, rude, His heart was warm, benevolent, and
                    good. (x.)</p>
