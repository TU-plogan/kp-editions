                <p><label type="entry">PHYSIOGNOMY</label> is a word formed from the Greek <hi
                    rend="italic">φυ</hi><hi rend="italic">σις, nature,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >γινασκω, I know,</hi> and it is the name of a science which occupied much of
                    the attention of ancient philosophers, but since the revival of learning has in
                    a great degree been disregarded.</p>
                <p>It does not appear that the ancients extended the compass of physiognomy beyond
                    man, or at least animated nature. But the study of that art was revived in the
                    middle ages, when those who treated of the subject strained their speculations
                    far beyond the ancient limits. The extension of the signification of the term
                    was adopted universally by those naturalists who admitted the theory of
                    signatures; and physiognomy came thus to mean the knowledge of the internal
                    properties of any corporeal existence from the external appearances. Baptista
                    Porta, for instance, a physiognomist and philosopher of considerable eminence,
                    wrote a treatise on the physiognomy of plants, in which he employs physiognomy
                    as the generic term; and there is likewise a treatise <hi rend="italic">de
                    Physiognomia Avium,</hi> written, we believe, by the same person. In the <hi
                    rend="italic">Mαgia Phy-siοgηomica</hi> of Gaspar Schottus, human physiognomy is
                    described as merely a subdivision of the science.</p>
                <p>Boyle, too, adopts the same extensive signification. At present, however,
                    physiognomy seems to mean no more than a knowledge of the moral character and
                    extent of intellectual powers of human beings, from their external appearance
                    and manners. In the Berlin Transactions for 1769 and 1770, there appears a
                    controversial discussion on the subject of the definition of physiognomy,
                    between Pernetty and Le Cat, two authors of some note. The former contends, that
                    all knowledge whatever is physiognomy; the latter confines the subject to the
                    human face. Soon afterwards appeared the celebrated book of Lavater, who defines
                    physiognomy to be the art of discovering the interior of man by means of his
                    exterior; but in different passages of his work he evidently favours the more
                    extended signification of Pernetty.</p>
                <p>Physiognomy was much cultivated in Egypt and India; and from these countries
                    Pythagoras probably introduced the rudiments of this science, as he did those of
                    many others, more important, into Greece. Plato also mentions the subject; and
                    it is formally treated of by Aristotle, in a book which he has allotted to the
                    purpose.</p>
                <p>Physiognomy, he conceives, had been treated of in three ways. Some philosophers
                    classed animals into genera, and ascribed to each genus a certain mental
                    disposition, corresponding to their corporeal appearance; whilst others made a
                    further distinction by dividing the genera into species. Amongst men, for
                    instance, they distinguished the Thracians, the Scythians, the Egyptians, and
                    whatever nations were strikingly different in manners and habits, to whom
                    accordingly they assigned the distinctive physiognomical characteristics. A
                    third set of physiognomists judged of the actions and manners of the individual,
                    and presumed that certain manners proceeded from certain dispositions. But
                    according to the method of treating the subject adopted by Aristotle, a peculiar
                    form of body is invariably accompanied by a peculiar disposition of mind, and a
                    human intellect is never found in the corporeal form of a beast. The mind and
                    body reciprocally affect each other. Thus <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193498575?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0717-8575-0576"/> in
                    intoxication and mania the mind exhibits the affections of the body; and in
                    fear, joy, and other emotions, the body displays the affections of the mind.</p>
                <p>From such facts he argues, that when in man there appears a particular bodily
                    character, which by prior experience and observation has been found uniformly
                    accompanied by a certain mental disposition, and with which therefore it must
                    have been necessarily connected, we are in all such cases entitled to infer the
                    disposition from the appearance. Such observations, he conceives, may be drawn
                    from other animals as well as from men. For, as a lion possesses one bodily form
                    and mental character, a hare another, the corporeal characteristics of the lion,
                    such as strong hair, deep voice, large extremities, discernible in a human
                    character, denote the strength and courage of that noble animal; whilst the
                    slender extremities, soft down, and other features of the hare, visible in a
                    man, betray the mental character of that pusillanimous creature. Upon this
                    principle Aristotle treats of the corporeal features of man, and the
                    corresponding dispositions, as far as these have been observed; he illustrates
                    them by the analogy just mentioned, and in some instances attempts to account
                    for them by physiological reasoning.</p>
                <p>Aristotle was followed by Theophrastus, whose ethical characters form a distinct
                    treatise on that branch of physiognomy which may be called the physiognomy of
                    manners; and the latter was in his turn succeeded by others. There is indeed a
                    considerable collection of Greek authors on physiognomy, entitled <hi
                    rend="italic">Physiognomiae</hi><hi rend="italic">Veteris Scriptores</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Graeci, Graeceet Latinc</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> i</hi>
                    1780, in 8vo. From these authors, it appears that the science was much
                    cultivated in Greece; but the professors seem soon to have connected with it
                    something of the marvellous. This we are led to suspect from the story told by
                    Apion of Apelles. The noviciates of the Pythagorean school were subjected to
                    physiognomical observation by their teachers, and it is probable the first
                    physiognomists by profession amongst the Greeks were of this sect. They, too, to
                    whom, from the nature of their doctrines and discipline, mystery was familiar,
                    were probably the first who, in Greece, exposed the science of physiognomy to
                    disgrace, by blending it with the art of divination. From the period of which we
                    have been treating to the close of the Roman republic, nothing worthy of remark
                    occurs in the literary history of physiognomy. About the last-mentioned era,
                    however, and thence to the decline of the empire under the later emperors, the
                    science appears to have been cultivated as an important branch of erudition.</p>
                <p>In the works of Hippocrates and Galen there occur many physiognomical
                    observations. Cicero appears to have been peculiarly attached to the science. In
                    his oration against Piso, and in that in favour of Roscius, the reader will at
                    the same time perceive in what manner the orator employs physiognomy to his
                    purposes, and find a curious instance of the ancient manner of oratorical abuse.
                    Many physiognomical remarks are likewise to be found in the writings of Sallust,
                    Suetonius, Seneca, Pliny, Aulus Gellius, Petro nius, Plutarch, and others. That
                    the science was practised as a profession in the Roman empire, ample evidence
                    may be discovered in the writings of the authors just mentioned. Suetonius, for
                    instance, in his Life of Titus, mentions that Narcissus employed a physiognomist
                    to examine the features of Britannicus, and he predicted that the empire would
                    devolve on Titus.</p>
                <p>The science of physiognomy shared the fate of all others, when the Roman empire
                    was overthrown by the northern barbarians. But about the beginning of the
                    sixteenth century it began to attract notice; and from that time till the close
                    of the seventeenth, it was one of the most fashionable studies. Within the space
                    here mentioned appeared almost all the modern authors who have written upon this
                    subject. <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi></p>
                <p>Soon after the controversy in the Berlin Transactions, the great work of Lavater
                    attracted the attention of the literary world. The work itself is magnificent;
                    and that circumstance, as well as the nature of the subject, has contributed to
                    extend its fame. With the scholastic and systematic method adopted by the
                    physiognomists of the last and preceding centuries, Lavater rejected their
                    manner of writing, which was dry, concise, indeterminate, and general. His own
                    remarks are. for the most part, precise, and frequently founded on distinctions
                    extremely acute. His opinions on the physiognomy of the ears, hands, nails, and
                    feet of the human species, on hand-writing, on the physiognomy of birds,
                    insects, reptiles, and fishes, are obviously premature, as hitherto no
                    sufficient number of accurate observations have been made, in Regard to these
                    particulars, to authorize any conclusion. He has also erred in the opposite
                    extreme, when treating of the important topic of national physiognomy, where he
                    has by no means prosecuted the subject so far as facts might have warranted.</p>
                <p>In the Berlin Transactions for the year 1775, there appears a formal attack upon
                    Lavater’s work by Μ. Formey. After disputing the propriety of the extensive
                    signification applied by Lavater and Pernetty to the term physiognomy, Formey
                    adopts nearly the same definition which we have proposed near the beginning of
                    this article. He allows that the mental character is intimately connected with,
                    and sensibly influenced by, every fibre of the body; but his principal argument
                    against physiognomy is, that the human frame is liable to innumerable accidents,
                    by which it may be changed in its external appearance, without any correspondent
                    change of the disposition; so that it surpasses the extent of the skill of
                    mortals to distinguish the modifications of feature which are natural from those
                    which may be accidental. Although, therefore, the science of physiognomy may be
                    founded in truth, he infers that the Deity only can exercise it. Formey further
                    contends, that education, diet, climate, and sudden emotions, nay, even the
                    temperaments of our ancestors, affect the cast of human features; so that the
                    influence of mental character on these features may be so involved with, or
                    hidden by, accidental circumstances, that the study of physiognomy must ever be
                    attended with hopeless uncertainty.</p>
