                    prodigies are related as would be very difficult to credit, were we not assured,
                    by some modern instances, of the perfection to which that faculty may be
                    carried. At the age of fourteen he was, by the direction of his mother, who was
                    desirous that he should assume the clerical functions, sent to Bologna, at that
                    time the principal resort of those who studied the pontifical law. After
                    spending two years there, he became disgusted with this pursuit; although such
                    was his industry, even at that early age, that he compiled an epitome of the
                    pontifical epistles or decretals. His disposition, however, led him strongly to
                    the pursuit of philosophy, and excited an eager curiosity to penetrate the
                    secrets of nature and science. With this view he travelled over Italy and
                    France, visited the most celebrated schools of each, and studied under the most
                    famous teachers of both countries.</p>
                <p>After seven years spent in this course of instruction, and at the age of
                    twenty-three, he went to Rome, and, after the fashion of the scholars of that
                    time, brought himself into notice by publicly proposing literary questions for
                    disputation. This sort of challenge was very common in that age, and, when
                    printing was scarcely practised, and the name of a man of learning less rapidly
                    extended than it is now, was almost the only method that a person of superior
                    attainments could adopt to make himself known. Mirandola proposed nine hundred
                    questions, or, as they were called, <hi rend="italic">Conclusiones,</hi> in
                    dialectics, mathematics, natural philosophy, and divinity; drawn not only from
                    the stores of the Latin and Greek, but from the mysteries of the Hebrews and the
                    arcana of the Chaldeans and Arabians. In addition to the endless topics of
                    metaphysics, theology, and the ordinary subjects of disputation, into which he
                    entered very profoundly, the <hi rend="italic">Conclusiones</hi> involved the
                    ancient and obscure philosophy of Pythagoras, Trismegistus, and Orpheus; the
                    doctrines of the Cabbala, or mystical interpretation of the sacred writings,
                    according to the Hebrews, taught by Origen and Hilarius; and the extent, uses,
                    and learning of natural magic, which was vindicated from the vulgar reproach of
                    impiety and necromancy. Seventy-two new physical and metaphysical dogmas of the
                    author’s invention were likewise proposed and defended. These propositions,
                    according to the ostentatious practice on these occasions, were fixed in the
                    most public places in Rome; and the proposer engaged to defray the expenses of
                    any one who should come from a distance for the purpose of disputing with him.
                    This challenge did not bring forward any disputants, but exposed Mirandola to
                    much envy and jealousy, particularly from the professors of science at Rome, who
                    felt the reflection that would be thrown upon their credit by their declining a
                    competition which they durst not encounter.</p>
                <p>Unable to injure his fame as a scholar, they made a much more dangerous attack
                    upon the soundness of his faith. Thirteen questions were selected, which were
                    charged with the terrible suspicion of heresy, and contempt of the ordinances of
                    the church; a suspicion very readily listened to by the church when directed
                    against great learning, which the increasing influence of philosophy and letters
                    began to make her watch with extreme jealousy. Mirandola repelled this attack by
                    publishing his <hi rend="italic">Apologia,</hi> or Defence of the accused
                    propositions, which, if he did not effectually clear away the suspicions he had
                    incurred, tended to confirm his enemies in their dread of <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193500655?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0717-0655-0736"/> his learning
                    and powers; and it must be owned that, overlooking the misapplication of talents
                    to such subjects, the <hi rend="italic">Apologia</hi> exhibits a command of
                    profound and well-digested learning and keen argument, truly astonishing at the
                    age of twenty-three. This work, and the discussions it contained of certain
                    delicate points, added to some hints of the limit of pontifical control in
                    matters of faith, were so disagreeable to Pope Innocent VIII. that he
                    interdicted the reading both of the Apology and the disputed questions. The love
                    of glory, however, was not Mirandola’s only pas- <hi rend="subscript"> i</hi>
                    sion. His youth, splendid accomplishments, and the graces of his person, for
                    which he is said to have been remarkable, attracted the admiration and caresses
                    of many distinguished Roman ladies, who united the love of letters to that of
                    pleasure, a taste very common amongst the Italian ladies of that age. The young
                    philosopher yielded to the force of these allurements, or rather, according to
                    the account of his nephew and biographer, Francisco di Mirandola, eagerly
                    followed the bent of his disposition, naturall y inclined to obey the
                    attractions of beauty.</p>
                <p>But this life of pleasure, however suitable to his condition and inclinations,
                    was of a short continuance. Irritated by the restless persecutions of his
                    enemies, and obliged perpetually to defend himself against the imputation of
                    heresy, the most formidable calumny which in that age any man could have to
                    contend with, he detached himself from vicious pleasures, and regulated his
                    manner of life by rigidly observing the laws of abstinence imposed by
                    Christianity; for being a firm adherent of the Christian doctrines, the charge
                    of infidelity and the vigilance of his enemies made him the more solicitous to
                    guard against the appearance of disobeying them. From this time becoming wholly
                    devoted to learning, he soon acquired such celebrity that the most eminent
                    scholars from all parts of Italy came to visit him for conversation or
                    instruction. As a proof of the sincerity of his reformation, he committed to the
                    flames five books of elegiac poetry which he had composed upon the subject of
                    his amours, together with numerous pieces in Tuscan verse, which had been
                    addressed to his various mistresses. There is perhaps reason to lament that the
                    zeal of the new convert could not be satisfied without this sacrifice. It must,
                    however, be considered that the spirit of religion at that period exacted many
                    sacrifices from the professors of Christianity, which the lenient temper of
                    these times does not call for. An example of this severity is to be met with
                    amongst the works which still remain of Mirandola, and at the end of which, in
                    the folio edition published by his nephew, we find a learned and entertaining
                    comment, in the Italian language, upon a composition of his friend Girolamo
                    Benivieni, entitled <hi rend="italic">Una Canzone de Amove</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >secundo</hi><hi rend="italic">la</hi><hi rend="italic">mente et
                    opinione</hi><hi rend="italic">dd</hi><hi rend="italic">Platonici,</hi> a
                    poetical treatise upon love, explaining the doctrines of the Platonists. The
                    author, Girolamo, informs the reader, in a short preface, that he had determined
                    to suppress this poem and comment, out of regard to his friend’s character and
                    his own, deeming it unbecoming a professor of Christianity, in treating of
                    celestial and divine love, “to treat of it as a Platonist, and not as a
                    Christian ;” but that having lent it to some of his friends for their perusal,
                    an imperfect and erroneous copy was printed, which obliged him, but not until
                    after the death of Mirandola, to publish it correctly. He takes care to allege,
                    in excuse of himself, however, that he has apprised the reader of his plan by
                    the title of the poem, and warned him, in all places where Plato’s opinions
                    depart from those of Christ, that the doctrines of a Gentile and a heathen are
                    not entitled to the least weight compared with the reasonings of the Christian
                    theologists,</p>
                <p>“and particularly the irrefragable arguments of the angelic doctor St Thomas of
                    Aquino.”</p>
                <p>1 he first fruit of Mirandola’s devotion to sacred literature was the Heptaplus,
                    or Comment upon the Six Days of the first chapter of Genesis, which was written
                    in 1491. Two years afterwards he published a treatise in tcp chapters, <hi
                    rend="italic">T)e</hi><hi rend="italic">Ente et</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Uno</hi><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> ì</hi> the object of which was to
                    reconcile the doctrines of Plato and Aristotle, and to demonstrate that the
                    disputes of their respective followers originated in a misconception <hi
                    rend="italic">of</hi> the opinions of these philosophers relative to the <hi
                    rend="italic">Ens</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Unum,</hi> at that time a
                    subject of mighty strife amongst the learned. This treatise was held in high
                    estimation by both sides. It was the last work of consequence, which the author
                    lived to complete; but he had laid the plan of a vast and comprehensive work, of
                    which his early death prevented the execution. This was no less than to confound
                    the seven enemies of the Christian church, by examining and refuting all their
                    errors. In the prosecution of this design, he had, before his death, composed
                    and perfected twelve books against astrology, the most popular and the most
                    pernicious superstition which then infested the world. Paulus Jovius, bishop of
                    Nocera, has,left a testimony to the merits of this work, which is above all
                    other encomiums. “In this excellent though unfinished work, Mirandola attacked
                    the astrologers with such erudition and keenness, and so ably exposed the
                    absurdity and vanity of the whole art of divination, that he seems to have
                    deterred the professors of the occult sciences from writing.”<note

                    Vir. p. 92.</p></note></p>
                <p>This great design, as well as many others which Mirandola had formed,
                    particularly that of a more complete essay towards reconciling the opinions of
                    Plato and Aristotle, was frustrated by his death. From the time that he left
                    Rome, which was soon after the publication of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Apologia,</hi> Mirandola generally resided either at Ferrara or at Florence.
                    The friendship of the Prince of Ferrara, and its vicinity to his paternal seat,
                    attracted him to the former place; but Florence was the most agreeable to him,
                    on account of the society of literary men which it afforded, and particularly
                    that of Poli tian and Lorenzo de’ Medici, with whom he entertained a close
                    friendship. Besides these two illustrious men, his society was cultivated by
                    other eminent scholars, amongst whom was the learned and unfortunate Hieronymus
                    Savanarola, and Hermolaus Barbarus. Petrus Crinitus, the pupil of Politian,<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>P. Crinitus De IIοηestα
                    Disciplina, lib. iii. c. 2, lib. v. c. J, and lib. ii. c. 2.</p></note> mentions
                    him as excelling all his companions in the erudition and eloquence of his
                    conversation. The same author has left us an account of Pica’s laborious
                    studies; for when Politian had expressed in his presence high admiration of his
                    great genius and learning, Mirandola with singular modesty answered, that he
                    deserved no praise except for his assiduous application: “Gratulandum potius,
                    intelligite, assiduis vigiliis atque lucubrationibus, quam nostro,ingenio
                    plaudendum.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Ibid. lib.
                    ii. c. 2.</p></note></p>
                <p>His library is likewise celebrated by the same writer, and is said by Francisco
                    di Mirandola to have cost seven thousand pieces of gold. His accomplishments
                    were not confined to subjects of abstruse literature; in his youth he was much
                    attached to music, in which he acquired such skill, that some of his melodies
                    were publicly received, and held in great-esteem. It mig⅛t also be concluded,
                    from an anecdote related by Petrus Crinitus, that he was not unacquainted with
                    physic; for, according to that author, when Hermolaus Barbarus was seized at
                    Rome with a dangerous fever, Mirandola sent him from Florence a medicine
                    prepared by himself. No man ever testified a more sincere devotion for learning
                    and philosophy<pb break="no" facs="nls:193500668?mode=fullsize"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0717-0668-0737"/>, to the contempt of all other qualifications,
                    than the Prince of Mirandola. He possessed a very large estate, which he
                    bestowed almost entirely upon works of charity, except what was spent in
                    collecting books, and entertaining and providing for literary men. At length,
                    however, about three years before his death, he made over to his nephew
                    Francisco his principality and possessions in Mirandola, and obtained a
                    confirmation of the grant from Maximilian, the Roman emperor, to whom that
                    principality was subject. He reserved to himself only enough to purchase a small
                    estate near Ferrara, where he spent the remainder of his life, except when he
                    resided at Florence, in elegant and learned retirement. His mother, under whose
                    care he received his education, had destined him for the church; and he was
                    often urged by his friends to embrace the sacred profession, with the certainty
                    of the highest honours and emoluments; but nothing could induce him to quit the
                    life which he had chosen for himself. He died of a fever, at Florence, in the
                    year 1494, in the thirty-first year of his age, on the same day that Charles IX.
                    of France entered the city on his famous expedition into Italy. That monarch,
                    hearing of Mirandola’s illness as he approached the city, sent two of his own
                    physicians to his assistance; but, in spite of their aid, the violence of his
                    disorder put an end to his existence in thirteen days.</p>
                <p>With respect to the works of this author, something has already been said, and
                    little more remains to be observed. The <hi rend="italic">Conclusiones</hi>
                    afford a very complete specimen of the learning of the age, and of what were
                    deemed the most valuable purposes to which learning could be applied. However
                    useless and unprofitable these purposes may appear to us, it will not be denied
                    by any one who has the curiosity to look into the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Conclusiones,</hi> that the mass of learning possessed by the proposer of them
                    must have been prodigious, when it is recollected, that at the time he proposed
                    them, he was no more than twenty-three years of age. For there is not the least
                    reason to suppose, that a person whose works prove him to have been a man of
                    profound learning, and who, in an age and nation distinguished by some of the
                    brightest scholars that ever appeared, was ranked by their unanimous judgment
                    amongst the first, should have challenged the discussion of any of the proposed
                    subjects, without being well provided with the knowledge necessary for such a
                    debate. The manner in which the questions were propounded leaves little room to
                    doubt that the author was deeply versed in the respective subjects they embrace;
                    and the Apology for the accused propositions, particularly those <hi
                    rend="italic">de Salute Origenis</hi> and <hi rend="italic">de</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Magia atque</hi><hi rend="italic">Cabbala,</hi> discover
                    familiarity with the writings of the Fathers, as well as with the Greek and
                    Hebrew classics.</p>
                <p>John Pica di Mirandola has been represented by some writers, whose ideas are
                    taken from the encomiums of his contemporaries, as a mighty prodigy of learning
                    and genius. The distaste which the present times entertain towards the subjects
                    upon which he wrote renders it very difficult, upon a review of his works, to
                    believe these encomiums well founded. But, making allowance for this change of
                    opinion, it may be fairly concluded that he was, in reality, a man of very
                    extraordinary powers.</p>
