                    Peter,</hi> a celebrated Nea1x&gt;litan writer and historian, was bom at
                    Ischitella, a small town in the province of Capitanata. Having acquired the
                    elements of a liberal education under the paternal roof, he was sent by his
                    father, at the age of eighteen, to Naples, there to complete his studies, and
                    particularly to study jurisprudence. Being placed under the immediate tuition of
                    Dominico Aulisio, who not only excelled in the qualifications necessary for
                    training young men to the bar, but was also profoundly conversant with Greek and
                    Roman literature, history, philosophy, and indeed all the learning of his time,
                    Giannone made so rapid progress in his studies, both in philosophy and
                    jurisprudence, and evinced so great penetration of mind, that he was admitted
                    into the society or club which met at the house of Gaetano Argento, one of the
                    most distinguished advocates of Naples, who combined the cultivation of letters
                    with the practice of his profession. This circumstance appears to have
                    materially influenced, if not in fact determined, the character of his
                    subsequent pursuits. He applied himself with great ardour to the study of
                    jurisprudence on philosophical principles, and soon gave proofs of his capacity
                    for investigating and illustrating the sources of that science by several
                    learned dissertations <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Originibus</hi><hi rend="italic">Juris.</hi> His inquiries, however, having
                    disclosed to him much respecting the origin and mutations of laws, and the
                    vicissitudes of nations, which had escaped the penetration of ordinary
                    jurisconsults, he conceived the design, with the approbation of Argento, of
                    writing a civil history of the kingdom of Naples, comprehending an account of
                    the origin and progress of its laws and government, and an exposition of the
                    causes which led to the gradual abolition of ancient customs and institutions.
                    But this work, interrupted from time to time by the affairs of the bar, was not
                    completed until after the lapse of twenty years, and only appeared in 1723,
                    under the title of <hi rend="italic">Istoria Civile del Regno di Napoli,</hi> in
                    four volumes 4to. Giannone took as his guide Angelo de Costanzo, whose history
                    of Naples, which was then accounted the best, he almost entirely transfused into
                    his work; but his distinguishing merit consists in the valuable expositions he
                    has given relative to the ecclesiastical and civil constitution, and to the laws
                    and customs of the kingdom. Although the style is neither correct nor elegant,
                    the philosophical spirit, the erudition, and the profound research, which this
                    history exhibits, secured it a high reputation. But the author perhaps affects
                    too much passion against the court of Rome, the proceedings of which, however
                    censurable in themselves, should have been treated by a writer like Giannone,
                    not with the impassioned bitterness of a controversialist, but with the
                    dignified and judicial calmness of a philosophical historian. The consequences
                    of this asperity were such as might have been expected. The freedom with which
                    he treated ecclesiastics generally, and the boldness with which he discussed
                    several topics relating to the origin of the papal power, raised a storm against
                    him, which neither the authority of the viceroy, Cardinal Althann, nor the
                    credit of the municipality of Naples, of which he had been elected advocate,
                    could allay, or even mitigate. “I know not, indeed,” said Argento, when speaking
                    to him on this subject, “whether I should congratulate you or condole with you;
                    for I very much fear lest the crown of laurel which now encircles your brows
                    should become a crown of thorns.” Having been several times insulted by the
                    populace, and at length excommunicated by the archiépiscopal court, Giannone,
                    seeing his work placed in the <hi rend="italic">index expuτgatorius,</hi> left
                    Naples on the 29th of April 1723, and went to seek an asylum at Vienna. The
                    Emperor Charles VI. regarded him at first with an unfavourable eye; but the
                    protection of such men as Prince Eugene, the Chancellor Zinzendorf, the
                    celebrated Count de Bonneval, and the Chevalier Garelli, first physician to the
                    emperor, procured him a pension of a hundred florins on the <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193520454?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0710-0454-0499"/> secretaryship
                    of Sicily. Although relieved from his excommunication by Cardinal Pignatelli,
                    archbishop of Naples, he did not restrain himself from composing several little
                    satires against his sentence, and particularly against the prohibition of his
                    book; but by the advice of his friends he only circulated these in manuscript.
                    It is in his smaller works that his resentment against the court of Rome knew no
                    bounds. During his stay at Vienna, where he enjoyed the favour of the great and
                    of men of letters, he laboured at a work entitled <hi rend="italic">II Triregno,
                    ossia del regno del Cielo, della Terra, e del Papa,</hi> which occupied him
                    nearly twelve years, and to which he only put the last touches at Geneva. This
                    work, in which man is successively represented in the state of nature, under the
                    law of grace, and under the temporal dominion of the popes, comprehends ten
                    epochs, the first three of which extend to the ninth century; but the remainder
                    has not been completed. Don Carlos having ascended the throne of Naples and of
                    Sicily in 1734, Giannone lost his pension and all his hopes. Being constrained
                    to quit Vienna, he retired to Venice, where he was received with every mark of
                    distinction, by persons of quality and men of letters, particularly by the
                    senator Angiolo Pisani, who gave him a lodging in one of his houses. He refused
                    the appointment of counsellor of the republic, and the chair of Roman law in the
                    university of Padua, ingenuously confessing that he was not in a condition to
                    explain the laws in the Latin language, according to the usage of the schools.
                    But the repose which he hoped to enjoy at Venice was not of long duration.
                    Denounced as unfavourable to the pretensions of the republic over the Adriatic,
                    he endeavoured to avert the storm by publishing a <hi rend="italic">Lettera
                    intomo al</hi><hi rend="italic">dominio</hi><hi rend="italic">del mare
                    Adri-atico ed</hi><hi rend="italic">ai</hi><hi rend="italic">trattati seguiti in

                    >Federigo</hi><hi rend="italic">Barbarossa ,∙</hi> but as the state inquisitors
                    had taken umbrage at the prolonged visits paid by him to the ambassadors of
                    France and Spain, his removal was decided on, and, in the night of the 23d
                    September 1735, sbirri seized and conducted him in a small boat or barque to the
                    frontiers of the territory of Ferrara. The apprehension of still greater
                    misfortunes now induced him to change his name to that of Antonio Rinaldo, under
                    which he sojourned at Modena, Milan, and Turin, and arrived with his son at
                    Geneva, on the 5th of December. His reputation, which had preceded him in
                    different cities, procured him in the last-mentioned place the most satisfactory
                    reception on the part of Dr Turretin, the minister Vernet, and the bookseller
                    Bousquet, who furnished him with the means <hi rend="italic">of</hi> living at
                    his ease. In 1736 he was preparing to print a volume of supplement to his
                    history, when, having been conducted by a perfidious friend to pass Easter in a
                    catholic village belonging to the king of Sardinia, he was arrested by order of
                    that sovereign, and his manuscripts seized and conveyed to Rome. He was himself
                    conducted to the castle of Miolan, and thence to the fort of Ceva, where, in
                    hiscalmer moments, he employed himself in translating various works into
                    Italian, in writing on politics, and in preparing memoirs of his life. The
                    discussion which arose between the courts of Rome and Turin on the nomination to
                    consistorial benefices in the states of the king of Sardinia, and which was
                    terminated by the concordat of 1738, furnished Giannone with an occasion of
                    writing, in favour of the rights of the sovereign, a memoir, which he sent to
                    the king. His Sardinian majesty appeared to receive it with pleasure; but,
                    strange to add, he caused the author to be more closely confined than before,
                    and ordered him to be transferred to the citadel of Turin, where he passed
                    twelve consecutive years in trouble and agitation. It was in this fortress that,
                    giving ear to the persuasions of Father Prever of the Oratory, Giannone
                    retracted, on the 4th April 1738, the maxims which had been condemned in his
                    history. But this submission did not procure him his liberty; for he died in
                    prison on the 7th of March 1758, aged seventy-two years. In 1760 his posthumous
                    works were published at Lausanne, in one volume 4to, under the title of <hi
                    rend="italic">Oj&gt;ere</hi><hi rend="italic">Postume</hi><hi rend="italic">in

                    by Louis Bochat of Lausanne; and among the re-impressions of the work maybe
                    distinguished that which appeared with illustrations by the Abbe Cestari. It has
                    been highly commended by Gibbon in his <hi rend="italic">Extraits</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">de mon Journal</hi> (Miscellaneous Works, vol. V. p. 413, 8vo ed.)
                    “The candour, penetration, and freedom of this excellent lawyer,” says he, “will
                    ever ensure to this work the esteem of all wise men. But,” he adds, “churchmen
                    are not always of the number.” In the number of the refutations which have
                    appeared, it is only necessary to mention the <hi rend="italic">Rifiessioni
