                    scholar of the diocese of Moray; and Keith conjectures, with great probability,
                    that he was the son of Gavin Lesley, rector of Kingusie, and likewise, as he
                    supposes, official of that diocese. The bishop’s father is described as an
                    eminent lawyer; and a knowledge of the canon law was indispensable in a person
                    who held this judicial situation.</p>
                <p>Lesley prosecuted his studies in King’s College, Aberdeen, where he took the
                    degree of A. M. Keith mentions a deed by the bishop of Aberdeen, promoting him,
                    a “clerk of his diocese, to the character of an acolyte in his cathedral church,
                    dated 15th June 1546.” This statement is scarcely intelligible: the character of
                    an acolyte, which cannot well be described as promotion, is that of an
                    individual who has been admitted to one of the lower orders in the Romish
                    church; the seven orders being those of porter, lector, exorcist, acolyte,
                    subdeacon, deacon, and priest. In the twentieth year of his age, he became a
                    canon of the cathedral churches of Aberdeen and Elgin. It was apparently this
                    improvement in his circumstances that enabled him to obtain the most liberal
                    education which was then to be procured. Having spent some time in Paris, where
                    he directed his attention to the study of divinity and languages, especially the
                    Greek and Hebrew, he proceeded to the university of Poitiers, and there applied
                    himself to the study of the civil and canon laws for the space of nearly four
                    years. He afterwards resided about a year at Toulouse, where he took the degree
                    of licentiate of the civil law; and having returned to Paris, and taken the
                    degree of LL.D, he continued for nearly another year to read lectures on the
                    canon law. With these proofs of his academical attainments, he returned to his
                    native country in the month of April 1554, and successively obtained many
                    different preferments, secular as well as ecclesiastical. He was appointed
                    professor of the canon law in the university of Aberdeen;<note anchored="true"

                    document, dated on the 2d of July 1559, relates to his induction and investiture

                <p>The protestant religion had now obtained a stable footing in Scotland; and the
                    Book of Discipline was presented to a convention of estates held at Edinburgh in
                    the month of January 1561. Several of the papists had been summoned to give an
                    account of their faith; and among .these was the official of Aberdeen, together
                    with Patrick Myrtom, treasurer, James Strahan, a canon of the cathedral, and
                    Alexander Anderson, sub-pr <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> ⅞ncipal of King’s
                    College. The disputants on the other side were Knox, Willock, and Goodman, whom
                    we may easily suppose to have been an over-match for the theologians of
                    Aberdeen. Of this disputation Lesley and Knox have each given an account, nor is
                    it easy to reconcile their statements with each other. According to one of them,
                    the four respondents made a very firm profession of the catholic faith; and of
                    the sacrifice of the mass Anderson gave so able an exposition, that the heretics
                    evinced no further inclination to dispute, either with him or any other
                    catholic, concerning the high mysteries of the true religion. According to the
                    other account, the sub-principal made a very lame defence of his opinions, and
                    finally declined to continue the disputation, admitting <hi rend="superscript">
                    ii</hi> that he was better sein in philosophy then theology.” Lesley was then
                    required to answer the former arguments against the mass; “and he with gravity
                    began to answer, If our master have nothing to say to it, I have nothing; for I
                    knaw nothing bot the canone law; and the grittest ressoun that ever I culd find

                    that he and his associates were subjected to the punishment of being compelled

                    incredible, there is a material departure in the biography to which we have
                    already referred. “Upon this, the sectarian nobility were, by the instigation of
                    the heretical ministers, so much incensed against Dr Lesley, and the doctors his
                    associates, that they were taken into custody, and put in the prison of
                    Edinburgh, the chief city of Scotland, where, after confinement for some time,
                    they found sureties, who were bound in a very great penalty, that they should
                    make their appearance, in order to their trial, whenever they should be
                    required: upon which they were at length set at liberty, and returned to
                    Aberdeen.” This biographical tract was obviously intended to exalt the subject
                    of it to the character of a great confessor and sufferer for the catholic faith;
                    and some of its statements are apparently to be received with a certain degree
                    of caution, if not suspicion.</p>
                <p>On the death of Francis the Second, the leaders of the protestant party sent the
                    prior of St Andrews to France, with the view of preparing the mind of the young
                    queen for a favourable consideration of their cause. In order to suscepit ex ea
                    Joannem episcopum Rossensem.” There is evidently a studied ambiguity in the
                    expression. Air Riddell mentions that the parson of Oyne was summoned as one of
                    the nearest of kin to “Andrew Lesslie, son to the deceased William Lesslie of
                    New-Lesslie, a pupil.” (Remarks upon Scotch Peerage Law, p. 205. Edinb. 1833,

                    on a similar mission by the popish earls of Huntley, Crawford, Athole,
                    Sutherland, and Caithness, the archbishop of St Andrews, the bishops of
                    Aberdeen, Moray, and Ross. He found Mary at Vitri in Champagne on the 15th of
                    April 1561, and earnestly recommended to her care and protection the interests
                    of the tottering church: he appears at the same time to have recommended himself
                    very effectually to her good graces. She did not however adopt his desperate
                    scheme of landing at Aberdeen, and endeavouring to raise an army for the purpose
                    of restoring the catholic faith. He attended the queen on her return to
                    Scotland, where she landed on the 21st of August. On the 14th of January 1564 he
                    was admitted an ordinary judge of the court of session. If we may rely on the
                    authority of the tract already quoted, he became president of that court, but
                    this statement is not supported by the records: in the absence of the president,
                    he may occasionally have filled his chair, and this is perhaps the only
                    charitable construction which such an averment will easily admit. The queen
                    likewise nominated him a member of the privy council, and bestowed upon him the
                    abbacy ofLindores, which he was allowed to hold <hi rend="italic"

                <p>In the year 1566 the queen issued, under the great seal, a commission to certain
                    noblemen, prelates, and lawyers, granting to them, or any six of their number,
                    full power and authority to revise and publish the laws of the realm. They were

                    were printed under the superintendence of the learned civilian, Dr Henryson, one
                    of the commissioners; and in his preface he has particularly commended <hi

                    career was marked by many actions which set virtue and decency at defiance, his
                    employment as a privy counsellor could not always be very suitable to his
                    character as a churchman. He is supposed to have been the individual who
                    suggested an expedient for granting to the earl of Bothwell an indirect pardon

                    that the queen was an accessory, before as well as after the fact. On the 24th
                    of April 1567 the carl seized her person, and conducted her as a prisoner to the
                    castle of Dunbar. This act of apparent violence, which at first seemed to be so
                    unnecessary, had evidently been devised with her entire approbation. 1he
                    ultimate object of such an expedient did not long remain doubtful: in the course
                    of a few days, she granted him a pardon for this treasonable act, and for all
                    other crimes with which he could be charged. By a general clause, inserted in
                    the common form, she pardoned the murder of her own husband, and yet avoided the
                    scandal of mentioning it in direct terms. She soon afterwards created her
                    paramour duke of Orkney; and having hastily procured a divorce from his wife,
                    his infamous nuptials with the queen were celebrated on the 15th of May, about
                    three months after he had assassinated her former husband. The measure of her
                    guilt and folly was now full. She was committed to custody in the castle of
                    Lochleven on the 15th of June, and was finally divested of the royal authority.
                    On the 2d of May 1568 she escaped from her prison, and soon afterwards found
                    herself at the head of a considerable army. The bishop of Ross had retired to
                    his diocese, and, according to his own account, was there employing his time in
                    contemplation and study, and in giving counsel to friends and others committed
                    to his charge, when the queen sent him a message requiring his immediate
                    attendance at Hamilton. In company with certain noblemen, whose names he does
                    not mention, he accordingly hastened to obey this summons; but before his
                    arrival her forces had been completely dispersed at the battle of Langside, and
                    she had found it necessary to consult her safety by proceeding towards the
                    borders of the two kingdoms. In an evil hour, she entered the English territory;
                    for she speedily discovered that she had reposed her confidence in a cruel and
                    unrelenting rival, whom neither the common ties of blood, nor the sympathy due
                    from one sovereign princess to another who had fallen from, her high estate, had
                    any tendency to move with feelings of generosity or even of compassion.</p>

                <p>Mary again required the services of the bishop, and in the month of September he
                    waited upon her at Bolton castle. Lesley acted as one of her commissioners
                    during the conferences which opened at York on the 4th of October, and in the
                    course of the ensuing month were continued at Westminster. After many debates,
                    which were very ably maintained on both sides, this commission terminated
                    without any immediate result. In February 1569 he proceeded to Tutbury castle,
                    where the queen was detained under the custody of the earl of Shrewsbury; but on
                    some suspicion of having concerted a plan to effect her escape, both he and Lord
                    Boyd were soon afterwards retained in ward at Burton upon Trent, and were not
                    released till after an interval of nearly three months. The bishop was now
                    employed in the capacity of an ambassador to the queen of England, and he
                    acquitted himself with great zeal and ability, but not with corresponding
                    success. He was instructed “to sue earnestly that the queen his mistres might be
                    put to libertie, and restored to her crowne and realme; and to that effect to
                    make such reasonable offers to the queen of .England, as might fully satisfie

                    in Scotland whoe had offended her.” His instructions embraced other particulars;
                    and he was specially enjoined to acquaint the French and Spanish ambassadors
                    with his proceedings, and to ask their advice in all matters connected with his
                    mission. In the mean time, his pecuniary resources were somewhat scanty and
                    precarious. A messenger brought me advertisement, he informs us, that the earl

                    England, albeit it was recovered shortely by my friends in my absence from him
                    at that time: but nowe he hath withholden the same, and taken up my whole
                    fruicts continually since that time. And farther the erle would not suffer anie
                    of my friends or merchants to make me anie furnyshinge; and he did well forsee
                    that the queen my mistres might not support her owne necessitie, nor yet my
                    chargs, at that time a great strayte; for he toke up her whole rents in
                    Scotland, and the prince of Condies armie was lieinge then at Poicters and
                    Toures, where the moste parte of her dowrie in Fraunce consists, and by that
                    meanes shee could gett none of it, soe that truely wee were driven to a great
                    strayte.” In the midst of these perplexities, he applied to the French
                    ambassador, who was unable to afford him any relief. Mary then wrote to the duke
                    of Alva; and, on his responsibility, the Spanish ambassador furnished him with a
                    thousand crowns, one portion of which he remitted to the queen, another to the
                    garrison of Dunbarton castle, and the residue he retained for the expenses of
                    the embassy; nor did he obtain any further supply during his residence at the
                    court of England.</p>
                <p>The scheme of a marriage between Mary and the duke of Norfolk involved many of
                    their adherents in danger and difficulties. The duke was himself committed to
                    the Tower, and several other men of rank were detained in custody. Lesley was
                    repeatedly examined before the English queen and council, and was confronted
                    with the earl of Leicester, who had likewise been implicated in the same
                    transaction. The earls of Northumberland and Westmoreland had recourse to arms,
                    but were not long able to keep the field: a force having been sent against them,
                    they suddenly retired into Scotland, in the month of December 1569. The former
                    of these noblemen having entered Liddaldale, was seized by a band of
                    freebooters, and delivered into the hands of the earl of Moray, who detained him
                    as a prisoner in Lochleven castle. A short time before his assassination, the
                    regent intimated to the ministers of Elizabeth that the earl of Northumberland,
                    and other Englishmen then in Scotland, had mentioned the bishop of Ross as
                    having been cognizant of their designs, and having encouraged them by the
                    promise of obtaining money from foreign princes. In consequence of this
                    information, he was placed under arrest, and was detained in custody for six
                    weeks before he was subjected to any examination. In March 1570 he was brought
                    before the council at Hampton Court, and confidently denied the charge; but what
                    is directly denied in the account of his Negotiations, is virtually admitted in
                    the narrative of his life. He did not recover his liberty till after a further
                    detention of two months, and he was speedily involved in fresh troubles.
                    Ridolfi, a papal emissary, was employed in conducting certain négociations
                    between the Scotish queen, the duke of Norfolk, and the duke of Alva. At
                    Brussels he had entrusted Charles Baily, a Flemish servant of the queen’s, with
                    a packet of letters addressed to Mary herself, to Norfolk, Lesley, the Spanish
                    ambassador, and Lord Lumley. Instead of obeying the bishop’s injunctions, by
                    leaving the packet with the captain of Calais, this messenger retained it in his
                    own possession; and having been searched at Dover, all his papers and books were
                    seized, and he was himself committed to the Marshelsea. Among the books were
                    some copies of the bishop’s defence of Mary’s honour, and her right of
                    succession to the crown of England. By means of Lord Cobham, warden of the
                    Cinque Ports,Ιιe had sufficient influence and dexterity to obtain possession of
                    the most material letters, and having “others made to their quantitie and
                    similitude,” these were transmitted to the council. Of this substitution he
                    contrived to make the prisoner duly aware, in order to allay his fears, and to
                    prevent him from making any dangerous disclosures; for his alarm had been so
                    great that he plainly declared he was the bearer of letters which would cause
                    himself and many others to be hanged. Being now recovered from his agitation, he
                    refused to divulge any material fact on his first examination; but on being sent
                    to the Tower, and placed upon the rack, he avoided the torture by a full
                    confession of his transactions with Ridolfi, and by a statement of the letters
                    having been conveyed to the bishop of Ross. Of this confession the bishop
                    obtained secret intelligence, and he lost no time in preparing himself against
                    its consequences. Only one individual, John Cuthbert, his chief secretary, was
                    acquainted with his ciphers and secret writings: he was immediately sent to a
                    place of safety, and after being concealed four months in London, was secretly
                    conveyed to France. The ambassador took care that no dangerous papers should be
                    found in the search which he now anticipated. In the mean time, his labours,
                    anxieties, and disappointments had severely affected his health, though for the
                    last thirty years he had not been visited with any sickness. For nearly three
                    months he was afflicted with a fever or ague, and was attended by two of the
                    best physicians in London. On the 13th of May 1571, while his malady was still
                    unabated, four members of the council, the earl of Sussex, Lord Burleigh, Sir
                    Walter Mildmay, and Sir Ralph Sadler, came to his residence, and began to
                    interrogate him respecting the facts disclosed by the intercepted messenger. He
                    averred that he was accountable to his royal mistress, and would not admit any
                    other responsibility. They did not fail to enquire for Cuthbert, but found that
                    he could not be traced. They then removed all his servants, except two who were
                    left to attend him during his illness; and two gentlemen of good credit, named
                    Shipworth and Kingsmill, were appointed to remain with their own servants in
                    charge of the ambassador and his house. His papers were carefully examined, and
                    his study was locked and sealed. On the following day, afflicted as he was, he
                    was conveyed in a chariot of the queen’s to Ely House in Holburn, and was there
                    committed to the keeping of the two gentlemen already mentioned, and of the
                    bishop of Ely’s own retinue. When his health was somewhat restored, he was on
                    five different occasions examined before the privy council. The key of his study
                    was at length restored to him; and on the 17th of August he was commanded to
                    accompany the bishop to the country, being permitted to retain five of his own
                    servants, who were to attend their master wherever the English prelate should
                    travel or reside.</p>
                <p>The duke of Norfolk, after having been set at liberty, was a second time
                    committed to the Tower; and the investigation of his alleged acts of treason led
                    to further discoveries respecting the bishop of Ross’s participation in his
                    designs. An order was despatched to the Isle of Ely, directing Bishop Cox to
                    send his prisoner to London. There he accordingly arrived on the 19th of
                    October, and was first detained in the house of the lord mayor. Several members
                    of the council, the earl of Bedford, the lord admiral, Lord Burleigh, Sir
                    Francis Knowles, and Sir Thomas Smith, accompanied by the attorney and solicitor
                    general, came to interrogate him on the twenty-fourth of that month, and treated
                    him with the utmost harshness, threatening him with the rack and the gallows. He
                    pleaded the privileges of an ambassador, and, producing the queen of England’s
                    safeconduct, appealed to his royal mistress as the only competent judge of his
                    conduct dur <pb break="no" facs="nls:193204504?mode=fullsize"

                    Tower, where he appears to have been treated with great and unnecessary rigour.
                    “At my entry into the Towre,” he states, <hi rend="italic">“</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">I</hi> was received by the leivetenant, and placed in a prison
                    called the bloudie towre, a very evill ayred and infected house (where noe man
                    of honest callinge had bin kepid manic yeres before) with close windowes and
                    dores with manie locks and bolts, which was torment sufficient enough for any
                    livinge man that had bin all his daies at libertie, with a cockshott, as they
                    call it, sett up without, right against my windowe, to keepe all light and sight
                    from me. And at my first entres I was searched in all parts, and such paper and
                    inke, as was in my companie, taken from me, which was another greife. And in
                    this manner I was straytly and closely kept, and noe man had recourse unto me,
                    butonely the leivetenant himselfe, dur-inge the whole time I was a prisoner.” Of
                    his subsequent treatment, of his different examinations, and of the various
                    attempts to draw from him information which might either criminate himself or
                    others, he has given a circumstantial and interesting detail in his
                    Negotiations.</p>
                <p>Dr Wilson, master of the requests, was sent to him for the purpose of inducing
                    him to become a witness against the duke of Norfolk, and to deliver certain
                    letters which he had himself received from Ridolfi and others, and which were to
                    be produced in evidence at the trial; but the bishop again relied upon his
                    character as an ambassador, and, according to his own statement, refused either
                    to appear as a witness, or in any other way to furnish information which might
                    tend to the prejudice of any individual. This unfortunate nobleman was convicted
                    of high treason on the 16th of January, and was brought to the scaffold on the
                    2d of June, 1572. The rules of evidence were at that period little understood,
                    and less regarded, nor was it necessary to produce the witnesses in court,
                    provided there was any other method of rendering their depositions available:
                    previous answers to interrogatories, the declarations or admissions of the
                    prisoner or other individuals, were all received as the most legitimate
                    evidence; and in fact the trial of the duke of Norfolk before his peers, was
                    entirely conducted without the aid of parole testimony. The bishop of Ross,
                    whose name was perpetually mentioned in the course of the proceedings, may be
                    considered as the principal witness against him; for of all the most material
                    charges the proof seems in a great measure to have rested on what are described
                    as the bishop’s confessions, that is, the answers emitted during his repeated
                    examinations after he had himself been taken into custody.<note anchored="true"

                    discovered, Lesley had become more communicative, and had thus contributed to
                    the ruin of a man whom he had so much contributed to entangle in dangerous
                    schemes of ambition.</p>
                <p>While he was beset with such perils in England, the regent sent Nicholas
                    Elphinstone with a demand that he should be conveyed to Scotland; a demand which
                    he considered as a sufficient indication of the treatment that awaited him in
                    his native country. But the duke of Montmorency having arrived from France on a
                    special mission, brought instructions from the king to intercede for bis
                    release; and this application was so far successful as to procure his removal to
                    Farnham castle, the scat of the bishop of Winchester. The lieutenant of the
                    Tower charged for his maintenance the sum of two hundred pounds, which was
                    advanced by the French ambassador, and repaid by Mary: he likewise retained as a
                    lawful perquisite the whole of the furniture and silver plate which the prisoner
                    had brought for his own use; and finally, says Lesley, “the gentleman-porter of
                    the Tower retained my satin gown as due to him, because it was my uppermost
                    cloth when I entred.” Being only permitted to take one attendant, he selected
                    Thomas Lesley, a secretary who had resided with him during his captivity, and
                    had himself been subjected to a short imprisonment. In the castle of this
                    prelate, Dr Horne, he has stated, “1 remained the space of a year and three
                    moneths, and all that time was very straitly keept, and two gentlemen did
                    continually wait upon me night and day, and had no liberty to speake to any
                    other his servants but in their presence, nor yet with any other but in my Lord
                    of Winchesters own presence; yet in all other things I was very honourably and
                    friendly used by him.”</p>
                <p>During his confinement in the Tower, he had sought for consolation in study and
                    meditation. There he had composed his <hi rend="italic">Pioe</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Consolationes</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and he was now
                    permitted to transmit them to the queen, who needed consolation still more than
                    her ambassador. From this pious treatise she derived so much gratification, that
                    she devoted some of her prison hours to the task of transfusing a portion of it
                    into French verse. He was induced to prepare a similar work, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Animi tranquilli Munimentum,</hi> which he sent to her on the 1st of October
                    1573, and had again the satisfaction of finding that his labours were duly
                    appreciated. In the mean time, he was not free from the apprehension of personal
                    danger; the earl of Morton having twice sent a diplomatic agent, Captain
                    Cockburn, for the purpose of renewing the demand for the delivery of his person.
                    Having some reliance upon his own eloquence, he now addressed to Elizabeth a
                    Latin oration for the recovery <hi rend="italic">of</hi> his liberty; and,
                    whatever might be the effect of his classical pleading, he was soon afterwards
                    released from his tedious confinement. The bishop of Winchester, on receiving
                    the necessary order, conducted him to London on the 11th of November. On the
                    sixteenth, he was brought before the council, at the house of the lord
                    treasurer, and was informed that he would be permitted to proceed either to
                    Scotland or France. That Lesley had been deeply implicated in transactions which
                    would justly have exposed a subject to punishment, there seems little or no
                    reason to dispute: the state-papers, as well as the histories of that period,
                    exhibit him in the light of a subtle, restless, and dangerous plotter, who
                    resorted to a great variety of expedients for promoting the interest of the
                    unfortunate quee∏. The English statesmen seem to have been much inclined to
                    treat him as they ultimately treated Mary herself; and in 1571 they had
                    submitted his case to the opinion of five learned civilians, Lewis, Dale, Drury,
                    Aubrey, and Jones.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    of the questions propounded, they declared, that, according to the law of

                    the sovereign to whom he is sent, forfeits all his privileges, and maybe
                    subjected to punishment. But among the more civilized nations it has very
                    generally been regarded as the safest maxim, rather to spare a delinquent than
                    not to spare an ambassador;<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    thus subjected to a long and arbitrary imprisonment, the ministers of Elizabeth

                <p>In the month of January 1574 he landed in France, and there he remained till the
                    following year, when Mary thought it expedient to send him on a mission to Rome.
                    He experienced a very gracious reception from Gregory the Thirteenth, who in a
                    great measure defrayed his expenses during the three years of his residence in
                    that holy city. Besides the release of the queen from captivity, her
                    ambassador’s instructions related to various other matters, connected with her
                    joint interest and that of the popish faith. The great object to be attained was
                    her restoration to the throne; and with the view of removing some of the
                    obstacles, she was willing to admit her son to a participation of the royal
                    dignity; but in order to render him worthy of being thus associated, some scheme
                    was to be devised for conveying him to a catholic country, and uniting him in
                    marriage either with a daughter of the emperor of Germany or the king of
                    Spain.</p>
                <p>Lesley was more usefully employed in preparing for the press his general history
                    of Scotland, which was published at Rome in the year 1578. It is dedicated to
                    the pope, and the epistle dedicatory is followed by an address to Cardinal
                    Cajetano, described as protector of the Scotish nation. Among the commendatory
                    verses inserted in the volume, we find the contributions of Muretus, Ninian
                    Winzet, and Alexander Seton, afterwards earl of Dunfermline, and chancellor of
                    Scotland.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>An epigram in
                    commendation of Lesley occurs among the poems of Joannes Gesseus, in the
                    Delitiae Poetarum Gallorum, torn· i. p. 934.</p></note> These elegant studies of
                    the author were speedily interrupted by a new mission. Hopes were now
                    entertained that the ancient faith might be restored in Scotland by the power
                    and influence of the earl of Athole; and with the view of watching any
                    favourable change of affairs, the pope directed the bishop of Ross to proceed
                    towards the coast of France adjacent to Britain. His holiness having appointed
                    him to supply the place of a nuncio who had recently died at the imperial court,
                    Lesley travelled through Germany, and remained for some time at Prague, where
                    Maximilian was then residing. His instructions from Mary partly related to the
                    Scotish monasteries founded in Germany; some of which having been seized by
                    heretics and other evil disposed persons, he exerted his influence to procure
                    their restoration to the Scotish monks. Monastic institutions have often been
                    the strongholds of political, as well as moral misrule; nor is it difficult to
                    discern the spirit which dictated this ambassador’s instructions. He visited the
                    duke of Bavaria, and other catholic princes of the empire, and was every where
                    well received till he arrived at Falsburg, a town near Strasburg, where he was
                    seized by some officers with a guard of four hundred men, under the command of a
                    protestant nobleman, George Cassimir of Littelsteyn. For the space of nearly two
                    months, he was detained in the castle of Falsburg; but they at length discovered
                    their mistake in supposing him to be the archbishop of Rossana, a papal legate;
                    and on paying a considerable sum of money, he was permitted to prosecute his
                    journey. Passing through Lorraine, he arrived in France, and had there the
                    mortification to receive intelligence of the earl of Athole’s sudden death,
                    which took place on the 24th of April 1579. It was some consolation that the
                    Cardinal de Bourbon, archbishop of Rouen, soon afterwards appointed him
                    suffragan and vicar general of that diocese. In this station he continued for
                    the space of fourteen years. The kingdom was then devastated by civil war, and
                    he naturally adhered to the party of the leaguers, who, with the view of
                    excluding Henry of Navarre, proclaimed the old cardinal king in the year 1589.
                    While visiting this diocese in the course of the following year, Lesley was
                    intercepted and cast into prison; and in order to pay a ransom of nearly three
                    thousand pistoles, he was under the necessity of selling his furniture and other
                    goods. The city of Rouen was invested in 1591, and during the siege he is said
                    to have exerted himself with great perseverance and resolution in encouraging
                    the governor, officers, and citizens. As a reward of his services, the duke of
                    Mayenne recommended him to Clement the Eighth as well qualified to fill the
                    vacant bishopric of Constance in Normandy. The pope issued the necessary bulls,
                    accompanied with an unavailing licence to retain the see of Ross till he should
                    be put in possession of his new diocese; and he was graciously pleased to remit
                    the annats, or first fruits, and other payments which usually attend a bishop’s
                    promotion. As he could not safely present himself at his episcopal seat, the
                    ceremony of his admission was in the year 1594 performed in the metropolitan
                    church of Rouen.</p>
                <p>But from this preferment he appears to have derived no advantage; and the unhappy
                    situation of public affairs in France induced him to seek another place of
                    refuge. Directing his course towards Flanders, he reached Chateau d’Aussy in the
                    province of Artois, in the month of March, and afterwards proceeded to Brussels,
                    where he experienced a friendly reception from the archduke Ernest, governor of
                    the Netherlands. Of the history of Scotland, he had at an earlier period
                    transmitted a copy to his catholic majesty, who testified its gracious reception
                    by a letter, written in Latin, and bearing the royal signature. On this occasion
                    he had promised to be mindful of the bishop’s private affairs. On the day before
                    her execution, Mary had addressed to Philip a letter in which she recommended
                    her son to his special protection; and she likewise requested him to bear in
                    remembrance the faithful services which had been rendered to her by the bishop
                    of Ross. He directed the prinće of Parma, then governor of the Netherlands, to
                    bestow upon him the first bishopric or other prelacy that should become vacant
                    in these provinces, and in the mean time to provide for him a suitable
                    maintenance. The prince had accordingly assigned to him a pension of fifty
                    crowns a month, to be computed from the first of June 1587; and this pension
                    still continued to be paid, though not with sufficient regularity to prevent him
                    from being exposed to occasional difficulties. The archbishopric of Mechlin
                    having become vacant, the archduke and the council of state recommended him to
                    Philip for this high preferment; but the design seems to have been frustrated,
                    partly by the unexpected demise of Ernest, who, almost in the article of death,
                    signified to the council his wish that Lesley’s suit should not be neglected. He
                    was encouraged by the nobility and counsellors to await the arrival of the new
                    governor, Cardinal Albert, another archduke of Austria, brother to the deceased;
                    and in order to smooth the path of preferment, he prepared a congratulation,
                    which was not however published till after the death of the author. Part of the
                    summer of 1595 he spent at Spa for the benefit of his declining health, and, as
                    we are informed, “not without great inconvenience, and even the danger of his
                    life, by the incursions of the hereticks and the rebels of Holland; who crowding
                    in those parts, robbed him of all his goods, and endeavoured to seize his
                    person, that they might carry it off.” But all his personal dangers, as well as
                    his schemes of ambition, were terminated at Brussels on the 31st of May 1596,
                    when he died in the sixty-ninth year of his age.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Dodd has recorded his pious benefactions to
                    the church. “He laid the foundation of three colleges for the education of cler
                    <pb break="no" n="239"/> gymen, to be sent upon the mission, after the example
                    of Dr Allen, as I find by letters between them upon that subject. Having
                    comρleated the establishment of a college for his countrymen in Paris, he gave a
                    beginning to another at Rome, with a subsistence for about ten students; where
                    the Jesuits stept in to be managers. This zealous bishop died in the year 1596,
                    leaving behind him a sum of money towards the foundation of a third college,
                    also for the clergy. The design could not be brought to bear till 16∏9, when a
                    small community was set up at Antwerp, whereof the Jesuits were made superiors.
                    But before matters could be entirely compleated, it was removed to Doway <hi

                    and bringing with him an addition of 5000 florins to the original stock, he was
                    made rector of the college about 1620. Since that time the superior has been a
                    Scotch Jesuit. Very few clergymen were educated there afterwards, and of latter
                    years none at all; the old fund, as may be supposed, being swallowed up by the
                    latter addition.” (Church History of England, from the year 1500 to the year

                <p>Bishop Lesley was evidently a man of very superior talents for literature as well
                    as business. His studies and pursuits had been those of a lawyer and statesman,
                    rather than a theologian; and his intellect had been much exercised and whetted
                    by a long course of diplomatic services, of a peculiarly delicate and dangerous
                    nature. With the accomplishments of an elegant scholar, he united the dexterity
                    of a man of the world. He is the author of various works, and several of these
                    must still be considered as valuable. FIis defence of Queen Mary’s honour is
                    written with no small acuteness and address: the task which he had undertaken
                    was sufficiently formidable; if the queen was not guilty of adultery and murder,
                    her conduct had at least exhibited the strongest indications of guilt; but this
                    zealous and able champion shrinks from no difficulties, and is undismayed by the
                    most prominent obstacles. His negociations contain some characteristic details,
                    and furnish some curious materials for history. But the most conspicuous of his
                    works is his Latin history of Scotland, which is written with a very
                    considerable degree of elegance, and, in the more recent portion of it, supplies
                    much important information. The work is divided into ten books; of which the
                    first seven, ending with the reign of James the First, comprehend little more
                    than an abridgement of Boyce. As he descends to his own times, he becomes much
                    more copious and interesting. With the transactions of Mary’s reign, which he
                    has not however prosecuted beyond the year 1562, he had peculiar opportunities
                    of becoming familiarly acquainted; and it is useful, as well as interesting, to
                    compare the statements and reflections of Lesley and Buchanan, the most
                    distinguished adherents of the popish and protestant parties.</p>

                <p>6. A Discourse conteyninge a perfect Accompt given to the moste vertuous and
                    excellent Princesse, Marie Queene of Scots, and her Nobility, by John Lesley,
                    Bishop of Rosse, Ambassador for her Highnes toward the Queene of England, of his
                    whole Charge and Proceedings during the time of his Ambassage, from his entres
                    in England in September 1568, to the 26th of March 1572. This account of the
                    bishop’s négociations, which extends to 252 pages, was printed, for the first
                    time, in Anderson’s Collections relating to the History of Mary Queen of
                    Scotland, vol. iii. Edinb. &amp; Lond. 1727-8, 4 vols. 4to. As the language was
                    Anglicized by Dr Good, it may be presumed that Lesley intended the work for
                    immediate publication.</p>

                    rend="smallcaps">m.cccc.xxxvi.</hi> to the year <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >m.d.lxĩ.</hi> By John Lesley, Bishop of Ross. Edinburgh, 1830, 4to. This
                    valuable relique was edited by Thomas Thomson, Esq. from a MS.belonging to the
                    earl of Leven and Melville. Prefixed is a portrait of the author, copied from an
                    old engraving, and representing him as a man of a dignified and sagacious
                    aspect. Of his Scotish history the Latin is not a mere translation. “The readers
                    of this volume,” as the editor has remarked, “who may take the trouble of
                    comparing it with the Latin version, will readily perceive that the alterations
                    made by the author on his own original sketch do not consist merely in
                    correction and enlargement; but that, in numerous instances, he has been induced
                    to suppress or generalize those more minute details and domestic occurrences
                    which he may have found less susceptible of that classic attire in which he was
                    naturally ambitious of exhibiting his historical work. In this respect, the
                    present publication may be found to contribute some few particulars to the
                    materials of our national history; but a still higher value will probably be
                    attached to it as a specimen of pure and vigorous composition, in his native
                    language, by one of the most able and accomplished Scotchmen of the sixteenth
                    century.” (x.)</p>
