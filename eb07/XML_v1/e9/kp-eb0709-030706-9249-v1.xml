                    system of doctrine, canonical, physical, and ethical, taught by Epicurus, and
                    maintained by his followers, who, from the name of their master, received that
                    of Epicureans.</p>
                <p>The first part of this threefold system regarded the canons or rules of judging.
                    Disgusted with the subtleties<pb break="no" facs="nls:193749262?mode=fullsize"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0709-9262-0308"/> and paradoxes of the Stoics, Epicurus endeavoured
                    to introduce a more simple and natural method of judging, and, instead of
                    artificial modes and scholastic distinctions, appealed to the common sense and
                    natural perceptions of mankind as the ultimate basis of all reasoning. These he
                    assumed as first principles, or rather as unerring guides; and by giving
                    excessive latitude to an elementary definition, which, if properly guarded and
                    restricted, might have served as the foundation of a rational system of logic,
                    he was betrayed into errors and extravagances not less startling than those from
                    which it had been his object to escape. Cicero has reproached him with an
                    alleged unpŉilosophi-cal contempt of logic; but this censure, when duly weighed,
                    must be pronounced to be entirely without foundation. Epicurus, it is true,
                    despised and even ridiculed the modes of reasoning by means of which the Stoics
                    evolved the paradoxes in which they delighted; and he was neither acquainted
                    with nor had any relish forthose analytical investigations in which the members
                    of that philosophical sect displayed so much unprofitable ingenuity. But, on the
                    other hand, all the errors with which his system is easily chargeable, may be
                    traced to the logical strictness with which he adhered, in all his reasonings,
                    to the primary canon which he had laid down, and to the implicit faith which he
                    was consequently led to repose in those sensible perceptions and intuitive
                    judgments which, though in every case relatively true, are nevertheless in many
                    absolutely and demonstrably false. Having, as he conceived, established a
                    principle indisputably certain, he was prepared to admit, and, in point <hi
                    rend="italic">of</hi> fact, never suffered himself to doubt or to question, any
                    consequence, however startling, which might be logically deduced from it. His
                    very errors, therefore, are the direct and necessary result of a rigid adherence
                    to this principle, and of the precision with which he reasoned from the primary
                    assumption to its consequences.</p>
                <p>In the second or physical part of his system, Epicurus borrowed from Democritus
                    and Leucippus the idea of the atoms or monads, which he regarded as the ultimate
                    principles of all things. These atoms, however, which had no other properties
                    than those of hardness and gravity, and which were therefore totally distinct
                    from the gases of every kind that form so prominenta part of the physics and
                    chemistry of the moderns, soon fell into discredit with philosophers; and,
                    notwithstanding the poetical embellishments which the hypothesis received from
                    the genius of Lucretius, it continued to be treated as a subject more fitted for
                    ridicule than reason, until Gassendi endeavoured to revive and restore it, but
                    without success. The efforts of this philosopher, however, can scarcely be
                    considered as having proved altogether fruitless, since Leibnitz in his theory
                    of monads, Boscovich in his principles of corpuscular attraction, and still more
                    recently Dr Dalton in his theory of definite proportions, which has effected a
                    complete revolution in the nomenclature of modern chemistry, have, each in
                    succession, adopted modifications of the original hypothesis, and thus brought
                    within the precincts of science a doctrine once regarded as amongst the wildest
                    extravagances of ancient philosophy. In fact, the atomic theory of modern times
                    is founded upon the same general principle with the hypothesis promulgated by
                    Democritus, taught by Leucippus, and afterwards adopted by Epicurus; namely,
                    that matter, so far from being infinitely divisible, is resolvable by division,
                    decomposition, or analysis, into certain ultimate or primordial elements or
                    atoms, which, again, enter synthetically, in certain definite proportions, into
                    the constitution or composition of all things. And thus it is that the grand
                    cycle of decay and reproduction, observable in the operations and changes which
                    take place in the material world, may also be detected in the history of
                    philosophical systems; they rise decline, disappear, and are reproduced by the
                    silent working of causes too remote to be discovered or appreciated by us; they
                    have their various phases and occultations even whilst they remain within the
                    sphere of our obser∙ vation; and when they altogether disappear from our view,
                    and seem to be for ever lost, it is only to return, after having rounded their
                    apogee, and to present nearly the same aspect as before.</p>
                <p>With regard to the third or ethical part of this system, morality, according to
                    Epicurus, is entirely founded upon utility. Man is placed upon earth to seek or
                    pursue his own happiness or good, and he finds it only in a calm and tranquil
                    life. The sage is ever upon his guard against the passions which might disturb
                    his peace. Physical pleasure consists in the satisfaction of our natural wants;
                    but the less trouble we take to ensure this satisfaction, the fewer privations
                    we will be exposed to, and the greater will be our immunity from reverses of
                    fortune. To abstain in order to enjoy, was accordingly the grand maxim of this
                    philosopher. The happiness of individuals depends upon, andforms part of, the
                    general happiness, from which, therefore, it can never be separated. This is his
                    leading principle; and hence the essence of his ethical system consists in
                    inculcating the <hi rend="italic">maxima</hi><hi rend="italic">felicitas,</hi>
                    or the greatest happiness of the greatest number. It has indeed been vulgarly
                    alleged that Epicurus made the supreme good to consist in pleasure; and many
                    persons persist in thus representing his doctrine, without giving themselves the
                    trouble to inquire what he understood by pleasure; a term which, as he applied
                    it, differs in no degree from the wisdom of the Stoics, and the <hi
                    rend="italic">maxima</hi><hi rend="italic">felicitas</hi> of the modern school
                    of Utilitarians, founded by Bentham, the great restorer of the Epicurean ethical
                    philosophy. In the nomenclature of this system, whatever contributes to the
                    happiness and wellbeing of man as a member of society, is denominated pleasure;
                    nor, as the happiness of individuals is made to depend upon, and declared to be
                    inseparable from, the general happiness, can the true meaning of the term be
                    mistaken or misapprehended by any honest and intelligent inquirer. But those
                    false Epicureans, who limited the import of the word to mere sensual indulgence,
                    and reasoned as if Epicurus himself had recognised this acceptation, did great
                    injury to the sect, which they brought into unmerited discredit and odium. We
                    accordingly find that they were banished from Rome in the time of the republic,
                    and also,at different intervals, from a number of other cities. But the school
                    always subsisted at Athens, where it remained in the time of Lucian; and
                    Numenius, his contemporary, remarks, with an evident feeling of regret, that the
                    Epicureans had preserved in all its purity the doctrine of their master, whilst
                    that of Plato had been greatly altered and corrupted. The Stoics appropriated
                    several of the maxims, and adopted the most remarkable apophthems of Epicurus,
                    which are expressed, with much spirit, ma brief, sententious style; and the
                    principal charm of Seneca’s letters to Lucilius consists in the freedom and
                    extent to which he has borrowed from the same source.</p>
                <p>It is very difficult to discover the real opinion of Epicurus respecting the
                    divinity. Cicero assures us that the philosopher spoke of the Supreme Being in
                    terms the most sublime, and that he recommended piety to his disciples. It may
                    no doubt be alleged that this was done order to conform to the popular belief,
                    and that ∙ <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> ° <hi rend="superscript"> sa e</hi>
                    conclusion can be drawn, as to the opinion really <hi rend="superscript">
                    enter</hi> ' taincd by the philosopher, from mere generalities, or a convenient
                    and safe recommendation. But, on the other han , in his letter to Menecius,
                    Epicurus expresses himse thus: “The gods are not such as the vulgar believe; <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 33</hi> the impious man is not he who rejects the gods of t
                    <hi rend="superscript"> e</hi><pb break="no" facs="nls:193749275?mode=fullsize"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0709-9275-0309"/> multitude, but he who attributes to the gods the
                    opinions of the multitude.” These expressions, if they had been known, would
                    have been sufficient to ensure to their author the honours of persecution. But,
                    whilst it is evident that Epicurus was not actuated by mere prudence in making
                    the belief of a God one of the principal dogmas of his philosophy, it must at
                    the same time be admitted that his other opinions respecting the gods rendered
                    this belief useless. For he regarded them as beings perfectly happy, impassible,
                    and in no degree concerned about, or disposed to intermeddle with, human
                    affairs,—as alike indifferent to, and incapable of, being affected by the good
                    or evil of this world; and thus destroyed at once a providence, and the hope of
                    future recompense or punishment. -To this opinion, certainly one of the most
                    discouraging and disastrous which can be maintained or promulgated, may be
                    mainly ascribed the charge of atheism which was early preferred, and often
                    subsequently reiterated, against this amiable and virtuous philosopher, whose
                    life was as remarkable for its moral purity as those of some of his pretended
                    followers were for their dissoluteness and profligacy.</p>
