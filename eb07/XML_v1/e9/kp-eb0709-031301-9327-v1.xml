                <p><label type="entry">EPISCOPACY</label>, that form of church government in which
                    diocesan bishops are established, as distinct from and superior to priests or
                    presbyters. We have already observed, that from a very early period the
                    ministers of religion have been distinguished into different orders, and that it
                    has been much controverted whether the distinction be of divine or human right;
                    whether it was settled in the apostolic age, or only adopted afterwards. (See
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Bishop.)</hi> This controversy commenced soon after the
                    Reformation, and has been agitated with great warmth between the Episcopalians
                    on the one side, and the Presbyterians and Independents on the other. Amongst
                    the Protestant churches abroad, those which were reformed by Luther and his
                    associates were in general episcopal; whilst such as follow the doctrines of
                    Calvin have for the most part dispensed with the order of bishops, as being
                    either unnecessary or unattainable. In England, however, the controversy has
                    been considered as of greater importance than on the continent; for it has there
                    been strenuously maintained by one party that the episcopal order is essential
                    to the constitution of the church; and by the others, that it is a pernicious
                    encroachment on the rights of Christians, for which there is no warrant or
                    authority in Scripture. Though the question has for some time lain almost
                    dormant, and though we have no desire to revive it, yet as a work of this kind
                    might perhaps be deemed defective, did it contain no account whatever of a
                    controversy which has employed some of the ablest writers of the past and
                    present times, we shall give a fair though short view of the chief arguments by
                    which the advocates of each contending party have endeavoured to support their
                    own cause, leaving it to our readers to judge where the truth lies. See <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Independents</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Presbyterians.</hi></p>
                <p>The Independent maintains, that under the gospel dispensation there is nothing
                    which bears the smallest resemblance to an exclusive priesthood; that Christ and
                    his apostles constituted no permanent order of ministers in the church; but that
                    any man who has a firm belief in revelation, a principle of sincere and
                    unaffected piety, a capacity forjeading devotion and communicating instruction,
                    and a serious inclination to engage in the important employment of promoting the
                    everlasting salvation of mankind, is in all respects a regular minister of the
                    New Testament, especially if he have an invitation to the pastoral office from
                    some particular society of professing Chris-</p>
                <p>Against this scheme, which supposes the rights and privileges of all Christian
                    men to be equal, and which ac-nowledges no authority in the church excepting
                    that which is derived from election by its members, the Proestant Episcopalian
                    argues in the following manner: He <hi rend="superscript"> a</hi> m, <hi
                    rend="superscript"> lts</hi> &gt; os an undoubted truth, that Christ gave to
                    none ' <hi rend="superscript"> ns</hi> followers authority or jurisdiction of
                    such a nature 3s could interfere with the rights and duties of the civil
                    magistrate; that he never conferred upon them what he ιscmmed for himself, when,
                    before Pilate, he declared <hi rend="superscript"> a</hi> is kingdom was not of
                    this world. He maintains, <hi rend="superscript"> 3r,</hi> that Christ did
                    confer upon his immediate fol-ζθ <hi rend="superscript"> r</hi> s&gt; and does
                    still confer upon their successors in the <hi rend="superscript"> ls</hi> ry,
                    authority and jurisdiction of a specific nature non Christians; and that neither

                    apostles, nor in the age immediately succeeding these, did there exist an
                    absolute equality among believers.</p>
                <p>During our Saviour’s ministry, it will be allowed that all power resided in him;
                    and it is important to observe, that even then, before believers were
                    constituted a church, parity was abolished by the ordinance of Jesus himself, in
                    the appointment of the twelve apostles and the seventy disciples. And when the
                    divine Founder of Christianity was making preparations for the maintenance of
                    his religion after his departure hence, he did not abolish the distinction which
                    he had previously instituted, but granted to the twelve apostles a still wider
                    commission, a still more decided supremacy over the ordinary members of the
                    church. “As my Father hath sent me,” said he, <hi rend="superscript"> ii</hi>
                    even so send I you. And when he had said this, he breathed on them, and said
                    unto them, receive ye the Holy Ghost: whose soever sins ye remit, they are
                    remitted unto them, and whose soever sins ye retain, they are retained.” (John,
                    XX. 21, 22, 23.) “All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth. Go ye,
                    therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and
                    of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, teaching them to observe all things
                    whatsoever I command you; and lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the
                    world.” (Matt, xxviii. 18, 19, 20.) Now the Episcopalian maintains that men who
                    had received this commission could not be on a footing of equality as to
                    ecclesiastical privileges with the great body of believers, who had no
                    commission whatsoever.</p>
                <p>If, however, all this be granted, and still the <hi rend="italic">permanence</hi>
                    of the commission be denied, the Episcopalian refers to our Lord’s concluding
                    words, “I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world and asks how Christ
                    could be with the commission to the end of the world, if the commission itself
                    was to last only for one generation. But, further than this, he refers to the
                    acts of the apostles, as furnishing abundant evidence that they understood it to
                    be the will of Christ that there should be a perpetual succession of privileged
                    officers in the church. For, in the first place, the vacancy occasioned by the
                    death of Judas was immediately filled by the appointment of Matthias; then a new
                    order of Christian ministers was introduced under the name of deacons;
                    afterwards Barnabas and Saul were ordained to be apostles; and finally, as the
                    number of Christian congregations increased, a race of ministers superior to the
                    deacons was instituted, to administer the sacraments, and to preside in the
                    religious assemblies. To imagine that these were elected by the laity, and
                    derived their authority from that election, could scarcely be credited, even if
                    we possessed no evidence to the contrary. But St Paul (Eph. iv. 11) asserts,
                    that when Christ ascended up <hi rend="subscript"> fc</hi> on high, “<hi
                    rend="italic">He</hi> gave some apostles, and some prophets, and some
                    evangelists, and some pastors and teachers ;” that is to say, <hi rend="italic"
                    >he</hi> commissioned the apostles, and empowered <hi rend="italic">them</hi> to
                    commission the inferior officers.</p>
                <p>With respect to the age immediately succeeding the apostolic, we cannot of course
                    refer to Scripture, but must have recourse to the records of primitive
                    antiquity. And in referring to the <hi rend="italic">Eathers</hi> for the
                    historical fact, the Episcopalian claims for them nothing more than sufficient
                    honesty to tell the truth when there existed no temptation to commit falsehood,
                    or sufficient sense to abstain from a falsehood which it was impossible should
                    be credited by any of their contemporaries. Now, of the earliest Christian
                    writers, of those called apostolic fathers, because they are believed, on good
                    grounds, to have been contemporaries and companions of the apostles, three,
                    namely, Clement of Rome, Ignatius, and Hermas, explicitly state the existence of
                    different orders of officers in the church, to whom great honour and obedience
                    was due from the laity; whilst the remaining two, Polycarp and Barnabas, do not
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:193749340?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0709-9340-0314"/>
                    touch upon ecclesiastical polity. Further than this it is unnecessary to
                    descend, as every one now admits that in the age succeeding this, diocesan
                    episcopaey prevailed over the Christian world, and continued undisputed till the
                    Reformation.</p>
                <p>Against this historical argument it may be urged, that the commission to the
                    apostles was “to go and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the
                    Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost and that consequently a system which
                    confines the right of preaching and baptizing to their successors in a
                    particular <hi rend="italic">order</hi> appears inconsistent with the wisdom and
                    the goodness of God; as by sueh an economy an intolerable dominion would be
                    established over the souls of men, and the very purpose for whieh the Saviour
                    died might be defeated by the eapriee of an ignorant or designing priesthood. To
                    this objection the Episcopalian replies, that under the Mosaic law sacrifice was
                    necessary for the expiation of sin, but that in many most important cases this
                    expiation could be effected only by the instrumentality of a priest; that, in
                    short, the objection, if it have any weight, weighs with equal foree against the
                    wisdom and justice of Providence in the ordinary government of the world. In
                    every thing, he observes, that is valuable, whether of a temporal or a spiritual
                    nature, mankind are subjected to mutual dependence; baptism must be conferred,
                    and knowledge must be communicated, by some human being; and it is just as easy
                    to imagine the whole <hi rend="italic">human race,</hi> as the whole <hi
                    rend="italic">clerical order,</hi> unfaithful to their obligations.</p>
                <p>The Episcopalian having by arguments of this nature attempted to prove that
                    Christ did institute a <hi rend="italic">permanent order of ministers</hi> in
                    his church, proceeds, in the next plaee, by an inquiry of the same nature, to
                    prove that this order was not <hi rend="italic">single,</hi> but <hi
                    rend="italic">threefold.</hi> In the former inquiry he was united with the <hi
                    rend="italic">Presbyterian</hi> against the <hi rend="italic">Independent',</hi>
                    he has now to answer the arguments of the Presbyterian, who maintains that
                    originally the Christian church contained no office higher than that of <hi
                    rend="italic">presbyter</hi> or <hi rend="italic">elder</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi> and, in opposition to him, the Episcopalian maintains that Christ and
                    his apostles instituted divers orders in the church, of which that of <hi
                    rend="italic">bishops</hi> with authority over <hi rend="italic"
                    >presbyters,</hi> and with the <hi rend="italic">exclusive right of
                    ordination,</hi> was the highest.</p>
                <p>In behalf of the Presbyterian plea it is urged, that the titles of <hi
                    rend="italic">bishop</hi> and <hi rend="italic">presbyter,</hi> being in the New
                    Testament indifferently given to the same persons, cannot be the titles of
                    distinct ecclesiastical officers; whieh appears still more evident from the
                    ordination of Timothy, who, although he was the first <hi rend="italic"
                    >bishop</hi> of Ephesus, received his episcopal character by the imposition of
                    the hands of the <hi rend="italic">presbytery.</hi> That one and the same man
                    is, in the New Testament, styled sometimes a <hi rend="italic">bishop</hi> and
                    sometimes a <hi rend="italic">presbyter,</hi> cannot be denied; but although
                    every apostolic bishop was therefore undoubtedly a presbyter, it does not of
                    course follow, says the Episcopalian, that every presbyter was likewise a <hi
                    rend="italic">bishop.</hi> In the <hi rend="italic">Old</hi> Testament, Aaron
                    and his sons are without any discrimination of order frequently styled <hi
                    rend="italic">priests</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> andin the <hi rend="italic"
                    >New,</hi> both St Peter and St John call themselves <hi rend="italic"
                    >presbyters,</hi> as St Paul, upon one occasion, styles himself a <hi
                    rend="italic">deacon,</hi> ð/axovo¢ (Eph. iii. 7): yet no man ever su∣ιposed
                    those apostles to have been sueh ecclesiastical officers as modern presbyters
                    and deacons; and it is universally known, that in the Jewish priesthood there
                    were different orders, and that Aaron was of an order superior to his sons. This
                    being the case, the presbyters, by the laying on of whose hands Timothy was made
                    a bishop, <hi rend="italic">may have been</hi> of the same order with St Peter
                    and St John; and if so, it follows that his ordination was <hi rend="italic"
                    >Episcopal.</hi> At all events, wc are certain, continues the advocate for
                    Episeopaey, that it was not in the modern sense of the word <hi rend="italic"
                    >Presbyterian</hi>; for the gift, which in the first epistle is said to have
                    been “given by prophecy <hi rend="italic">with ⅛</hi><hi rend="italic
                    subscript"> e</hi> laying on of the hands of the presbytery,” is in the second
                    said to have been “in him <hi rend="italic">by</hi> the putting on of the hands
                    of St Paul.” And here it is worthy of observation, that the preposition used in
                    the former case is <hi rend="italic">μιτa,,</hi> which signifies <hi
                    rend="italic">concurrence</hi> rather than instrumentality; but rλα⅛ the latter
                    is δ∕α, whieh, as every Greek scholar knows is prefixed to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >instrumental cause</hi> by whieh any thing is effected; so that whatever may
                    have been the order of the presbyters who <hi rend="italic">concurred,</hi> St
                    Paul appears to have been the <hi rend="italic">sole</hi> ordainer. But by the
                    confession of all parties, St Paul was a bishop in the highest sense in which
                    that word is ever used; and the powers of the episcopate not being parcelled out
                    among various partners, of whom each possessed only a share, the imposition of
                    his hands was sufficient for every purpose whieh could have been effected by the
                    hands of the whole college of apostles.</p>
                <p>It appears, therefore, that from the promiscuous use of the titles <hi
                    rend="italic">bishop</hi> and <hi rend="italic">presbyter,</hi> and from the <hi
                    rend="italic">ordination of Timothy,</hi> nothing can with any certainty be
                    concluded on either side of this celebrated question. But if, instead of resting
                    on mere <hi rend="italic">words,</hi> which, when taken alone and without regard
                    to the context, are almost all of ambiguous signification, we attend to some
                    important <hi rend="italic">facts</hi> recorded in the New Testament, the
                    Episcopalian thinks we shall discover in these sufficient evidence that the
                    government of the primitive church was Episcopal.</p>
                <p>During our Saviour’s stay upon earth, it is undeniable that he had under him two
                    distinct orders of ministers, the twelve and the seventy; and after his
                    ascension, immediately before which he had enlarged the powers of the <hi
                    rend="italic">eleven,</hi> we read of <hi rend="italic">apostles,
                    presbyters,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">deacons,</hi> in the church. That the
                    presbyters were superior to the deacons, and the apostles superior to both, is
                    acknowledged by the supporters of presbyterian parity; but it has been said,
                    that in Scripture we find no intimation that the apostolic order was designed
                    for continuance. A Quaker says the same thing of water-baptism; and the
                    Episcopalian observes, that it would be difficult to point out by what passage
                    of Scripture, or what mode of reasoning, those who upon this plea reject the
                    apostolic order of Christian ministers, eould overthrow the principles upon
                    which the disciples of George Fox reject the use of that rite whieh our Saviour
                    instituted for the initiation of mankind into his church. They were the <hi
                    rend="italic">eleven</hi> alone to whom Christ said, “go ye therefore and teaeh
                    all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of
                    the Holy Ghost ;” and hence, although we frequently find presbyters and deacons
                    administering the sacrament of baptism, we must conclude, that as <hi
                    rend="italic">ŭgudçpfù·’</hi> ministers justice by authority derived from his
                    <hi rend="italic">soνerdph</hi> so those <hi rend="italic">inferior
                    officers</hi> of the church administered baptism by authority derived from the
                    <hi rend="italic">apostles.</hi> Indeed, had they pretended to act by any other
                    authority, it is <hi rend="superscript"> n0t</hi> easily to be conceived how <hi
                    rend="italic">their</hi> baptism eould have been the baptism instituted by
                    Christ; for it was not with the <hi rend="italic">external washing,</hi> by
                    whomsoever performed, but with the <hi rend="italic">eleven</hi> and their
                    successors, that he promised tobe “a· ways, even unto the end of the world.” .
                    .</p>
                <p>We have already noticed that the <hi rend="italic">eleven,</hi> acting, as a
                    orthodox Christians allow, by the extraordinary direction of the Spirit, never
                    appear to have supposed that the commission with which they were invested was to
                    terminate with them. On the contrary, they admitted Matthias Barnabas, and Paul,
                    to the name and authority ot apost es, and Timothy and Titus to some offiee

                    addressed to none but a bishop, that is, to one possessing an ecclesiastical
                    authority superior to that of presbyters. For in Timothy (iv. 2-6) we read, “I
                    besought thee to abide still at Ephesus, when I went into Macedonia, that thou
                    mightest charge some that they teach no other doctrine, neither give heed to
                    fables and endless genealogies. Let the presbyters that rule well be counted
                    worthy of double honour; especially they who labour in the word and doctrine.
                    Against a presbyter receive not an accusation but before two or three witnesses.
                    Them that sin rebuke before all, that others also may fear. Lay hands suddenly
                    on no man, neither be partaker of other men’s sins.” Now, an individual right to
                    direct <hi rend="italic">presbyters</hi> as to the doctrine they preached, to
                    receive accusations against them, to rebuke the offending, to confer
                    authoritative approbation upon the deserving, and finally, to <hi rend="italic"
                    >ordain,</hi> are exactly the offices which belong to a bishop. The right to
                    perform these, if derived from an appointment by presbyters, would have
                    constituted a <hi rend="italic">superintending presbyter</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi> but the right being conferred by apostolic authority, raised their
                    professor to higher <hi rend="italic">order,</hi> and this higher order is the
                    Episcopal.</p>
                <p>It is unnecessary to pursue the argument in the case of Titus, bishop of Crete,
                    whose episcopacy is equally clear with that of Timothy; and if no other diocesan
                    bishops are mentioned in the Acts or Epistles, we need not wonder when we
                    reflect how little is said of the greater part of the apostolic body.</p>
                <p>We perceive, then, that as far down as the history of the church is warranted in
                    Scripture, there always existed <hi rend="italic">imparity</hi> among the
                    ministers of religion, and that the apostles ordained certain officers to
                    superintend or be <hi rend="italic">bishops</hi> over the presbyters. And when
                    from the inspired penmen of the New Testament he proceeds to examine the
                    succeeding writers of the Christian church, the Episcopalian finds such
                    multiplied and concurring evidence of the apostolic institution of episcopacy,
                    as he thinks it impossible to resist without denying the truth of all ancient
                    history, and even shaking the pillars of revelation itself; for, “in the noble
                    army of martyrs,” the witnesses of the episcopal government of the church are
                    earlier, and by far more numerous, than those who testify that the gospel of St
                    Matthew was written by that apostle, or that the book of the Apocalypse is
                    canonical Scripture. The authority of the Fathers indeed is at present very low;
                    but should they be allowed to be as fanciful divines and as bad critics as their
                    worst enemies are pleased to represent them, this would detract nothing from
                    their evidence when they bear witness to the constitution of the church in their
                    own times; for of their honesty there can be no doubt; and ιvhat the
                    Episcopalian wants of them is only their testimony to matters of fact which fell
                    under the cognizance of their own senses, and about which therefore they could
                    not be deceived. It is here indeed chiefly that he triumphs over his
                    antagonists. In the second and third centuries there was no general council, nor
                    any Christian sovereign. A prelacy therefore, he urges, could not have been <hi
                    rend="italic">universally</hi> introduced, during that period, either by a
                    concert among the clergy, or by the authority of the civil magistrate.</p>
                <p>That at the close of the first or apostolic century the w ole Christian world was
                    <hi rend="italic">Presbyterian,</hi> and that, as we now to have been the case,
                    at the close of the second it ¶as entirely <hi rend="italic">Episcopal</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> that of the cause or progress of e change not a word should
                    be mentioned by the contemporary writers; that whilst Episcopacy was a foul
                    usurpation of the rights of Christ’s flock, every Christian <hi
                    rend="superscript"> w</hi> ∏ter from Clement downwards should speak of it as a
                    most excellent and even divine institution; that no single presbyter throughout
                    the world should, as far as we know, have said a single word in defence of his
                    insulted order; all this, the Episcopalian maintains, is so utterly· improbable
                    as to justify his regarding it as a fable, and one not very cunningly
                    devised.</p>
                <p>The candid Episcopalian, however, allows, that in the apostolic age there may
                    have been some churches which at first had only bishops and deacons to perform
                    the offices of religion; for when the number of disciples in any place was so
                    small that they could all meet in one assembly, there was no necessity for any
                    other order of ministers; but it appears that, from the very beginning, <hi
                    rend="italic">bishops, presbyters,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">deacons</hi> were
                    settled in all the <hi rend="italic">langer</hi> cities of the Roman empire; and
                    it was in those days an allowed maxim, that without a <hi rend="italic"
                    >bishop</hi> there could be <hi rend="italic">no church.</hi> The better to
                    understand the original state and institution of episcopacy, it is necessary to
                    observe, that the empire, which contained almost all the known part of the
                    Christian world, was divided originally into provinces of two kinds, the one
                    called <hi rend="italic">consular,</hi> the other <hi rend="italic"
                    >praelorian,</hi> of which the former vvere either larger, or of more political
                    importance. In the reign of Augustus the consular provinces were placed under
                    the direct control of the emperor, and were administered by <hi rend="italic"
                    >legates</hi> generally of consular rank; whilst the praetorian were left under
                    the control of the senate and people, and were governed by a <hi rend="italic"
                    >proconsul,</hi> as Asia was. (See Acts, xix. 38.) There was still a third class
                    of smaller provinces retained by the emperor, and governed in general by men of
                    equestrian or even inferior rank, under the title of <hi rend="italic"
                    >procurators</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> of these Judaea was one. A province
                    comprehended the cities of a whole region; and in the age of the apostles each
                    city was under the immediate government of certain magistrates within its own
                    body, known by the name of βooλτj, or <hi rend="italic">senatus,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">ordo,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">curia,</hi> the states and court
                    of the city. Those magistrates were subordinate to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >praetor</hi> or <hi rend="italic">proconsul</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> but
                    among them there was <hi rend="italic">one</hi> superior to the rest, called
                    sometimes <hi rend="italic">dictator</hi> and sometimes <hi rend="italic"
                    >defensor</hi><hi rend="italic">civitatis,</hi> whose jurisdiction extended not
                    only over the city itself, but likewise over all the adjacent territory. That
                    territory was denominated <hi rend="italic">¶¢oa¢rtia,</hi> or the suburbs, and
                    often reached to the distance of ten or twelve miles round the city, and
                    sometimes much farther, containing within it many villages and small towns under
                    the government of the city magistrates. From some passages in the New Testament,
                    and from the concurring evidence of the earliest writers of the church, it
                    appears to have been the purpose of the apostles to settle a bishop in every
                    city where there was a civil magistracy; but as they could not be personally
                    present in all places at once, it was natural for them to enter upon the great
                    work of converting the nations by first preaching the gospel in that city of
                    each province which was the ordinary residence of the governor; because to it
                    there must have been the greatest resort of people, who would carry the glad
                    tidings with them into the country when they returned. Accordingly, having
                    dispersed themselves over the empire, and made numbers of proselytes in the
                    principal cities, they fixed in each, where they saw it necessary, a <hi
                    rend="italic">bishop,</hi> with a college of <hi rend="italic">presbyters</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">deacons,</hi> and gave to those bishops, who were at first
                    called <hi rend="italic">apostles,</hi> a commission, as the <hi rend="italic"
                    >other</hi> cities of the province should be converted, to fix bishops in them
                    also.</p>
                <p>In some of the smaller cities, it is extremely probable that a bishop and a
                    deacon were for a short time the only ecclesiastical officers, till the number
                    of Christians increased so much as to make it impossible for them all to
                    assemble in one house for the purposes of public worship. The bishop then
                    ordained <hi rend="italic">presbyters</hi> to officiate in those congregations
                    where he himself could not be present, and <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193749366?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0709-9366-0316"/> to assist him
                    in other parts of his pastoral office; but in all their ministrations the
                    presbyters were subordinate to him, who was the chief pastor within the city,
                    who composed the prayers which were offered up in public, and to whom all the
                    other ministers of religion were accountable for their conduct. As long as the
                    number of the faithful was confined within the <hi rend="italic">walls</hi> of
                    the city, it appears that the bishop with his presbyters and deacons lived
                    together as in a college; that divine service was every Lord’s day, or oftener,
                    performed in what was afterwards called the cathedral or mother-church, by the
                    bishop himself, assisted by some of his clergy; and that the congregations which
                    met in other churches, having no <hi rend="italic">fixed</hi> pastors, were
                    supplied by such presbyters as the bishop chose to send to them from his own
                    church. Whilst matters continued in this state, the clergy had no other revenues
                    than what arose from the voluntary oblations of the people; which were indeed so
                    large as not only to support them with decency, but likewise to answer other
                    ends of charity and munificence. They were commonly divided into four equal
                    parts; of which one was allotted to the bishop, a second to the inferior clergy,
                    a third to the poor, and a fourth to keep the churches in repair; and it was
                    considered as a part of the bishop’s duty to take care that the offerings should
                    be faithfully applied to these purposes.</p>
                <p>When converts increased in number, and churches were built in'the suburbs, each
                    of these churches had a fixed pastor similar to a parish-priest amongst us; but
                    still those pastors, as well as the city clergy, ministered in subordination to
                    the bishop, whose authority extended as far as the civil authority of the Roman
                    magistrate, within which district or diocese it was supreme over all orders of
                    Christians. This every man knows who is acquainted with ecclesiastical history;
                    for the bishop alone could ordain <hi rend="italic">priests</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">deacons,</hi> administer the rite of <hi rend="italic"
                    >confirmation, absolve penitents</hi> who were under church censure, and <hi
                    rend="italic">exclude from communion</hi> heretics and notorious offenders; and
                    from his sentence there lay no appeal but to a synod of comprovincial
                    bishops.</p>
                <p>Such synods were in each province convened by the bishop of the chief city: for
                    the apostles having been careful to place in those cities men of the most
                    eminent gifts and abilities, the other bishops of the provinces applied to them
                    for advice upon every emergency, and paid a particular deference to them upon
                    every occasion. So that though all bishops were of equal authority <hi
                    rend="italic">as bishops,</hi> yet when they met to consecrate a new bishop, or
                    to deliberate upon the affairs of the church, they yielded a precedency to the
                    bishop of the metropolis, who called them together, and who sat as <hi
                    rend="italic">president</hi> or <hi rend="italic">moderator</hi> of the synod.
                    Hence the origin of metropolitans or <hi rend="italic">archbishops,</hi> whose
                    authority was so considerable, that though there is not a doubt but the <hi
                    rend="italic">election</hi> of bishops was anciently placed in the clergy and
                    people of the vacant diocese, yet the bishop <hi rend="italic">elect</hi> could
                    not be <hi rend="italic">consecrated</hi> without the consent of the archbishop
                    of the province.</p>
                <p>In consequence of the very extensive powers with which the primitive bishops were
                    vested, they are commonly styled in the writings of those times <hi
                    rend="italic">presidents, provosts,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">inspectors</hi> of
                    the church, <hi rend="italic">chief priests, princes of the clergy,</hi> and
                    even <hi rend="italic">princes of the people;</hi> but their authority was
                    wholly spiritual. Those prelates, imitating the example of their Divine Master
                    when on earth, neither possessed nor assumed to themselves any jurisdiction over
                    the <hi rend="italic">properties</hi> or <hi rend="italic">civil rights</hi> of
                    men. In consequence of St Paul’s having reprimanded the Corinthians for going to
                    law before the <hi rend="italic">unbelievers,</hi> they were indeed often chosen
                    as <hi rend="italic">arbiters</hi> of such civil disputes as arose between
                    individuals under their episcopal government; but on these occasions they could
                    not act unless the submission was <hi rend="italic">voluntarily</hi> made by <hi
                    rend="italic">both</hi> the contending parties, and <hi rend="italic">then</hi>
                    their decision was final. When the empire became Chris· tian, this privilege was
                    confirmed to them by law; for any <hi rend="italic">civil</hi> cause depending
                    before a court of justice could be withdrawn, and by the mutual consent of
                    parties be submitted to the arbitration of the bishop, whose award, which in
                    former times could be enforced only by the terror of church censures, was then
                    enforced by the secular magis∙ träte. In <hi rend="italic">criminal</hi> causes,
                    where the trial might be for life or death, they were prohibited, both by the
                    canons of the church and by the laws of the state, from acting as judges; and
                    therefore they never suffered such causes to come before them, excepting when it
                    was necessary that the person accused, if found guilty, should be excluded the
                    communion of the faithful.</p>
                <p>Be this as it may, it is certain that, through the liberality of the Christian
                    emperors, the bishops enjoyed large revenues and many valuable privileges; but
                    it does not appear that they had any rank or authority, as <hi rend="italic"
                    >barons</hi> or <hi rend="italic">temporal princes,</hi> till the Gothic
                    nations, which subverted the Roman empire, had embraced the Christian faith. As
                    Christianity incapacitated the leaders of those tribes from officiating as chief
                    priests at the religious rites which were usually celebrated at the opening of
                    their public assemblies, the bishops came naturally to discharge that duty on
                    such occasions, when they must have shared in the rank by sharing in the
                    functions of the chief. The situation in which they thus appeared at the opening
                    of all political conventions, enabled them to join with much effect in the
                    deliberations which ensued; and their superior knowledge, their sacred
                    character, and their influence with the people, soon acquired them power equal
                    to their rank. They must therefore have been thought entitled to obtain
                    admission into that council which was formed by the king and the lay-chiefs at
                    the national assemblies; and as they balanced the authority of those chiefs, we
                    cannot doubt of the king’s disposition to give the utmost effect to their claim.
                    Accordingly, we find the dignified clergy, who received large grants of land to
                    be held on the same tenures with the lands of the lay magistrates, presiding
                    along with those magistrates in the provincial assemblies of every degree in all
                    the Gothic nations, and enjoying every advantage of rank and authority in their
                    national diets. Hence the bishop of Rome, and several bishops in Germany, have,
                    like the dukes and marquises of that empire, been for a long time sovereign
                    princes; and hence too the bishops of England and Ireland have always sat, and
                    have an equal right with the lay-peers to sit, in the upper house of parliament
                    It is however obvious, that, as far as episcopacy is of <hi rend="italic"

                    more than the ministers of a small body of dissenters from an established
                    church.</p>
                <p>Having thus traced what we may call the progress of episcopacy from the simple
                    purity of apostolic times up to the gorgeous prelacy of the middle ages, it
                    seems proper, before concluding, that we should briefly allude to the history
                    and present state of episcopacy in Scotland.</p>
                <p>About the time of the Reformation, the want of order and decency in the worship
                    of the reformed church was abolished in the reign of James VI. by the
                    establishment of episcopacy on very liberal principles. This mode o worship
                    obtained the sanction of the most respectable part of the nation, and continued
                    to flourish under the auspices of government, till it was overthrown by the
                    adherents <hi rend="italic">W</hi> the <hi rend="italic">national covenant.</hi>
                    Its restoration was, however, et∙</p>

                <p>fecteđ in the year 1662, and twenty-seven years subsequently it was again
                    abolished by the supporters of the Prince of Orange, afterwards William HI.</p>
                <p>It may be proper to observe, that the Scotch Episcopal Church had no public
                    liturgy during her legal establishment. It is indeed true that the English book
                    of common prayer was used by the first reformers, and there is reason to believe
                    that John Knox himself was by no means inimical to fixed forms of prayer, nor to
                    clerical subordination; but his successor, Andrew Melvil, introduced an equality
                    among the clergy, and excited the minds of the people against the liturgy to
                    such a degree, that an attempt to modify the prayer-book for the use of the
                    Church of Scotland was productive of the solemn league and covenant, and the
                    subsequent ruin of Charles I.</p>
                <p>During the reign of William III. the episcopalians were treated with some degree
                    of severity, because they could not transfer to him that allegiance which they
                    had sworn to King James. It is said that they were prohibited from officiating
                    on the Sabbath-day, except “in their own hired houses, where they received such
                    friends as chose to come in unto them.” In this manner was their worship
                    conducted, praying either extempore, or from premeditation, till the accession
                    of Queen Anne, when the English liturgy was introduced by degrees into Scotland,
                    under the sanction of an act of parliament, passed on the third of March 1712,
                    “to prevent the disturbing of those of the episcopal communion in that part of
                    Great Britain called Scotland, in the exercise of their religious worship, and
                    in the use of the liturgy of the Church of England.” But as their attachment to
                    the house of Stuart was well known, they were, at the rebellion in 1715, laid
                    under some restraints, yet neither severe in their nature, nor of any long
                    continuance, since in 1720 their places of worship were as numerous as before,
                    and frequented by numbers both of rank and respectability, many of whom held
                    places under government.</p>
                <p>In England Dr Sancroft, archbishop of Canterbury, with five other bishops, were
                    deprived of their sees for refusing their allegiance to King William; a
                    circumstance which occasioned a schism in the church, as they were extremely
                    popular. Different opinions were entertained respecting the nature and design of
                    the Lord’s Supper, and the controversy infected the Episcopalians of Scotland.
                    On the death of Dr Rose, the proscribed bishop of Edinburgh, the diocesan form
                    of church government was opposed by such of the presbyters as had been raised to
                    the episcopal dignity, and it was proposed to govern the whole church by a
                    college of bishops. This plan, for the adoption of which no precedent could be
                    found in the annals of history, was successfully opposed by many of the most
                    enlightened bishops, and it was of consequence abandoned.</p>
                <p>After the rebellion of 1745 additional acts of considerable severity were passed
                    against the Scottish episcopalians, the worst effect of which was the formation
                    of many congregations using the English liturgy, and imagining themselves
                    episcopalians, whilst they and their ministers were living in separation from
                    the bishops of the country· All restraints upon Scottish episcopalians were,
                    owever, removed by the act of 1792; since which period they have enjoyed full
                    liberty of conscience, in common with other dissenters from the established
                    church.</p>
                <p>1he repeal of the penal acts of course tended to unite e independent chapels
                    above mentioned to the episco-pa church; but an impediment still existed, which

                    had never yet adopted the English θntessιon of Faith; and though the act of 1792

                    expected, those ministers were not prepared immediately to sign a declaration of
                    faith at a secular mandate. There consequently remained an ostensible reason for
                    separation till , the year 1804, when a convocation of the episcopal church
                    declared their readiness to sign the Thirty-nine Articles of the Church of
                    England, in the manner enacted by the act of 1792.</p>
                <p>The cause of separation being thus removed, the English chapels began immediately
                    to unite themselves to the Scottish Episcopal Church, and to submit to the
                    authority of the bishop within whose jurisdiction they lay; and at the present
                    moment (1834) there are but three congregations in Scotland using the English
                    liturgy, who refuse obedience to the Scottish bishops. The episcopal church in
                    Scotland is now governed by six bishops, having under them about seventy
                    presbyters entrusted with the cure of souls.</p>
