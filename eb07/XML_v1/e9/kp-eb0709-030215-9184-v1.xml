                <p><label type="entry">EPAMINONDAS</label>, son of Polymnis the Theban, born about
                    410 B. c., was one of those distinguished characters whose appearance forms an
                    epoch in the history of their country. The position of Thebes was not such as to
                    enable it to take a prominent part in the affairs of Greece; and, excepting
                    during the short period when Epaminondas and Pelopides were at the head of the
                    government, it seems to have been dependent either on Sparta or on Athens,
                    according as the power of the one or the other prevailed. The earlier years of
                    Epaminondas were spent under the direction of Lysis the Pythagorean philosopher;
                    and, if we may credit the story told by Diodθ rus, he was the fellow-student of
                    Philip of Macedonia. Devoted though he seems to have been to the study of
                    philosophy, he did not neglect those lighter accomplishments which add grace to
                    the character; and Nepos even thinks it necessary to tell us the names of the
                    masters from whom he derived his knowledge of music and dan cing. ...</p>
                <p>At the period when Epaminondas appeared upon the stage, the small republics of
                    Greece were torn to pieces by intestine dissensions; at one time the party of
                    the ∏c and noble prevailed, at another the power ofthe demθ∙ cracy was
                    predominant. Of the latter party Athens was the main prop, whilst Sparta was the
                    powerful friend o the former. It does not appear that Epaminondas in h <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ιs</hi> earlier years took any prominent part in support of
                    either faction, being probably disgusted by the intrigues and remorseless
                    cruelty which he saw practised by all parties <hi rend="superscript">

                    He was present indeed at the battle of Mantinea (385 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.
                    c.),</hi> fought between the Arcadians and Spartans; and it was mainly through
                    his efforts that it was decided in favour of the latter, on the very same ground
                    which was destined a few years afterwards (362 <hi rend="smallcaps">b. c.)</hi>
                    to witness his own death, and the defeat of his allies.</p>
                <p>During the whole period of his political life his friendship with Pelopidas was
                    uninterrupted, and, according to Plutarch, nothing reflected greater glory on
                    both, than that they never allowed a feeling of rivalry to interfere with their
                    exertions for their common country. Yet no two individuals could possibly be
                    more dissimilar in character, as Pelopidas loved all the pomp and splendour <hi
                    rend="italic">of</hi> power, whilst Epaminondas was better pleased to remain in
                    poverty and retirement. The nobles, mistrusting their own strength, received a
                    Spartan garrison (382 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.</hi> c.) into their citadel, and
                    Pelopidas and the chiefs’of the popular party were banished; but Epaminondas,
                    who was supposed to be more engaged in the speculations of philosophy than in
                    the active affairs of life, was allowed to remain. Three years afterwards a
                    conspiracy was formed to recover the independence of Thebes; but though his
                    friend Pelopidas was at its head, Epaminondas refused to join in the attempt,
                    wisely judging that the bloodshed and rapine which would inevitably follow any
                    violent change in the government must more than counterbalance the good
                    anticipated from the success of the popular party. The conspirators succeeded
                    without his assistance, yet prudently adopted the moderate counsels which he
                    recommended. The Spartans made an attempt to recover their power, but, being
                    defeated by Pelopidas, were induced to listen to terms of accommodation. A
                    general diet of all the states of Greece was summoned at Sparta, in order that
                    peace might be established on just and sound principles. Epaminondas was the
                    deputy appointed by Thebes, and the able manner in which he maintained the
                    interests of his country did not disappoint the expectations of his
                    fellovv-citizens. He refused to emancipate the cities of Boeotia from the
                    control of Thebes, unless Sparta was prepared to act the same part towards those
                    subject to her in Laconia. Negotiations were broken off, as neither party showed
                    a disposition to yield, and orders were sent to Cleombrotus the Spartan general,
                    then in Phocis, to commence hostilities against the Thebans. It was now that
                    dpaminondas, by the consent of all, was appointed to the chief command, and the
                    measures which he took to protect the country from the incursions of Cleombrotus
                    were so complete that they compelled the Spartan general to ∙etιre from
                    Chaeronea, where he had taken up his position. Cleombrotus descended from the
                    mountains to the sea shore, and passing along the difficult and rugged coast at
                    he foot of Mount Helicon, reached without interruption he plains of Leuctra, at
                    no great distance from Thebes. Here he found the troops of the Thebans posted on
                    the <hi rend="superscript"> leι</hi> ghts around; and in the council of war
                    which was held required all the ability of Epaminondas to persuade the ’mcers
                    that the fate of their country ought to be staked on he chances of a general
                    engagement. In this, however, ıe succeeded, and immediately drew out his men in
                    order &gt;f battle.</p>
                <p>The result of his arrangements was <hi rend="italic">a</hi> complete victory,
                    gained in July 371 <hi rend="smallcaps">b. c. To</hi> his friends who

                    was corned, however, to retire, by the able generalship of Agesilaus, though not
                    until he had devastated the whole country around. On his return home he was
                    brought to trial, along with Pelopidas and the other generals, tor having
                    retained his command four months beyond the time specified by law. He
                    recommended the other generals to plead as their excuse his superior orders, and
                    then boldly said to the assembly, “I acknowledge that the law condemns me to
                    death; all I ask is, that the sentence passed on me may be couched in these
                    words: Epaminondas was punished for having conquered the Spartans at Leuctra,
                    for having besieged Lacedaemon, and rebuilt Messene.” The boldness of this
                    answer was of course applauded, and Epaminondas acquitted; yet his enemies had
                    sufficient influence with the people to exclude him from all honourable
                    employment. Some time afterwards he redeemed his character by a successful
                    campaign against Alexander, the tyrant of Pherae, in Thessaly, and by delivering
                    his friend Pelopidas from the hands of that unprincipled despot. A war broke out
                    between the Tegeates in Arcadia, who had implored the assistance of the Thebans,
                    and the Mantineans, who were supported by Lacedemon. The two armies met near
                    Mantinea, the modern village <hi rend="italic">oĩ Paleopoli,</hi> when
                    Epaminondas employing a manoeuvre similar to that which had succeeded at
                    Leuctra, gained a complete victory, but was wounded by a javelin, the iron point
                    of which remained in his body. Before he expired, he inquired for the generals
                    Deiphantus and Jollidas, and being told they were dead, he*added, “Then persuade
                    the Thebans to make peace.” In fact, from this moment, Thebes, to use the
                    expression of an ancient writer, was a javelin deprived of its iron point, and
                    ceased to be formidable. Epaminondas died on the 4th July 362 <hi

                    of a great captain, a true patriot, and a philosophic sage.</p>
                <p>His life was written by Plutarch, but it has been unfortunately lost; there are,
                    however, many details of it contained in the lives of Agesilaus and Pelopidas,
                    and also in his moral works. But it is to Xenophon that we are indebted for the
                    chief facts. The life of Epaminondas by Cornelius Nepos has been evidently
                    mutilated. The reader may also consult Diodorus Siculus, x. xvi. xv.; Pausanias,
                    Polybius, AElian, and Valerius Maximus. A long and uninteresting life has been
