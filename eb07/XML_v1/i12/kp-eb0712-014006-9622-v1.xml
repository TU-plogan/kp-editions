                <p><label type="entry">ICE</label>, a solid, transparent, and brittle body, formed
                    of some fluid, particularly water, by means of cold.</p>
                <p>Μ. Lemery observes, that ice is only a re-establishment of the parts of water in
                    their natural state; that the mere absence of fire is sufficient to account for
                    this re-establishment; and that the fluidity of water is a real fusion, like
                    that of metals exposed to the fire; differing only in this, that a greater
                    quantity of fire is necessary to the one than the other. Galileo was the first
                    who observed that ice was lighter than the water which composed it; and hence it
                    happens that ice floats upon water, its specific gravity being to that of water
                    as eight to nine. This rarefaction of ice seems to be owing to the air-bubbles
                    produced in water by freezing, and which, being considerably large in proportion
                    to the water frozen, render the body so much specifically lighter. These
                    airbubbles, during their production, acquire a great expansive power, so as to
                    burst the containing vessels, though ever so strong.</p>
                <p>Μ. Mairan, in a disscrtation on ice, attributes the increase of its bulk chiefly
                    to a different arrangement of the parts of the water from which it is formed;
                    the icy skin on the water being composed of filaments, which, according to him,
                    are found to be constantly and regularly joined at an angle of 60°; and which,
                    by this angular disposition, occupy a greater volume than if they were parallel.
                    He found the augmentation of the volume of water by freezing, in different
                    trials, a fourteenth, an eighteenth, a nineteenth, and, when the water was
                    previously purged of air, only a twenty-second part; that ice, even after its
                    formation, continues to expand by cold; for, after water had been frozen to some
                    thickness, the fluid part being let out by a hole in the bottom of the vessel, a
                    continuance of the cold made the ice convex; and a piece of ice which was at
                    first only a fourteenth part specifically lighter than water, on being exposed

                    attributes the bursting of ice on ponds.</p>
                <p>Though it has been generally supposed that the natural crystals of ice are stars
                    of six rays, forming angles of 60° with each other, yet this crystallization of
                    water, as it may properly be called, seems to be as much affected by
                    circumstances as that of salts. Hence we find a considerable difference in the
                    accounts of those who have undertaken to describe these crystals. M. Mairan
                    informs us that they are stars with six radii; and his opinion is confirmed by
                    observing the figure of frost on glass. M. Rome de ľIsle determines the form of
                    the solid crystal to be an equilateral octahedron; M. Hassenfratz found it to be
                    a prismatic hexahedron; but M. d’Antic found a method of reconciling these
                    seemingly opposite opinions. In a violent hail-storm, where the hailstones were
                    very large, he found that they had sharp wedge-like angles of more than half an
                    inch; and in these he supposed it impossible to see two pyramidal tetrahedra
                    joined laterally, and not to conclude that each grain was composed of
                    octahedrons converging to a centre. Some had a cavity in the middle; and he saw
                    the opposite extremities of two opposite pyramids, which constitute the
                    octahedron; he likewise saw the octahedron entire united in the middle; all of
                    them were therefore similar to the crystals formed upon a thread immersed in a
                    saline solution. On these principles M. d’Antic constructed an artificial
                    octahedron resembling one of the largest hailstones, and found that the angle at
                    the summit of the pyramid was 45°, but that of the junction of the two pyramids
                    145°. It is not, however, easy to procure regular crystals in hailstones, where
                    the operation is conducted with such rapidity; in snow and hoar-frost, where the
                    crystallization goes on more slowly, our author is of opinion that the rudiments
                    of octaheđra may be discovered. (See the section on <hi rend="smallcaps"

                    so quickly as to affect the breath, and are found very useful in conveying goods
                    and passengers over lakes and great rivers. Boats of different sizes are placed
                    in a transverse form upon a two-and-a-half or three-inch deal board. At the
                    extremity of each end are fixed irons, which turn up in the form of skaits. Upon
                    this plank the boat rests, and the two ends serve as out-riggers to prevent
                    oversetting; whence ropes are fastened that lead to the head of the mast in the
                    nature of shrouds, and others passed through a block across the bowsprit. The
                    rudder is made somewhat like a hatchet with the head placed downwards, which
                    being pressed down, cuts the ice, and serves all the purposes of a rudder in the
                    water, by enabling the helmsman to steer.</p>

                    The aspect of ice-houses should be towards the east or south-east, for the
                    advantage of the morning sun to expel the damp air, as that is more pernicious
                    than warmth; for which reason trees in the vicinity of an ice-house tend to its
                    disadvantage. The best soil for an ice-house to be made in is chalk, as it
                    conveys away the waste water without any artificial drain; the next to that is
                    loose stony earth or gravelly soil.</p>
                <p>Ice may be preserved in a dry place under ground, by covering it well with chaff,
                    straw, or reeds. Great use is made of chaff in some places of Italy to preserve
                    ice; the ice-house for this purpose need only be a deep hole dug in the ground
                    on the side of a hill, from the bottom of which they can easily carry out a
                    drain, to let out the water which is separated at any time from the ice, that it
                    may not melt and spoil the rest. If the ground is tolerably dry, they do not
                    line the sides with any thing, but leave them naked, and only make a covering of
                    thatch over the top of the hole. This pit they fill either with pure snow, or
                    else with ice taken from the purest and clearest water; because they do not use
                    it, as we do in England, to set the bottles in, but really mix it with the wine.
                    They first cover the bottom of the hole with chaff, and then lay in the ice, not
                    letting it anywhere touch the sides, but ramming in a large bed of chaff all the
                    way between; they thus carry on the filling to the top, and then cover the
                    surface with chaff. Ice packed in this manner will keep as long as they please.
                    When they take any of it out for use, they wrap up the lump in chaff, and it may
                    then be carried to any distant place without waste or melting.</p>
                <p>It appears from the investigations of Professor Beckman, in his History of
                    Inventions, that the ancients, from the earliest ages, were acquainted with the
                    method of preserving snow for the purpose of cooling liquors in summer. “This
                    practice,” he observes, “is mentioned by Solomon; and proofs of it are so
                    numerous in the works of the Greeks and the Romans, that it is unnecessary for
                    me to quote them, especially as they have been collected by others. How the
                    repositories for keeping it were constructed we are not expressly told; but it
                    is probable that the snow was preserved in pits or trenches.</p>
                <p>“When Alexander the Great besieged the city of Petra, he caused thirty trenches
                    to be dug, and filled with snow, which was covered with oak branches, and which
                    kept in that manner for a long time. Plutarch says that <hi rend="italic">a</hi>
                    covering of chaff and coarse cloth is sufficient; and at present a like method
                    is pursued in Portugal. Where the snow has been collected in a deep gulf, some
                    grass or green sods, covered with dung from the sheep pens, is thrown over it;
                    and under these it is so well preserved, that, the whole summer through, it is
                    sent the distance of sixty Spanish (nearly 180 English) miles to Lisbon.</p>
                <p>“When the ancients, therefore, wished to have cooling liquors, they either drank
                    the melted snow, or put some of it in their wine; or they placed jars filled
                    with wine in the snow, and suffered it to cool there as long as they thought
                    proper. That ice was also preserved for the like purpose, is probable from the
                    testimony of various authors; but it appears not to have been used so much in
                    warm countries as in the northern. Even at present snow is employed in Italy,
                    Spain, and Portugal; but in Persia ice. I have never any where found an account
                    of Grecian or Roman ice-houses. By the writers on agriculture they are not
                    mentioned.”</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">IcE-lsland,</hi> a name given by sailors to a great quantity of
                    ice collected into one huge solid mass, and floating about upon the seas near or
                    within the polar circles. The motion of the lesser pieces is as rapid as the
                    currents: the greater, which are sometimes two hundred leagues long, and sixty
                    or eighty broad, move slowly and majestically; often fix for a time, immoveable
                    by the power of the ocean, and then produce near the horizon that bright white
                    appearance called the <hi rend="italic">ice-blink.</hi> The approximation of two
                    great fields produces a most singular phenomenon; it forces the lesser (if the
                    term can be applied to pieces of several acres square) out of the water, and
                    adds it to the surface; a second, and often a third succeeds, so that the whole
                    forms an aggregate of a tremendous height. These float in the sea like so many
                    rugged mountains, and are sometimes five or six hundred yards thick; but the far
                    greater part is concealed beneath the water. These are continually increased in
                    height by the freezing of the spray of the sea, or the melting of the snow which
                    falls on them. Those which remain in this frozen climate receive continual
                    additions; others are gradually wafted by the northern <pb break="no"
