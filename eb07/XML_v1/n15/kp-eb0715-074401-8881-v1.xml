                    so useful an invention to God himself, who gave the first specimen of navigation
                    in the ark built by Noah under his direction.</p>
                <p>However, profane history represents the Phoenicians, especially those of their
                    capital Tyre, as the first navigators; being urged to seek a foreign commerce by
                    the narrowness and poverty of a slip of ground they possessed along the coast,
                    as well as by the convenience of two or three good ports, and by their natural
                    genius for traffic. Accordingly, Lebanon and the other neighbouring mountains
                    furnishing them with excellent wood for ship-building, they in a short time
                    became masters of a numerous fleet; and constantly hazarding new navigations,
                    and settling new trades, they soon arrived at an incredible pitch of opulence
                    and populousness, insomuch as to be in a condition to send out colonies. The
                    principal of these was Carthage, which, keeping up the Phoenician spirit of
                    commerce, in time not only equalled Tyre itself, but vastly surpassed it,
                    sending its merchant fleets through the Straits of Gibraltar, along the western
                    coasts of Africa and Europe, and even, if we may believe some authors, to
                    America itself.</p>
                <p>Tyre, whose immense riches and power are represented in such lofty terms both by
                    sacred and profane authors, was destroyed by Alexander the Great, upon which its
                    navigation and commerce were transferred by the conqueror to Alexandria, a new
                    city, admirably situated for these purposes, and intended to form the capital of
                    the empire of Asia, of which Alexander then meditated the conquest. And thus
                    arose the navigation of the Egyptians, which was afterwards so much cultivated
                    by the Ptolemies, that Tyre and Carthage were quite forgotten.</p>
                <p>Egypt being reduced into a Roman province after the battle of Actium, its trade
                    and navigation fell into the hands of Augustus, in whose time Alexandria was
                    only inferior to Rome; and the magazines of the capital of the world were wholly
                    supplied with merchandize from the commercial capital of Egypt.</p>
                <p>At length Alexandria itself underwent the fate of Tyre and Carthage, being
                    surprised by the Saracens, who, in spite of the Emperor Heraclius, overspread
                    the northern coasts of Africa, whence the merchants being expelled, Alexandria
                    has ever since been in a languishing state, though it still has a considerable
                    share of the commerce of the Christian merchants trading to the Levant.</p>
                <p>The fall of Rome and its empire drew along with it not only the overthrow of
                    learning and the polite arts, butthat of navigation; the barbarians, into whose
                    hands it fell, contenting themselves with the spoils of the industry of their
                    predecessors. But no sooner were the braver amongst those nations well settled
                    in their new provinces, some in Gaul, as the Franks, others in Spain, as the
                    Goths, and others in Italy, as the Lombards, than they began to learn the
                    advantages of navigation and commerce, and the methods of managing them, from
                    the people they had subdued; and this with so much success, that in a little
                    time some of them became able to give new lessons, and set on foot new
                    institutions, for its advantage. Thus it is to the Lombards that we usually
                    ascribe the invention and use of banks, book-keeping, exchanges, rechanges,
                    &amp;c.</p>
                <p>It does not appear which of the European people, after the settlement of their
                    new masters, first betook themselves to navigation and commerce. Some think it
                    began with the French, although the Italians seem to have the justest title to
                    this distinction, and are accordingly regarded as the restorers of navigation,
                    as well as of the polite arts, which had been banished together from the time
                    the empire was torn asunder. It is the people of Italy, then, and particularly
                    those of Venice and Genoa, who have the glory of this restoration; and it is to
                    their advantageous situation for navigation that they in great measure owe their
                    glory. In the bottom of the Adriatic were a great number of marshy islands, only
                    separated by narrow channels, but these well screened, and almost inaccessible,
                    the residence of some fishermen, who here supported themselves by a little trade
                    in fish and salt, which they found in some of these islands. Thither the Veneti,
                    a people inhabiting that part of Italy which stretches along the coasts of the
                    gulf, retired, when Alaric king of the Goths, and afterwards Attila king of the
                    Huns, ravaged Italy.</p>
                <p>These new islanders, little imagining that this was to be their fixed residence,
                    di∣d not think of composing any body politic; but each of the seventy-two
                    islands of this little archipelago continued a long time under its separate
                    master, and each formed a distinct commonwealth. When their commerce had become
                    considerable enough to occasion jealousy to their neighbours, they began to
                    think of uniting into a body; and it was this union, first begun in the sixth
                    century, but not completed till the eighth, that laid the sure foundation of the
                    future grandeur of the state of Venice. From the time of this union, their
                    fleets of merchantmen were sent to all the ports of the Mediterranean; and at
                    last to those of Egypt, particularly Cairo, a new city, built by the Saracen
                    princes, on the eastern bank of the Nile, where they traded for the spices and
                    other products of the Indies. Thus they flourished, and increased their
                    commerce, their navigation, and their conquests, till the league of Cambray in
                    1508, when a number of jealous princes conspired to bring about their ruin;
                    which was the more easily effected by the diminution of their East India
                    commerce, of which the Portuguese had got one part and the French another.</p>
                <p>Genoa, which had applied itself to navigation at the same time with Venice, and
                    that with equal success, was a long time its dangerous rival, disputed with it
                    the empire of the sea, and shared with it the trade of Egypt and other parts
                    both of the east and west. But jealousy soon began to break out; and the two
                    republics coming to an open rupture, there was almost continual war for three
                    centuries before the superiority was ascertained, when, towards the end of the
                    fourteenth century, the battle of Chioza ended the strife; the Genoese, who till
                    then had usually the advantage, having now lost all, and the Venetians, almost
                    become desperate, having, by one happy blow, beyond all expectation, secured to
                    themselves the empire of the sea, and superiority in commerce.</p>
                <p>About the same time that navigation was retrieved in the southern parts of
                    Europe, a new society of merchants was formed in the north, which not only
                    carried commerce to the greatest perfection of which it was capable till the
                    discovery of the East and West Indies, but also formed a <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193828907?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0715-8907-0746"/> new scheme of
                    laws for its regulation, which still obtain under the name of Uses and Customs
                    of the Sea.</p>
                <p>This society is that famous league of the Hanse Towns, commonly supposed to have
                    been instituted about the year 1164. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Hanse Towns.</hi>
                    For the modern state of navigation in England, Holland, France, Spain, Portugal,
                    &amp;c. see the articles <hi rend="smallcaps">Commerce, Company,
                    &amp;c.</hi></p>
                <p>We shall only add, that in examining the causes of commerce passing successively
                    from the Venetians, Genoese, and Hanse Towns, to the Portuguese and Spaniards,
                    and from these again to the English and Dutch, it may be established as a maxim,
                    that the relation between commerce and navigation, or their union, is so
                    intimate, that the fall of the one inevitably draws after it that of the other;
                    and that they will always either flourish or decline together. Hence so many
                    laws, ordinances, statutes, and edicts for its regulation; and hence
                    particularly that celebrated act of navigation, which an eminent foreign author
                    calls the <hi rend="italic">palladium</hi> or <hi rend="italic">tutelar deity of
                    the commerce of England,</hi> which was long considered as the standing rule,
                    not only of the British amongst themselves, but also as that of other nations
                    with whom they trafficked.</p>
                <p>The art of navigation has been exceedingly improved in modern times, both with
                    regard to the form of the vessels themselves, and also with respect to the
                    methods of working them. The use of rowers is now entirely superseded by the
                    improvements made in the formation of the sails, rigging, &amp;c. by which means
                    ships can not only sail much faster than formerly, but can tack in any direction
                    with the greatest facility. It is also very probable that the ancients were
                    neither so well skilled in finding the latitudes, nor in steering their vessels
                    in places of difficult navigation, as the moderns. But the greatest advantage
                    which the moderns possess over the ancients consists in the ma riner’s compass,
                    by which they are enabled to find their way with more facility in the midst of
                    an immeasurable ocean, than the ancients could have done by creeping along the
                    coast, and never going out of sight of land. Some people indeed contend that
                    this is no new invention, but that the ancients were acquainted with it. They
                    say, that it was impossible for Solomon to have sent ships to Ophir, Tarshish,
                    and Parvaim, which last they imagine to have been Peru, without this useful
                    instrument. They insist, that it was impossible for the ancients to be
                    acquainted with the attractive virtue of the magnet, and to be ignorant of its
                    polarity; nay, they affirm that this property of the magnet is plainly mentioned
                    in the book of Job, where the loadstone is mentioned by the name of <hi
                    rend="italic">topaz,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">the stone that turns itself</hi>
                    But it is certain that the Romans who conquered Judaea were ignorant of this
                    instrument; and it is very improbable that such an useful invention, if it had
                    once been commonly known to any nation, would have been forgotten, or perfectly
                    concealed from such a prudent people as the Romans, who were so deeply
                    interested in the discovery of it.</p>
                <p>Amongst those who admit that the mariner’s compass is a modern invention, it has
                    been much disputed who was the inventor. Some attribute the honour of the
                    discovery to Flavio Gioia of Amalfi in Campania,<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See the articles <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Gioia</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Magnetism.</hi></p></note> who lived about
                    thebeginning of the fourteenth century; whilst others contend that it came from
                    the east, and was earlier known in Europe. But, at whatever time it was
                    invented, it is certain, that the mariner’s compass was not commonly used in
                    navigation before the year 1420. In that year the science was considerably
                    improved under the auspices of Henry duke of Visco, brother to the king of
                    Portugal. In the year 1485, Roderick and Joseph, physicians to John II. king of
                    Portugal, together with one Martin de Bohemia, a Portuguese native of the island
                    of Fayal, and scholar of Regiomontanus, calculated tables of the sun’s
                    declination for the use of sailors, and recommended the astrolabe for taking
                    observations at sea. Of the instructions of Martin the celebrated Christopher
                    Columbus is said to have availed himself, and to have improved the Spaniards in
                    the knowledge of the art; for the farther progress of which a lecture was
                    afterwards founded at Seville by the Emperor Charles V.</p>
                <p>The discovery of the variation is claimed both by Columbus and by Sebastian
                    Cabot. The former certainly did observe the variation without having heard of it
                    from any other person, on the 14th of September 1492, and it is very probable
                    that Cabot might have done the same. At that time it was found that there was no
                    variation at the Azores, where some geographers have thought proper to place the
                    first meridian, though it has since been observed that the variation alters in
                    time. The use of the cross staff now began to be introduced amongst sailors.
                    This ancient instrument is described by John Werner of Nuremberg, in his
                    annotations on the first book of Ptolemy’s Geography, printed in the year 1514.
                    He recommends it for observing the distance between the moon and some star, in
                    order thence to determine the longitude.</p>
                <p>At this time the art of navigation was very imperfect, on account of the
                    inaccuracies of the plane chart, which was the only one then known, and which,
                    by its gross errors, must have greatly misled the mariner, especially in voyages
                    far distant from the equator. Its precepts were probably at first only set down
                    on the sea charts, as is the custom at this day; but at length two Spanish
                    treatises were published in the year 1545, one by Pedro de Medina, and the other
                    by Martin Cortes, which contained a complete system of the art, as far as it was
                    then known. These seem to have been the oldest writers who fully handled the
                    art; for Medina, in his dedication to Philip prince of Spain, laments that
                    multitudes of ships daily perished at sea, because there were neither teachers
                    of the art, nor books by which it might be learned; and Cortes, in his
                    dedication, boasts to the emperor, that he was the first who had reduced
                    navigation into a compendium, valuing himself much on what he had performed.
                    Medina defended the plane chart; but he was opposed by Cortes, who showed its
                    errors, and endeavoured to account for the variation of the compass, by
                    supposing the needle to be influenced by a magnetic pole (which he called the
                    <hi rend="italic">point attractive),</hi> different from that of the world,
                    which notion has been farther prosecuted by others. Medina’s book was soon
                    translated into Italian, French, and Flemish, and for a long time served as a
                    guide to foreign navigators. However, Cortes was the favourite author of the
                    English nation, and was translated in the year 1561; whilst Medina’s work was
                    entirely neglected, though translated also within a short time of the other. At
                    that time the system of navigation consisted of an account of the Ptolemaic
                    hypothesis, and the circles of the sphere; of the roundness of the earth, the
                    longitudes, latitudes, climates, &amp;c. and eclipses of the luminaries; a
                    calendar; the method of finding the prime, epact, moon’s age, and tides; a
                    description of the compass, an account of its variation, for the discovering of
                    which Cortes said that an instrument might easily be contrived; tables of the
                    sun’s declination for four years, in order to find the latitude from his
                    meridian altitude; directions to find the same by certain stars; of the course
                    of the sun and moon; the length of the days; of time and its divisions; the
                    method of finding the hour of the day and night; and, lastly, a description of
                    the sea chart, on w hich, in order to discover where the ship was, they made use
                    of a small table, which showed, upon an alteration of one degree of the
                    latitude, how many <pb break="no" facs="nls:193828920?mode=fullsize"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0715-8920-0747"/> leagues were run in each rhumb, together with the
                    departure from the meridian. Besides, some other instruments were described,
                    especially by Cortes; such as one to find the place and declination of the sun,
                    with the days and place of the moon; certain dials, the astrolabe, and cross
                    staff; together with a complex machine to discover the hour and latitude at
                    once.</p>
                <p>About the same time proposals were made for finding the longitude by observations
                    of the moon. In 1530 Gemma Frisius advised the keeping of time by means of small
                    clocks or watches, which were then, as he says, newly invented. He also
                    contrived a new sort of cross staff, and an instrument called the <hi
                    rend="italic">nautical quadrant,</hi> which last was much praised by William
                    Cunningham, in his Astronomical Glass, printed in the year 1559.</p>
                <p>In the year 1537, Pedro Nunez, or Nonius, published a book in the Portuguese
                    language, to explain a difficulty in navigation proposed to him by the commander
                    Don Martin Alphonso de Susa. In this he exposed the errors of the plane chart,
                    and likewise gave the solution of several curious astronomical problems, amongst
                    which was that of determining the latitude from two observations of the sun’s
                    altitude and the intermediate azimuth. He observed, that although the rhumbs are
                    spiral lines, yet the direct course of a ship will always be in the arc of a
                    great circle, whereby the angle with the meridians will continually change; and
                    hence all that the steersman can here do for the preserving of the original
                    rhumb, is to correct these deviations as soon as they appear sensible. But in
                    reality the ship will thus describe a course without the rhumb line intended;
                    and therefore his calculations for assigning the latitude, where any rhumb line
                    crosses the several meridians, will be in some measure erroneous. He invented a
                    method of dividing a quadrant by means of concentric circles, which, after
                    having been much improved by Dr Halley, is used at present, and is called a <hi
                    rend="italic">nonius.</hi></p>
                <p>In the year 1577, Mr William Bourne published a treatise, in which, by
                    considering the irregularities in the moon’s motion, he showed the error of the
                    sailors in finding her age by the epact, and also in ‘determining the hour from
                    observing on what point of the compass the sun and moon appeared. He advised, in
                    sailing towards the high latitudes, to keep the reckoning by the globe, as there
                    the plane chart was most erroneous. He despaired of our ever being able to find
                    the longitude, unless the variation of the compass should be occasioned by some
                    such attractive point as Cortes had imagined, of which, however, he doubted; but
                    as he had shown how to find the variation at all times, he recommended to keep
                    an account of the observations, as useful for finding the place of the ship; and
                    this advice was prosecuted at large by Simon Stevin, in a treatise published at
                    Leyden in 1599, the substance of which was the same year printed at London in
                    English by Mr Edward Wright, entitled the Haven-finding Art. In this ancient
                    tract is also described the method by which our sailors estimate the rate of a
                    ship in her course, by an instrument called the <hi rend="italic">log.</hi> This
                    was so named from the piece of wood or log which floats in the water, whilst the
                    time is reckoned during which the line that is fastened to it is veering out.
                    The author of this contrivance is not known, neither was it taken notice of till
                    1607, in an East India voyage published by Purchas; but from that time it became
                    famous, and was much taken notice of by almost all writers on navigation in
                    every country; and it still continues to be used as at first, although many
                    attempts have been made to improve it, and contrivances proposed to supply its
                    place, many of which have succeeded in quiet water, but proved useless in a
                    stormy sea.</p>
                <p>In the year 1581 Michael Coignet, a native of Antwerp, published a treatise, in
                    which he animadverted on Medina. In this he showed, that as the rhumbs are
                    spirals, making endless revolutions about the poles, numerous errors must arise
                    from their being represented by straight lines on the sea charts; but although
                    he hoped to find a remedy for these errors, he was of opinion that the proposals
                    of Nonius were scarcely practicable, and therefore in a great measure useless.
                    In treating of the sun’s , declination, he took notice of the gradual decrease
                    in the obliquity of the ecliptic; he also described the cross staff with three
                    transverse pieces, which he admitted were then in common use amongst the
                    sailors. He likewise described some instruments of his own invention; but all of
                    them are now laid aside, excepting perhaps his nocturnal. He constructed a sea
                    table to be used by such as sailed beyond the sixtieth degree of latitude; and
                    at the end of the book is delivered a method of sailing upon a parallel of
                    latitude by means of a ring dial and a twenty-four hour glass. The same year the
                    discovery of the dipping needle was made by Mr Robert Norman. In his publication
                    on that subject he maintains, in opposition to Cortes, that the variation of the
                    compass was caused by some point on the surface of the earth, and not in the
                    heavens; and he also made considerable improvements on the construction of
                    compasses themselves, showing especially the danger of not fixing, on account of
                    the variation, the wire directly under <hi rend="italic">Xhefieur</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">de lis,</hi> as compasses made in different countries have it
                    placed differently. To this performance of Norman’s is prefixed a discourse on
                    the variation of the magnetical needle, by Mr William Burrough, in which he
                    shows how to determine the variation in many different ways, and also points out
                    many errors in the practice of navigation at that time, speaking in very severe
                    terms concerning those who had published upon it.</p>
                <p>During this time the Spaniards continued to publish treatises on the art. In 1585
                    an excellent compendium was published by Roderico Zamorano, and contributed
                    greatly towards the improvement of the art, particularly in the sea charts.
                    Globes of an improved kind, and of a much larger size than those formerly used,
                    were now constructed, and many improvements were made in other instruments;
                    nevertheless, the plane chart continued still to be followed, though its errors
                    were frequently complained of. Methods of removing these errors had indeed been
                    sought after; and Gerard Mercator seems to have been the first who found the
                    true method of effecting this, so as to answer the purposes of seamen. His
                    method was to represent the parallels, both of latitude and longitude, by
                    parallel straight lines, but gradually to augment the former as they approached
                    the pole. Thus the rhumbs, which otherwise ought to have been curves, were now
                    also extended into straight lines; and thus a straight line drawn between any
                    two places marked upon the chart formed an angle with the meridians, expressing
                    the rhumb leading from the one to the other. But although in 1569 Mercator
                    published an universal map constructed in this manner, it does not appear that
                    he was acquainted with the principles upon which this proceeded; and it is now
                    generally believed, that the true principles on which the construction of what
                    is called <hi rend="italic">Mercators chart</hi> depends were first discovered
                    by an Englishman, Mr Edward Wright.</p>
                <p>Mr Wright supposed, but, according to the general opinion, without sufficient
                    grounds, that this enlargement of the degrees of latitude was known and
                    mentioned by Ptolemy, and that the same thing had also been spoken of by Cortes.
                    The expressions of Ptolemy alluded to relate indeed to the proportion between
                    the distances of the parallels and meridians; but instead of proposing any
                    gradual enlargement of the parallels of latitude in a general chart, he speaks
                    only of particular maps, and advises not to confine a system of such maps to one
                    and the same scale, but to plan them out by a different measure, as occasion
                    might require; with this precaution, however, that the degrees of <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193828933?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0715-8933-0748"/> longitude in
                    each should bear some proportion to those of latitude, and this proportion was
                    to be deduced from that which the magnitude of the respective parallels bore to
                    a great circle of the sphere. He added, that, in particular maps, if this
                    proportion be observed with regard to the middle parallel, the inconvenience
                    will not be great, although the meridians should be straight lines parallel to
                    each other. But here he is understood only to mean, that the maps should in some
                    measure represent the figures of the countries for which they are drawn. In this
                    sense Mercator, who drew maps for Ptolemy’s tables, understood him; thinking it,
                    however, an improvement not to regulate the meridians by one parallel, but by
                    two, one distant from the northern, the other from the southern extremity of the
                    map, by a fourth part of the whole depth; by which means, in his maps, although
                    the meridians are straight lines, yet they are generally drawn inclining to each
                    other towards the poles. With regard to Cortes, he speaks only of the number of
                    degrees of latitude, and not of the extent of them; nay, he gives express
                    directions that they should all be laid down by equal measurement in a scale of
                    leagues adapted to the map.</p>
                <p>For some time after the appearance of Mercator’s map, it was not rightly
                    understood, and it was even thought to be entirely useless, if not detrimental.
                    However, about the year 1592 its utility began to be perceived; and seven years
                    afterwards, Mr Wright printed his famous treatise entitled the Correction of
                    certain Errors in Navigation, where he fully explained the reason of extending
                    the length of the parallels of latitude, and the uses thereof to navigators. In
                    1610 a second edition of Mr Wright’s book was published, with improvements. <hi
                    rend="italic">An</hi> excellent method was proposed of determining the magnitude
                    of the earth; and at the same time it was judiciously proposed to make our
                    common measures in some proportion to a degree on its surface, that they might
                    not depend on the uncertain length of a barleycorn. Amongst his other
                    improvements may be mentioned the Table of Latitudes for Dividing the Meridian
                    computed to Minutes, whereas it had been only divided to every tenth minute. He
                    also published a description of an instrument which he calls the <hi
                    rend="italic">tea rings,</hi> by which the variation of the compass, the
                    altitude of the sun, and the time of the day, may at once readily be determined
                    in any place, provided the latitude is known. He also showed how to correct the
                    errors arising from the eccentricity of the eye in observing by the cross staff.
                    In the years 1594, 1595, 1596, and 1597, he amended the tables of the
                    declinations and places of the sun and stars from his own observations made with
                    a six-feet quadrant, a sea quadrant to take altitudes by a forward or backward
                    observation, and likewise with a contrivance for the ready finding of the
                    latitude by the height of the pole star, when not upon the meridian. To this
                    edition was subjoined a translation of Zamorano’s Compendium, above mentioned,
                    in which he corrected some mistakes in the original; adding a large table of the
                    variation of the compass observed in different parts of the world, in order to
                    show that it was not occasioned by any magnetical pole.</p>
                <p>These improvements soon became known abroad. In 1608 a treatise entitled <hi
                    rend="italic">Hypomnemata Mathematica</hi> was published by Simon Stevin, for
                    the use of Prince Maurice. In the portion of the work relating to navigation,
                    the author having treated of sailing on a great circle, and shown how to draw
                    the rhumbs on a globe mechanically, set down Wright’s two tables of latitudes
                    and of rhumbs, in order to describe these lines more accurately, pretending even
                    to have discovered an error in Wright’s table. But all Stevin’s objections were
                    fully answered by the author himself, who showed that they arose from the rude
                    method of calculating made use of by the former.</p>
                <p>In 1624 the learned Wellebrordus Snellius, professor of the mathematics at
                    Leyden, published a treatise of navigation on Wright’s plan, but somewhat
                    obscurely; and as he did not particularly mention all the discoveries of Wright,
                    the latter was thought by some to have taken the hint of all his discoveries
                    from Snellius. But this supposition has been long ago refuted; and Wright now
                    enjoys the honour of those discoveries, which is justly his due.</p>
                <p>Mr Wright having shown how to find the place of the ship upon his chart, observed
                    that the same might be performed more accurately by calculation; but
                    considering, as he says, that the latitudes, and especially the courses at sea,
                    could not be determined so precisely, he forbore setting down particular
                    examples, as the mariner may be allowed to save himself this trouble, and only
                    to mark out upon his chart the ship’s way, after the manner then usually
                    practised. However, in 1614, Mr Raphe Handson, amongst the nautical questions he
                    subjoined to a translation of Pitiscus’s Trigonometry, solved very distinctly
                    every case of navigation, by applying arithmetical calculations to Wright’s
                    Table of Latitudes, or of Meridional Parts, as it has since been called.
                    Although the method discovered by Wright for finding the change of longitude by
                    a ship sailing on a rhumb is the proper way of performing it, Handson also
                    proposes two methods of approximation without the assistance of Wright’s
                    division of the meridian line. The first was computed by the arithmetical mean
                    between the cosines of both latitudes; and the other by the same mean between
                    the secants as an alternative, when Wright’s book was not at hand; although this
                    latter is wider of the truth than the former. By the same calculations also he
                    showed how much each of these compendiums deviates from the truth, and also how
                    widely the computations on the erroneous principles of the plane chart differ
                    from them all. The method generally used by our sailors, however, is commonly
                    called the <hi rend="italic">middle latitude,</hi> which, although it errs more
                    than that by the arithmetical mean between the two cosines, is preferred on
                    account of its being less operose; yet in high latitudes it is more eligible to
                    use that of the arithmetical mean between the logarithmic cosines, equivalent to
                    the geometrical mean between the cosines themselves; a method since proposed by
                    Mr John Bassat. The computation by the middle latitude will always fall short of
                    the true change of longitude, that by the geometrical mean will always exceed;
                    but that by the arithmetical mean falls short in latitudes of about 45 degrees,
                    and exceeds in lesser latitudes. However, none of these methods will differ much
                    from the truth when the change of latitude is sufficiently small.</p>
                <p>About this period logarithms were invented by John Napier, baron of Merchiston in
                    Scotland, and proved of the utmost service to the art of navigation. From these
                    Mr Edmund Gunter constructed a table of logarithmic sines and tangents to every
                    minute of the quadrant, which he published in 1620. In this work he applied to
                    navigation, and other branches of mathematics, his admirable ruler known by the
                    name of Gunter’s scale,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>See Gunter’s Scale.</p></note> on which are described lines of logarithms,
                    of logarithmic sines and tangents, of meridional parts, &amp;c.; and he greatly
                    improved the sector for the same purposes. He also showed how to take a back
                    observation by the cross staff, by which the error arising from the eccentricity
                    of the eye is avoided. He likewise described another instrument, of his own
                    invention, called the <hi rend="italic">cross bow,</hi> for taking altitudes of
                    the sun or stars, with some contrivances for the more readily collecting the
                    latitude from the observation. The discoveries concerning logarithms were
                    carried into France in <pb break="no" facs="nls:193828946?mode=fullsize"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0715-8946-0749"/> 1624 by Mr Edmund Wingate, who published two
                    small tracts in that year at Paris. In one of these he taught the use of
                    Gunter’s scale; and in the other, that of the tables of artificial sines and
                    tangents, as modelled according to Napier’s last form, erroneously attributed by
                    Wingate to Briggs.</p>
                <p>Gunter’s rule was projected into a circular arch by the Reverend Mr William
                    Oughtred in 1633, and its uses were fully shown in a pamphlet entitled the
                    Circles of Proportion, where, in an appendix, several important points in
                    navigation are well treated. It has also been made in the form of a sliding
                    ruler.</p>
                <p>The logarithmic tables were first applied to the different cases of sailing by Mr
                    Thomas Addison, in his treatise entitled Arithmetical Navigation, printed in the
                    year 1625. He also gave two traverse tables, with their uses; the one to
                    quarter· points of the compass, and the other to degrees. Mr Henry Gellibrand
                    published his discovery of the changes of the variation of the compass, in a
                    small quarto pamphlet, entitled a Discourse Mathematical on the Variation of the
                    Magnetical Needle, printed in 1635. This extraordinary phenomenon he found out
                    by comparing the observations which had been made at different times near the
                    same place by Mr Burrough, Mr Gunter, and himself, all persons of great skill
                    and experience in these matters. This discovery was likewise soon known abroad;
                    for Athanasius Kircher, in his treatise entitled <hi rend="italic">Magnes,</hi>
                    first printed at Rome in the year 1641, informs us, that he had been told of it
                    by Mr John Greaves, and then gives a letter of the famous Marinus Mersennus,
                    containing a very distinct account of the same.</p>
                <p>As altitudes of the sun are taken on shipboard by observing his elevation above
                    the visible horizon, to obtain from these the sun’s true altitude with
                    correctness, Wright observed it to be necessary that the dip of the visible
                    horizon below the horizontal plane passing through the observer’s eye should be
                    brought into the account, which cannot be calculated without knowing the
                    magnitude of the earth. Hence he was induced to propose different methods for
                    finding this; but he complains that the most effectual was out of his power to
                    execute, and therefore he contented himself with a rude attempt, in some measure
                    sufficient for his purpose. The dimensions of the earth deduced by him
                    corresponded very well with the usual divisions of the log line; nevertheless,
                    as he wrote not an express treatise on navigation, but only for the correcting
                    such errors as prevailed in general practice, the log line did not fall under
                    his notice. Mr Richard Norwood, however, put in execution the method recommended
                    by Mr Wright as the most perfect for measuring the dimensions of the earth, with
                    the true length of the degrees of a great circle upon it; and, in 1635, he
                    actually measured the distance between London and York; from which measurement,
                    and the summer solstitial altitudes of the sun observed on the meridian at both
                    places, he found a degree on a great circle of the earth to contain 367,196
                    English feet, equal to 57,300 French fathoms or toises, which is very exact, as
                    appears from many measurements that have been made since that time. Of all this
                    Mr Norwood gave a full account in his treatise called the Seaman’s Practice,
                    published in 1637. He there showed the reason why Snellius had failed in his
                    attempt; and he also pointed out various uses of his discovery, particularly for
                    correcting the gross errors hitherto committed in the divisions of the log line.
                    But necessary amendments have been little attended to by sailors, whose
                    obstinacy in adhering to established errors has been complained of by the best
                    writers on navigation. This improvement, however, has at length made its way
                    into practice, and few navigators of reputation now make use of the old measure
                    of forty-two feet to a knot. In this treatise Mr Norwood also describes his own
                    excellent method of setting down and perfecting a sea reckoning, by using a
                    traverse table, which method he had followed and taught for many years. He
                    likewise shows how to rectify the course by the variation of the compass being
                    considered; as also how to discover currents, and to make proper allowance on
                    their account. This treatise, and another on trigonometry, were continually
                    reprinted, as the principal books for learning scientifically the art of
                    navigation. What he had delivered, especially in the latter of them, concerning
                    this subject, was abridged as a manual for sailors, in a very small piece called
                    an Epitome, which useful performance has gone through a great number of
                    editions. No alterations were ever made in the Seaman’s Practice till the
                    twelfth edition in 1676, when the following paragraph was inserted in a smaller
                    character: “About the year 1672, Monsieur Picart has published an account in
                    French, concerning the measure of the earth, a breviate whereof may be seen in
                    the Philosophical Transactions, No. 112, wherein he concludes one degree to
                    contain 365,184 English feet, nearly agreeing with Mr Norwood’s experiment ;’’
                    and this advertisement is continued through the subsequent editions as late as
                    the year 1732.</p>
                <p>About the year 1645 Mr Bond published in Norwood's Epitome a very great
                    improvement of Wright’s method, from a property in his meridian line, whereby
                    the divisions are more scientifically assigned than the author himself was able
                    to effect; it resulted from this theorem, that these divisions are analogous to
                    the excesses of the logarithmic tangents of half the respective latitudes
                    augmented by forty-five degrees above the logarithm of the radius. This he
                    afterwards explained more fully in the third edition of Gunter’s works, printed
                    in 1653, where he observed that the logarithmic tangents from 45° upwards
                    increase in the same manner as the secants do added together, if every half
                    degree be accounted as a whole degree of Mercator’s meridional line. His rule
                    for computing the meridional parts belonging to any two latitudes, supposed to
                    be on the same side of the equator, is to the following effect: “Take the
                    logarithmic tangent, rejecting the radius, of half each latitude, augmented by
                    forty-five degrees; divide the difference of those numbers by the logarithmic
                    tangent of 45° 30', the radius being likewise rejected, and the quotient will be
                    the meridional parts required, expressed in degrees.” This rule is the immediate
                    consequence of the general theorem, that the degrees of latitude bear to one
                    degree (or sixty minutes, which in Wright’s table stands for the meridional
                    parts of one degree), the same proportion as the logarithmic tangent of half any
                    latitude augmented by forty-five degrees, and the radius neglected, to the like
                    tangent of half a degree augmented by forty-five degrees, with the radius
                    likewise rejected. But here there was still wanting the demonstration of this
                    general theorem, which was at length supplied by Mr James Gregory of Aberdeen,
                    in his <hi rend="italic">Exercitationes</hi><hi rend="italic">Geometricae,</hi>
                    printed at London in 1668; and afterwards more concisely demonstrated, together
                    with a scientific determination of the divisor, by Dr Halley, in the
                    Philosophical Transactions for 1695 (No. 219), from the consideration of the
                    spirals into which the rhumbs are transformed in the stereographic projection of
                    the sphere upon the plane of the equinoctial, and which is rendered still more
                    simple by Mr Roger Cotes, in his <hi rend="italic">Logornetria,</hi> first
                    published in the Philosophical Transactions for 1714 (No. 388). It is moreover
                    added in Gunter’s book, that if ^th of this division, which does not sensibly
                    differ from the logarithmic tangent of 45° P 30", with the radius subtracted
                    from it, be used, the quotient will exhibit the meridional parts expressed in
                    leagues, and this is the divisor set down in Norwood’s Epitome. After the same
                    manner the meridional parts will be found in minutes, if the like logarithmic
                    tangent of 45° 1' 30'', diminished by the radius, be <pb break="no"

                    is, the number used by others being 12633, when the logarithmic tables consist
                    of eight places of figures besides the index.</p>
                <p>In an edition of a book called the Seaman’s Kalendar, Mr Bond declared that he
                    had discovered the longitude by having found out the true theory of the magnetic
                    variation; and to gain credit to his assertion, he foretold, that at London in
                    1657 there would be no variation of the compass, and from that time it would
                    gradually increase the other way; which happened accordingly. Again, in the
                    Philosophical Transactions for 1668 (No. 40), he published a table of the
                    variation for forty-nine years to come. Thus he acquired such reputation, that
                    his treatise entitled The Longitude Found, was in the year 1676 published by the
                    special command of Charles II. and approved by many celebrated mathematicians.
                    It was not long, however, before it met with opposition; and in the year 1678,
                    another treatise, entitled The Longitude not Found, made its appearance, and as
                    Mr Bond’s hypothesis did not in any manner answer its author’s sanguine
                    expectations, the affair was undertaken by Dr Halley. The result of his
                    speculation was, that the magnetic needle is influenced by four poles; but this
                    wonderful phenomenon seems hitherto to have eluded all our researches. (See <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Magnetism.)</hi> In 1700, however, Dr Halley published a
                    general map, with curve lines expressing the paths where the magnetic needle had
                    the same variation; which was received with universal applause. But as the
                    positions of these curves vary from time to time, they should frequently be
                    corrected by skilful persons, as was done in 1644 and 1756, by Mr William
                    Mountaine, and Mr James Dodson. In the Philosophical Transactions for 1690, Dr
                    Halley also gave a dissertation on the monsoons, containing many very useful
                    observations for such as sail to places subject to these winds.</p>
                <p>After the true principles of the art were settledby Wright, Bond, and Norwood,
                    the authors who wrote on navigation became so numerous that it would be
                    impossible to enumerate them. New improvements were daily made, and every thing
                    relative to it was settled with an accuracy not only unknown to former ages, but
                    which would have been reckoned utterly impossible. The earth being found to be a
                    spheroid, and not a perfect sphere, with the shortest diameter passing through
                    the poles, a tract was published in 1741 by the Reverend Doctor Patrick Murdoch,
                    wherein he accommodated Wright’s sailing to such a figure; and the same year Mr
                    Colin Maclaurin, in the Philosophical Transactions (No. 461), gave a rule for
                    determining the meridional parts of a spheroid; which spe-. culation is farther
                    treated of in his book of Fluxions,, printed at Edinburgh in 1742, and in
                    Delambre’s Astronomy (t. iii. ch. xxxvi.).</p>
                <p>Amongst the later discoveries in navigation, that of finding the longitude both
                    by lunar observations and by timekeepers is the principal. It is owing chiefly
                    to the rewards offered by the British parliament that this has attained the
                    present degree of perfection. We are indebted to Dr Maskelyne for putting the
                    first of these methods in practice, and for other important improvements in
                    navigation. The time-keepers constructed by Harrison for this express purpose
                    were found to answer so well that he obtained the parliamentary reward. These
                    have been improved by Arnold, Earnshaw, and many others, so as now to be almost
                    in common use.</p>
                <p>The works which have latterly appeared on navigation are those on the longitude
                    and navigation by Dr Mackay, Dr Inman, Mr Riddle, Mr Norie, and others, and
                    which contain every necessary requisite to form the practical navigator.</p>
                <p>THEORY OF NAVIGATION.</p>
                <p>The motion of a ship in the water is well known to depend on the action of the
                    wind upon its sails, regulated by the direction of the helm. As the water is a
                    resisting medium, and the bulk of the ship very considerable, it thence follows
                    that there is always a great resistance on her forepart; and when this
                    resistance becomes sufficient to balance the moving force of the wind upon the
                    sails, the ship attains her utmost degree of velocity, and her motion is no
                    longer accelerated. This velocity is different according to the different
                    strength of the wind; but the stronger the wind, the greater resistance is made
                    to the ship’s passage through the water; and hence, although the wind should
                    blow ever so strongly, there is also a limit to the velocity of the ship, for
                    the sails and ropes can bear but a certain force of air; and when the resistance
                    on the fore-part becomes more than equivalent to their strength, the velocity
                    can no longer be increased, and the rigging gives way.</p>
                <p>The direction of a ship’s motion depends upon the position of her sails with
                    regard to the wind, combined with the action of the rudder. The most natural
                    direction of the ship is, when she runs directly before the wind, the sails
                    being then disposed so as to be at right angles thereto. But this is not always
                    the case, both on account of the variable nature of the winds, and the situation
                    of the intended port, or of intermediate headlands or islands. When the wind,
                    therefore, happens not to be favourable, the sails are placed so as to make an
                    oblique angle both with the direction of the ship and with the wind; and the
                    sails, together with the rudder, must be managed in such a manner that the
                    direction of the ship may make an acute angle with that of the wind; and the
                    ship, making boards on different tacks, will by this means arrive at the
                    intended port.</p>
                <p>The reason of the ship’s motion in this case is, that the water resists the side
                    more than the fore-part, and that in the same proportion as her length exceeds
                    her breadth. This proportion is so considerable, that the ship continually flies
                    off where the resistance is least, and that sometimes with great swiftness. In
                    this way of sailing, however, there is a great limitation; for if the angle made
                    by the keel with the direction of the wind be too acute, the ship cannot be kept
                    in that position; neither is it possible for a large ship to make a more acute
                    angle with the wind than about six points, though small sloops, it is said, may
                    make an angle of about five points with it or less. In all these cases, however,
                    the velocity of the ship is greatly retarded, and that not only on account of
                    the obliquity of her motion, but by reason of what is called her <hi
                    rend="italic">lee-way.</hi> This is occasioned by the yielding of the water on
                    the lee-side of the ship, by which means the vessel acquires a compound motion,
                    partly in the direction of the wind, and partly in that which is necessary for
                    attaining the desired port.</p>
                <p>It is perhaps impossible to lay down any mathematical principles on which the
                    lee-way of a ship could be properly calculated; only we may observe in general
                    that it depends on the strength of the wind, the roughness of the sea, and the
                    velocity of the ship. When the wind is not very strong, the resistance of the
                    water on the lee-side bears a very great proportion to that of the current of
                    air, and therefore it will yield but very little; however, supposing the ship to
                    remain in the same place, it is evident, that the water having once begun to
                    yield, will continue to do so for some time, even though no additional force
                    were applied to it; but as the wind continually applies the same force as at
                    first, the lee-way of the ship must go on constantly increasing till the
                    resistance of the water upon the lee-side balances the force applied on the
                    other, when it will become uniform, as does the motion of a ship sailing <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193828972?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0715-8972-0751"/>
                    before the wind. If the ship change her place with any degree of velocity, then
                    every time she moves her own length, a new quantity of water is to be put in
                    motion, which has not yet received any momentum, and which of consequence will
                    make a greater resistance than it can do when the ship remains in the same
                    place. In proportion to the swiftness of the ship, then, the lee-way will be the
                    less; but if the wind be very strong, the velocity of the ship will bear but a
                    small proportion to that of the current of air, and the same effects must follow
                    as though the ship moved slowly and the wind was gentle, that is, the ship must
                    make a great deal of lee-way. The same thing happens when the sea rises high,
                    whether the wind be strong or not; for then the whole water of the ocean, as far
                    as the swell reaches, has acquired a motion in a certain direction, and that to
                    a very considerable depth. The mountainous waves will not fail to carry the ship
                    very much out of her course; and this deviation will certainly be according to
                    their velocity and their magnitude. In all cases of a rough sea, therefore, a
                    great deal oflee-wayismade. Another circumstance also occasions a variation in
                    the quantity of the lee-way, namely, the lightness or heaviness of the ship; it
                    being evident, that when the ship sinks deep in the water, a much greater
                    quantity of that element is to be put in motion before she can make any lee-way,
                    than when she swims on the surface. As, therefore, it is impossible to calculate
                    all these things with mathematical exactness, it is plain that the real course
                    of a ship is exceedingly difficult to be found, and frequent errors must occur,
                    which can only be corrected by means of celestial observations.</p>
                <p>In many places of the ocean there are <hi rend="italic">currents,</hi> or places
                    where the water, instead of remaining at rest, runs with a very considerable
                    velocity for a considerable way in some particular direction, and which will
                    certainly carry the ship greatly out of her course. This occasions an error of
                    the same nature with the lee-way; and therefore, whenever a current is
                    perceived, its direction and velocity ought to be determined, and the proper
                    allowances made.</p>
                <p>Another source of error in reckoning the course of a ship proceeds from the
                    variation of the compass. There are few parts of the world where the needle
                    points exactly north.; and in those where the variation is known, it is subject
                    to very considerable alterations. By these means the course of the ship is
                    mistaken; for as the sailors have no other standard to direct them than the
                    compass, if the needle, instead of pointing due north, should point northeast, a
                    prodigious error would be occasioned during the course of the voyage, and the
                    ship would not come near the port to which she was bound. To avoid errors of
                    this kind, the only method is to observe the sun’s amplitude and azimuth as
                    frequently as possible, by which the variation of the compass will be perceived,
                    and the proper allowances can then be made for errors in the course which this
                    may have occasioned.</p>
                <p>Errors will arise in the reckoning of a ship, especially when she sails in high
                    latitudes, from the spheroidal figure of the earth; for as the polar diameter of
                    our globe is found to be considerably shorter than the equatorial one, it thence
                    follows, that the farther we remove from the equator, the longer are the degrees
                    of latitude. Of consequence, if a navigator assigns any certain number of miles
                    for the length of a degree of latitude near the equator, he must vary that
                    measure as he approaches towards the poles, otherwise he will imagine that he
                    has not sailed so far as he has actually done. It would therefore be necessary
                    to have a table containing the length of a degree of latitude in every different
                    parallel from the equator to either pole; as, without this, a troublesome
                    calculation must be made at every time the navigator makes a reckoning of his
                    course. Such a table, however, has not yet appeared; neither indeed does it seem
                    to be an easy matter to make it, on account of the difficulty of measuring the
                    length even of one or two degrees of latitude in different parts of the world.
                    Sir Isaac Newton first discovered this spheroidal figure of the earth; and
                    showed, from theory originally suggested by experiments on pendulums, that the
                    polar diameter was to the equatorial one as 229 to 230. This proportion,
                    however, has not been admitted by succeeding calculators. The French
                    mathematicians, who measured a degree of the meridian in Lapland, made the
                    proportion between the equatorial and polar diameters to be as 1 to 0∙9891;
                    those who measured a degree at Quito in Peru made the proportion as 1 to
                    0∙99624&lt;, or 266 to 265; Μ. ßouguer makes the proportion to be as 179 to 178;
                    and Μ. Buffon, in one part of his theory of the earth, makes the equatorial
                    diameter exceed the polar one by γ⅛-th of the whole. According to Μ. du Séjour,
                    this proportion is as 321 to 320; and Μ. de Laplace, in his Memoir upon the
                    Figure of Spheroids, has deduced the same proportion. Later investigations,
                    however, show that the polar axis is to the equatorial diameter in the ratio of
                    300 to 301 nearly. From these variations, it appears that the point is not
                    exactly determined, and, consequently, that any corrections which can be made
                    with regard to the spheroidal figure of the earth must be very uncertain.</p>
                <p>It is of consequence to navigators, in a long voyage, to take the nearest way to
                    their port; but this is scarcely possible to be done. The shortest distance
                    between any two points on the surface of a sphere is measured by an arc of a
                    great circle intercepted between them; and therefore it is advisable to direct
                    the ship along a great circle of the earth’s surface. But this is a matter of
                    considerable difficulty, because there are no fixed marks by which it can be
                    readily known whether the ship sails in the direction of a great circle or not.
                    For this reason the sailors commonly choose to direct their course by the
                    rhumbs, or the bearing of the place by the compass. These bearings do not point
                    out the shortest distance between places; because, upon a globe, the rhumbs are
                    spirals, and not arcs of great circles. However, when the places lie directly
                    under the equator, or exactly under the same meridian, the rhumb then coincides
                    with the arc of a great circle, and of consequence shows the nearest way. The
                    sailing on the arc of a great circle is called <hi rend="italic">great circle
                    sailing</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and the cases of it depend all upon the
                    solution of problems in spherical trigonometry.</p>
                <p>MARINER’S COMPASS.</p>
                <p>A ship is enabled to keep her course at sea by means of an instrument called the
                    mariner’s compass. It consists of a magnetic steel bar attached to the under
                    side of a card divided into points and quarter points, and supported by a fine
                    pin, on which it turns freely within a box covered with glass. By reason of the
                    directive property of the magnet, the north point, which is commonly denoted by
                    a <hi rend="italic">fleur de lis,</hi> is readily known. The circumference of
                    the card is generally divided into thirty-two points, which in the best
                    compasses are again subdivided into half points and quarters. These are reckoned
                    sufficient for nautical purposes. On the inside of the box is drawn a dark
                    vertical line called lubber’s point. This point, or rather line, and the pin on
                    which the card turns, are in the same line or plane with the keel of the ship;
                    and hence the point on the circumference of the card opposite to lubber’s point
                    shows the angle which the ship’s course makes with the magnetic meridian, called
                    the course of the ship.</p>

                <p>The annexed diagram gives a general view of the com pass. The names of the
                    points, and the angles which they form with the meridian, are given in Table I.
                    at the end of this article, and, as thus described, the instrument is called the
                    steering compass.</p>
                <p>The azimuth compass is the same instrument more nicely made. The circumference of
                    the card isdivided into degrees and parts by a vernier, and is fitted up with
                    sight-vanes to take amplitudes and azimuths, for the purpose of determining the
                    variation of the compass by observation. The variation is then applied to the
                    magnetic course shown by the steering compass, whence the true course with
                    respect to the meridian becomes known. The necessary rules for this purpose will
                    be given in a succeeding part of this article.</p>
                <p>Besides the variation, the needle is also affected by the dip, which is likewise
                    fully explained in the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Magnetism,</hi> as well as
                    Mr Barlow’s method of correcting the effects of local attraction, arising from
                    the effects of the iron, guns, &amp;c. in the vessel itself. Having made these
                    preliminary observations, we shall now proceed to the</p>

                <p>BOOK I.</p>
                <p>CONTAINING THE VARIOUS METHODS ΟΕ SAILING.</p>
                <p>The art of navigation depends upon astronomical and mathematical principles. The
                    places of the sun, moon, planets, and fixed stars, are deduced from observation
                    and calculation, and arranged in tables, the use of which is absolutely
                    necessary in reducing observations taken at sea for the purpose of ascertaining
                    the latitude and longitude of the ship, and the variation of the compass. The
                    problems in the various sailings are resolved either by trigonometrical
                    calculation, or by tables or rules formed by the assistance of trigonometry. By
                    mathematics, the necessary tables are constructed, and rules investigated for
                    performing the more difficult parts of navigation. For these several branches of
                    science, and for logarithmic tables, the reader is referred to the respective
                    articles in this work. A few tables are given at the end of this article; but as
                    the other tables necessary for the practice of navigation are to be found in
                    almost every treatise on that subject, it seems unnecessary to insert them in
                    this place.</p>
                <p>CHAP. I. PRELIMINARY PRINCIPLES.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> I.— <hi rend="italic">Of the Latitude and
                    Longitude of a Place.</hi></p>
                <p>The situation of a place on the surface of the earth is estimated by its distance
                    from two imaginary lines intersecting each other at right angles. The one of
                    these is called the <hi rend="italic">equator,</hi> and the other the <hi
                    rend="italic">first meridian.</hi> The situation of the equator is fixed; but
                    that of the first meridian is arbitrary, and therefore different nations assume
                    different first meridians. In Great Britain, we esteem that to be the first
                    meridian which passes through the Royal ' Observatory at Greenwich.</p>
                <p>The equator divides the earth into two equal parts, called the <hi rend="italic"
                    >northern</hi> and <hi rend="italic">southern hemispheres</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi> and the latitude of a place is its distance from the equator, reckoned
                    on a meridian in degrees and parts of a degree, being either north and south,
                    according as it is in the northern or southern hemisphere.</p>
                <p>The first meridian being continued round the globe, divides it into two equal
                    parts, called the <hi rend="italic">eastern</hi> and <hi rend="italic">western
                    hemispheres</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and the longitude of a place is that
                    portion of the equator contained between the first meridian and the meridian of
                    the given place, and is either east or west, according as it is in the eastern
                    or western hemisphere respectively to the first meridian.</p>

                <p>The theory of the tides has already been explained under the article <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Astronomy,</hi> and will again be further illustrated under
                    that of <hi rend="smallcaps">Tides.</hi> In this place, therefore, it remains
                    only to explain the method of calculating the time of high water at a given
                    place.</p>
                <p>As the tides depend upon the joint actions of the sun and moon, and therefore
                    upon the distance of these objects from the earth and from each other; and as,
                    in the method generally employed to find the time of high water, whether by the
                    mean time of new moon, or by the epacts, or tables deduced therefrom, the moon
                    is supposed to be the sole agent, and to have an uniform motion in the periphery
                    of a circle, whose centre is that of the earth; it is hence obvious that this
                    method cannot be accurate, and by observation the error is sometimes found to
                    exceed two hours. This method is therefore rejected, and another given, in which
                    the error will seldom exceed a few minutes, unless the tides are greatly
                    influenced by the winds.</p>

                    Almanack the moon’s horizontal parallax. Also to the time of the moon’s transit
                    over the meridian of Greenwich apply the variation answering to the longitude
                    and daily variation between the given and preceding day if tlιe longitude is
                    east. Subtract it from the transit over the meridian of Greenwich, and the
                    remainder will be the time of transit over the meridian of the given place. But
                    if the longitude be west, the correction answering to the longitude and daily
                    variation of transit between the given and following day must be added to the
                    time of transit over the meridian of Greenwich to obtain the time of transit
                    over the meridian of the given place. To the time of high water, if new and full
                    moon at the given place, add the reduced time of transit over the meridian of
                    the same place, and to the sum apply the equation from the table answering to
                    the time of transit and horizontal parallax formerly found: the result will be
                    the true mean time of high water required. The apparent time may be found by
                    applying the equation of time, with its proper sign.</p>

                    in a given Time.</hi></p>
                <p>The method commonly used at sea to find the distance sailed in a given time is by
                    means of a log-line and halfminute glass. A description of these is given under
                    the articles <hi rend="smallcaps">Log</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Log-line,</hi> which see.</p>
                <p>It has been already observed, that the interval between each knot on the line
                    ought to be fifty feet, in order to adapt it to a glass that runs thirty
                    seconds. But although the line and glass be at any time perfectly adjusted to
                    each other, yet as the line shrinks after being wet, and as the weather has a
                    considerable effect upon the glass, it will therefore be necessary to examine
                    them from time to time; and the distance given by them must be corrected
                    accordingly. The distance sailed may, therefore, be affected by an error in the
                    glass, or in the line, or in both. The true distance may, however, be found as
                    follows:</p>

                    sailing.</hi></p>
                <p>Plane sailing is the art of navigating a ship upon principles deduced from the
                    notion of the earth’s being an extended plane. On this supposition the meridians
                    are esteemed as parallel right lines. The parallels of latitude are at right
                    angles to the meridians; the lengths of the degrees on the meridians, equator,
                    and parallels of latitude, are everywhere equal; and the degrees of longitude
                    are reckoned on the parallels of latitude as well as on the equator. In this
                    sailing four things are principally concerned, namely, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >course, distance, difference of latitude,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >departure.</hi></p>
                <p>The course is the angle contained between the meridian and the line described by
                    the ship, and is usually expressed in points of the compass.</p>
                <p>The distance is the number of miles a ship has sailed on a direct course in a
                    given time.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193829037?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0715-9037-0756"/>
                <p>The difference of latitude is the portion of a meridian contained between the
                    parallels of latitude sailed from and come to; and is reckoned either north or
                    south, according as the course is in the northern or southern hemisphere.</p>
                <p>The departure is the distance of the ship from the meridian of the place she
                    left, reckoned on a parallel of latitude. In this sailing, the departure and
                    difference of longitude are esteemed equal.</p>
                <p>In order to illustrate the above, let A represent the position of any given
                    place, and AB the meridian passing through that place; also let AC represent the
                    line described by a ship, and C the point arrived at. From C draw CB
                    perpendicular to AB. Now in the triangle ABC, the angle BAC represents the
                    course, the side AC the distance, AB the difference of latitude, and BC the
                    departure.</p>
                <p>In constructing a figure relating to a ship’s course, let the upper part of what
                    the figure is to be drawn on represent the <hi rend="italic">north,</hi> then
                    the lower part will be <hi rend="italic">south,</hi> the right-hand side <hi
                    rend="italic">east,</hi> and the left-hand side <hi rend="italic">west.</hi></p>
                <p>A north and south line is to be drawn to represent the meridian of the place from
                    which the ship sailed; and the upper or lower part of this line, according as
                    the course is southerly or northerly, is to be marked as the position of that
                    place. From this point as a centre, with the chord of 60°, an arch is to be
                    described from the meridian towards the right or left, according as the course
                    is easterly or westerly; and the course, taken from the line of chords if given
                    in degrees, but from the line of rhumbs if expressed in points of the compass,
                    is to be laid upon this arch, beginning at the meridian. A line drawn through
                    this point and that sailed from will represent the distance, which, if given,
                    must be laid thereon, beginning at the point sailed from. A line is to be drawn
                    from the extremity of the distance perpendicular to the meridian; and hence the
                    difference of latitude and departure will be obtained.</p>
                <p>If the difference of latitude is given, it is to be laid upon the meridian,
                    beginning at the point representing the place the ship left; and a line drawn
                    from the extremity of the difference of latitude perpendicular to the meridian,
                    till it meets the distance produced, will limit the figure.</p>
                <p>If the departure is given, it is to be laid off on a parallel, and a line drawn
                    through its extremity will limit, the distance. When either the distance and
                    difference of latitude, distance and departure, or difference of latitude and
                    departure, are given, the measure of each is to be taken from a scale of equal
                    parts, and laid off on its respective line, and the extremities connected. Hence
                    the figure will be formed.</p>

                <p>CHAP. III. OF TRAVERSE SAILING.</p>
                <p>If a ship sail upon two or more courses in a given time, the irregular tract she
                    describes is called a <hi rend="italic">traverse</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi>
                    and to resolve a traverse, is the method of reducing these several courses, and
                    the distances run, into a single course and distance. The method chiefly used
                    for this purpose at sea is by inspection, which shall therefore be principally
                    adhered to, and is as follows.</p>
                <p>Make a table of a breadth and depth sufficient to contain the several courses,
                    &amp;c. This table is to be divided into six columns; the courses are to be put
                    in the first, and the corresponding distances in the second column; the third
                    and fourth columns are to contain the differences of latitude, and the two last
                    the departures.</p>
                <p>Now, the several courses and their corresponding distances being properly
                    arranged in the table, find the difference of latitude and departure answering
                    to each in the traverse table; remembering that the difference of latitude is to
                    be put in a north or south column, according as the course is in the northern or
                    southern hemisphere; and that the departure is to be put in an east column if
                    the course is easterly, but in a west column if the course is westerly;
                    observing also, that the departure is less than the difference of latitude when
                    the course is less than four points, or 45°; otherwise greater.</p>
                <p>Add up the columns of northing, southing, easting, and westing, and set down the
                    sum of each at its bottom; then the difference between the sums of the north and
                    south columns will be the difference of latitude made good, of the same name
                    with the greater; and the difference between the sums of the east and west
                    columns is the departure made good, of the same name with the greater sum.</p>
                <p>Now, seek in the traverse table till a difference of latitude and departure are
                    found to agree as nearly as possible with those above; then the distance will be
                    found on the same line, and the course at the top or bottom of the page,
                    according as the difference of latitude is greater or less than the
                    departure.</p>
                <p>In order to resolve a traverse by construction, describe a circle with the chord
                    of 60°, in which draw two diameters at right angles to each other, at whose
                    extremities are to be marked the initials of the cardinal points, north being
                    uppermost.</p>
                <p>Lay off each course on the circumference, reckoned from its proper meridian; and
                    from the centre to each point draw lines, which are to be marked with the proper
                    number of the course.</p>
                <p>On the first radius lay off the first distance from the centre, and through its
                    extremity, and parallel to the second radius, draw the second distance, of its
                    proper length; through the extremity of the second distance, and parallel to the
                    third radius, draw the third distance, of its proper length; and thus proceed
                    until all the distances are drawn.</p>
                <p>A line drawn from the extremity of the last distance to tlιe centre of the circle
                    will represent the distance made good; and a line drawn from the same point
                    perpendicular to the meridian, produced if necessary, will represent the
                    departure; and the portion of the meridian intercepted between the centre and
                    departure will be the difference of latitude made good.</p>

                    represents the place the ship sailed from; draw two diameters NS, EW at right
                    angles to each other, the one representing the meridian, and the other the
                    parallel of latitude of the place sailed from. Take each course from the line of
                    rhumbs, lay it oft" on the circumference from its proper meridian, and number it
                    in order 1, 2, 3, 4. Upon the first rhumb Cl, lay off the first distance 163
                    miles from C to A; through it draw the second distance AB parallel to C2, and
                    equal to 110 miles; <pb break="no" facs="nls:193829089?mode=fullsize"

                <p>CHAP. IV.—OF PARALLEL SAILING.</p>
                <p>The figure of the earth is spherical, and the meridians gradually approach each
                    other, and meet at the poles. The difference of longitude between any two places
                    is the angle at the pole contained between the meridians of those places, or it
                    is the arch of the equator intercepted between the meridians of the given
                    places; and the meridian distance between two places in the same parallel is the
                    arch thereof contained between their meridians. It hence follows, that the
                    meridian distance, answering to the same difference of longitude, will vary with
                    the latitude of the parallel upon which it is reckoned; and the same difference
                    of longitude will not answer to a given meridian distance when reckoned upon
                    different parallels.</p>
                <p>Parallel sailing is, therefore, the method of finding the distance between two
                    places lying in the same parallél whose longitudes are known; or, to find the
                    difference of longitude answering to a given distance run in an east or west
                    direction. This sailing is particularly useful in making low or small
                    islánds.</p>
                <p>In order to illustrate the principles of parallel sailing, let CABP (fig. 9)
                    represent a section of one fourth part of the earth, the arch ABP being part of
                    a meridian; CA the equatorial, and CP the polar semi-axis. Also let B be the
                    situation of any given place on the earth; and join BC, which will be equal to
                    CA or CP.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>This is not
                    strictly true, as the figure of the earth is that of an oblate spheroid; and
                    therefore the radius of curvature varies with the latitude. The difference
                    between CA and CP, according to Sir Issac Newton’s hypothesis, is about 17
                    miles.</p></note> The arch AB, or angle ACB, is the measure of the latitude of
                    the place B; and the arch BP, or angle BCP, is that of its complement. If BD be
                    drawn from B perpendicular to CP, it will represent the cosine of latitude to
                    the radius BC or CA.</p>
                <p>Now since circles and similar portions of circles are in the direct ratio of
                    their radii; therefore,</p>
                <p>As radius</p>
                <p>Is to the cosine of latitude, So is any given portion of the equator To a similar
                    portion of the given parallel.</p>
                <p>But the difference of longitude is an arch of the equator<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193829102?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0715-9102-0761"/>, and the
                    distance between any two places under the same parallel is a similar portion of
                    that parallel.</p>
                <p>Hence R: cosine latitude:: dift'. longitude: distance.</p>
                <p>And, by inversion, cosine latitude: R:: distance: diff. of longitude.</p>
                <p>Also, diff. of longitude: distance:: R: cos. latitude.</p>
                <p>PnoB. I. Given the latitude of a parallel, and the number of miles contained in a
                    portion of the equator, to find the miles contained in a similar portion of that

                <p>CHAP. V.—OF MIDDLE LATITUDE SAILING.</p>
                <p>The earth is a sphere, and the meridians meet at the poles; and since a
                    rhumb-line makes equal angles with every meridian, the line a ship describes is,
                    therefore, that kind of a curve called a <hi rend="italic">spiral.</hi></p>
                <p>Let AB (fig. 15) be any given distance sailed upon an oblique rhumb, PBN, PAM the
                    extreme meridians, MN a portion of the equator, and PCK, PEL two meridians
                    intersecting the distance AB in the points CE infinitely near each other. If the
                    arches BS, CD, and AR, be described parallel to the equator,* it is hence
                    evident that AS is the difference of latitude, and the arch MN of the equator
                    the difference of longitude, answering to the given distance AB and course
                    PAB.</p>
                <p>Now, since CE represents a very small portion of the distance AB, DE will be the
                    correspondent portion of a meridian; hence the triangle EDC may be considered as
                    rectilineal. <hi rend="italic">If</hi> the distance be supposed to be divided
                    into an infinite number of parts, each equal to CE, and upon these, triangles be
                    constructed whose sides are portions of a meridian and parallel, it is evident
                    these triangles will be equal and similar; for, besides the right angle, and
                    hypothenuse which is the same in each, the course or angle CED is also the same.
                    Hence, by the J 2th of V. Eue. the sum of all the hypothenuses CE, or the
                    distance AB, is to the sum of all the sides DE, or the difference of latitude
                    AS, as one of the hypothenuses CE is to the corresponding side DE. Now, let the
                    triangle GIH (fig. 16) be constructed similar to the triangle CDE, having the
                    angle G equal to the course: then, as GH: GI:: CE: DC:: AB: AS.</p>
                <p>Hence, if GH be made equaI to the given distance AB, then GI will be the
                    corresponding difference of latitude.</p>
                <p>In like manner, the sum of all the hypothenuses CE, or the distance AB, is to the
                    sum of all the sides CD, as CE is to CD, or as GH to HI, because of the similar
                    triangles.</p>
                <p>The several parts of the same rectilineal triangle will, therefore, represent the
                    course, distance, difference of latitude, and departure.</p>
                <p>Although the parts HG, GI, and angle G of the rectilineal triangle GIH, are equal
                    to the corresponding parts AB, AS, and angle A, of the triangle ASB upon the
                    surface of the sphere; yet HI is not equal to BS, for HI is the sum of all the
                    arcs CD; but CD is greater than OQ, and less than ZX: therefore HI is greater
                    than BS, and less than AR. Hence the difference of longitude MN cannot be
                    inferred from the departure reckoned either upon the parallel sailed from or
                    upon that come to, but on some intermediate parallel TV, such that the arch TV
                    is exactly equal to the departure; and, in this case, the difference of
                    longitude would be easily obtained. For TV is to MN as the sine PT to the sine
                    PM; that is, as the cosine of latitude is to the radius.</p>
                <p>The latitude of the parallel TV is not, however, easily determined with accuracy:
                    various methods have, therefore, been taken in order to obtain it nearly, with
                    as little trouble as possible; first, by taking the arithmetical mean of the two
                    latitudes for that of the mean parallel; secondly, by using the arithmetical
                    mean of the cosines of the latitudes; thirdly, by using the geometrical mean of
                    the cosines of the latitudes; and, lastly, by employing the parallel deduced
                    from the mean of the meridional parts of the two latitudes. The first of these
                    methods is that which is generally used.</p>
                <p>In order to illustrate the computations in middle latitude sailing, let the
                    triangle ABC (fig. 17) represent a figure in plane sailing, wherein AB is the
                    difference of latitude, AC the distance, BC the departure, and the angle BAC the
                    course. Also, let the triangle DBC be a figure in parallel sailing, in which DC
                    is the difference of longitude, BC the meridian distance, and the angle DCB the
                    middle latitude. In these triangles there is, therefore, one side BC common to
                    both; and that triangle is to be first resolved in which two parts are given,
                    and then the unknown parts of the other triangle will be easily obtained.</p>

                <p>The above method is that always practised'to find the difference of longitude
                    made good in the course of a day’s run, and will, no doubt, give the difference
                    of longitude tolerably exact in any probable run a ship may make in that time,
                    especially near the equator. But in a high latitude, when the distances are
                    considerable, this method is not to be depended on. To illustrate this, let a
                    ship be supposed to sail from latitude 57° N., as follows: E. 240 miles, N. 240
                    miles, W. 240 miles, and S. 240 miles; then, by the above method, the ship will
                    be come to the same place she left. It will, however, appear evident from the
                    following consideration, that this is by no means the case; for let two ships,
                    from latitude 61° N., and distant 240 miles, sail directly south till they are
                    in latitude 57° N.; now, their distance, being computed by Problem IV. of
                    Parallel Sailing, will be 269∙6 miles; and therefore, if the ship sailed as
                    above, she will be 29∙6 miles west of the place sailed from, and the error in
                    longitude will be equal to 240 × secant 61° —secant 57° = 29∙6 X secant 57° =
                    54∙4∙</p>
                <p>Theorems might be investigated for computing the errors to which the above method
                    is liable. These corrections may, however, be avoided, by using the following
                    method.</p>

                    and the fourth and fifth columns are to contain the differences of

                    sailing.</hi></p>
                <p>It was observed, in Middle Latitude Sailing, that the difference of longitude
                    made upon an oblique rhumb· could not be exactly determined by using the middle
                    latitude. In Mercator’s Sailing the difference of longitude is very easily
                    found, and the several problems of sailing are resolved with the utmost
                    accuracy, by the assistance of Mercator’s chart or equivalent tables.</p>
                <p>In Mercator’s chart, the meridians are straight lines parallel to each other; and
                    the degrees of latitude, which at the equator are equal to those of longitude,
                    increase with the distance of the parallel from the equator. The parts of the
                    meridian thus increased are called <hi rend="italic">meridional parts.</hi> A
                    table of these parts was first constructed by Mr Edward Wright, by the continual
                    addition of the secants of each minute of latitude.</p>
                <p>For by parallel sailing,</p>
                <p>R: cos. of lat.:: part of equat.: similar part of parallel.</p>
                <p>And because the equator and meridian on the globe are equal; therefore,</p>
                <p>R: cos. lat.:: part of meridian: similar part of parallel. Or sec. lat.: R:: part
                    of merid.: similar part of parallel, <hi rend="subscript"> ττ</hi> secant
                    latitude R</p>
                <p>Hence —τ. — = —.</p>
                <p>part of meridian part of parallel</p>
                <p>But in Mercator’s chart the parallels of latitude are equal, and radius is a
                    constant quantity. If, therefore, the latitude be assumed successively equal to
                    ‘ l <hi rend="superscript"> z</hi>, 2 ’, 3 <hi rend="superscript"> z</hi>, ’
                    &amp;c. and the corresponding parts of the enlarged meridian be represented by
                    α, <hi rend="italic">b, c,</hi> &amp;c.; then, secant P __ secant 2' secant
                    3'</p>
                <p>part of mer. <hi rend="italic">a ~</hi> part of mer. <hi rend="italic">b ~</hi>
                    part ofmer. c,&amp;c. Hence secant 1': part of mer. <hi rend="italic">a</hi>::
                    secant 2 <hi rend="superscript"> z</hi>: part of mer. <hi rend="italic">b</hi>::
                    secant 3': part of mer. c, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>Therefore, by 12th V. Euclid,</p>
                <p>Secant 1 <hi rend="superscript"> z</hi>: part of mer. <hi rend="italic">a</hi>::
                    secant 1 <hi rend="superscript"> z</hi> + secant 2 <hi rend="superscript">
                    z</hi> + secant 3 <hi rend="superscript"> z</hi>, &amp;c.: parts of <hi
                    rend="italic">a + b</hi> + mer. <hi rend="italic">c,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                <p>That is, the meridional parts of any given latitude are equal to the sum of the
                    secants of the minutes in that latitude.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>This is not strictly true; for instead of taking the sum of
                    the secants of every minute in the distance of the given parallel from the

                    taken.</p></note></p>
                <p>Since CD: LK:: R: secant LD, fig. 15.</p>
                <p>And in the triangle CED, ED: CD:: R: tangent CED;</p>
                <p>Therefore ED: LK:: R <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>: secant LD × tangent CED. η

                <p>But ft is the enlarged portion of the me ridian answering to ED. Now the sum of
                    all the quan- . . ED × secant LD tities ∣ξ corresponding to the sum of all the
                    ED’s contained in AS, will be the meridional parts answering to the difference
                    of latitude AS; and MN is the sum of all the corresponding portions of the
                    equator LK.</p>
                <p>Whence MN = mer. diff. oflat. × tangent</p>
                <p>R</p>
                <p>That is, the difference of longitude is equal to the meridional difference of
                    latitude multiplied by the tangent of the course, and divided by the radius.</p>
                <p>This equation answers to a right-angled rectilineal triangle, having an angle
                    equal to the course; the adjacent side equal to the meridional difference of
                    latitude, and the opposite side the difference of longitude. This triangle is,
                    therefore, similar to a triangle constructed, with the course and difference of
                    latitude, according to the principles of plane sailing, and the homologous sides
                    will be proportional. Hence, if, in fig. 26, the angle A represents the course,
                    AB the difference of latitude, and if AD be made equal to the meridional
                    difference of latitude, then DE, drawn perpendicular to AD, meeting the distance
                    produced to E, will be the difference of longitude.</p>

                <p>CHAP. X. OF CURRENT SAILING.</p>
                <p>The computations in the preceding chapters have been performed upon the
                    assumption that the water has no motion. This may no doubt answer tolerably well
                    in those places where the ebbings and flowings are regular, as then the effect
                    of the tide will be nearly counterbalanced. But in places where there is a
                    constant current or setting of the sea towards the same point, an allowance for
                    the change of the ship’s place arising therefrom must be made. And the method of
                    resolving these problems, in which the effect of a current or heave of the sea
                    is taken into consideration, is called <hi rend="italic">current
                    sailing.</hi></p>
                <p>In a calm, it is evident a ship will be carried in the direction and with the
                    velocity of the current. Hence, if a ship sails in the direction of the current,
                    her rate will be augmented by the rate of the current; but if sailing di rectly
                    against it, the distance made good will be equal to the difference between the
                    ship’s rate as given by the log’ and that of the current. And the absolute
                    motion of the ship will be a-head if her rate exceeds that of the current; but
                    if less, the ship will make stern way. If the ship’s course be oblique to the
                    current, the distance made good in a given time will be represented by the third
                    side of a triangle, whereof the distance given by the log, and the drift of the
                    current in the same time, are the other sides; and the true course will be the
                    angle contained between the meridian and the line actually described by the
                    ship.</p>

                    solve the various</hi> PROBLEMS IN SAILING, INDEPENDENT OF CALCULATION.</p>
                <p>Various methods besides those already given have been proposed, to save the
                    trouble of calculation. One of these methods is by means of an instrument
                    composed of rulers, so disposed as to form a right-angled triangle, having
                    numbers in a regular progression marked on their sides. These instruments are
                    made of different materials, such as paper, wood, brass, &amp;c. and are
                    differently constructed, according to the fancy of the inventor. A number of
                    other instruments, very differently constructed, have been proposed for the same
                    purpose; of these, the rectangular instrument by the late A. Mackay, LL.D. F. R.
                    S. E. &amp;c. is one of the best. It is seldom, however, that any of them are
                    used.</p>

                <p>The charts usually employed in the practice of navigation are of two kinds,
                    namely, <hi rend="italic">Plane</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Mercator’s
                    Charts.</hi> The first of these is adapted to represent a portion of the earth’s
                    surface near the equator, and the last for all portions of the earth’s surface.
                    For a particular description of these, see the article <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Chart</hi>; and as these are particularly described under the above article, it
                    is therefore sufficient in this place to describe their use.</p>

                    the graduated meridian, from the extremity of the parallel, will give the
                    latitude of the proposed place.</p>
                <p>Thus the distance between Bonavista and the parallel of 15°, being laid from that
                    parallel upon the graduated meridian, will reach to 16° <hi rend="italic"

                    touch the edge of the ruler, and the straight line joining their points may be
                    perpendicular thereto; then will the other point show the course. The interval
                    between the places, being applied to the scale, will give the required
                    distance.</p>
                <p>Thus the course from Palmato St Vincent will be found to be about S. S. W. f W.

                <p><hi rend="italic">Of the Frame of the Quadrant.</hi></p>
                <p>The frame of the quadrant consists of an arch BC, firmly attached to the two
                    radii AB, AC, which are bound together by the braces LM, in order to strengthen
                    it, and prevent it from warping.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Of the Index</hi> D.</p>
                <p>The index is a flat bar of brass, and turns on the centre of the octant: at the
                    lower end of the index there is an oblong opening; to one side of this opening
                    the vernier scale is fixed, to subdivide the divisions of the arch; at the end
                    of the index there is a piece of brass, which bends under the arch, carrying a
                    spring to make the subdividing scale lie close to the divisions. It is also
                    furnished with a screw to fix the index in any desired position. The best
                    instruments have an adjusting screw fitted to the index, that it may be moved
                    more slowly, and with greater regularity and accuracy, than by the hand. It is
                    proper, however, to observe, that the index must be previously fixed near its
                    right position by the above-mentioned screw.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Of the Index-Glass</hi> E.</p>
                <p>Upon the index, and near its axis of motion, is fixed a plane speculum, or mirror
                    of glass quicksilvered. It is set in a brass frame, and is placed so that its
                    face is perpendicular to the plane of the instrument. This mirror being fixed to
                    the index, moves along with it, and has its direction changed by the motion
                    thereof; and the intention of this glass is to receive the image of the sun, or
                    any other object, and reflect it upon either of the two horizon-glasses,
                    according to the nature of the observation.</p>
                <p>The brass frame with the glass is fixed to the index by the screw c; the other
                    screw serves to replace it in a perpendicular position, if by any accident it
                    has been deranged.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Of the Horizon-Glasses</hi> F, G.</p>
                <p>On the radius AB of the octant are two small speculums: the surface of the upper
                    one is parallel to the indexglass, and that of the lower one perpendicular
                    thereto, when 0 on the index coincides with 0 on the limb. These mirrors receive
                    the reflected rays, and transmit them to the observer.</p>
                <p>The horizon-glasses are not entirely quicksilvered; the upper one F is only
                    silvered on its lower half, or that next the plane of the quadrant, the other
                    half being left transparent, and the back part of the frame cut away, that
                    nothing may impede the sight through the unsilvered part of the glass. The edge
                    of the foil of this glass is nearly parallel to the plane of the instrument, and
                    ought to be very sharp, and without a flaw. The other horizon-glass is silvered
                    at both ends. In the middle there is a transparent slit, through which the
                    horizon may be seen.</p>
                <p>Each of these glasses is set in a brass frame, to which there is an axis passing
                    through the wood-work, and is fitted to a lever on the under side of the
                    quadrant, by which the glass may be turned a few degrees on its axis, in order
                    to set it parallel to the index-glass. The lever has a contrivance to turn it
                    slowly, and a button to fix it. To set the glasses perpendicular to the plane of
                    the instrument, there are two sunk screws, one before and one behind each glass:
                    these screws pass through the plate on which the frame is fixed, into another
                    plate; so that by loosening one and tightening the other of these screws, the
                    direction of the frame with its mirror may be altered, and set perpendicular to
                    the plane of the instrument.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Of the Coloured Glasses</hi> K.</p>
                <p>There are usually three coloured classes, two of which are tinged red and the
                    other green. They are used to prevent the solar rays from hurting the eye at the
                    time of observation. These glasses are set in a frame, which turns on a centre,
                    so that they may be used separately or together as the brightness of the sun may
                    require. The green glass is particularly useful in observations of the moon; it
                    may be also used in observations of the sun, if that object be very faint. In
                    the fore observation, these glasses are fixed as in fig. 39; but when the back
                    observation is used, they are removed to N.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Of the two Sight Vanes,</hi> H, I.</p>
                <p>Each of these vanes is a perforated piece of brass, designed to direct the sight
                    parallel to the plane of the quadrant. That which is fixed at I is used for the
                    fore, and the other for the back observation. The vane I has two holes, one
                    exactly at the height of the silvered part of the horizon-glass, the other a
                    little higher, to direct the sight to the middle of the transparent part of the
                    mirror.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Of the Divisions on the Limb of the Quadrant.</hi></p>
                <p>The limb of the quadrant is divided from right to left into 90 primary divisions,
                    which are to be considered as degrees, and each degree is subdivided into three
                    equal parts, which are therefore of 20 minutes each: the intermediate minutes
                    are obtained by means of the scale of divisions at the end of the index.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193829297?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0715-9297-0776"/>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Of the Vernier, or Subdividing Scale.</hi></p>
                <p>The dividing scale contains a space equal to 21 divisions of the limb, and is
                    divided into 20 equal parts. Hence the difference between a division on the
                    dividing scale and a division on the limb is one twentieth of a division on the
                    limb, or one minute. The degree and minute pointed out by the dividing scale may
                    be easily found thus.</p>
                <p>Observe what minute on the dividing scale coincides with a division on the limb;
                    this division being added to the degree and part of a degree on the limb,
                    immediately preceding the first division on the dividing scale, will be the
                    degree and minute required.</p>
                <p>Thus, suppose the fourteenth minute on the dividing scale coincided with a
                    division on the limb, and that the preceding division on the limb to 0 on the
                    vernier was 56° 40'; hence the division shown by the vernier is 56° 54'. A
                    magnifying glass will assist the observer to read off the coinciding divisions
                    with more accuracy.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Adjustments of Hadley s Quadrant.</hi></p>
                <p>The adjustments of the quadrant consist in placing the mirrors perpendicular to
                    the plane of the instrument. The fore horizon-glass must be set parallel to the
                    speculum, and the planes of the speculum and back horizon-glass produced must be
                    perpendicular to each other when the index is at 0.</p>

                    the plane of the quadrant.</p>
                <p>Set the index towards the middle of the limb, and hold the quadrant so that its
                    plane may be nearly parallel to the horizon: then look into the index-glass, and
                    if the portion of the limb seen by reflection appears in the same plane with
                    that seen directly, the speculum is perpendicular to the plane of the
                    instrument. If they do not appear in the same plane, the error is to be
                    rectified by altering the position of the screws behind the frame of the
                    glass.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Adjustment</hi> II. To set the fore horizon-glass

                    direct the sight to the horizon, and if the horizons seen directly and by
                    reflection are apparently in the same straight line, the fore horizon-glass is
                    perpendicular to the plane of the instrument; if not, one of the horizons will
                    appear higher than the other. Now if the horizon seen by reflection is higher
                    than that seen directly, release the nearest screw in the pedestal of the glass,
                    and screw up that on the farther side, till the direct and reflected horizons
                    appear to make one continued straight line. But if the reflected horizon is
                    lower than that seen directly, unscrew the farthest, and screw up the nearest
                    screw till the coincidence of the horizons is perfect, observing to leave both
                    screws equally tight, and the fore horizon-glass will be perpendicular to the

                    seen in the silvered part coincides with that seen through the transparent part,
                    the horizon-glass is adjusted; but if the horizons do not coincide, unscrew the

                    the horizons do not unite, turn the sunk screws in the pedestal of the glass

                    on the other side of the quadrant must be released, and the nut at its extremity
                    turned till both horizons coincide. It may be observed, that the reflected
                    horizon will be inverted; that is, the sea will be apparently uppermost and the
                    sky lowermost.</p>
                <p>This method of adjustment is esteemed troublesome, and is often found to be very
                    difficult to perform at sea, on which account the method of observation by the
                    back horizon-glass is seldom or never used.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Use of Hadley’s Quadrant,</hi></p>
                <p>The altitude of any object is determined by the position of the index on the
                    limb, when by reflection that object appears to be in contact with the
                    horizon.</p>
                <p>If the object whose altitude is to be observed be the sun, and if so bright that
                    its image may be seen in the transparent part of the fore horizon-glass, the eye
                    is to be applied to the upper hole in the sight-vane; otherwise, to the lower
                    hole: and in this case the quadrant is to be held so that the sun may be
                    bisected by the line of separation of the silvered and transparent parts of the
                    glass. The moon is to be kept as nearly as possible in the same position; and
                    the image of the star is to be observed in the silvered part of the glass
                    adjacent to the line of separation of the two parts.</p>
                <p>There are two different methods of taking observations with the quadrant. In the
                    first of these the face of the observer is directed towards that part of the
                    horizon immediately under the sun, and is therefore called the <hi rend="italic"
                    >fore observation.</hi> In the other method, the observer’s back is to the sun,
                    and it is hence called the <hi rend="italic">bach observation.</hi> This last
                    method of observation is to be used only when the horizon under the sun is
                    obscured, or rendered indistinct by fog or any other impediment.</p>
                <p>In taking the sun’s altitude, whether by the fore or back observation, the
                    observer must turn the quadrant about upon the axis of vision, and at the same
                    time turn himself about upon his heel, so as to keep the sun always in that part
                    of the horizon-glass which is at the same distance as the eye from the plane of
                    the quadrant. In this way the reflected sun will describe an arch of a parallel
                    circle round the true sun, the convex side of which will be downwards in the
                    fore observation and upwards in the back; and consequently, when, by moving the
                    index, the lowest point of <pb break="no" facs="nls:193829310?mode=fullsize"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0715-9310-0777"/> the arch in the fore observation, or highest in
                    the back, is made to touch the horizon, the quadrant will stand in a vertical
                    plane, and the altitude above the visible horizon will be properly observed. The
                    reason of these operations may be thus explained: The image of the sun being
                    always kept in the axis of vision, the index will always show on the quadrant
                    the distance between the sun and any object seen directly which its image
                    appears to touch; therefore, as long as the index remains unmoved, the image of
                    the sun will describe an arch everywhere equidistant from the sun in the
                    heavens, and consequently a parallel circle about the sun as a pole. Such a
                    translation of the sun’s image can only be produced by the quadrant’s being
                    turned about upon a line drawn from the eye to the sun as an axis. A motion of
                    rotation upon this line may be resolved into two, one upon the axis of vision,
                    and the other upon a line on the quadrant perpendicular to the axis of vision;
                    and consequently a proper combination of these two motions will keep the image
                    of the sun constantly in the axis of vision, and cause both jointly to run over
                    a parallel circle about the sun in the heavens; but when the quadrant is
                    vertical, a line thereon perpendicular to the axis of vision becomes a vertical
                    axis; and as a small motion of the quadrant is all that is wanted, it will never
                    differ much in practice from a vertical axis. The observer is directed to
                    perform two motions rather than the single one equivalent to them on a line
                    drawn from the eye to the sun; because we are not capable, while looking towards
                    the horizon, of judging how to turn the quadrant about upon the elevated line
                    going to the sun as an axis, by any other means than by combining the two
                    motions above mentioned, so as to keep the sun’s image always in the proper part
                    of the horizon-glass. When the sun is near the horizon, the line going from the
                    eye to the sun will not be far removed from the axis of vision; and consequently
                    the principal motion of the quadrant will be performed on the axis of vision,
                    and the part of motion made on the vertical axis will be but small. <hi
                    rend="italic">Or</hi> the contrary, when the sun is near the zenith, the line
                    going to the sun is not far removed from a vertical line, and consequently the
                    principal motion of the quadrant will be performed on a vertical axis, by the
                    observer’s turning himself about, and the part of the motion made on the axis of
                    vision will be but small. In intermediate altitudes of the sun, the motions of
                    the quadrant on the axis of vision, and on the vertical axis, will be more
                    equally divided.</p>
                <p>Observations taken with the quadrant are liable to errors, arising from the
                    bending and elasticity of the index, and the resistance it meets with in turning
                    round its centre; whence the extremity of the index, on being pushed along the
                    arch, will sensibly advance before the index-glass begins to move, and may be
                    seen to recoil when the force acting on it is removed. Mr Hadley seems to have
                    been apprehensive that his instrument would be liable to errors from this cause;
                    and, in order to avoid them, gives particular directions that the index be made
                    broad at the end next the centre, and that the centre, or axis itself, have as
                    easy a motion as is consistent with steadiness; that is, an entire freedom from
                    looseness, or <hi rend="italic">shake as</hi> the workmen term it. By strictly
                    complying with these directions the error in question may indeed be greatly
                    diminished; so far, perhaps, as to render it nearly insensible, where the index
                    is made strong, and the proper medium between the two extremes of a shake at the
                    centre on one hand, and too much stiffness there on the other, is nicely hit:
                    but it cannot be entirely corrected; for to more or less of bending the index
                    will always be subject, and some degree of resistance will remain at the centre,
                    unless the friction there could be totally removed, which is impossible.</p>
                <p>Of the reality of the error to which he is liable from this cause, the observer,
                    if he is provided with a quadrant furnished with a screw for moving the index
                    gradually, may thus satisfy himself. After finishing the observation, lay the
                    quadrant on a table, and note the angle; then cautiously loosen the screw which
                    fastens the index, and it will immediately, if the quadrant is not remarkably
                    well constructed, be seen to start from its former situation, more or less
                    according to the perfection of the joint and the strength of the index. This
                    starting, which is owing to the index recoiling after being released from the
                    confined state it was in during the observation, will sometimes amount to
                    several minutes; and its direction will be opposite to that in which the index
                    was moved by the screw at the time of finishing the observation. But how far it
                    affects the truth of the observation, depends on the manner in which the index
                    was moved in setting it to 0, for adjusting the instrument; or in finishing the
                    observations necessary for finding the index error.</p>
                <p>The easiest and best rule to avoid these errors seems to be this: In all
                    observations made by Hadley’s quadrant, let the observer take notice constantly
                    to finish his observations by moving the index in the same direction which was
                    used in setting it to 0 for adjusting, or in the observations necessary for
                    finding the index error. If this rule is observed, the error arising from the
                    spring of the index will be obviated. For as the index was bent the same way,
                    and in the same degree, in adjusting as in observing, the truth of the
                    observations will not be affected by this bending.</p>

                    a Place.</hi></p>
                <p>The observation necessary for ascertaining the latitude of a place, is that of
                    the meridional altitude of a known celestial object; or two altitudes when the
                    object is out of the meridian. The latitude is deduced with more certainty and
                    with less trouble from the first of these methods than from the second; and the
                    sun, for various reasons, is the object most proper for this purpose at sea. It,
                    however, frequently happens that, by the interposition of clouds, the sun is
                    obscured at noon, and by this means the meridian altitude is lost. In this case,
                    therefore, the method by double altitudes becomes necessary. The latitude may be
                    deduced from three altitudes of an unknown object, or from double altitudes, the
                    apparent times of observation being given.</p>
                <p>The altitude of the limb of an object observed at sea requires four separate
                    corrections in order to obtain the true altitude of its centre; these are for
                    <hi rend="italic">semidiameter, dip, refraction,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >parallax.</hi> (See <hi rend="smallcaps">Astronomy,</hi> and the respective
                    articles.) The first and last of these corrections vanish when the observed
                    object is a fixed star.</p>
                <p>When the altitude of the lower limb of any object is observed, its semidiameter
                    is to be added thereto in order to obtain the central altitude; but if the upper
                    limb be observed, the semidiameter is to be subtracted. The dip is to be
                    subtracted from, or added to, the observed altitude, according as the fore or
                    back observation is used. The refraction is always to be subtracted from, and
                    the parallax added to, the observed altitude.</p>

                <p>The dip in the preceding table answers to an entirely open and unobstructed
                    horizon. It, however, frequently happens that the sun is over the land at the
                    time of observation, and the ship nearer to the land than the visible horizon
                    would be if unconfined. In this case, the dip will be different from what it
                    would otherwise have been, and is to be taken from the subjoined table, in which
                    the height is expressed at the top, and the distance from the land in the side
                    column in nautical miles. Seamen, in general, can estimate the distance of any
                    object from the ship with sufficient exactness for this purpose, especially when
                    that distance is not greater than six miles, which is the greatest distance of
                    the visible horizon from an observer on the deck of any ship.</p>

                <p>CHAP. II.—METHOD OF FINDING THE LONGITUDE AT SEA BY LUNAR OBSERVATIÓNS.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> I.— <hi rend="italic">Introduction.</hi></p>
                <p>The observations necessary to determine the longitude by this method are, the
                    distance between the sun and moon, the moon and a planet, or the moon and a
                    fixed star near the ecliptic, together with the altitude of each. The planets
                    used in the Nautical Almanac for this purpose are the following:—Venus, Mars,
                    Jupiter, and Saturn. The stars are, <hi rend="italic">α</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Arietis,</hi><hi rend="italic">Aldebaran,</hi><hi rend="italic">Pollux,</hi><hi

                    Fomalhaut,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">α Pegasi</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and
                    the distances of the moon’s centre from the sun, and from one or more of these
                    planets and stars, are contained in the xiiith—xviiith pages of the month, at
                    the beginning of every third hour mean time by the meridian of Greenwich. The
                    distance between the moon and one of these objects is observed with a sextant;
                    and the altitudes of the objects are taken as usual with a Hadley’s
                    quadrant.</p>
                <p>In the practice of this method, it will be found convenient to be provided with
                    three assistants. Two of these are to take the altitudes of the sun and moon, or
                    moon and star, at the same time that the principal observer is taking the
                    distance between the objects; and the third assistant is to observe the time,
                    and write down the observations. In order to obtain accuracy, it will be
                    necessary to observe several distances, and the corresponding altitudes, the
                    intervals of time between them being as short as possible; and the sum of each
                    divided by the number will give the mean distance and mean altitudes; from which
                    the time of observation at Greenwich is to be computed by the rules to be
                    explained.</p>
                <p>If the sun or star from which the moon’s distance is observed be at a proper
                    distance from the meridian, the time at the ship may be inferred from the
                    altitude observed at the same time with the distance. In this case the watch is
                    not necessary; but if that object be near the meridian, the watch is absolutely
                    necessary, in order to connect the observations for ascertaining the mean time
                    at the ship and at Greenwich with each other.</p>
                <p>An observer without any assistants may very easily take all the observations, by
                    first taking the altitudes of the objects, then the distance, and again their
                    altitudes, and reduce the altitudes to the time of observation of the distance;
                    or, by a single observation of the distance, the time being known from which the
                    altitudes of the bodies may be computed, the longitude may be determined.</p>
                <p>A set of observations of the distance between the moon and a star or planet, and
                    their altitudes, may be taken with accuracy during the time of the evening or
                    morning twilight; and the observer, though not much acquainted with the stars,
                    will not find it difficult to distinguish the star from which the moon’s
                    distance is to be observed. For the time of observation nearly, and the ship’s
                    longitude by account being known, the estimate time at Greenwich may be found;
                    and by entering the Nautical Almanac with the reduced time, the distance between
                    the moon and given star will be found nearly. Now set the index of the sextant
                    to this distance, and hold the plane of the instrument so as to be nearly at
                    right angles to the line joining the moon’s cusps; direct the sight to the moon,
                    and, by giving the sextant a slow vibratory motion, the axis of which being that
                    of vision, the star, which is usually one of the brightest in that part of the
                    heavens, will be seen in the transparent part of the horizon-glass.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> II.— <hi rend="italic">Of the Sextant.</hi></p>
                <p>This instrument is constructed for the express purpose of measuring with accuracy
                    the angular distance between the sun and moon, or between the moon and a planet
                    or fixed star, in order to ascertain the longitude of a place by lunar
                    observations. It is, therefore, made with more care than the quadrant, and has
                    some additional appendages that are wanting in that instrument.</p>
                <p>Fig. 40 represents the sextant, so framed as not to be liable to bend. The arch
                    AA is divided into 120 degrees; each degree is divided into three parts; each of
                    these parts, therefore, contains twenty minutes, which are again subdivided by
                    the vernier into every half minute or thirty seconds. The vernier is, numbered
                    at every fifth of the longer divisions, from the right towards the left, with 5,
                    10, 15, and 20; the first division to the right being the beginning of the
                    scale.</p>
                <p>In order to observe with accuracy, and make the images come precisely in contact,
                    an adjusting screw B is added to the index, which may thereby be moved with
                    greater accuracy than it can be by the hand; but this screw does not act until
                    the index is fixed by the finger-screw C. Care should be taken not to force the
                    adjusting screw when it arrives at either extremity of its adjustment. When the
                    index is to be moved any considerable quantity, the screw C at the back of the
                    sextant must be loosened; but when the index is brought nearly to the division
                    required, this back screw should be tightened, and then the index may be moved
                    gradually by the adjusting screw.</p>
                <p>There are four tinged glasses D, each of which is set in a separate frame that
                    turns on a centre. They are used to defend the eye from the brightness of the
                    solar image and the glare of the moon, and may be used separately or together as
                    occasion requires.</p>
                <p>There are three more such glasses placed behind the horizon-glass at E, to weaken
                    the rays of the sun or moon when they are viewed directly through the
                    horizon-glass. The paler glass is sometimes used in observing altitudes at sea,
                    to take off the strong glare of the horizon.</p>
                <p>The frame of the index-glass I is firmly fixed by a strong cock to the centre
                    plate of the index. The horizon-glass F is fixed in a frame that turns on the
                    axes or pivots, which move in an exterior frame; the holes in which the pivots
                    move may be tightened by four screws in the exterior frame. G is a screw by
                    which the horizon-glass may be set perpendicular to the plane of the instrument:
                    should this screw become loose, or move too easy, it may be easily tightened by
                    turning the capstan headed screw H, which <pb break="no"

                    of the socket through which the stern of the finger-screw passes.</p>
                <p><hi rend="superscript"> l</hi> The sextant is furnished with a plain tube without
                    any glasses; and to render the objects still more distinct, it has two
                    telescopes, one representing the objects erect, or in their natural position:
                    the longer one shows them inverted; it has a large field of view, and other
                    advantages, and a little use will soon accustom the observer to the inverted
                    position, and the instrument will be as readily managed by it as by the plain
                    tube alone. By a telescope the contact of the images is more perfectly
                    distinguished; and by the place of the images in the field of the telescope, it
                    is easy to perceive whether the sextant is held in the proper place for
                    observation. By sliding the tube that contains the eye-glasses in the inside of
                    the other tube, the object is suited to different eyes, and made to appear
                    perfectly distinct and well defined.</p>
                <p>The telescopes are to be screwed into a circular ring at K; this ring rests on
                    two points against an exterior ring, and is held thereto by two screws: by
                    turning one or other of these screws, and tightening the other, the axis of the
                    telescope may be set parallel to the plane of the sextant. The exterior ring is
                    fixed on a triangular brass stem that slides in a socket, and, by means of a
                    screw at the back of the quadrant, may be raised or lowered so as to move the
                    centre of the telescope to point to that part of the horizonglass which shall be
                    judged the most fit for observation. Tinged glasses are provided to screw on the
                    eye end of either of the telescopes or the plain tube.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Adjustments of the Sextant.</hi></p>
                <p>The adjustments of a sextant are, to set the mirrors perpendicular to its plane
                    and parallel to each other when the index is at zero, and to set the axis of the
                    telescope parallel to the plane of the instrument. The three first of these
                    adjustments are performed nearly in the same manner as directed in the section
                    on the quadrant; as, however, the sextant is provided with a set of coloured
                    glasses placed behind the horizon-glass, the index error may be more accurately
                    determined by measuring the sun’s diameter twice, with the index placed
                    alternately before and behind the beginning of the divisions; half the
                    difference of these two measures will be the index error, which must be added to
                    or subtracted from all observations, according as the diameter measured with the
                    index to the left of 0 is less or greater than the diameter measured with the
                    index to the right of the beginning of the divisions. It will be more accurate
                    to measure the sun’s horizontal diameter, as the vertical diameter is often
                    affected with refraction.</p>

                <p>Turn the eye end of the telescope until the two wires are parallel to the plane
                    of the instrument; and let two distant objects be selected, as two stars of the
                    first magnitude, whose distance is not less than 90° or I00°; make the contact
                    of these objects as perfect as possible at the wire nearest the plane of the
                    instrument; fix the index in this position; move the sextant till the objects
                    are seen at the other wire, and if the same points are in contact, the axis of
                    the telescope is parallel to the plane of the sextant; but if the objects are
                    apparently separated, or do partly cover each other, correct half the error by
                    the screws in the circular part of the supporter, one of which is above and the
                    other between the telescope and sextant; turn the adjusting screw at the end of
                    the index till the limbs are in contact; then bring the objects to the wire next
                    the instrument; and if the limbs are in contact, the axis of the telescope is
                    adjusted; if not, proceed as at the other wire, and continue till no error
                    remains.</p>
                <p>It is sometimes necessary to know the angular distance between the wires of the
                    telescope; to find which, place the wires perpendicular to the plane of the
                    sextant, hold the instrument vertical, direct the sight to the horizon, and move
                    the sextant in its own plane till the horizon and upper wire coincide; keep the
                    sextant in this position, and move the index till the reflected horizon is
                    covered by the lower wire, and the division shown by the index of the limb,
                    corrected by the index error, will be the angular distance between the wires.
                    Other and better methods will readily occur to the observer at land.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Use of the Sextant.</hi></p>
                <p>When the distance between the moon and the sun, a planet or a star, is to be
                    observed, the sextant must be held so that its plane may pass through the eye of
                    the observer and both objects; and the reflected image of the most luminous of
                    the two is to be brought in contact with the other seen directly. To effect
                    this, therefore, it is evident, that when the brightest object is to the right
                    of the other, the face of the sextant must be held upwards; but if to the left,
                    downwards. When the face of the sextant is held upwards, the instrument should
                    be supported with the right hand, and the index moved with the left hand. But
                    when the face of the sextant is from the observer, it should oe held with the
                    left hand, and the motion of the index regulated by the right hand.</p>
                <p>Sometimes a sitting posture will be found very convenient for the observer,
                    particularly when the reflected object is to the right of the direct one; in
                    this case the instrument is supported by the right hand, the elbow may rest on
                    the right knee, the right leg at the same time resting on the left knee.</p>
                <p>If the sextant is provided with a ball and socket, and a staff, one of whose ends
                    is attached thereto, and the other rests in a belt fastened round the body of
                    the observer, the greater part of the weight of the instrument will by this

                <p>Put the telescope in its place, and the wires parallel to the plane of the
                    instrument; and if the sun is very bright, raise the plate before the silvered

                    parts, according to the brightness of the sun, and turn down one of the coloured
                    glasses; then hold the sextant so that its plane produced may pass through the
                    sun and moon, having its face either upwards or downwards, according as the sun
                    is to the right or left of the moon; direct the sight through the telescope to
                    the moon, and move the index till the limb of the sun is nearly in contact with
                    the enlightened limb of the moon; now fasten the index, and by a gentle motion
                    of the instrument make the image of the sun move alternately past the moon; and,
                    when in that position where the limbs are nearest each other, make the
                    coincidence of the limbs perfect by means of the adjusting screw; this being
                    effected, read off the degrees and parts of a degree shown by the index on the
                    limb, using the magnifying glass; and thus the angular distance between the

                    may be parallel to that passing through the eye of the observer and both
                    objects; its face being upwards if the moon is to the right of the star, but if
                    to the left the face is to be held from the observer; now direct the sight
                    through the telescope to the star, and move the index till the moon appears by
                    the reflection to be near!y in contact with the star; fasten the index, and turn
                    the adjusting screw till the coincidence of the star and enlightened limb of the
                    moon is perfect; and the degrees and parts of a degree shown by the index will
                    be the observed distance between the moon’s enlightened limb and the star.</p>
                <p>The contact of the limbs must always be observed in the middle between the

                    case be found more convenient to look directly to the object, and, by moving the
                    index, to make its image coincide with that seen directly.</p>

                    of Reflection.</hi></p>
                <p>This instrument was proposed with a view to correct the errors to which the
                    sextant is liable, particularly the error arising from the inaccuracy of the
                    divisions on the limb. It consists of the following parts, a circular ring or
                    limb, two moveable indices, two mirrors, a telescope, coloured glasses,
                    &amp;c.</p>
                <p>The limb of this instrument is a complete circle of metal, and is connected with
                    a perforated central plate by six radii; it is divided into 720 degrees, each
                    degree being divided into three equal parts, and the division carried to minutes
                    by means of the index scale as usual.</p>
                <p>The two indices are moveable about the same axis, which passes exactly through
                    the centre of the instrument :—the first index carries the central mirror, and
                    the other the telescope and horizon-glass, each index being provided with an
                    adjusting screw for regulating its motion, and a scale for showing the divisions
                    on the limb.</p>
                <p>The central mirror is placed on the first index, immediately above the centre of
                    the instrument, and its plane makes an angle of about 30° with the middle line
                    of the index. The four screws in its pedestal for making its plane perpendicular
                    to that of the instrument have square heads, and are therefore easily turned
                    either way by a key for that purpose.</p>
                <p>The horizon-glass is placed on the second index near the limb, so that as few as
                    possible may be intercepted of the rays proceeding from the reflected object
                    when to the left. The perpendicular position of this glass is rectified in the
                    same manner as that of the horizon-glass of a sextant, to which it is similar.
                    It has another motion, whereby its plane may be disposed so as to make a proper
                    angle with the axis of the telescope, and a line joining its centre and that of
                    the central mirror.</p>
                <p>The telescope is attached to the other end of the index. It is an achromatic
                    astronomical one, and therefore inverts objects; it has two parallel wires in
                    the common focus of the glasses, whose angular distance is between two and three
                    degrees, and which, at the time of observation, must be placed parallel to the
                    plane of the instrument. This is easily done, by making the mark on the
                    eye-piece coincide with that on the tube. The telescope is moveable by two
                    screws in a vertical direction with regard to the plane of the instrument, but
                    is not capable of receiving a lateral motion.</p>
                <p>There are two sets of coloured glasses, each set containing four, and differing
                    in shade from each other. The glasses of the larger set, which belongs to the
                    central mirror, should have each about half the degree of shade with which the
                    correspondent glass of the set belonging to the horizon-mirror is tinged. These
                    glasses are kept tight in their places by small pressing screws, and make an
                    angle of about 85° with the plane of the instrument, by which means the image
                    from the coloured glass is not reflected to the telescope. When the angle to be
                    measured is between 5° and 34°, one of the glasses of the largest set is to be
                    placed before the horizon-glass.</p>
                <p>The handle is of wood, and is screwed to the back of the instrument,‘immediately
                    under the centre, with which it is to be held at the time of observation.</p>

                <p>CHAP. III. TO FIND THE LONGITUDE BY MEANS OF A</p>
                <p>CHRONOMETER.</p>
                <p>In order to find the longitude at sea by means of a chronometer, its daily rate
                    on mean solar or sidereal time must be established by observations made at some
                    particular place, and its error ascertained for the meridian of that or of any
                    other known place.</p>
                <p>An observatory is the most proper and convenient place for this purpose, as there
                    the rate and error may be both determined with the utmost accuracy by equal
                    altitudes, or transits over the meridian of the sun or stars. But if an
                    observatory is not adjacent, the rate and error of the chronometer may be found
                    by altitudes taken daily for several days from the horizon of the sea, or by the
                    method of reflection from an artificial horizon.</p>
                <p>If by these observations the daily rate is found to be nearly the same; that is,
                    if the chronometer gains or loses nearly the same portion of absolute time
                    daily, it may be depended on for finding the longitude; but if its rate is
                    unequal, it must be rejected, as the longitude inferred from it cannot be
                    expected to be accurate.</p>
                <p>It would be proper to have two chronometers, and that they should be wound up at
                    different stated times of the day, so that if one should be found stopt, either
                    through neglect in winding up, or otherwise, it may be set by the other,
                    observing to apply the former interval of time between them, and the change in
                    their rates of going in that interval.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Prob.</hi> To find the longitude of a ship at sea by a
                    chronometer.</p>
                <p>Let several altitudes of the sun, or of any fixed star or planet, be observed,
                    and find the true mean altitude; with which, the ship’s latitude, and object’s
                    declination, compute the mean time of observation.</p>
                <p>To the mean of the times of observation, as shown by the chronometer, apply its
                    error and accumulated rate. Hence the mean time under the meridian of the place
                    where the error and rate were established will be known; to which apply the
                    difference of longitude in time between that place and Greenwich, and the mean
                    time of observation under the meridian of Greenwich will be obtained. The
                    difference between the time at the place of observation and that at Greenwich
                    will be the longitude of the ship in time; and it is east or west, according as
                    the time, by observation, is later or earlier than the Greenwich time.</p>

                <p>For various other methods of determining the longitude of a place, the reader is
                    referred to Mackay’s Treatise on the Longitude, Inman’s, Riddle’s, and Norie’s
                    Treatises on Navigation; Mendoza Rios’s and Thomson’s Tables, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>CHAP. IV.—OF THE VARIATION OF THE COMPASS.</p>
                <p>The variation of the compass is the deviation of the points of the mariner’s
                    compass from the corresponding points of the horizon, and is denominated <hi
                    rend="italic">east</hi> or <hi rend="italic">west</hi> variation, according as
                    the north point of the compass is to the east or west of the true north point of
                    the horizon.</p>
                <p>A particular account of the variation, and of the several instruments used for
                    determining it from observation, may be seen under the articles <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Azimuth, Compass,</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Variation</hi>;
                    and for the method of communicating magnetism to compass needles, see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Magnetism.</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Prob.</hi> I. Given the
                    latitude of a place, and the sun’s magnetic amplitude, to find the variation of

                    sine of the sun’s declination, the sun will be the log. cosine of the true
                    amplitude; to be reckoned from the north or south, according as the declination
                    is north or south.</p>
                <p>The difference between the true and observed amplitudes, reckoned from the same
                    point, and if of the same name, is the variation; but if of a different name,
                    their sum is the variation.</p>
                <p>If the observation be made before noon, the variation will be east or west,
                    according as the observed amplitude is nearer to or more remote from the north
                    than the true amplitude. The contrary rule holds good in observations taken
                    after noon.</p>

                <p>CHAP. V.—OF A <hi rend="smallcaps">ship’s</hi> JOURNAL.</p>
                <p>A journal is a regular and exact register of all the various transactions that
                    happen aboard a ship, whether at sea or land, and more particularly that which
                    concerns a ship’s way, from whence her place at noon or any other time may be
                    justly ascertained.</p>
                <p>That part of the account which is kept at sea is called <hi rend="italic">sea
                    work</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and the remarks taken down while the ship is
                    in port are called <hi rend="italic">harbour work.</hi></p>
                <p>At sea, the day begins at noon, and ends at the noon of the following day; the
                    first twelve hours, or those contained between noon and midnight, are denoted by
                    p. <hi rend="smallcaps">μ.,</hi> signifying <hi rend="italic">after
                    mid-day</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and the other twelve hours, or those from
                    midnight to noon, are denoted by <hi rend="smallcaps">a. μ.,</hi> signifying <hi
                    rend="italic">before mid-day.</hi> A day’s work marked Wednesday, March 6, began
                    on Tuesday at noon, and ended on Wednesday at noon. The days of the week are
                    usually represented by astronomical characters. Thus 0 represents Sunday; J ,
                    Monday; $ , Tuesday; ÿ , Wednesday; 1∫, Thursday; $, Friday; and ¾,
                    Saturday.</p>
                <p>When a ship is bound to a port so situated that she will be out of sight of land,
                    the bearing and distance of the port must be found. This may be done by
                    Mercator’s or Middle Latitude Sailing; but the most expeditious method is by a
                    chart. If islands, capes, or headlands intervene, it will be necessary to find
                    the several courses and distances between each successively. The true course
                    between the places must be reduced to the course per compass, by allowing the
                    variation to the right or left of the true course, according as it is west or
                    east.</p>
                <p>At the time of leaving the land, the bearing of some known place is to be
                    observed, and its distance is usually found by estimation. As perhaps the
                    distance thus found will be liable to some error, particularly in hazy or foggy
                    weather, or when that distance is considerable, it will therefore be proper to
                    use the following method for this purpose.</p>
                <p>Let the bearing be observed of the place from which the departure is to be taken;
                    and the ship having run a certain distance on a direct course, the bearing of
                    the same place is to be again observed. Now, having one side of a plain
                    triangle, namely, the distance sailed, and all the angles, the other distances
                    may be found by Prob. I. of Oblique Sailing.</p>
                <p>The method of finding tlιe course and distance sailed in a given time is by the
                    compass, the log-line, and halfminute glass. These have been already described.
                    In the royal navy, and in ships in the service of the East India Company, the
                    log is hove once every hour; but in most other trading vessels only every two
                    hours.</p>
                <p>The several courses and distances sailed in the course of twenty-four hours, or
                    between noon and noon, and whatever remarks are thought worthy of notice, are
                    set down with chalk on a board painted black, called the <hi rend="italic"
                    >log-board,</hi> which is usually divided into six columns; the first column on
                    the left hand contains the hours from noon to noon; the second and third the
                    knots and parts of a knot sailed every hour, or every two hours, according as
                    the log is marked; the fourth column contains the courses steered; the fifth,
                    the winds; and in the sixth the various remarks and phenomena are written. The
                    log-board is transcribed every day at noon into the log-book, which is ruled and
                    divided after the same manner.</p>
                <p>The courses steered must be corrected by the variation of the compass and leeway.
                    If the variation is west, it must be allowed to the left hand of the course
                    steered; but if east, to the right hand, in order to obtain the true course. The
                    leeway is to be allowed to the right or left of the course steered, according as
                    the ship is on the larboard or starboard tack. The method of finding the
                    va-nation<pb break="no" facs="nls:193829492?mode=fullsize"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0715-9492-0791"/>, which should be determined daily if possible, is
                    given in the preceding chapter; and the leeway may be understood from what
                    follows.</p>
                <p>When a ship is close hauled, that part of the wind which acts upon the hull and
                    rigging, together with a considerable part of the force which is exerted on the
                    sails, tends to drive her to the leeward. But since the bow of a ship exposes
                    less surface to the water than her side, the resistance will be less in the
                    first case than in the second; the velocity in the direction of her head will
                    therefore in most cases be greater than the velocity in the direction of her
                    side; and the ship’s real course will be between the two directions. The angle
                    formed between the line of her apparent course and the line she really describes
                    through the water is called the <hi rend="italic">angle of leeway,</hi> or
                    simply the <hi rend="italic">leeway.</hi></p>
                <p>There are many circumstances which prevent the laying down rules for the
                    allowance of leeway. The construction of different vessels, their trim with
                    regard to the nature and quantity of their cargo, the position and magnitude of
                    the sail set, and the velocity of the ship, together with the swell of the sea,
                    are all susceptible of great variation, and very much affect the leeway. The
                    following rules, are, however, usually given for this purpose.</p>
                <p>1. When a ship is close hauled, has all her sails set, the water smooth, with a
                    light breeze of wind, she is then supposed to make little or no leeway.</p>
                <p>2. Allow one point when the top-gallant sails are handed.</p>
                <p>3. Allow two points when under close reefed top-sails.</p>
                <p>4. Allow two points and a half when one top-sail is handed.</p>
                <p>5. Allow three points and a half when both top-sails are handed.</p>
                <p>6. Allow four points when the fore course is handed.</p>
                <p>7. Allow five points when under the main-sail only.</p>
                <p>8. Allow six points when under balanced mizen.</p>
                <p>9. Allow seven points when under bare poles.</p>
                <p>These allowances may be of some use to work up the day’s work of a journal which
                    has been neglected; but a prudent navigator will never be guilty of this
                    neglect. A very good method of estimating the leeway is to observe the bearing
                    of the ship’s wake as frequently as may be judged necessary; which may be
                    conveniently enough done by drawing a small semicircle on the tafferel, with its
                    diameter at right angles to the ship’s length, and dividing its circumference
                    into points and quarters. The angle contained between the semidiameter which
                    points right aft, and that which points in the direction of the wake, is the
                    leeway. But the best and most rational way of bringing the leeway into the day’s
                    log is to have a compass or semicircle on the tafferel, as before described,
                    with a low crutch or swivel in its centre; after heaving the log, the line may
                    be slipped into the crutch just before it is drawn in, and the angle it makes on
                    the limb with the line drawn right aft will show the leeway very accurately,
                    which, as a necessary article, ought to be entered into a separate column
                    against the hourly distance on the log-board.</p>
                <p>In hard blowing weather, with a contrary wind and a high sea, it is impossible to
                    gain any advantage by sailing. In such cases, therefore, the object is to avoid
                    as much as possible being driven back. With this intention it is usual to lie to
                    under no more sail than is sufficient to prevent the violent rolling which the
                    vessel would otherwise acquire, to the endangering her masts, and straining her
                    timbers, &amp;c. When a ship is brought to, the tiller is put close over to the
                    leeward, which brings her head round to the wind. The wind having then very
                    little power on the sails, the ship loses her way through the water; which
                    ceasing to act on the rudder, her head falls off from the wind, the sail which
                    she has set fills, and gives her fresh way through the water, which, acting on
                    the rudder, brings her head again to the wind. Thus the ship has a kind of
                    vibratory motion, coming up to the wind and falling off from it again
                    alternately. Now the middle point between those upon which she comes up and
                    falls off is taken for her apparent course; and the leeway and variation is to
                    be allowed from thence, to find the true course.</p>
                <p>The setting and drift of currents, and the heave of the sea, are to be marked
                    down. These are to be corrected by variation only.</p>
                <p>The computation made from the several courses, corrected as above, and their
                    corresponding distances, is called a <hi rend="italic">day's work</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> and the ship’s place, as deduced therefrom, is called her

                <p>It is almost constantly found that the latitude by account does not agree with
                    that by observation. From an attentive consideration of the nature and form of
                    the common log, that its place is alterable by the weight of the line, by
                    currents, and other causes, and also the errors to which the course is liable,
                    from the very often wrong position of the compass in the binnacle, the variation
                    not being well ascertained, an exact agreement of the latitudes cannot be
                    expected.</p>
                <p>When the difference of longitude is tobe found by dead reckoning, if then the
                    latitudes by account and observation disagree, several writers on navigation
                    have proposed to apply a conjectural correction to the departure or difference
                    of longitude. Thus, if the course be near the meridian, the error is wholly
                    attributed to the distance, and the departure is to be increased or diminished
                    accordingly; if near the parallel, the course only is supposed to be erroneous;
                    and if the course is towards the middle of the quadrant, the course and distance
                    are both assumed wrong. This last correction will, according to different
                    authors, place the ship upon opposite sides of her meridian by account. As these
                    corrections are, therefore, no better than guessing, they should be absolutely
                    rejected.</p>
                <p>If the latitudes are not found to agree, the navigator ought to examine his
                    log-line and half-minute glass, and correct the distance accordingly. He is then
                    to consider if the variation and leeway have been properly ascertained; if not,
                    the courses are to be again corrected, and no other alteration whatever is to be
                    made on them. He is next to observe if the ship’s place has been affected by a
                    current or heave of the sea, and to allow for them according to the best of his
                    judgment. By applying these corrections, the latitudes will generally be found
                    to agree tolerably well; and the longitude is not to receive any farther
                    alteration.</p>
                <p>It will be proper, however, for the navigator to determine the longitude of the
                    ship from observation as often as possible; and the reckoning is to be carried
                    forward in the usual manner from the last good observation; yet it will perhaps
                    be very satisfactory to keep a separate account of the longitude by dead
                    reckoning.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">General Rules for working a Day's Work.</hi></p>
                <p>Correct the several courses for variation and leeway; place them, and the
                    corresponding distances, in a table prepared for that purpose. From whence, by
                    Traverse Sailing, find the difference of latitude and departure made good; hence
                    the corresponding course and distance, and the ship’s present latitude, will be
                    known.</p>
                <p>Find the middle latitude at the top or bottom of the traverse table, and the
                    distance, answering to the departure found in a latitude column, will be the
                    difference of longitude; or, the departure answering to the course made good,
                    and the meridional difference of latitude in a latitude column, is the
                    difference of longitude; the sum or difference of which, and the longitude left,
                    according as they are of the same or of a contrary name, will be the ship’s
                    present longitude of the same name with the greater.</p>

                <p>Compute the difference of latitude between the ship and the intended port, or any
                    other place whose bearing and distance may be required: find also the meridional
                    difference of latitude and the difference of longitude. Now the course answering
                    the meridional difference of latitude found in a latitude column, and the
                    difference of longitude in a departure column, will be the bearing of the place,
                    and the distance answering to the difference of latitude will be the distance of
                    the ship from the proposed place. If these numbers exceed the limits of the
                    table, it will be necessary to take aliquot parts of them; and the distance is
                    to be multiplied by the number by which the difference of latitude is
                    divided.</p>
                <p>It will sometimes be necessary to keep an account of the meridian distance,
                    especially in the Baltic or Mediterranean trade, where charts are used in which
                    the longitude is not marked. The meridian distance on the first day is that
                    day’s departure; and any other day it is equal to the sum or difference of the
                    preceding day’s meridian distance and the day’s departure, according as they are
                    of the same or of a contrary denomination.</p>
                <p>It will be found very satisfactory to lay down the ship’s place on a chart at the
                    noon of each day, and her situation with respect to the place bound to and the
                    nearest land will be obvious. The bearing and distance of the intended or any
                    other port, and other requisites, may be easily found by the chart, as already
                    explained; and indeed every day’s work may be performed on the chart, and thus
                    the use of tables superseded.</p>
                <p>Specimens of a ship’s journal may be found in the works on navigation already
                    mentioned. The reader is also referred to these works for the traverse table,
                    and tables of meridional parts, log. rising, middle time, half elapsed time,
                    logarithmic difference, &amp;c. which have been employed in the solution of the
                    various problems.</p>
