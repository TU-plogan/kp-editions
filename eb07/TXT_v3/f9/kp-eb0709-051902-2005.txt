FERMENTATION may be defined a sensible internal motion of the constituent particles of a fluid, mixed, or compound, body; by the continuance of which motion ese particles are gradually removed from their former si- ι mtion or combination, and again, after some visible separation is made, combined together in a different order and arrangement, so that a new compound is formed, having qualities very sensibly differing from those of the original - fluid. See Brewing and Chemistry.
