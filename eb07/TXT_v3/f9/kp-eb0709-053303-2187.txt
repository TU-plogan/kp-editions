FIBRE, in Anatomy, a perfectly simple body, or at least as simple as any thing in the human structure, being fine and slender like a thread, and serving to knit together or connect other parts.

Fibre is also used to denote one of the slender filaments which compose bodies, whether animal, vegetable, or mineral, but more especially a capillary root of plants.
