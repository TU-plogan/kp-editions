FAUNALIA, in Antiquity, Roman feasts celebrated in onour of the god Faunus, who was the same amongst the omans as Pan amongst the Greeks.

The Faunalia were held on the day of the nones of December, or on the fifth day of that month. The principal sacrifice was a roebuck, or rather, according to Horace, a id, attended with libations of wine and the burning of incense. It was properly a country festival, being performed in the fields and villages with peculiar joy and devotion, btruvius in his Roman kalendar marks the feast of Faunus on the day of he ides of February; and the Faunalia he places on the fifth of the ides of December, or the 9th of that month. He also show’s, that there really were two Faunalia; the one in February, mentioned by Ovid {Fast. lib. iy. ver. 246), and the other on the 9th of December, mentioned by Horace in the eighteenth ode of his third book.
