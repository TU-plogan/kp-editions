FIBULA, in Anatomy, is the outer and smaller of the bones of the leg. See Anatomy.

Fibula, in Antiquity, a sort of button, buckle, or clasp, made use of by the Greeks and Romans for keeping close or fastening together certain parts of their clothes. The fibulae were of various forms, and often adorned with precious stones. Both men and women wore them in their air and on their shoes. Players and musicians, by way of preserving the voices of children placed under their care to learn their art, used to compress the prepuce with a fibula, lest they should have commerce with women.
