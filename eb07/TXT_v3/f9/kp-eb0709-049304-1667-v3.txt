FAT, an oily concrete substance, deposited in different parts of animal bodies.

Fat, in nautical language, signifies the same with broad. Thus a ship is said to have a fat quarter, if the trussing in or tuck of her quarter be deep.
[7:9:494]

Fat likewise denotes an uncertain measure of capacity. Thus a fat of isinglass contains from three and a fourth hundredweight to four hundredweight; a fat of unbound books, half a maund or four bales; of wire, from twenty to twenty-five hundredweight; and of yarn, from 220 to 221 bundles.

Fat, or Vat, is also applied to several utensils; as, a great wooden vessel, employed for measuring of malt, and containing a quarter or eight bushels; a large brewing vessel, used by brewers to run their wort in; and a leaden pan or vessel for making salt at Droitwich.
