FORTIFIED Island, an island in the Indian Seas, lying off the coast of Canara, about a mile from the land, a little way north from the entrance into Lake Onore. The island abounds in cocoa-nut, palms, and plantain trees, and has plenty of fresh water. It produces the best sort of cari, which is used by the natives in painting their houses. Its name is derived from its fortifications, which were greatly strengthened by Tippoo Saib, from whom it was taken in 1792, by three British frigates. It is upwards of a mile in circuit. Long. 74. 27. E. Lat. 14. 16. N.
