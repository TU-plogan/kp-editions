FOULA, or Fowla Island, one of the Zetland Isles, lying between six and seven leagues west from the mair land. It is about three miles in length, narrow, and full ol rough, steep, and bare rocks; one of which is so large, and runs up to such a height, that it may be clearly seen from Orkney. This solitary isle, it has been conjectured, is the Thule of Tacitus. It is pastoral, and maintains a few families.
