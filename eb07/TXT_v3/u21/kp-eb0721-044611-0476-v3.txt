ULLAPOOL, a fishing village situate on the north shore of Loch Broom, in Ross-shire. It possesses an excellent harbour and quay; but the buildings, and, it must be added, the population, are quite disproportionate to the present state of its trade and fisheries. In the article Ross-shire, the quantity of fish caught and cured here since 1830 is stated. The population amounts to 500 or 600.
