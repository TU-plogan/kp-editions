UBRIQUE, a city of Spain, of the province of Andalusia, in the western part of the government of Granada, between the Sierra of the Alpuraxis and that of Antequera, in a most picturesque country. It is nestled in the bottom of a deep valley, hemmed in by singularly rugged mountains. The valley is pierced by two streams, which are conducted to the town, and form, the river Majaceite, and fertilize a belt of ground around the city, of most luxuriant vegetation. The streets are wide, clean, and well paved, the houses lofty and good, but with scarcely any furniture. The population is estimated at 8000 souls. They have some tanneries, and manufacture some hats and coarse cloth. In the neighbourhood are some mines of copper, which were formerly worked, but have for many years been abandoned.
