BRANK, an instrument formerly used in some parts of Scotland, and in Staffordshire, for correcting scolding women. It was a sort of head-piece, which opened and inclosed the head of the shrew, while an iron, sharp as a chisel, entered the mouth, and subdued the unruly member within. Thus harnessed, the offender was led in triumph through the streets. Dr Plott, in his History of Staffordshire, has favoured the world with a minute description and figure of the instrument, which is there called a scolding-bridle; and he assures us that he looks upon it “as much to be preferred to the ducking-stool, which not only endangers the health of the party, but also gives the tongue liberty betwixt every dip; to neither of which (he adds) this is at all liable.”
