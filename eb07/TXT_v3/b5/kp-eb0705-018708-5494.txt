BRAY, Sir Reginald, an architect and politician, was the second son of Sir Richard Bray, one of the privy council to King Henry VI. Sir Reginald was instrumental in the advancement of King Henry VII. to the throne of England, and was greatly in favour with that prince, who bestowed honours and wealth upon him. His skill in architecture appears from Henry VII.'s chapel at Westminster, and the chapel of St George at Windsor; he had a principal concern and direction in building the former, and in finishing and bringing to perfection the latter, to which he was also a liberal benefactor. He died in 1501, and was interred in the above chapel, probably under the stone where Dr Waterland lies; for, on opening the vault to admit the body of that gentleman, who died in 1740, a leaden coffin of ancient form was found, which, by other appearances, was judged to be that of Sir Reginald, and was, by order of the dean, immediately arched over.

Bray, Br Thomas, a learned and pious divine, was born at Marton, in Shropshire, in the year 1656, and educated at Oxford. He was at length presented to the vicarage of Over-Whitacre, in Warwickshire; and in 1690 he obtained the rectory of Sheldon, where he composed his Catechetical Lectures. These procured him such reputation, that Dr Compton, bishop of London, pitched upon him as a proper person to model the infant church of Maryland, and establish it upon a solid foundation; and for that purpose he was invested with the office of commissary. He now engaged in several important undertakings. He caused sums to be raised for purchasing small libraries for the use of the poor ministers in the several parts of our plantations; and the better to promote this design, he published two books. One of these is entitled Bibliotheca Parochialis, or a scheme of such theological and other heads as seem requisite to be perused or [7:5:188]occasionally consulted by the clergy, together with a catalogue of books which may be profitably read on each of those points; the other, Apostolical Charity, its nature and excellency considered. He endeavoured to get a fund established for the propagation of the gospel, especially among the uncultivated Indians; and by his means a patent was obtained for erecting the corporation called The Society for the Propagation of the Gospel. By his industry he also procured relief for prisoners, and formed the plan of the society for the reformation of manners, charity schools, and other like purposes. He wrote Martyrology, or Papal Usurpation, in one volume, folio; Directorium Missionarium; and other works. Dr Bray died in 1730, aged seventy-three.
