BUC, George, a learned English antiquary, flourished in the beginning of the seventeenth century. In the reign of King James I. he was made one of the gentlemen of his majesty’s privy chamber, and knighted; he was also constituted master of the revels. What he mostly distinguished himself by was his writing the History of the Reign of Richard III.; in which he takes great pains to wipe off the bloody stains which have tarnished the character of that prince, and represents his person and actions in a much less odious light than any other historian has done. He also wrote, a Treatise of the Art of Revels; and a work entitled the Third Universitie of England.
