BURIATS, Buraty, or Bratsky, a tribe of Tartars, now brought under the jurisdiction of Russia, and widely dispersed throughout Siberia, in the government of Irkutsk, wherein their numbers are computed from the capitation tax at about sixty thousand. Their features are of a genuine Tartar cast, resembling those of the Kalmucks, though they are not quite so flat, the nose being somewhat higher, and the countenance more open. They themselves trace their origin to the Kalmucks, and not to the Moguls. They are entirely pastoral in their habits, and depend for their subsistence chiefly on their flocks. The principal occupations of the men are riding and hunting; and they are dexterous archers as well as skilful horsemen. They are esteemed honest and sincere, and both sexes are extremely courteous. They are very ignorant, and debased by the grossest paganism. The residence of this tribe is chiefly around the banks of the lake Baikal, and those of the rivers Angora and Lena.
