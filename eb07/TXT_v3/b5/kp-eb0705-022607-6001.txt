BREH AR, one of the Scilly Islands, lying almost, directly west of the Land’s End in Cornwall, about the distance of thirty miles. It is situated between the isles of Micarol, Guel, Trescaw, and Samson, and is the roughest and most mountainous of them all. Not long ago there were only two families on it, but now the number has considerably increased. There are a few miserable houses, called the town of Brehar; and also several barrows edged with stone, in which considerable persons were burned in ancient times; besides many monuments of the Druids. Some are of opinion that this, with the rest, originally made but one island; which is probably the reason why so many antiquities are now found in most of them.
