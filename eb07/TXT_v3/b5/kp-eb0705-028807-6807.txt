BRIM denotes the utmost verge or edge, especially of round things. The brims of vessels are made to projecta little over, to prevent liquors, when poured out, from running down the side of the vessel. The brimming of vessels was contrived by the ancient potters, in imitation of the supercilium or clip of the cornices of columns.
