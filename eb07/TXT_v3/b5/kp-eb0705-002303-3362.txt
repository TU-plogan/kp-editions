BOSPHORUS, or Bosporus, in Geography, a long and narrow channel running in between two lands, or separating two continents, and by which two seas, or a gulf and a sea, communicate with each other. In this sense Bosphorus means a channel or strait, and is synonymous with what the Italians call faro, the Latins fretum, and the French pas or manche. The word is Greek, /?o<jwopoç, being formed of βοvς, an ox, and crooος, passage, probably from an idea that an ox or bullock might swim across.

The name of Bosphorus is chiefly confined to two straits, namely, the Bosphorus of Thrace, commonly called the Strait of Constantinople, or Channel of the Black Sea; and the Cimmerian or Seythian Bosphorus, now known by the name of the Strait of Jenikale. The origin of the name is not disputed; but various mythological legends, some of them absurd enough, were invented to account for its first application.
