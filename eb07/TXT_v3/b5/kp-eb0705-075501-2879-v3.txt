He died of the plague at Basel in 1629, aged sixty-five. His principal works are, 1. A small but excellent Hebrew Grammar, the best edition of which is that of Leyden in 1701, revised by Leusden; 2. A treasure of the Hebrew Grammar; 3. A Hebrew Concordance, and several Hebrew Lexicos; 4. Institutio epistolaris Hebraica ; 5. De Abbreviaturis Hebraeorum, &c.

Buxtorf, John, the son of the former, and a learned professor of the oriental languages at Basel, distinguished himself, like his father, by his knowledge of the Hebrew language, and his rabbinical learning. He died at Basel in 1664, aged sixty-five years. His principal works are, L His translation of the More Nevochim and the Cozri ; 2. A Chaldee and Syriac Lexico; 3. An Anti-critique against Cappel; 4. A treatise on the Hebrew Points and Accents, against the same Cappel.
