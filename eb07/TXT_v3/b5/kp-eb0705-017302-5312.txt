BRADS, among artificers, a kind of nails used in building, which have no spreading heads as other nails have. They are distinguished among ironmongers by six names; as joiners -brads, flooring-brads, batten-brads, bill-brads, quarter-heads, and the like. Joiners’-brads are for hard wainscot; batten-brads are for soft wainscot; bill-brads are used when a floor is laid in haste, or for shallow joists subject to warp.
