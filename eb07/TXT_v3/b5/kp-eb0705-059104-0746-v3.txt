BROSSARD, Sebastian de, an eminent French musician. In the early part of his life he had been prebendary and chapel-master of the cathedral church of Strasburg, but afterwards became grand chaplain and also maitre de chapelle in the cathedral of Meaux. There is extant of his a work entitled Prodromus Musicalis, in two volumes folio. He was also author of a very useful book entitled Dictionnaire de Musique, printed at Amsterdam, in folio, 1703; and afterwards at the same place in octavo, without a date. At the end of this book is a catalogue of authors ancient and modern, to the amount of nine hundred, who have written on musie, divided into classes; wherein are interspersed many curious observations of the author relating to the history of musie. From Μ. Boivin’s Catalogue General des Livres de Musique for the year 1729, it appears that Brossard was the author of two sets of motets, as also of nine Leçons de Tenebres, therein mentioned. It seems that these several publications were made at a time when the author was far advanced in years; for Walther takes notice that in the Mercure Galante he is mentioned as an abbé and componist as early as the year 1678. He died on the 10th August 1730, aged upwards of seventy.
