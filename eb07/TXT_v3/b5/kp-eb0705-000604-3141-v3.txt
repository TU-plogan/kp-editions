BORKUM, an island of Hanover, on the coast of East Friesland, situated between the mouths of the East and West Ems, and included in the bailiwick of Grutsiel. It [7:5:7]is about twelve miles in circumference, and so low in the middle that it is separated into two parts at high water. A considerable proportion of the inhabitants consists of seafaring people, and the remainder draw their support from the rearing of cattle, or in picking up the fragments of vessels wrecked on their coast. It has a governor, a minister of the Calvinistic faith, and a schoolmaster.
