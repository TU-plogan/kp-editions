BRIDPORT, a borough and market-town in the hundred of Beaminster and county of Dorset, 134 miles from London, on the river Brit, which is divided into two branches, one of them passing at the east, the other at the west end of the town. The manufacturing industry here is very great, producing sail-cloth, twine, nets, ropes, and other requisites for the Newfoundland fishery. The harbour is small and almost choked, but some vessels are built celebrated for their fast sailing. The streets are wide and well paved, and where the four cross streets meet is a handsome town-hall. It returns two members to parliament, chosen by the inhabitant householders. There is a good market on Saturday. The population amounted in 1801 to 3117, in 1811 to 3666, and in 1821 to 3742.
