BOXERS, a kind of athlerae, who combat or contend for victory with their fists. Boxers are the same as the pugiles among the Romans. The ancient boxers battled with great force and fury, so as to dash out each other’s teeth, break bones, and sometimes to kill each other. The disfigurements which the boxers underwent were such that they frequently could not be known, and were thus rendered the subject of many railleries. In the Greek Anthology there are four epigrams of the poet Lucilius, and one of Lucian, in which their disfigurements are pleasantly enough exposed.
