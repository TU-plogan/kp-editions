BZOVIUS, Abraham, one of the most celebrated writers[7:5:762] in the seventeenth century, in as far as respects the number of pieces composed by him. His chief work is the continuation of Baronius’s Annals. He was a native of Poland, and a Dominican friar. Upon his arrival at Rome he was received with open arms by the Pope, and had an apartment assigned him in the Vatican. He merited that reception, for he has imitated Baronius to admiration, in his design of making all things conspire to enhance the power and glory of the papal see. He died in 1630, aged seventy.
