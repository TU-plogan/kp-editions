BURGGRAVE properly denotes the hereditary governor of a castle or fortified town, chiefly in Germany. The word is compounded of bourg, town, and graf or grave, count. The burggraves were originally the same with what is otherwise called castellans or comites castellani ; but their dignity was considerably advanced under Rodolph of Hapsburg. Before his time they were ranked only as counts, and below the princes, but under him they began to be esteemed as on a footing with princes. In some parts the dignity has much degenerated.
