BOTTOMRY, feenus nauticum, is a term applied to that particular kind of transaction where a person lends money to a merchant, who wants it to traffic, and is to be paid a greater sum at the return of a certain ship, standing to the hazard of the voyage; and, in this case, although the interest be greater than that allowed by law, it is not usury.
