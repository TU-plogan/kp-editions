CORNARISTS, in ecclesiastical history, the disciples of Theodore Cornhert, an enthusiastic secretary of the states of Holland, who wrote at the same time against the Catholics, Lutherans, and Calvinists. He maintained that every religious communion needed reformation; but he added, that no person had a right to engage in accomplishing it without a mission supported by miracles. He was also of opinion that a person might be a good Christian without being a member of any visible church.
