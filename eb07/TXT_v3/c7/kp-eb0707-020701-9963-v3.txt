CONDITIONAL, something not absolute, but subject to conditions.

Conditional Conjunctions, in Grammar, are those which serve to make propositions conditional; as if, unless, provided, and so forth.

Conditional Propositions, in Logic, such as consist of two parts connected together by a conditional particle.

Conditional Syllogism, a syllogism where the major is a conditional proposition. Thus,

If there is a God, he ought to be worshipped.

But there is a God; Therefore he ought to be worshipped.
