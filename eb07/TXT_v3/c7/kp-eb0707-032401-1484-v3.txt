CORDUS, Valerius, a learned botanist, was the son of Ericius Cordus, a physician and poet of Germany. Having learned the languages, he applied himself to the study of botany, in the prosecution of which he examined the mountains of Germany, and travelled into Italy; but being wounded in the leg by the kick of a horse, he died at Rome in 1554. He wrote Remarks on Dioscorides, and other works.
