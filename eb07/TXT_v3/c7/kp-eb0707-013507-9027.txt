COMBAT, in a general sense, denotes an engagement, or a difference decided by arms.

Combat, in our ancient law, was a formal trial of some doubtful cause or quarrel, by the swords or bastons of two champions. This form of proceeding was very frequent, not only in criminal, but in civil causes; being founded on a supposition that God would never grant the victory but to him who had the best right. See Battle.
