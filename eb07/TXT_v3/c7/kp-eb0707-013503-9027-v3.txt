COLURI, a little island in the Gulf of Engia, in the Archipelago, formerly called Salamis. The principal town is of the same name, and situated to the south side, at the bottom of the harbour, which is one of the finest in the world. The famous Grecian hero Ajax, who makes such a figure in Homer’s Iliad, was king of this island. It is now, however, but a poor place, its commodities consisting of wheat, barley, tar, rosin, pit-coal, sponges, and potashes, which they carry to Athens. It is seven miles south from Athens, and is separated from the continent by a strait about a mile in breadth.
