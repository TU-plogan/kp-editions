COLANGODU, a town of Hindustan, in the southeastern division of the Malabar province. This town has a resemblance to many of the villages in Bengal, though the houses are in their structure quite different, each being surrounded with a small garden, while at a little distance nothing is to be seen except a large grove of trees. The town contains about a thousand houses, many of which are inhabited by Tamul weavers, who import all their cotton from Coimbetoor. Colangodu is surrounded by a beautiful country. The high mountains on the south pour down cascades of prodigious height; and the corn fields are intermixed with lofty forests and plantations of fruit trees. The cultivation is, however, but poor. Most of the dry field is neglected, and the quantity of rice land is not great. One crop of rice is brought to maturity by the rains, and in some places the natives have constructed reservoirs, which enable them to have a second crop. Long. 76. 49. E. Lat. 10. 42. N.
