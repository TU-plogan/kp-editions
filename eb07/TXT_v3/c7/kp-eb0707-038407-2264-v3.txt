COTE-CAUNGRA, a strong fortress of Hindustan, in the province of Lahore, which was taken by the Emperor Acbar after a year’s siege. In the neighbourhood is the celebrated temple of Nagur Cote, which continued to retain its reputation for sanctity many years after the country was invaded by the Mahommedans. It is 122 miles E.N.E. from the city of Lahore. Long. 75. 42. E. Lat. 32. 20. N.

Cote d’ Or, a department of France, formed out of the countries Montagne, Auxois, and Dijonais, parts of the ancient kingdom of Burgundy. It is bounded on the north by the departments of the Aube and the Upper IMarne, on the east by the Upper Saone and Jura, on the south [7:7:385]by the Saone-Loire, and on the west by the Nièvre and the Yonne. It extends over 3635 square miles, and the inhabitants amount to 354-,436 persons. The divisions are into four arrondissements, thirty-six cantons, and 733 communes. It may be called a hilly, but scarcely a mountainous district. A range of hills runs from within two miles of Dijon to the river Dheune, which, from its richness in the most excellent wine, has given the name to the department. The soil is generally good, producing the best of wheat and other grain, and affording admirable pasture. It is a well-watered province, containing many rivers, none of which, except the Saone, is navigable, but all assist in fertilizing the land. No branch of husbandry, however, is equal in extent to the cultivation of the vines, which yield the several varieties of Burgundy wine. As one fourth of the department is covered with woods, the proprietors gain much from other districts in which fuel is scarce. The chief products are wine, corn, maize, flax, hemp, honey, wax, and sheep’s wool. There are some iron mines, which give occupation to about 10,000 workmen, and yield about 20,000 tons of that metal yearly. Some ironmongery and cutlery goods are manufactured; and also some linen and woollen cloths, chiefly for domestic use.
