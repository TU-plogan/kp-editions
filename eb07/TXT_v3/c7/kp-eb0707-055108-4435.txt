CURRAH, a district of Hindustan, in the province of Allahabad. It has a fertile soil, which, when well watered, yields all sorts of grain, also sugar-cane, cotton, tobacco, and a species of earth impregnated with alkali, which is used as soap. Its capital is of the same name; it is situated on the south-western bank of the Ganges, and extends above a mile on the bank of the river, and about half a mile inland. On the banks of the Ganges, and in the middle of the town, stands an old fort, in the vicinity of which are several Hindu temples. ’The governor of the province formerly resided at Currah; but being removed by the Emperor Acbar, the town has since decayed. It is forty-five miles north-west from Allahabad. Long. 81. 24. E. Lat. 25. 4L N.
