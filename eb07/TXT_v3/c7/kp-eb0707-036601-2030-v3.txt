CORNELIA, daughter of Scipio Africanus, was the mother of Tiberius and Caius Gracchus. She was courted by a king, but she preferred being the wife of a Roman citizen to that of a monarch. Iler virtues have been deservedly commended, as well as the wholesome principles which she inculcated on her two sons. When a Campanian lady once made a show of her jewels at Cornelia’s house, and entreated the latter to favour her with a sight of her own, Cornelia produced her two sons, saying, “These are the only jewels of which I can boast.”
