COLAIR Lake, a lake of Hindustan, to the south of Ellore, in the Northern Circars, which is formed by the overflowings of the Krishna and Godavery, and extends forty-seven miles in length from west to east, and fourteen in breadth from north to south. During the rainy season the whole of this space is overspread with water, excepting sixty or seventy islets, in which the inhabitants remain; but during the remainder of the year the whole is dry, and in many places well cultivated. The waters of this lake are distributed in many channels over the adjacent country.
