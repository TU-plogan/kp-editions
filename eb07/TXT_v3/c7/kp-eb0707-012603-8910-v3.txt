COLOSSUS, a statue of enormous or gigantic size. The most eminent specimen of this kind was the Colossus of Rhodes, a statue of Apollo, so high that ships passed with full sails betwixt its legs. It was the workmanship of Chares, a disciple of Lysippus, who spent twelve years in making it. But it was at length overthrown by an earthquake, after having stood 1360 years. Its height was six score and six feet; and there were few people who could fathom its thumb. When the Saracens became possessed [7:7:127]of the island, the statue was found prostiate on the ground; and they sold it to a Jew, who loaded nine hundred camels with the brass. The basis which supported it was a triangular figure; and its extremities were sustained by sixty pillars of marble. There was a winding staircase to go up to the top of it, where might be discovered Syria, and the ships proceeding to Egypt, in a great looking-glass, suspended about the neck of the statue.

Among the antiquities of Rome there are seven colossuses; namely, two of Jupiter, as many of Apollo, one of Nero, one of Domitian, and one of the Sun.
