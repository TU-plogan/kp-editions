COMMISSARY, in the ecclesiastical law, an officer of the bishop, who exercises spiritual jurisdiction in places of a diocese so far from the episcopal see that the chancellor cannot call the people to the bishop’s principal consistory court, without putting them to too much inconvenience.

Commissary Court, in Scotland, a court originally constituted by the bishops, and anciently called the bishops court, curia Christianitatis, or consistorial court. This court was regulated by Queen Mary at the Reformation, and continued in a certain modified form as a separate tribunal until lately, when it was in a great measure merged in the court of session. See Scotland.
