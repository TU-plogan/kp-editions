COURTRAY, a city of West Flanders, the capital of a circle of the same name. It is situated on the river Lys, and contains 2000 houses, with 13,980 inhabitants, who are industriously employed in various manufactures. The finest linen is woven by the peasantry in the neighbouring villages, and brought to the city to be bleached and finished. Some of the finest lace-making threads are spun here, and much lace is made. There are also extensive works for printing calicoes, besides refineries for sugar, distilleries, tanneries, breweries, and dyeing houses. The councilhouse, the exchange, and some of the churches, are much distinguished, particularly the church of Notre Dame and of St Martin.
