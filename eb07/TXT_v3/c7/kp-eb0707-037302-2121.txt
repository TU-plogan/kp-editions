CORONELLI, Vincent, a well-known geographer, was born at Venice. His skill in the mathematics having brought him to the knowledge of the Count d’Estrées, the latter employed him in making globes for Louis XIV. With this view Coronelli spent some time at Paris, and left a great number of globes there, which are much esteemed. In 1685 he was appointed cosmographer to the republic of Venice, and four years afterwards public professor of geography. He founded an academy of cosmography at Venice, and died in that city in the year 1718. He published about four hundred geographical charts, an abridgement of cosmography, several books on geography, and other works.
