COSENZA, a city of Italy, the capital of the Neapolitan province of Calabria Citeriore. It is built in the lovely valley of the same name, at the junction of the river Crati with the Busiento. Within the walls the inhabitants are 7900; but the suburbs and adjoining villages, the residents in which frequent the city daily on their various affairs, contain upwards of 45,000 souls. Being the only place of trade in the province, whatever excess of produce it yields is exported from Cosenza, which makes the city swarm with people. It is the chief market for silk, and there are some manufactories of heavy articles of iron ware. Long. 16. 25. E. Lat. 39. 34. N.
