COPIAPO, the most northern province of Chili, in South America. It contains an area of 18,750 square miles. It has a dry and sterile aspect, except in those places where streams irrigate and .fertilize the soil, giving birth to luxuriant vegetation. The rains are here of rare occurrence, and the showers which do fall are so trifling, and so soon exhaled by solar influence, that vegetation derives but little permanent good from them. There are mines of gold in this province; but the richest are those of silver and copper, the ores of which generally contain sulphur, lead, arsenic, and other mineral substances. The copper mines are much the most numerous; but only those whose ores yield half their weight of metal are accounted worthy of being wrought. Copiapo, the capital city of this province, is situated on a river of the same name, about twelve leagues from the Pacific Ocean. It is the seaport of the district, and here the products of the latter are shipped. Copiapo contains about 10,000 inhabitants.
