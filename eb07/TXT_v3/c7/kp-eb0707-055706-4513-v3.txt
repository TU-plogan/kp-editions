CURULE Chair, in Roman antiquity, a chair adorned with ivory, in which the superior magistrates of Rome had a right to sit and be carried.

The curule magistrates were the aediles, the praetors, the censors, and the consuls. The chair was fitted in a kind of chariot, whence it had its name. The senators who had borne the offices of aediles, praetors, censors, or consuls, were carried to the senate-house in this chair, as were all those who had triumphed, and such as had been appointed to administer justice.
