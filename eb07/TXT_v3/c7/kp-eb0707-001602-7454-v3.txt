COCKET is a seal belonging to the king’s customhouse, or rather a scroll of parchment sealed and delivered by the officers of the customs to merchants, as a warrant that their merchandise has been customed.

It is also used for the office where goods transported were first entered and paid their custom, and had a cocket or certificate of discharge.
