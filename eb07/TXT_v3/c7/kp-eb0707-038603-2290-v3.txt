COTT, or Cot, a particular sort of bed-frame, suspended from the beam of a ship, for the officers to sleep in, between decks. This contrivance is much more convenient at sea than either the hammocks or fixed cabins, being a large piece of canvass sewed into the form of a chest, about six feet in length and one foot in depth, and from two to three feet in width. It is extended by a square .wooden frame with a canvass bottom.
