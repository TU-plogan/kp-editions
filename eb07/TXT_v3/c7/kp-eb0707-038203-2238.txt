CORYPHAEUS, in the ancient tragedy, was the chief or leader of the company who composed the chorus. The word is formed from the Greek κoguprj, the top of the head. Whenever the chorus took part in the action, the eory-phaeus spoke for all the rest, in quality of a person of the drama, during the course of the acts. Hence coryphaeus passed into a general name for the chief or principal of any company, corporation, sect, or opinion. Thus Eustatius of Antioch is called the coryphaeus of the council of Niee; and Cicero calls Zeno the coryphaeus of the Stoies.
