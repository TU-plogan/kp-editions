CONCORDIA, a pagan divinity among the Romans, who had a temple on the declivity of the Capitol; another in the Portieo of Livia; and a third on Mount Palatine, built of brass by Cn. Flavius, on account of a vow made for reconciling the senate and people. She was represented with a cup in her right hand; while in her left she held sometimes a sceptre, and sometimes a cornueopia. Her symbols were two hands joined, and two serpents twisting about a caduceus. She was addressed in order to promote peace and union in the families and citizens.
