CONJEVERAM, a considerable town of Southern India, in the Carnatic, which has all the appearance of a flourishing place. The streets are wide, and cross each other at right angles, and have a row of cocoa-nut trees on each side. The houses are generally built of mud; and have mud walls with tiled roofs. It contains several tanks for water, which are lined with stone and in good repair. This town is chiefly supported by a famous Hindu temple, dedicated to Mahadera. The principal entrance is very grand and lofty, and the sides of the steps leading to the temple are formed by two elephants drawing a chariot carved in stone. The sanctuary is surrounded by a double wall, the outer inclosure of which contains an extensive chantrai or caravanserai for pilgrims and devotees.
