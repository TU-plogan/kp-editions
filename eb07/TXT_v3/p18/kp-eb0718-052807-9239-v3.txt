Itissitu-ated on the river Ribble, and is a corporate place, governed by a mayor, recorder, twelve aidermen, and thirty-six common councilmen; for which purpose it is now divided into six wards, and returns tvyo members to the House of Commons. The town has good wide streets, many fine houses, a very [7:18:529]extensive town-hall and assembly-rooms, a recently built jail, and several charity-schools. It is a place of great manufacturing industry for various kinds of cotton goods, especially cambric muslins; and to the introduction of this trade the town is indebted for its extension in the last forty years. Though the river Ribble is only navigable for small craft, yet it is connected by canals with almost every part of the kingdom, and can, by these means, easily disperse its productions in every direction. It has well-supplied markets on Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday. The two first are well provided with fish for the Roman Catholics, who are very numerous. The population was, in 1801, 11,887; in 1811, 17,065; in 1821, 24,557; and in 1831, 33,112; but, at the last census, the whole parish, χ,'onsisting of eight other townships, contained 36,336 inhabitants.
