PRESBYTER, in the primitive Christian church, an elder, one belonging to the second order of ecclesiastics; the other two being bishops and deacons.

Presbyter, or elder, is a word borrowed from the Greek translation of the Old Testament, where it commonly signifies ruler or governor; it being a note of office and dignity, not of age; and in this sense bishops are sometimes called presbyters in the New Testament. The presbyters might baptize, preach, consecrate, and administer the cucharist in the bishop’s absence, or in his presence, if he authorised and deputed them; and the bishops did scarcely anything in the government of the church without their advice, consent, and amicable concurrence.

The grand dispute between the followers of Geneva and Roman discipline, is about the sameness and difference of presbyters and bishops at the time of the apostles.
