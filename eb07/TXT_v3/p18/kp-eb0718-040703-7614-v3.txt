POPPAEA, Sabina, a Roman matron, daughter of Titus Ollius. She was married and had a son to Rufus Crispinus, a Roman knight. Her beauty captivated Otho, one of Nero’s favourites, who carried her off and married her; but he was not long permitted to retain her, for Nero, having heard her extolled for her accomplishments, sent Otho out of Italy, under pretence of presiding over one of the Roman provinces, shortly after which Nero repudiated his wife Octavia, and married Poppaea; but she did not long enjoy the imperial dignity, for Nero soon began to despise her, and treat her with great barbarity. She bore him a son; and when she was again far advanced in pregnancy, he struck her a blow with his foot, of which she died, about 65 a. D. It is said she was so anxious to preserve her beauty, that five hundred she-asses were kept to afford milk, in which she used daily to bathe.
