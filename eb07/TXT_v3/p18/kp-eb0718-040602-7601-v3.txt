POPILIUS, Laenas, Roman ambassador to Antiochus, king of Syria: He was commissioned to order that monarch to desist from hostilities against Ptolemy, king of Egypt, ally of Rome. Antiochus attempted to elude him by evasive answers; but Popilius, with a stick in his hand, made a circle round him in the sand, and charged him, in the name of the Roman senate and people, not to go beyond it till he gave a decisive answer. This boldness intimidated Antiochus, who immediately withdrew his garrisons from Egypt, and desisted from his hostile attempts against Ptolemy.
