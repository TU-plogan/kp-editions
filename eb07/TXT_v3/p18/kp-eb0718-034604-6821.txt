PONDAH, a town and celebrated fortress of Hindustan, in the province of Bejapore, which stands at the foot of the Western Ghauts, and commands the most frequented pass into the interior from Goa and Soondah. It was taken by the Mahrattas under Sevajec in 1673; and being afterwards, in 1683, besieged by the Portuguese, it was relieved by Sambajee, who, observing that they had made greater progress in battering the fortifications in ten days, than his father had done in three months, ordered them to be razed. Long. 73. 56. E. Lat. 15. 23′ N.
