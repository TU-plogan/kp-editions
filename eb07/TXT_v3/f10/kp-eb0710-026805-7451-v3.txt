FURIES, in pagan antiquity, were goddesses whose office it was to punish the guilty after death. They were three in number, Alecto, Megaera, and Tisiphone, and were described as having snakes instead of hair, and eyes like lightning, carrying iron chains and whips in one hand, and in the other flaming torches; the latter to discover, [7:10:269]and the former to punish, the guilty. They were supposed to be constantly hovering over such persons as had been guilty of any enormous crime.

Mythologiβts suppose that Tisiphone punished the crimes which sprang from hatred or anger; Megaera those from envy; and Alecto those arising from an insatiable pursuit after riches and pleasure.
