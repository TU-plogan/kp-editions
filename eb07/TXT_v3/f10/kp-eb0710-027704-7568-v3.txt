FURTH, a city of the circle of the Rezat, in the kingdom of Bavaria. It stands at the junction of the rivers Rednitz and Pegnitz. It contains 1240 houses, and 13,850 inhabitants, of whom 3550 are Jews, which people have here an university with 200 students, two Hebrew printing presses, three Jewish schools, and an hospital. It is the most active manufacturing town in the kingdom; and though none of the establishments are upon a large scale, great quantities of goods are produced by them. The principal fabric consists of looking-glasses, innumerable small ones being made and distributed throughout Europe. Some hundreds of people are employed in making turnery ware; many in making locks, snuff-boxes, watches, leaf-gold, foil, spectacles, and the various other articles usually called Nuremburg goods.
