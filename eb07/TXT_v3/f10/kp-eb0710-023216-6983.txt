FRIENDLY Islands, a cluster of islands io the Pacific Ocean, so named by Captain Cook in the year 1773, on account of the friendship which appeared to subsist among the inhabitants, and from their courteous behaviour to strangers. Abel Jansen Tasman, an eminent Dutch navigator, first landed on these islands in 1643, and gave names to most of them. Captain Cook explored the whole cluster, which he found to consist of above sixty. See Polynesia.
