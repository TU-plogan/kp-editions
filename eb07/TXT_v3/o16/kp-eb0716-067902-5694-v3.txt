OVERHAULING, the act of opening and extending the several parts of a tackle, or other assemblage of ropes, communicating with blocks or dead eyes. It is used to remove those blocks to a sufficient distance from each other, that they may again be placed in a state of action, so as to produce the effect required.

Overhauling is also vulgarly employed to signify an examination or inspection of the condition of a person or thing.
