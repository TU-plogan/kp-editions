ONEGA, a city of European Russia, in the province of Archangel. It is the capital of a circle of the same name, both so called from the river which waters a great part of the district, and at the mouth of which the city has been built. It is a small but well-built town, containing less than 2000 inhabitants, who subsist by trading in timber, pitch, and tar, and by exporting oats in some seasons to Norway. It has some trade in ship-building. It is about eighty miles from Archangel, and 916 from St Petersburg. Long. 38. 7. 40. E. Lat. 63. 53. 36. N.

Onega, a river and lake of the Russian empire. It is a hundred miles in length and forty in breadth, having a communication with the lake Ladoga, and consequently with St Petersburg. The river, which has its source in Cargapol, and gives its name to a country full of woods, falls into the white Sea.
