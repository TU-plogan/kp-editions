OROPESA, a town of Bolivia, in South America, in the department of Cochabamba. The district in which it is situated is so well irrigated by rivers and streams, that it yields immense harvests of grain and other agricultural products. Oropesa, formerly the capital, and still a considerable place, is situated in a beautiful and fertile valley, on the borders of a small stream, one of the tributaries of the Rio Grande. The chief occupation of its inhabitants consists in supplying the neighbouring provinces with fruits and grain. The climate is mild and salubrious. Oropesa stands in long. 67. 6. west, and lat. 18. 15. south. This is likewise the name of a small town of Cuzco, in Peru.
