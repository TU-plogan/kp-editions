OBI, a great river of Asiatic Russia, which is said to rise in fifty-two degrees of north latitude, on the southern side of the Altai Mountains, from a lake called by the Tartars Altyn Noor. It is now denominated By, and was formerly known by the name of the Great River, as being the longest which flows through Asiatic Russia. It receives the waters of the Irtysch, after which it becomes very broad, and sometimes extends several miles across. It also spreads out into branches, which again re-unite and form numerous islands. It flows through the governments of Kolivan, Tobolsk, Tomsk, and Narym. The entire length of its stream is two thousand miles; yet, from the northerly course which it takes into the barren and inhospitable regions of Northern Asia, it is comparatively of much less benefit in facilitating the internal communications of the country than if it flowed cast and west, as it only gives access to countries cold, unproductive, and barbarous, which mankind would rather desire to fly from than to visit. It abounds, however, in fish, which might become a lucrative object of trade, as during the summer season they might be sent along the Northern Ocean to Archangel.
