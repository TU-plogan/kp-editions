ORGIA, feasts and sacrifices in honour of Bacchus, which were held every third year, and chiefly celebrated by wild, distracted women, called Pacchae. The chief solemnities were performed in the night, to conceal, perhaps, their shocking impurities; and a mountain was generally chosen as the place of celebration. They were instituted by Orpheus, and from him are sometimes called Orphica. Authors are not agreed as to the derivation of the word; but if we consider the frantic proceedings of the Bacchanalians, igγη, furor, bids fair for being the true etymology.

Orgia, according to Servius, was a common name for all kinds of sacrifices amongst the Greeks, as ceremoniae was amongst the Romans.
