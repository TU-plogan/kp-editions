OUSE, Greater, a river which rises near Fitwell, in Oxfordshire, and proceeds to Buckingham, Stony Stratford, and Newport-Pagnel, in Buckinghamshire; from thence it proceeds to Bedford, and turning north-east, it passes on to Huntingdon and Ely, till at length it arrives at Lynn-Regis, in Norfolk, and falls into the sea.

Ouse, Smaller , rises in Suffolk, and, separating that county from Norfolk on the south-west, discharges itself into the Great Ouse near Downham. There is still another of the same name, which rises on the west-north-west side of Yorkshire, and running chiefly to the south-east, at length falls into the Humber.
