OTTERBURN, a township in the parish of Eilsdon, of the county of Northumberland, and ward of Coquetdale, 308 miles from London, and thirty-two from Newcastle. It is remarkable for the battle fought there in +fl88 r between Henry Percy, usually called Hotspur, and the Earl of Douglas, a conflict which gave rise to the ancient ballad of Chevy Chase. It is on the north side of the Cheviot Hills, and the population amounts to about 400.
