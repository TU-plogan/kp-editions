AXAMENTA, in Antiquity, a denomination given to the verses or songs of the Salii, which they sung in honour of all men. The word is formed, according to some, from axare, q. d. nominare. Others will have the Carmin Saliaria to have been denominated axamenia, on account of their having been written in axibus, or on wooden tables. The axamenta were not composed, as some have asserted, but only sung by the Salii. The author of them was Numa Pompilius; and as the style might not be altered, they grew in time so obscure that the Salii them [7:4:257]selves did not understand them. Varro says they were 700 years old. Quint. Inst. Or. lib. i. c. 11.

Axamenta, or Assamenta, in ancient music, hymns or songs performed wholly with human voices.
