ATTRIBUTIVES, in Grammar, are words which are significative of attributes; and thus include adjectives, verbs, and particles, which are attributes of substances, together with adverbs, which denote the attributes only of attributes. Mr Harris, who introduced this distribution of words, denominates the former attributives of the first order, and the latter attributives of the second order.
