AVESBURY, Robert, an English historian, of whom little more is known than that he was keeper of the registry of the court of Canterbury in the reign of Edward III. and consequently that he lived in the fourteenth century. He wrote Memorabilia gesta magnifici regis Angliae domini Edwardi Tertii post Conquoestum, procerumque ; tactis primitus quibusdam gestis de tempore patris sui domini Edwardi Secundi, quae in regnis Angliae, Scotiae, et Franciae, ac in Aquitania et Britannia, non humana sed Bei potentia, contigerunt. This history ends with the battle of Poictiers, about the year 1356. It continued in manuscript till the year 1720, when it was printed by Hearne at Oxford, from a manuscript belonging to Sir Thomas Sea-bright.
