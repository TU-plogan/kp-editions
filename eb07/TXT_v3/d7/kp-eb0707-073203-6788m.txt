DENSITY of Bodies is that property directly opposite to rarity, by which they contain a certain quantity of matter under a certain bulk. Accordingly, a body is said to have double or triple the density of another body, when, the bulk being equal, the quantity of matter in the one is double or triple the quantity of matter in the other.
