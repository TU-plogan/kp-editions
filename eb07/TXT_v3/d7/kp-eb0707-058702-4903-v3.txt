DAGON, the false god of Ashdod, or, as the Greeks call him, Azotos. He is commonly represented as a monster, half man and half fish; whence most learned men derive his name from the Hebrew dag, which signifies a fish. Those who consider him to have been the inventor of bread corn, derive his name from the Hebrew dagon, which signifies frumentum ; whence Philo Biblius calls him Zsu; Agaψ∕θi, Jupiter Aratrius.

This deity continued to have a temple at Ashdod duringall the ages of idolatry, till the time of the Maccabees; for the author of the first book of Maccabees tells us that “Jonathan, one of the Maccabees, having beaten the army of Apollonius, Demetrius’s general, they fled to Azotus, and entered into Bethdagon (the temple of their idoD; but that Jonathan set fire to Azotus, and burnt the temple of Dagon and all those who had fled into it.”

According to some, Dagon was the same with Jupiter, according· to others, with Saturn; according to others, again, he was identical with Venus, but according to most, with Neptunc.
