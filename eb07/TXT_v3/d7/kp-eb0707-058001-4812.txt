D, THE fourth letter of the alphabet, and the third consonant. Grammarians generally reckon D among the lingual letters, supposing the tongue to have the principal share in its pronunciation; though the Abbé de Dangeau is rather inclined to regard it as a palate letter. The letter D is the fourth in the Hebrew, Chaldee, Samaritan, Syriac, Greek, and Latin alphabets; in all of which languages except the last it has the same name, though somewhat differently spoken, namely, in Hebrew, Samaritan, and Chaldee, Daleth or Dhaleth, in Syriac Doleth, and in Greek Delta. The form of our D is the same with that of the Latins, as appears from all the ancient medals and inscriptions, and the Latin D is no other than the Greek Δ, with the angle on the left hand rounded off into a curve. The Δ of the Greeks, again, is borrowed from the ancient character of the Hebrew Daleth ; which form it still retains, as is shown by Souciet, in his Dissertation on the Samaritan Medals.

D is sometimes put for the aspirate Th, as Theos, Deus ; sometimes it is converted into B, as Duellum, Bellum, Duellona, Bellona. It has also an affinity with T, as Quintilian has observed (lib. i. c. 4); and hence, anciently, we meet with Alexanter and Cassantra, for Alexander and Cassandra, and, vice versa, quodannis and adque for quotannis and atque. In like manner, it is interchanged with R for the sake of euphony, as in meridies for medidies. In praenomens D stands for Decimus, and in the titles of emperors, for Divus. It is also a numeral letter, representing five hundred. This arises from the circumstance that the letter D is analogous in form to IϽ, the half of CIϽ, which is the Roman numeral expression for a thousand. With a dash placed on the top thus, D, its value is increased tenfold, or, in other words, it stands for five thousand. Used as an abbreviation, D has various significations, for which see article Abbreviations.
