DAMAUN, a sea-port of Hindustan, on the western coast of the province of Aurungabad. It is a considerable place, though the commerce is now much reduced; and it makes a conspicuous figure from the sea, the churches and houses being all white. The Parsees have a temple here, in which they pretend that the sacred fire brought with them from Persia nearly twelve hundred years ago is still burning. Ship-building to a considerable extent is here earned on, the teak forests being at no great distance. The harbour is convenient for small vessels, there being nearly seventeen feet of water over the bar. This place was taken by the Portuguese in 1531, and it still remains in their possession. Long. 73. 1. E. Lat. 20. 22. N.
