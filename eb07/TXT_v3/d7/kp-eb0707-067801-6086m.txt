DEGREE, in Geometry, a division of a circle, including a three hundred and sixtieth part of its circumference.

Degree of Latitude. See Latitude. Degree of Longitude. See Longitude.

A degree of the meridian on the surface of the globe has been variously determined by various observers. Mr Picart measured a degree in the latitude of 49° 2P, and found it equal to 57,060 French toises. But the French mathematicians, who examined Mr Picart’s operations, assure us that the degree in that latitude is 57,183 toises. Our countryman, Mr Norwood, measured the distance between London and York, and found it 905,751 English feet; and finding the difference of latitudes 2° 28′, determined the quantity of one degree to be 367,196 English feet, or 69 English miles and 288 yards. Maupertuis measured a degree in Lapland, in the latitude of 66° 20 , , and found it 57,438 toises. A degree was likewise measured at the equator by other French mathematicians, and found to contain 56,767∙8 toises. Whence it appears that the earth is not a sphere, but an oblate spheroid.

Degree, in the civil and canon law, denotes an interval in kinship, by which proximity and remoteness of blood are computed.

Degrees, Academical. See Universities. Degrees, in Music, are the little intervals of which the concords or harmonical intervals are composed.
