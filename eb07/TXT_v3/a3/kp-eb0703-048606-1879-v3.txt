ARIOLI, in Antiquity, a kind of prophets or religious conjurers, who, by abominable prayers and horrible sacrifices at the altars of idols, procured answers to their questions concerning future events. Isid. Orig. lib. viii. cap. 9. These are also called harioli, and their operation hariolation. Sometimes they were denominated aruspices or haruspices. The arioli were distinguished by a slovenly dress, disorderly and matted beards, hair, &c.
