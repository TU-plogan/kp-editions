ANDRELINUS, Publius Faustus, born at Forli in Italy. He was a long time professor of poetry and philosophy in the university of Paris. Louis XII. of France made him his poet laureat, and Erasmus tells us that he was likewise poet to the queen. His pen was not wholly employed in making verses, for he wrote also moral and proverbial letters in prose, which were printed several times. His poems, which are chiefly in Latin, are inserted in vol. i. of the Deliciae Poetarum Italorum. He died in 1518.
