APOB ATERION, in Antiquity, a valedictory speech or poem, made by a person on departing out of his own country, and addressed to his friends or relations. < v APOCALYPSE, Révélation, the name of one of the sacred books of the New Testament, containing revelations concerning Several important doctrines of Christianity. The word is Greek, and derived, from ατro%αλuwτω, I reveal or discover- , y;

This book, according to Irenaeus, was'written about the year 96 of Christ, in the island of Patmos, whither St John had been banished by the emperor Domitian. But Sir Isaac Newton places the writing of i∙t earlier, wiz. in the time of Nero. Some attribute this book to the archheretic Cerinthus; but the ancients unanimously ascribed it to John, the son of Zebedec, and brother of James, whom the Greek fathers called the Divine, by way of eminence, to distinguish him from the other evangelists. This book has not at all times been esteemed canonical. There were many churches in Greece, as St. Jerome informs us, which did not receive it; neither is it in the catalogue of canonical books prepared by the council of Laodicea, nor in that of St Cyril of Jerusalem: but Justin, Irenaeus, Origen, Cyprian, Clemens-of: Alexandria, Tertullian, and all the fathers of the fourth, fifth, and the following centuries, quote : the'Revelation as a'book then acknowledged to be .canonical. "The Alogians, Marcio-ιites, Cerdonians, and Luther lumself, rejected this book: but the Protestants have forsaken Luther in this particular; and Beza has strongly maintained, against his objections, that the Apocalypse is authentic and canonical.

I here have been several other works published under the title of Apocalypses. Sozomen mentions a book used in the churches of Palestine, called the Apocalypse or Revelation of St Peter. î He also mentions an Apocalypse

St Paul, which the Cophtae retain to this day. Eusebius also speaks of Doth these Apocalypses. St Epipha-nius mentions an Apocalypse of Adam; Nicephorus, an Apocalypse of Esdras; Gratian and Cedrenus. an Apocalypse òt Moses, another of St Thomas, and another of St btephen; St Jerome, an: Apocal}pse of Elias. Porphyry, tn his life of: Plotin, makes mention of the Apocalyps.e or Revelations of Zoroaster, ’ Zostrian, Nicothaeus, Allogenes, &C. Ş ,ţ , β <
