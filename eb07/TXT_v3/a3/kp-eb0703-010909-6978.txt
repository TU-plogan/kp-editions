ANCUS Martius, the fourth king of the Romans, succeeded Tullus Hostilius 639 years before Christ. He defeated the Latins, subdued the Fidenates, conquered the Sabines, Volsci, and Veientines, enlarged Rome by joining to it Mount Janiculum, and made the harbour of Ostia. He died about 615 years before the Christian era.
