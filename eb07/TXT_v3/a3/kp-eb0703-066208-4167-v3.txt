ASAROTA, αo ’ αgωrα, from a and da∕jω, I sweep, a kind of painted pavements in use before the invention of mosaic work. The most celebrated was that at Pergamus, painted by Sesus, which exhibited the appearance of crumbs, as if the floor had not been swept after dinner; hence, according to Pliny, the denomination. Perrault supposes them to have been a black kind of pavements, of a spongy matter.
