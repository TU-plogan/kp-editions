ANGAR, Angan, or Hindsham, a barren and uninhabited island on the Arabian shore of the Persian Gulf, on the south side of the island of Kishma, about 12 miles in circuit. It must have been formerly inhabited, as it contains the ruins of a considerable town, and many reservoirs of water. It has also two wells, and a stream of good water, which unfortunately become dry in the hot weather. It is covered with pits of salt and metallic ores, and a soft rocky substance resembling lava. The hills, which are overspread with shells of oysters and other fish, abound in wild goats, rabbits, and partridges.
