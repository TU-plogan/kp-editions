ARNE, Thomas Augustine, doctor of music, was born in King Street, Covent Garden, where his father was an upholsterer. He served three years with an attorney; but his strong propensity for music prevailed over the law, and he finally attached himself to the science, in which he soon became so eminent as to receive the degree of doctor from the University of Oxford in 1759. His compositions are numerous, he having adapted upwards of thirty musical pieces for the stage. They are characterized by a natural ease and elegance, a flow of melody, and a fullness and variety without affected or extraneous modulation. His most celebrated works are, Artaxerxes, which he paraphrased from Metastasio; the Masque of Comus ; the Opera of Operas, a burletta; the Guardian Outwitted; and the Bose ; some of which have taken a permanent hold of the stage. Dr Arne died March 5, 1778.
