ANTIMETATHESIS, in Rhetoric, is the inversion of the parts or members of an antithesis. Such is that of Cicero in Verrem, lib. iv. cap. 52: “Compare this peace with that war; the arrival of this governor with the victory of that general; his profligate troops with the invincible army of the other; the luxury of the former with the temperance of the latter: you will say that Syracuse was founded by him who took it, and taken by him who held it when founded.”
