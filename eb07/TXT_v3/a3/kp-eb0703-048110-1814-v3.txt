ARGENTARIUS is frequently used in Roman writers for a money-changer or banker. The argentarii were capitalists, who made a profit either by the changing or lending of money at interest. They had their tabernae or offices in dne. forum Bamanum, built there as early as the reign of L. Tarquinius Priscus.
