ANTIQUARII, a name given to copiers of old books. After the decline of learning among the Romans, and when many religious houses were erected, learning was chiefly in the hands of the clergy, the greater number of whom were regulars, and lived in monasteries. In these houses were many industrious men, who were continually employed in making new copies of old books, either for the use of the monastery or for their own emolument. These writing monks were distinguished by the name of Antiquarii.
