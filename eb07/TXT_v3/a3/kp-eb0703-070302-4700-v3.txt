ASPASIA of Miletus, a celebrated courtezan who settled at Athens under the administration of Pericles. She was of admirable beauty: yet her wit and eloquence, still more than her beauty, gained her extraordinary reputation among all ranks in the republic. Her conversation was so entertaining and instructive, that notwithstanding the dishonourable commerce she carried on in female virtue, persons of the first distinction, male and female, resorted to her house as to an academy. It is said that she even numbered Socrates among her hearers. She captivated Pericles in such a manner that he dismissed his own wife in order to espouse her; and by her universal knowledge, irresistible elocution, and intriguing genius, she in a great measure influenced the administration of Athens. She was accused of having excited, from motives of personal resentment, the war of Peloponnesus. The companions of Aspasia served as models for painting and statuary, and themes for poetry and panegyric. Nor were they merely the objects, but, as is said, the authors, of some literary works, in which they established rules for the behaviour of their lovers, particularly at table; and explained the art of gaining the heart and captivating the affections.
