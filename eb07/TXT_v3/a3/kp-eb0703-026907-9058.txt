ANTOECI, those inhabitants of the earth who live under the same meridian, and at the same distance from the equator; the one toward the north, and the other toward the south. Hence they have the same longitude; and their latitude is also the same, but of a different denomination: they are in the same semicircle of the meridian, but in opposite parallels: they have precisely the same hours of the day and night, but opposite seasons; and the night of the one is always equal to the day of the other.
