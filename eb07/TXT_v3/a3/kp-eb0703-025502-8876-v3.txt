ANTIPHONARY, Antiphonarium, a service-book, which contained all the invitatories, responsories, collects, and whatever else was sung or said in the choir, except the lessons. This is otherwise called responsorium, from the responses contained therein. The author of the Roman antiphonary was Pope Gregory the Great. We also find mention of nocturnal and diurnal antiphonaries, for the use of the daily and nightly offices; summer and winter antiphonaries! also antiphonaries for country churches, &c. By the provincial constitutions of Archbishop Winchelsea, made at Merton A. d∙ 1305, it is required that one of these should be found in every church within the province of Canterbury. The use of these and many other popish books was forbid by the 3d and 4th of Edward VI. c. 10.
