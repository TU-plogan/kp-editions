ASSONANT Rhymes is a term particularly applied to a kind of verses common among the Spaniards, where a resemblance of sound serves instead of a natural rhyme. Thus ligera, cubierta, tierra, mesa, may answer each other in a kind of assonant rhyme, having each an e in the penult syllable, and an a in the last.
