ANTIDOSIS, in Antiquity, denotes an exchange of estates, practised by the Greeks on certain occasions with peculiar ceremonies, and first instituted by Solon.

When a person was nominated to an office, the expense of which he was not able to support, he had recourse tõ the antidosis; that is, he was to seek some other citizen of better substance than himself, who was free from this and other offices; in which case the former was excused. In case the person thus substituted denied himself to be the richest, they were to exchange estates after this manner[7:3:250]: the doors of their houses were shut up and sealed, that nothing might be conveyed away; then both took an oath to make a faithful discovery of all their effects, except what lay in the silver mines, which by the laws were exempted from all imposts. Accordingly, within three days, a full discovery and exchange of estates was made.
