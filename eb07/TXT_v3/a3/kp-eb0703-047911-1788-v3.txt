ARETAEUS of Cappadocia, a Greek physician of the sect of the Pneumatists, who, according to some, lived in the reign of Augustus; according to others, under Trajan or Adrian. He wrote several treatises, in the Ionian dialect, on acute diseases and other medicinal subjects, some of which are still extant. The best edition of his works is that of Boerhaave, in Greek and Latin, with notes, printed in 1731; that printed at Oxford in 1723, in folio, is also much esteemed.
