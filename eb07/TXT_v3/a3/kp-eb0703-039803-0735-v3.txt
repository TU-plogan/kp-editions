ARCHDEACON, an ecclesiastical dignitary or officer, next to a bishop, whose jurisdiction extends either over the whole diocese or only a part of it. He is usually appointed by the bishop himself, and has a kind of episcopal authority, originally derived from the bishop, but now independent and distinct from his. He therefore visits the clergy, and has his separate court for punishment of offenders by spiritual censures, and for hearing all other causes of ecclesiastical cognizance. There are 60 archdeacons in England.

Archdeacon' s Court is the most inferior court in the whole ecclesiastical polity. It is held, in the archdeacon’s absence, before a judge appointed by himself, and called his official; and its jurisdiction is sometimes in concurrence with, sometimes in exclusion of, the bishop’s court of the diocese. From hence, however, by statute 24, Henry VIII. cap. 12, there lies an appeal to that of the bishop.
