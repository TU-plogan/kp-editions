ARBE, anciently Arba, an island and city of Illyria, in the gulf of Quarnaro. Of this island, which has been but slightly noticed by geographers, there is a full account in the Abbé Fortis’s Account of Dalmatia. The appearance of the island is exceedingly pleasant. On the east it has a very high mountain, at the foot of which the rest of the island is extended to the westward, and divided into beautiful and fruitful plains interspersed with Htle hills fit to bear the richest products. At the extremity that looks to the north a delightful promontory called Loparo, stretches into the sea: it is crowned with little hills, which almost quite inclose a fine cultivated plain. Near this promontory are the two small islands of S. Gregorio and Goli. The city of Arbe stands on a rising ground between two harbours, which form a peninsula.
