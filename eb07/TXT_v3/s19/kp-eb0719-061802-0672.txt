SALIANT, in Fortification, denotes projecting. There are two kinds of angles; the one saliant, which have their points outwards; the other re-entering, which have their points inwards.

Saliant, Sament, or Saillant, in Heraldry, is applied to a lion, or other beast, when its tore-legs are raised in a leaping posture.
