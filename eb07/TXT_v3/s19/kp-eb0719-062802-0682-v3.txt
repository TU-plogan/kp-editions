SALVIANUS, an ancient father of the Christian church, who flourished in the fifth century, and was well skilled in the sciences. He acquired such reputation for his piety and learning, that he was named the Master of the Bishops. He wrote a Treatise on Providence; another on Avarice; and some epistles, of which Baluze has given an excellent edition. That of Conrad Rittershusius, in two volumes 8vo, is also esteemed.[7:19:629]
