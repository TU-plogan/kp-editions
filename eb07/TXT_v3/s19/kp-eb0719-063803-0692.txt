SANCTORIUS, or Sanctorio, an ingenious and learned physician, was professor in the university of Padua in the beginning of the seventeenth century. He contrived a kind of statical chair, by means of which, after estimating the aliments received, and the sensible discharges, he was enabled to determine with great exactness the quantity of insensible perspiration, as well as what kind of victuals and drink increased or diminished it. On these experiments he erected a curious system, which he published under the title of De Medicina Statica, and which has been translated into English by Dr Quincy. Sanctorius published several other treatises, which showed great abilities and learning.
