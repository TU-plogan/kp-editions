SCHULTENS, Albert, professor of Hebrew and of the oriental languages at Leyden, and one of the most learned men of the eighteenth century, was born at Groningen, where he studied till the year 1706, and thence continued his studies at Leyden and Utrecht. Schultens at length applied himself to the study of Arabic, both printed and in manuscript, in which he made great progress. A short time afterwards he became minister of Wassenar; and in two years professor of the eastern tongues at Franekcr. At length he was invited to Leyden, where he taught Hebrew and the Oriental languages with extraordinary reputation till his death, which happened in the year 1750. He wrote many learned works, the principal of which are, 1. A Commentary on Job, in two vols. 4to; 2. A Commentary on the Proverbs; 3. Vetus regia Via Hebraizandi; 4. Animadversiones philologicae et criticacad varia loca Veteris Testamenti; 5. An excellent Hebrew Grammar. Schultens discovered in all his works sound criticism and much learning. He maintained against Gousset and Driessen, that in order to have a perfect knowledge of Hebrew, it is necessary to join with it not only the Chaldaic and Syriac, but more particularly the Arabic.
