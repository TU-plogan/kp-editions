SCHOONER, in nautical language, a small vessel with two masts, whose main-sail and fore-sail are suspended from gaffs, reaching from the mast towards the stern, and stretched out below by booms, and whose foremost ends are hooked to an iron, which clasps the mast so as to turn therein as upon an axis, when the after-ends are swung from one side of the vessel to the other.
