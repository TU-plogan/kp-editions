SALLO, Denis De, a French writer, famous for being the projector of a certain class of literary journals, was born at Paris in 1626. He studied the law, and was admitted a counsellor in the parliament of Paris in 1652. It was in 1664 that he formed the plan of the Journal des Savans; and the year following he began to publish it under the name of Sieur de Héronville, which was that of his valet de chambre. But he played the critic so severely, that authors, surprised at the novelty of such attacks, retorted so powerfully, that M. de Sallo, unable to weather the storm, after he had published his third journal, declined the undertaking, which he handed over to the Abbé Gallois, who, without presuming to criticise, contented himself merely with giving titles and making extracts. M. de Sallo died in 1669.
