ESKI-HISSAR, a small town of Asiatic Turkey, in Natolia. It is supposed to stand on the site of the ancient Stratonica, which was founded by a colony of Macedonians. The neighbouring plain is fertile in tobacco, which is collected by the inhabitants, who hang it up in their cottages to dry. It is situated sixteen miles westward from Mogla.
