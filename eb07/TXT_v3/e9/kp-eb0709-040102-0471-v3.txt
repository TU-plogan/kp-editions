EUMOLPIDES, the priests of Ceres at the celebration of her festivals at Eleusis. They were descended from Eumolpus, a king of Thrace, who was appointed priest of Ceres by Erechtheus, king of Athens. After his appointment to the priesthood, however, Eumolpus became so powerful that he maintained a war against Erechtheus. The contest proved fatal to both; Erechtheus and Eumolpus were killed; and peace was re-established amongst their descendants, on condition that the priesthood should for ever remain in the house of Eumolpus, and the regal power in that of Erechtheus. The priesthood remained in the family of Eumolpus for twelve hundred years; and this is the more remarkable, because he who was once appointed to the holy office was obliged to observe perpetual celibacy.
