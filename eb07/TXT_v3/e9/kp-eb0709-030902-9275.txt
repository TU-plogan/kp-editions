EPICYCLE, in the ancient astronomy, a little circle whose centre is in the circumference of a greater circle: or it is a small orb or sphere, which being fixed in the deferent of a planet, is carried along with it; and yet, by its own peculiar motion, carries the planet fastened to it round its proper centre.

It was by means of epicycles that Ptolemy and his followers solved the various phenomena of the planets, but more especially their stations and retrogradations.
