EXTRINSIC, among metaphysicians, is taken in various senses. Sometimes it signifies that which does not belong to the essence of another; in which sense the efficient cause and end of a thing are said to be extrinsic. Sometimes it signifies that which is not contained within another; in which sense those causes are called extrinsic which introduce something into a subject from without, as when a fire introduces heat. Sometimes it signifies a thing added or applied to another; in which sense accidentsand adherents are said to be extrinsic to the subjects to which they adhere. Sometimes the vision is said to be extrinsic from some form which does not exist in it, but is adjacent to it, or by some means or other without it.
