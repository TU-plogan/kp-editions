EUCHARIST, the sacrament of the Lord’s supper. The word in the original Greek, Eo^ag/d’na, literally imports thanksgiving ; being formed from íu, bene, well, and %αg∕,, gratia, thanks. This sacrament was instituted by Christ himself; and the participation of it is called communion.

As to the manner of celebrating the eucharist among the ancient Christians; after the customary oblations were made, the deacon brought water to the bishops and presbyters, standing round the table, to wash their hands; according to the words of the psaloust, “I will wash my hands in innocence, and so will I compass thy altar, 0 Lord.” Then the deacon cried aloud, “mutually embrace and kiss each other ;” which being done, the whole congregation prayed for the universal peace and welfare of the church, for the tranquillity and repose of the world, for the prosperity of the age, for propitious weather, and for all ranks and degrees of men. After this followed the mutual salutations of the minister and people; and then the bishop or presbyter, having sanctified the elements by a solemn benediction, broke the bread, and handed it to the deacon, who delivered it to the communicants; and in like manner afterwards the cup. The sacramental wine was usually diluted or mixed with water. During the time of administration hymns and psalms were sung; and the whole concluded with prayer and thanksgiving, upon which the people saluted each other with the kiss of peace, and so the assembly broke up.
