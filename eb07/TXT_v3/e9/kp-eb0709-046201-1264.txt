EXCREMENT, whatever is discharged out of the body of animals after digestion; or the fibrous part of the aliment, mixed with the bile, saliva, and other fluids. Urine and the faeces are the gross excrements discharged out of the bladder and stomach. The other excrements are the various humours secreted through the different pores of the body, by which secretion several useful purposes are served.
