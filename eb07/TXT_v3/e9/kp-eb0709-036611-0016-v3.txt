ESCHRAKITES, or Esrakites, a sect of philosophers amongst the Mahommedans, who adhere to the doctrines and opinions of Plato. The word is derived from the Arabic schraha, which in the fourth conjugation signifies to shine or glitter like the sun, so that Eschrakite seems to signify illuminated.

The Eschrahites, or Mahommedan Platonists, place their highest good and happiness in the contemplation of the Divine Majesty, despising the sensual imaginations in the Koran concerning paradise. They are careful in avoiding all vice; they preserve an equal and easy temper, love music, and divert themselves with composing little poems or spiritual songs.
