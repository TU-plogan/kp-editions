ESPOUSALS, in Law, signify a contract or promise made between a man and a woman to marry each other; and in cases where marriages may be consummated, espousals take place previously. Marriage is termed an espousal de prũedenti.

The espousals amongst the Jews were either by writing, or by a piece of silver given and received, or by cohabitation. Amongst the Greeks, after the parents and friends of the young people had finished their negotiation, the couple themselves pledged their faith to each other; the man swearing that he would be constant and true, the woman that she would marry him, and make him master of all she had. They then ratified their agreement by a kiss and by joining right hands.

Amongst the Romans the espousals consisted in an engagement of friends on both sides, whether absent or present, in public or without witnesses. But the common way was by means of writings drawn up by common consent, and sealed by both parties; and besides this, the man sent a ring to the woman, consisting of iron, and without a stone.
