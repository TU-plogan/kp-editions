EPAULEMENT, in Fortification, is a kind of breastwork, constructed to cover the troops in front, and sometimes also in flank. In a siege, an epaulement of eight or ten feet in height is generally raised near the entrance of the approaches, in order to cover the cavalry which is placed there to support the guard of the trenches. These works are commonly constructed of filled gabions, or of fascines and earth intermixed. The term epaulement is frequently applied to any work thrown up to defend the flank of a post or other place; it also denotes sometimes a demi-bastion, and at others a square orillon, for covering the cannon of a casemate.
