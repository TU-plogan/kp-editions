AGAMEMNON, the son of Atreus by Aerope, was captain-general of the Trojan expedition. It was foretold to him by Cassandra, that his wife Clytemnestra would be his death: yet he returned to her; and accordingly was slain by Aegisthus, who had gained upon his wife in his absence,, and by her means got the government into his own hands.
