ALA, a Latin term, properly signifying a wing; from a resemblance to which several other things are called by the same name. Thus, Ala is a term used by botanists for the hollow of a stalk, which either the leaf or the pedicle of the leaf makes with it; or it is that hollow turning, or sinus, placed between the stalk or branch of a plant and the leaf, whence a new offspring usually issues. Sometimes it is used for those parts of leaves otherwise called lobes or wings.
