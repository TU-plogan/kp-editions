ADMONITION, in ecclesiastical affairs, a part of discipline much used in the ancient church. It was the first act or step towards the punishment or expulsion of delinquents. In private offences it was performed, according to the evangelical rule, privately; in case of public offence, openly, before the church. If either of these sufficed for the recovery of the fallen person, all further proceedings in the way of censure ceased: if they did not, recourse was had to excommunication.

Admonitio Fustium, a military punishment among the Romans, not unlike our whipping, but it was performed with vine branches.
