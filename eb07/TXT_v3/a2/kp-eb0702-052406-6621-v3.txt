ALLEY, William, bishop of Exeter in the reign of Queen Elizabeth, was born at Great Wycomb in Buckinghamshire. From Eton School, in the year 1528, he removed to King’s College, Cambridge, where he took the degree of bachelor of arts. He also studied some time at Oxford; afterwards he married, was presented with a living, and became a zealous reformer. Upon Queen Mary’s accession he left his cure and retired into the north of England, where he maintained his wife and himself by teaching a school, and practising physic. Queen Elizabeth ascending the throne, he went to London, where he acquired great reputation by reading the divinity lecture, at St Paul’s, and in July 1560 was consecrated bishop of Exeter. [7:2:525] He was created doctor of divinity at Oxford in November 1561. He died on the 15th of April 1570, and was buried at Exeter, in the cathedral. He wrote, 1. The Poor Man’s Library, 2 vols. folio, Lond. 1571. These volumes contain twelve lectures on the first epistle of St peter, read at St Paul’s. 2. A Hebrew Grammar. Whether it was ever published is uncertain. He translated the Pentateuch, in the version of the Bible which was undertaken by Queen Elizabeth’s command.
