AEORA, among ancient writers on medicine, is used for gestation; which sort of exercise was often prescribed by the physicians of those days. Other exercises consisted principally in the motion of the body; but in the aeora the limbs were at rest, while the body was carried about and moved from place to place, in such a manner as the physician prescribed. It had therefore the advantage of exercise, without the fatigue of it. This exercise was promoted several ways; sometimes the patient was laid in a sort of hammock, supported by röpes, and moved backward and forward; sometimes his bed ran nimbly on its feet; and sometimes he was carried in a litter, in a boat or ship, or on even ground in a chariot. Asclepiades was the first who brought gestation into practice, which was used as a means to recover strength after a fever, &c.
