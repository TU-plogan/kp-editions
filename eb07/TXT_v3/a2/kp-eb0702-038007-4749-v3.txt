ALBARIUM Opus, in the ancient building, the incrustation or covering of the roofs of houses with white plaster, made of mere. lime. This is otherwise called opus album. It differed from Tectorium, which is a common name given to all roofing or ceiling, including even that formed of lime and sand, or lime and marble; whereas albarium was restrained to that made of lime alone.
