ACETABULUM, in antiquity, a measure used by the ancients, equal to one-eighth of our pint It seems to have acquired its name from a vessel in which acetum or vinegar was brought to their tables, and which probably contained about this quantity.

Acetabulum, in Anatomy, a cavity in any bone for receiving the protuberant head of another, and thereby forming that species of articulation called Enarthrosis. Acetabulum, in Potany, the trivial name of a species of the peziza, or cup peziza, a genus belonging to the cryptogamja fungi of Linnaeus. It has got the name of acetabulum from the resemblance its leaves bear to a cup.
