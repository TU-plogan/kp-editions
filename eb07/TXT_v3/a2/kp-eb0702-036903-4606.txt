AIX, an ancient city of France, the chief place of the arrondissement of the same name, in the department of the Mouths of the Rhone. It was, before the revolution, fitted with richly endowed ecclesiastical establishments, which have been secularized. It stands on a plain surrounded by hills, which produce abundance of most excellent olives, which, with wine and fruits, form the most important branches of agricultural industry. There arc manufactories of various rich silk goods, of some linen, and hardware. The ancient springs, known to the Romans, but disused till again discovered in 1704, arc slightly warm, but their efficacy is not now highly valued. The population amounts to 21,960 persons. This city is celebrated for having given birth to two famous naturalists, Adanson and Tourncfort, and to the painter Vanloo.
