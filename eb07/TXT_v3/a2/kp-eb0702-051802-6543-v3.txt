ALLAN, David, a Scotish historical painter of considerable celebrity, was born at Alloa, on the 13th February 1744. At a very early age he showed such marks of genius as attracted the notice of some gentlemen living in the neighbourhood. In a remote part of the country, and deprived of the ordinary means of indulging his propensity to drawing, he betook himself, when a boy, to such implements and materials as he could readily procure; and the mechanical skill and taste which, in particular, he displayed in using his knife, have been mentioned as remarkable for his years. Mr Stewart, then collector of the Customs at Alloa, having mentioned these proofs of natural talent to Mr Foulis the printer, who some time before had instituted an academy in Glasgow for painting and engraving, he invited young Allan to study under his care. Here he remained about seven years, studying the elementary principles of his art; and, by the proficiency which he attained, justified the opinion of his talents which had procured him admission to that ill-fated seminary. But although the public taste for the fine arts, which then existed in Scotland, was so feeble as to leave his preceptor without support, which his liberal and spirited efforts justly claimed, Allan, on leaving the academy, had the good fortune to gain the patronage of individuals whose generosity enabled him to prosecute his views, and to improve his taste, by studying the works of art abroad. At the joint expense of several persons of fortune, particularly Lord Catheart and Mr Abererombie of Tullibody, he was enabled to go to Italy; and at Rome he devoted himself with great zeal to his profession. Here he remained for no less a period than sixteen years, during which time his subsistence chiefly depended on the copies which he made from the most celebrated pictures of the ancient masters. Among the original works which he then painted, there was one which does the highest credit to his talents, and which gained for him the gold medal given by the Academy of St Luke, in the year 1773, for the best specimen of historical composition. This picture represents the Origin of Painting, and is well known by the excellent engraving of it by Cunego. His design of the Calabrian Shepherds is also a composition of great merit; and his four views of the Carnivals at Rome, etched by Paul Sandby, are said likewise to have been very successful.

On his return to his native country, he took up his residence in Edinburgh, and soon after, on the death of Alexander Runciman, in 1786, was appointed director and master of the academy established by the Board of Trustees for Manufactures in Scotland. There he executed a great variety of works, of various degrees of merit; but perhaps none such as might have been expected from the author of the Origin of Painting. Those, indeed, by which he is most known, are of a east altogether different, being remarkable for the comic humour which they display. The Scotch Wedding, the Highland Dance, the Repentance Stool, with his Illustrations of the Gentle Shepherd, are all of this class, and so generally known, from his own spirited etchings in aqua-tinta, as to need no description. Of his graver compositions, the Prodigal Son, in possession of Lord Catheart, and his Hercules and Omphale, in the possession of Mr Erskine of Mar, are regarded as works of great merit.

As an artist, Mr Allan possessed much facility of invention, with a keen discernment of those evanescent circumstances in the outward form which mark the different shades of passion and affection in the mind. With the talent of artfully arranging the various parts of a crowded and bustling scene, such as appears in some of his comic productions, he possessed that feeling for simplicity which gives to his graver compositions a classical and antique air of elegance. In his drawing he was often hasty and incorrect. He executed a great variety of etchings and drawings in water colours, which are valuable, on account of their excellent humour, and the great knowledge of national character which they express. We do not know that Allan left any pupil who has followed his particular line in painting; but among those who received from him the rudiments of art while he continued master of the academy, we may name the late Mr Hugh W. Williams, whose genius, however, directed him to a different course, which conducted him to high and merited distinction as a landscape painter.

Mr Allan is remembered and spoken of as an excellent private character. He died at Edinburgh on the 6th of August 1796, in the 53d year of his age.
