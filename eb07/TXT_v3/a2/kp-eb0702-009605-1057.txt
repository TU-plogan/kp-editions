ACHERUSIA PALUS, a lake between Cumae and the promontory Misenum, now II Lago della Colluxia. (Clu-verius.) Some confound it with the Lacus Lucrinus, and others with the Lacus Averni ; but Strabo and Pliny distinguish them.—Also a lake of Epirus, through which the Acheron runs.—There is also a cave of the same name, through which Hercules is fabled to have descended to hell to drag forth Cerberus.
