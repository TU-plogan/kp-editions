ABJURATION, in our ancient customs, implied an oath taken by a person guilty of felony, and who had fled to a place of sanctuary, whereby he solemnly engaged to leave the kingdom for ever.

Abjuration is now used to signify the renouncing, disclaiming, and denying upon oath, the Pretender to have any kind of right to the crown of these kingdoms.

Abjuration of Heresy, the solemn recantation of any doctrine as false and wicked.
