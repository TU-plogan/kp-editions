ALGARVE, a province of Portugal, the most southern of the kingdom. It is divided from the Spanish province of Andalusia by the river Guadiana. On the north it i s bounded by the province of Alentejo, and on the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean. It is the smallest division of Portugal, and is very thinly peopled. Its extent is 232 square leagues, and the number of inhabitants 127,615. On the northern part, towards Alentejo, the Sierras de Caldeyraron and Monchique rise to a great height. The roads are very bad, the soil unfruitful, and the inhabitants few in those districts. Numerous flocks of goats are bred, and some other cattle are pastured. The country on the coast is more fruitful, and produces abundant harvests of grapes, figs, oranges, lemons, olives, and almonds, considerable quantities of which are shipped from the seaport to the different countries in the north of Europe. Very little wheat or other corn is grown in this province, but the inhabitants draw their principal supply from the adjoining provinces of Spain. On the coasts the people derive their subsistence in a great measure from the fisheries; and both the tunny and sardinias are caught in very considerable quantities. The rivers are of short course, running from north to south,and at their mouths vessels may enter at high tide; but the harbours on the whole coast are bad, though near Tavira, the principal city, some islands afford shelter, and allow of good anchorage for large vessels behind them. The whole of the foreign trade from the various ports in Algarve is carried on in the vessels of other countries, as there are scarcely any other than fishing boats owned by the inhabitants of the ports. The name Algarve is derived from an Arabic word which signifies westward. The province is designated by the name of kingdom, and gives one of the titles to the Portuguese monarch. This province contains 4 cities, 14 towns, 63 villages, 71 parishes, and 25,503 hearths. It is situated between lat. 36.56. and 37.30. N.
