AMHAR, or Amhara, a province of Abyssinia, said to extend 40 leagues from east to west. It is considered as the most noble in the whole empire, both on account of its being the usual residence of the Abyssinian monarchs, and having a peculiar dialect, which is become the language of the court. Here is the famed rock Amba-geshen, where the young monarchs were formerly confined.
