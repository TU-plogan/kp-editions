ACILIUS GLABRIO, Marcus, consul in the year of Rome 562, and 211 years before the Christian era, distinguished himself by his bravery and conduct in gaining a complete victory over Antiochus the Great, king of Syria, at the Straits of Thermopylae in Thessaly, and on several other occasions. He built the temple of Piety at Rome, in consequence of a vow which he made before this battle. He is mentioned by Pliny, Valerius Maximus, and others.
