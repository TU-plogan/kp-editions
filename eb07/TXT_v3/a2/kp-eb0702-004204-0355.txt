ABRASAX, or Abraxas, the supreme god of the Basilidian heretics. It is a mystical or cabbalistic word, composed of the Greek letters c¢, ĉ, g, α, ξ, α , ς, which together, according to the Grecian mode of numeration, make up the number 365. For Basilides taught, that there were 365 heavens between the earth and the empyrean; each of which heavens had its angel or intelligence, which created it; each of which angels likewise was created by the angel next above it; thus ascending by a scale to the Supreme Being, or first Creator. The Basilidians used the word Abraxas by way of charm or amulet.
