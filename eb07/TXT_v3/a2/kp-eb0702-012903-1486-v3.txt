ACROSTIC, in Poetry, a kind of poetical composition, disposed in such a manner that the initial letters of the verses form the name of some person, kingdom, place, motto, &c. The word is compounded of the Greek ακgoς, extremity, and στιχος, verse. The acrostic is considered by the critics as a species of false wit, and is therefore very little regarded by the moderns.
