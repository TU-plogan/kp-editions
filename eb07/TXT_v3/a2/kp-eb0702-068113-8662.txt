ANAGOGICAL signifies mysterious, transporting, and is used to express whatever elevates the mind, not only to the knowledge of divine things, but of divine things in the next life. This word is seldom used but with regard to the different senses of the Scripture. The anagogical sense is, when the sacred text is explained with regard to eternal life, the point which Christians should have in view: for example, the rest of the Sabbath, in the anagogical sense, signifies the repose of everlasting happiness.
