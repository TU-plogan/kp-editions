ACATALECTIC, a term in ancient poetry for such verses as have all their feet or syllables, in contradistinction to those that have a syllable too few. The first verse of the two following from Horace is acatalectic or complete, the last catalectic or deficient.
Solvitur acris hiems grata vice veris et Favonî,
Trahuntque siccas machinae carinas.
