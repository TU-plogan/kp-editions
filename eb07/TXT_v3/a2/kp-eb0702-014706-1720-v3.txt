ADEL, a kingdom on the eastern coast of Africa, which reaches as far as the Straits of Babelmandel, which unite the Red Sea to the sea of Arabia. This country produces corn, and feeds a great number of cattle. The [7:2:148] inhabitants carry on a trade in gold, silver, ivory, oil, frankincense, a sort of pepper, and other merchandises of Arabia and the Indies. The king was formerly a vassal to the grand ncgus of Abyssinia; but being Mahometans, and the Abyssinians a sort of Christians, they could not agree, and in 1535 came to an open rupture, when the Adelians threw off the yoke, seeking protection from the grand signior. The principal places are Adela, seated in the centre of the country, and the town where the king resides.
