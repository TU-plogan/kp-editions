ABIANS, or Abii, anciently a people of Thrace, or (according to some authors) of Scythia. They had no fixed habitations, but led a wandering life; dwelling on waggons, which carried all their possessions. They lived on the flesh of their herds and flocks, on milk and cheese, chiefly on that of marc’s milk. They were unacquainted with commerce, and only exchanged commodities with their neighbours. Besides these, many other qualities and habits are ascribed to them, which are justly regarded as fictitious.
