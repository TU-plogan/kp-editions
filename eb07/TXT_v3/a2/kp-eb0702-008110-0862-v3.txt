ACATIUM, in Ancient Navigation, a kind of boat or pinnace used for military purposes. The acatium was a species of those vessels called naves actuariae, i. e. such as were wrought with oars. It was sometimes made use of in battle. Strabo describes it as a privateer or pirate sloop, and Suidas as a fishing vessel.
