AERIANS, in Church History, a branch of Arians, who to the doctrines of that sect added some peculiar dogmas of their own; as, that there is no difference between bishops and priests,—a doctrine maintained by many modern divines, particularly of the presbyterian and reformed churches. The sect received its denomination from Aerius, an Arminian priest of the fourth century.

Flos AERIS, among alchemists, small scales procured from copper melted by a strong heat; it is sometimes used for aerugo or verdigris.
