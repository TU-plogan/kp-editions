ALEMANIA, or Allemania, in Ancient Geography, a name of Germany, but not known before the time of the Antonines, and then used only for a part. After the Marcomanni and their allies had removed from the Rhine, a rabble or collection of people from all parts of Gaul, as the term Alemanni denotes, prompted either by levity or poverty, occupied the lands, called Decumates by Tacitus, because they held them on a tithe; now supposed to be the duchy of Wirtemberg. Such appear to have been the small beginnings of Alemania, which was in after-times greatly enlarged; but still it was considered as a distinct part; for Caracalla, who conquered the Alemanni, assumed the surname both of Alemannicus and Germanicus.
