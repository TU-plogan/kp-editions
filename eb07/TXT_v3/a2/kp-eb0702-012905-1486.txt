ACROSTOLIUM, in ancient naval architecture, the extreme part of the ornament used on the prows of ships, which was sometimes in the shape of a buckler, helmet, animal, &c. but more frequently circular, or spiral. It was usual to tear them from the prows of vanquished vessels, and fix them to those of the conquerors, as a signal of victory. They were frequently represented on the reverse of ancient medals.
