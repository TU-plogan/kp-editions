ACCOMPLISHMENT, the entire execution or fulfilling of any thing.

Accomplishment is principally used in speaking of events foretold by the Jewish prophets in the Old Testament, and fulfilled under the New. We say a literal accomplishment, a mystical or spiritual accomplishment, a single accomplishment, a double accomplishment, a Jewish accomplishment, a Christian, a Heathen accomplishment. The same prophecy is sometimes accomplished in all or in several of those different ways. Thus, of some of the prophecies of the Old Testament, the Jews find a literal accomplishment in their own history, about the time when the prophecy was given; the Christians find another in Christ, or the earliest days of the church; the Heathens: another in some of their emperors; the Mahometans, another in their legislator, &c. There are two principal, ways of accomplishing a prophecy; directly, and by accommodation. See Accommodation, and Prophecy.
