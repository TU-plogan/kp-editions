ACULER, in the Manege, is used for the motion of a horse when, in working upon volts, he does not go far enough forward at every time or motion, so that his shoulders embrace or take in too little ground, and his croupe comes too near the centre of the volt. Horses are naturally inclined to this fault in making demi-volts.
