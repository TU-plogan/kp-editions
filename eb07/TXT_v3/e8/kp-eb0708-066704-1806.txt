ELFSBORG, a province in the southern part of Sweden. It is bounded on the north by Carlstadt, on the north-cast by Wenar, on the east by Skaraborg, on the south-east by Jonkoping, on the south-west by Helmstadt, and on the west by Gottcborg. It extends over 3106 square miles, is divided into six bailiwicks, comprehends five cities, one market-town, and 4266 rural establishments, and contains 156,271 inhabitants. The land is generally mountainous and stony, or marshy and sandy, and yet produces corn nearly sufficient for the demand; but that demand is considerably lessened by the supply of potatoes, ruta baga, and other vegetables. It also produces some hemp and flax. The woods are the chief sources of the means of subsistence, by the employment they give to the labourers in cutting down, sawing, and conveying timber to the sea. The chief place is Wer-nersburg.
