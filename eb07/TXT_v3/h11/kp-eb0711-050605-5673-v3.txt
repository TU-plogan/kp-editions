HOHENGEROLDSECK, a small territory denominated a grafschaft or county, belonging to the empire of Austria. It is the only part of the dominion detached from the rest, and is surrounded by the territory of the Prince of Baden. It extends over fifty square miles, and contains about 5000 inhabitants. It is composed chiefly of hills, which form part of the Black Forest, the highest of which, called the Schimburg, has an extensive prospect over the Rhine. There are in it some mines of lead and silver. The soil is fruitful in corn, and the valleys afford good pasturage.
