HERMIONE, in Ancient Geography, a considerable city of Argolis. Excepting a few temples, it was in ruins in the time of Pausanias, who says that the new city was situated at the distance of four stadia from the promontory on which stood the temple of Neptune. It gave name to the Sinus Hermionicus, a part of the Sinus Argolicus.
