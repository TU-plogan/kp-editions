HERMESIANAX, a poet of Colophon, in Asia Minor, of whose private history we know scarcely any thing. He seems to have flourished about b. c. 280, at the same time as Theocritus, and was the author of three books of elegies, which he addressed to his mistress Leontium, as Propertius did to Cynthia. Athenaeus (xiii. 597) has preserved ninety-eight verses of a very beautiful elegy, which has been published separately by Weston in his Conjec-turoe in Athenoeum, Lond. 1784. Van Santen has translated it into Latin verse under the title of Tentamen Her· mesianacteum, as also Rigler and Axti (Colon. 1828). The best edition is by Bach (Hale, 1829). See Leontjum.
