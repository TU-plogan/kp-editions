HELVETII, a people of Belgica, in the neighbourhood of the Allobroges and the Provincia Romana. They were famed for bravery and a predilection for war. The Civitas Helvetia was divided into four pagi or cantons, situated to the south and west of the Rhine, by which they were divided from the Germans; and extending towards Gaul, from which they were separated by Mount Jura on the west, and by the Rhone and the Leman Lake on the south, and therefore called a Gallic nation. (Tacitus, Caesar, Strabo, Ptolemy, Pliny.)
