HOP, a plant of great importance in brewing. This plant was originally brought into England from the Netherlands in the year 1524. Hops are first mentioned in the English statute book in the year 1552, viz. in the 5th and 6th of Edward VI. c. 5. And by an act of parliament of the first year of James I. c. 18, it appears that hops were then produced in abundance in England.
