HILBURGHAUSEN, a city, the capital of the duchy of Saxe-Hilburghausen, in Germany. It stands on the right bank of the river Werra, is surrounded with walls, and contains the magnificent palace of the sovereign, two Lutheran churches and one Reformed, and several other public buildings. It is divided into three parts, the old town, the new, and the suburbs, which together have a population of 3820 persons, in 362 houses. It is a place of little commerce, and depends chiefly on the trade arising from the court, and from being the residence of the officers of the several boards of law and revenue.
