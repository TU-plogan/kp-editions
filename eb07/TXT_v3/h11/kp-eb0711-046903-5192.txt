HISSAR Ferozch, a large district of Hindustan, in the province of Delhi, situated between the 28th and 30th degrees of north latitude, on the western side of the river Jumna. The country is fertile, but labours under a scarcity of water, which detracts from its fertility. It is only watered by one small stream, namely, the Sursutty. In order to supply the means of irrigation, one of the Afghan emperors, who lived in the fourteenth century, caused two canals to be cut, one from the Sutledge and the other from the Jumna, both of which joined at the city of Hissar, whence they are supposed to have been divided into a number of branches, so that the water was nearly all distributed over the lands, and the remainder fell into a lake called Bhedar. Under the influence of this extensive irrigation the country became fertile, and yielded two abundant crops in the year; and, from this circumstance, a part of it received the name of Hurriana, or the verdant mead. All these great works are now ruined; but the country still produces horses, camels, and cattle. The inhabitants are chiefly Jauts, with the exception of a few Rajpoots; there are also villages of Rajpoots who have embraced the Mahommedan religion. This district imports matchlocks, swords, coarse white cloth, salt, sugar, and a small quantity of rice and spices. The exports are horses, camels, bullocks, and ghee. The chief towns are Hissar, Hansy, and Ferozch. During the prosperity of the Mogul government, this district was considered the personal estate of the heir apparent to the throne. It is now parcelled out amongst a number of native chiefs. The town of Hissar is the capital of the district. It was built by Sultan Feroz, who gave previous directions for the digging of the two canals above mentioned; after which he laid the foundations of the town and fortress, which he built of stone brought from the neighbouring hills of Nosa, and was completed in less than three years.
