HUMECTATION, formed of humour, moisture, moistening, in pharmacy, the preparing of a medicine by steeping it for a time in water, in order to soften and moisten it; or to cleanse it, or prevent its subtile parts from being dissipated in grinding, or the like.

Humectation is also used for the application of moistening remedies. In this sense we say, embrocations, em-plasters, unctions, humectations, fomentations, and so on.
