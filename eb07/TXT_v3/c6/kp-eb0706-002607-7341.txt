CALLISTEA, in Grecian Antiquity, a Lesbian festival, in which the women presented themselves in Juno’s temple, and the prize was assigned to the fairest. There was another of these contentions at the festival of Ceres Eleusinia among the Parrhasians, and another among the Eleans, where the most beautiful man was presented with a complete suit of armour, which he consecrated to Minerva, to whose temple he walked in procession, being accompanied by his friends, who adorned him with ribbons, and crowned him with a garland of myrtle.
