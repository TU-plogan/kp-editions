CAPISCOLUS, or Capiscnolus, in ecclesiastical writers, denotes a dignitary in certain cathedrals, who had the superintendence of the choir or band of music, and answers to what in other churches is called chanter or precentor. The word is also written cabiscolus and caput-scholoe, meaning the head of the school or band of music. The capiscolus is also called scholasticus, as having the instruction of the young clerks and choristers in the performance of their duty.
