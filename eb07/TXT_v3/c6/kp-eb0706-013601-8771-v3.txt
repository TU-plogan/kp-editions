CARDASS, a sort of card, proper for carding flocks of silk, to make cappadine of it. It is also the name which the French give to those flocks of silk.

Cardass is also the name which, in the cloth manufactories of Languedoc, they give to a sort of large card, which is used for carding the dyed wool designed for making cloth of mixed colours.
