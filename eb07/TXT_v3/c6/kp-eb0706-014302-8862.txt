CARLOS, San, a city of South America, in the province and government of Venezuela. It is situated on the river Aguirre, and is large, handsome, and well divided. Like a number of other towns in the South American provinces, it was founded by the missionaries. The inhabitants, who are chiefly Spaniards from the Canary Islands, display considerable enterprise and industry. Their wealth consists mainly of cattle, and the principal agricultural products are indigo and coffee. The heat experienced at San Carlos is great, and would be almost intolerable but for the north-east wind which frequently blows here. The population amounts to about 10,000. It is 180 miles southwest of Caraccas. Lat. 9. 20. N.
