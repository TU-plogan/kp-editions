CEIMELIA, from κιιμα ∣ , to be laid up, in Antiquity, denotes choice or precious pieces of furniture or ornaments, reserved or laid up for extraordinary occasions and uses. In this sense sacred garments, vessels, and the like, are reputed of the ceimelia of a church. Medals, antique stones, figures, manuscripts, records, and the like, are the ceimelia of men of letters.
