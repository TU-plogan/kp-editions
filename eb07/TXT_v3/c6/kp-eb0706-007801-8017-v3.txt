CANDLEMAS, a feast of the church held on the second day of February, in honour of the purification of the Virgin Mary. It is borrowed from the practice of the ancient Christians, who on that day used abundance of lights both in their churches and processions, in memory, as is supposed, of our Saviour’s being on that day declared by Simon to be a light to lighten the Gentiles. In imitation of this custom, the Roman Catholics on this day consecrate all the tapers and candles which they use in their churches during the whole year. At Rome, the pope perforins that ceremony himself, and distributes wax-candles to the cardinals and others, who carry them in procession through the great hall of the pope’s palace. This ceremony was prohibited in England by an order of council in 1548.

Candlemas, the second of February, is one of the four terms of the year for paying or receiving rents or borrowed money, and the like. In the courts of law Candlemas term begins 15th January and ends 3d February.
