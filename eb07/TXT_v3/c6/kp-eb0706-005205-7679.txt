CAMPO Mayor, a town of Portugal, on the frontiers of Spain, in the province of Alentejo. It is about three leagues from Elvas, the fortress opposed to the Spanish frontier city of Badajos. It is on a barren soil, and produces scarcely food sufficient for the inhabitants; it possesses two forts and a castle, and contains 243 houses.
