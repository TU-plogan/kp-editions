CALLIGRAPHY, the art of fair writing. Callicrates is said to have written an elegant distich on a sesamum seed. Junius speaks of a person, as very extraordinary, who wrote the apostles’ creed and the beginning of St John’s Gospel in the compass of a farthing. What would he have said of our famous Peter Bale, who, in 1575, wrote the Lord’s prayer, creed, ten commandments, and two short prayers in Latin, with his own name, motto, day of the month, year of our Lord, and reign of the queen, in the compass of a single penny, enchased in a ring and border of gold, and covered with a crystal, all so accurately wrought as to be perfectly legible?
