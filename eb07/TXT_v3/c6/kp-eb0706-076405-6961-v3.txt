CLISTHENES, a famous Athenian magistrate, the author of the mode of banishing ambitious citizens by ostracism, or writing their names upon a shell; in other words, by a species of ballot. The intention was patriotic, but, like all other human institutions, it was abused; and some of the worthiest citizens of Athens were thus exiled. Clisthenes died 510 years before Christ.
