CANINI, John Angelo and Marc Anthony, brothers and Romans, celebrated for their love of antiquities. John excelled in designs for engraving on stones, particularly heads, and Marc engraved them. They were encouraged by Colbert to publish a succession of heads of the heroes and great men of antiquity, designed from medals, antique stones, and other ancient remains; but John died at Rome soon after the work was begun. Mare Anthony, however, procured assistance, finished, and published it in Italian in 1669. The cuts of this edition were engraved by Canini, Picard, and Valet; and a curious explanation is given, which discovers the skill of the Caninis in history and mythology. The French edition of Amsterdam, in 1731, is spurious.
