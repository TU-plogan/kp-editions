CHAPELLE, Claudius Emanuel Luillier, the natural son of Francis Luillier, took the name of Chapelle from a village between Paris and St Denys, where he was born. He distinguished himself by writing small pieces of poetry, in which he discovered great delicacy, an easy turn, and an admirable felicity of expression. He was the friend of Gassendi and Molière, and died in 1686.
