CAPUT, the head.

Caput Baronice, the head of the barony, in ancient customs, denotes the ancient or chief seat or castle of a nobleman, where he had his usual residence, and held his court; and sometimes also called caput honoris, or the head of the honour. The caput baronice could not be settled in dowry, nor could it be divided among the daughters in case there was no son to inherit, but was to descend entirc to the eldest daughter, caeteris filiabus aliunde satisfactis. Caput Lupinum. Anciently an outlawed felon was said to have caput lupinum, and might be knocked on the head like a wolf, by any one who should meet him; because, having renounced all law, he was to be dealt with as in a state of nature, when every one who should find him might slay him.

Caput Mortuum, a Latin name given to fixed and exhausted residuums remaining in retorts after distillations.
