CHEMNITZ, or Chemnitius, Martin, a famous Lutheran divine, the disciple of Mclancthon, was born at Britzen, in Brandenburg, in 1522. He was employed in several important negotiations by the princes of the Lutheran communion, and he died in April 1589. His principal work is Examem Concilii Tridentini, Frankfort, 1585, in 4 vols. fol. and 4to. This work comprises a course of theology for the use of the Protestant churches. Another production of Chemnitz, scarcely less celebrated than his Examination of the Council of Trent, is his Treatise on Indulgences., which was translated from Latin into French, and printed at Geneva in 1599, 8vo.
