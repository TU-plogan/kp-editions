CARLOTA, a town of Spain, in the province of Cordova. It is one of those new establishments, founded with a view to cultivate the Sierra Morena. It is near the confluence of the rivers Guadalquivir and Xenil. The cultivation of the Sierra Morena by German colonists was the project of the meritorious but unfortunate Olavide, and was conducted by him with great judgment. It would have been crowned with ultimate success, but for his being subjected to the power of the Inquisition, which by his imprisonment first checked it; and it was subsequently impeded by the war of independence which so long desolated Spain. This town contains 900 inhabitants.
