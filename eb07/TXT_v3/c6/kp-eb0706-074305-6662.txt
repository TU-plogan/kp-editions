CLIENT, among the Romans, a citizen who put himself under the protection of some great man, who, in respect of that relation, was called patron. This patron assisted his client with his protection, interest, and goods; and the client gave his vote for his patron, when the latter sought any office for himself or his friends. Clients owed respect to their patrons, and patrons owed their clients protection. The right of patronage was appointed by Romulus, in order to unite the rich and the poor in such a manner as that the one might live without contempt, and the other without envy; but the condition of a client became in course of time little else than a species of servitude.

Client is now used to signify a party in a law-suit, who has entrusted his cause into the hands of a counsellor or solicitor.
