CASE, among grammarians, implies the different inflections or terminations of nouns, serving to express the different relations they bear to each other, and to the things they represent.

Case also denotes a receptacle for various articles; as a case of knives, of lancets, of pistols, and the like.

Case, in printing, a large flat oblong frame, placed aslope, and divided into several compartments or little square cells, in each of which are lodged a number of types or letters of the same kind, whence the compositor takes them out, each as he needs it, to compose his matter. See Printing. Case- Shot, in the military art, musket-balls, stones, old iron, &c. put into cases, and shot out of great guns.
