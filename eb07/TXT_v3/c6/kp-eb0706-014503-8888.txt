CARLSRUHE, a city of Germany, the capital of the dominions of the Grand Duke of Baden. It is situated in the valley of the Rhine, about three miles from that stream, and 376 feet above the level of the sea. The city is built in a peculiar form, eight principal streets proceeding from a circular centre, and not unlike the stick of a fan when open, which produces a very striking effect in spite of the dulness of uniformity. The palace of the duke, and the other public buildings, arc, some tasteful, some magnificent; and the institutions for education, for charity, as well as the library, the museums, and various collections, are appropriate and well conducted. The inhabitants amount to 15,789, of whom 9299 are Lutherans, 4417 Catholics, 642 Calvinists, with some other sectaries, and a few Jews. It is a place of sonic trade, but chiefly confined to the sale of the various productions needed by the inhabitants of the duchy. The environs are beautiful, owing to the groves through which the roads to the city pass. Long. 8. 15. 25. E. Lat. 48. 59. 55. N.
