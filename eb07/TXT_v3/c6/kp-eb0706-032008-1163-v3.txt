CHAPPEL, William, a learned and pious bishop of Cork, Cloyne, and Ross, in Ireland, was born in Nottinghamshire in 1582. When the troubles began under Charles I. he was prosecuted by the puritan party in parliament, and retired to Derby, where he devoted himself to study till his death in 1649. He wrote Methodus Cοnciοηαndi, or the Method of Preaching; and he is one of those to whom the Whole Duty of Man has been attributed. He left behind him also his own life, written by himself in Latin, which has been twice printed.
