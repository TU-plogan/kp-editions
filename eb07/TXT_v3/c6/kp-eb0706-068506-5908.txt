CHUNAR, a district of Hindustan, in the province of Allahabad, situated between the 25th and 26th degrees of north latitude. It is bounded on the north by the Ganges, on the east by Caramnassa, on the south by the Soane, and on the west by the Tonse. It was formerly part of the zemindary of Benares, and was ceded to the English in 1775, along with the whole province. The northern and eastern parts are the most fertile, and carry on a flourishing commerce and manufactures. Towards the south, where the country is penetrated by the Vindhy chain of hills, which extend so far across Hindustan, to the north of the Nerbuddah, it is mountainous, woody, and uncultivated. The chief towns are Chunar, Mirzapore, Catrah, Luteefgur, and Bidzigur, which last is now in ruins.
