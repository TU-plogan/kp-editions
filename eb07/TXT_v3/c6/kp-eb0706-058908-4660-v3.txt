CHIONE, in fabulous history, was daughter of Daedalion, of whom Apollo and Mercury both became enamoured. To enjoy her company, Mercury lulled her to sleep with his caduceus; but,- under the form of an old woman, Apollo, in the night, obtained the same favours as Mercury. From these embraces Chione became mother of Philammon and Autolycus; the former of whom, being son of Apollo, became an excellent musician; while the latter, no doubt from his paternity also, became equally notorious for those robberies of which his father Mercury was supposed to be the patron. Chione became so proud of her commerce with the gods, that she even preferred her beauty to that of Juno; for which impious arrogance she was killed by the queen goddess, and changed into a hawk. There is another personage of the same name, who was daughter of Boreas and Orithia, and had Eumolpus by Neptune. She threw her son into the sea, but he was preserved by his father.
