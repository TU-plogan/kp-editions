CHAMPAGNY’S Archipelago comprehends a group of islands, amounting to about twenty, of which the largest[7:6:315] is not above nine miles in length. They are situated on the north-west coast of New Holland, and were so called by the French expedition of 1S00. They are in general sterile, and of an irregular figure. The surrounding seas abound with fish.
