SEQUIN, a gold coin, struck at Venice, and in several parts of the grand signior’s dominions. In Turkey it is called dahob, or piece of gold, and, according to Volney, is in value about 6s. 3d. sterling. It varies, however, considerably in its value in different countries. At Venice it is equal to about 9s. 2d. sterling.
