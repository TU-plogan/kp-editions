SPHERE is a solid contained under one uniform round surface, every point of which is equally distant from a cer tain point in the middle called its centre; and is formed by the revolution of a semicircle about its diameter.

Sphere, in Astronomy, that concave orb or expanse which invests our globe, and in which the heavenly bodies appear to be fixed, and at equal distance from the eye.
