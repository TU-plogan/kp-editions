SUPINE, in Latin grammar, part of the conjugation of a verb, being a verbal substantive of the singular number and the fourth declension. There are two kinds of supines; one, called the first supine, ending in urn of the accusative case, which is always of an active signification, and follows a verb of motion, as abiit deambulatum; the other, called the last supine, and ending in u of the ablative case, is of a passive signification, and is governed by substantives or adjectives, as facile dictu.
