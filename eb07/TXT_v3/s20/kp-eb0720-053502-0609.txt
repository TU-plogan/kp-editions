SPEUSIPPUS, an Athenian philosopher, the nephew and successor of Plato. Contrary to the practice of his mas ter, Speusippus required from his pupils a stated gratuity. He placed statues of the Graces in the school which Plato had built. On account of his infirm state of health, he was commonly carried to and from the Academy in a ve hicle. On his way thither he one day met Diogenes, and saluted him: the surly philosopher refused to return the sa 1ute, and told him, that such a feeble wretch ought to be ashamed to live; Speusippus replied, that he lived not in his limbs, but in his mind. At length being wholly incapacitated, by a paralytic stroke, for the duties of the chair, he resigned it to Xenocrates. He is said to have been of a violent temper, fond of pleasure, and exceedingly avaricious. Speusippus wrote many philosophical works, which are now lost, but which Aristotle thought sufficiently valuable to purchase at the expense of three talents. From a few fragments which remain of his philosophy, it appears that he adhered very strictly to the doctrine of his master.
