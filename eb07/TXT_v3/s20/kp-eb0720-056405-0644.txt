STARLINGS, or Sterlings, the name given to the strong pieces of timber which were driven into the bed of the river to protect the piles, on the top of which were laid the flat beams upon which were built the bases of the stone piers that support the arches of London bridge. In general, starlings are large piles placed on the outside of the foundation of the piers of bridges, to break the force of the water, and to protect the stone work from injury by floating ice. They are otherwise called jettes, and their place is often supplied by large stones thrown at random round the piers of bridges, as may be seen at Stirling bridge when the river is low; and as was done by Mr. Smeaton’s direction round the piers of the centre arch of London bridge, when it was thought in danger of being undermined by the current.
