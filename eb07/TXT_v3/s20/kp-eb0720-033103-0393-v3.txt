SIFANTO, or Siphanto, an island of the Archipelago, west of Paros, north-east of Milo, and south-west of Ser-phanto. The air is so good here, that many of the inhabitants live to the age of a hundred and twenty; and their water, fruits, wild fowl, and poultry, are excellent, but more especially the grapes. It abounds with marble and granite, and is one of the most fertile and best cultivated of these islands. The inhabitants employ themselves in cultivating olive-trees and capers; and they have very good silk. They trade in figs, onions, wax, honey, and straw-hats, and may be about eight thousand in all. E. Long. 25. 15. N. Lat. 37. 9.
