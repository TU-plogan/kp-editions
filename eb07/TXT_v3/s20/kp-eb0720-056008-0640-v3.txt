STAMINA, in Botany, are those upright filaments which, on opening a flower, we find within the corolla surrounding the pistillum. According to Linnaeus, they are the male organs of generation, whose office it is to prepare the pollen. Each stamen consists of two distinct parts, viz. the filamentum and the anthera.

Stamina , in the animal body, are defined to be those simple original parts which existed first in the embryo or even in the seed; and by whose distinction, augmentation, and accretion by additional juices, the animal body at its utmost bulk is supposed to be formed.
