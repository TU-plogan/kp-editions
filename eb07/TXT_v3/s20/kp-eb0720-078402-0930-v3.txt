STUDY (Ital. Studio), a piece of instrumental music composed for the purpose of familiarizing the player with some of the difficulties of his instrument. Thus we have studies for the violin by Fiorillo, Kreuzer, Rode, Spohr, Paganini; and for the pianoforte by Clementi, Cramer, Kalkbretmer, and others.
