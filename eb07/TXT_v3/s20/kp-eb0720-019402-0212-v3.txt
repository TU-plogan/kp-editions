SHEATHING, in the nautical language, is the casing of that part of a ship which is to be under water, with firboard an inch thick; first laying hair and tar mixed together under the boards, and then nailing them on, in order to prevent worms from eating the ship’s bottom. Ships of war are now generally sheathed with copper; but copper sheathing is liable to be corroded by the action of salt water, and something is still wanting to effect this purpose. It is very probable that tar might answer very well.
