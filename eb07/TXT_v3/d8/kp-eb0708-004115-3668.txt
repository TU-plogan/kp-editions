DISPART, in Gunnery, is the setting a mark upon the muzzle ring, or thereabouts, of a piece of ordnance, so that a sight-line taken upon the top of the base ring against the touch-hole, by the mark set on or near the muzzle, may be parallel to the axis of the concave cylinder. The common way of doing this is to take the two diameters of the base ring, and of the place where the dispart is to stand, and divide the difference between them into two equal parts, one of which will be the length of the dispart which is set on the gun with wax or pitch, or fastened there with a piece of twine or marlin. By means of an instrument it may be done with all possible nicety.
