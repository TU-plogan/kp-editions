DIVESTING properly signifies undressing or stripping off one’s garment, in contradistinction to investing. In law it is used for the act of surrendering or relinquishing one’s effects. By a contract of donation or sale, the donor or seller is said to be disseised and divested of his property in such a commodity, and the donee or purchaser becomes invested therewith. A demise is a general divestiture which the fathers and mothers make of all their effects in favour of their children.
