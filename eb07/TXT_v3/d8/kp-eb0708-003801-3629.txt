DIPONDIUS, in the language of Scripture, is used by St Luke to signify a certain coin which was of very little value. Our translation of the passage is, “Are not two sparrows sold for two farthings ?” In St Matthew, who relates the same thing, we read “Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing ?” The Greek reads assarion instead of as. Now assarion, according to some, was worth half an as, that is to say, four French deniers and⅛th; and, according to others, two deniers and -⅛th. Dipondius seems rather to signify half an as. See Calmet, Diction. Bibl.; Luke, xii. 6; Matt. x. 29. But Dr Arbuthnot differs in opinion from the author last quoted. He says that this coin was at first libralis, or of a pound weight; and that even when diminished, it retained the name of libella. So that dipondius denotes two asses.
