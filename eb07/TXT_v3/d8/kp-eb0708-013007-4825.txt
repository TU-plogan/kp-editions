DOVE. See Ornithology. Dove Island, a small island in Torres Strait, on the north coast of New Holland, about a mile and a half in circuit. The fragrance of the trees and shrubs with which it is covered perfumes the air.

Dove- Tailing, in carpentry, is the manner of fastening boards together by letting one piece into another in the form of the tail of a dove. The dove-tail is the strongest of the assemblages or joinings, because the tenon, or piece of wood which is put into the - other, goes widening to the extreme, so that it cannot be drawn out again, by reason that the extreme or tip is bigger than the hole.
