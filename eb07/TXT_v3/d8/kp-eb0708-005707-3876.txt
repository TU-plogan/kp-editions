DIVERSIFYING, in Rhetoric, is of infinite service to the orator; it is an accomplishment essential to his character, and may fitly be called the subject of all his tropes and figures. Vossius lays down six ways of diversifying a subject: 1. By enlarging on what was briefly mentioned before; 2. by a concise enumeration of what had been insisted on at length; 3. by adding something new to what is repeated; 4. by repeating only the principal heads of what had been said; 5. by transposing the words and periods; 6. by imitating them.
