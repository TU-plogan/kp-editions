DINOCRATES, a celebrated architect of Macedonia, who rebuilt the temple of Ephesus, when burnt by Ero-stratus, with much more magnificence than before. Vitruvius informs us that Dinocrates proposed to Alexander the Great to convert Mount Athos into the figure of a man, whose left hand should contain a walled city, whilst all the rivers of the mount should flow into his right, and thence into the sea. He also conceived a scheme for building the dome of the temple of Arsinoë at Alexandria of loadstone, that by its attraction it should hold her iron image in the centre, suspended in the air; projects which at least showed great boldness and conception.
