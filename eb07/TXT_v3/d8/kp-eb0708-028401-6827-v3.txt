DUNSE, a market-town of Scotland, in the district of Merse, Berwickshire. It is situated on a rising ground in the middle of the shire, and though not the county town, is by far the largest and most respectable place in Berwickshire. It is a burgh of barony, and is governed by a bailie. The town is of great antiquity, and was frequently destroyed in the Border wars. As seen from any point around, Dunse has the appearance of a city, and on closer inspection it is found to possess a respectable proportion of good houses. In the market-place stands the townhouse, an elegant modern building, in the Gothic style. Besides a parish church, Dunse possesses two Seeeder meeting-houses and a Relief chapel. There is here a week ly market, and four fairs for sheep and three for horses and cattle annually. Dunse is considered as the birthplace of the famous John Duns Scotus. A mile south of the town is a well of mineral water, which is a powerful chalybeate. The population in 1821 amounted to 3773, and in 1831 to 3469.
