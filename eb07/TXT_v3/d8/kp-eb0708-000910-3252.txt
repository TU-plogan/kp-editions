DICAEARCHUS, a scholar of Aristotle, who composed a great number of books, which were much esteemed. Cicero and his friend Pomponius Atticus valued him highly. He wrote a book to prove that men suffer more mischief from one another than from all evils besides; and the work which he composed concerning the republic of Lacedaemon was extremely honoured, and read every year before the youth in the assembly of the ephori. Geography was one of his principal studies, on which science there is a fragment of a treatise of his still extant, and preserved among the Veteris Geographice Scriptores minores. ∣
