DUILLIUS Nepos, C., a Roman consul, the first who obtained a victory over the naval power of Carthage, in the year of Rome 492. He captured fifty of the enemy’s ships, and was honoured with a naval triumph, the first of the kind ever granted at Rome. The senate rewarded his valour by permitting him to have music playing and torches lighted at the public expense every day while he was at supper. Some medals were struck in commemoration of his victory; and there exists a column at Rome which was erected on the occasion.
