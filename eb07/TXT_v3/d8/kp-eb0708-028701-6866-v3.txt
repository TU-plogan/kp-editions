DUQUELLA, a province of Morocco, about seventy-five miles long and sixty broad. It is chiefly remarkable in an agricultural point of view for the production of a species of water melon, which grows to a prodigious size. Grain is also raised, but not in such quantities as in some other parts of the empire. Goats are bred in immense numbers, and their skins form one of the principal articles of export from Mogadore. Honey and wax are in great abundance. The inhabitants are industrious, and much inclined to commerce.
