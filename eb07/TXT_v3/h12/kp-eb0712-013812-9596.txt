HYPOGLOTTIS, or Hypoglossis, composed of ⅛o, zrnder, and yλω-rα, tongue, in Anatomy, is a name given to two glands of the tongue. There are four large glands of the tongue; two of them, called hypoglottides, are situated under it, near the venae ranulares, one on each side of the tongue. They serve to secrete a kind of serous matter of the nature of saliva, which is discharged into the mouth by little ducts near the gums.

Hypoglottis, or Hypoglossis, in Medicine, denotes an inflammation or ulceration under the tongue, called also ranula.
