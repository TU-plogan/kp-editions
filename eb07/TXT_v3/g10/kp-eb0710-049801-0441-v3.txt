GHORE, or Ghour, a considerable district of Afghanistan, situated between the thirty-fifth and thirty-seventh degrees of north latitude, and the sixty-seventh and sixty-ninth degrees of east longitude. This was formerly one of the Persian governments; but in the twelfth century its chiefs became independent, overturned the Ghiznian empire, and carried their arms as far as Benares. One of their slaves named Cuttub founded, about the year 1206, the Mahommedan kingdom of Delhi. This-country was overrun in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries by the armies of Genghis Khan and Tamerlane, and it is now in possession of the Usbec Tartars. The Ghory tribe, being of pastoral habits, have emigrated to the vicinity of Peshawer, and are now subdivided into three tribes. Its chief towns are Ghore and Firoy Koh. Ghore is the name of the capital, and was once the residence of a long line of. sovereigns. It was taken by the king of Kharezm, and was subsequently sacked by the armies of Genghis and Tamerlane, from which it has never recovered, and is now scarcely known. Long. 67. 48. E. Lat. 35. 45.
