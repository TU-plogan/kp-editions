GHEP, or Gheep, a district of Hindustan, in the province of Lahore, situated principally between the thirty-second and thirty-third degrees of north latitude. It is bounded on the north-west by Sohaan, and on the southeast by Jhylum rivers. It produces a considerable quantity of fossil salt, great part of which is exported to the more eastern and southern provinces of Hindustan. Part of it belongs to the Sikkβ, and the remainder to the Afghans. The principal towns are Pirhala, Muckealab, and Varsha.
