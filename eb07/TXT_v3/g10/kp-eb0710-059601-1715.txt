GOELWARAH, a district of Hindustan, in the province of Gujrat, situated within the 2lst and 22d parallels of north latitude, and bounded on the east by the Gulf of Cambay. The greater part of this country, adjacent to the Gulf of Cambay, was ceded by the Mahratta chief the Guicowar, in 1805, in part payment of the subsidiary force supplied for his protection. It is famous for a breed of cattle, and its chief town is Gogo.
