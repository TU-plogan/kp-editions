GERONTES, in Antiquity, a kind of judges, or magistrates, in ancient Sparta, answering to what the Areopagites were at Athene. The word is Greek, ytļm, and signifies an old man, whence also the words gerontie, some thing belonging to an old man; and Geronieon, a famous book amongst the modern Greeks, containing the lives of the ancient monks. The senate of Gerontes was called Gerusia, that is, an assembly or council of old men. The Gerontes were originally instituted by Lycurgus ;' and their number, according to some, was twenty-eight, but according to others, thirty-two. They governed in conjunction with the king, whose authority they were intended to balance, and also to watch over the interests of the people. Polybius defines their office in few words, when he says, per ipsos, et cum ipsis, omnia administrari. None were to be admitted into this office under sixty years of age, and they held it for life. The Gerontes were succeeded by the Ephori.
