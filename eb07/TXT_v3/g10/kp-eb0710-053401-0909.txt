GLARUS, one of the Swiss cantons, is bounded on the north and on the east by St Gall, on the south by the canton of Gray Bunden, and on the west by those of Uri and Schwytz. It extends over 467 square miles, and contains 26,570 inhabitants. The canton consists of two valleys between the snow-covered mountains Todi, 11,037, and Kistenberg, 10,690, feet in height, towards the south; and towards the north the mountains of less elevation, viz. the Garn, the Hausstoch, the Martinsloch, the Plattenburg, and the Schilt, which vary from 6300 to 8800feet in height. Although the valleys are narrow, they are moderately fertile; but the chief supply for subsistence is derived from the pasture on the mountains, on which, during the summer season, more than 10,000 cows and 5000 sheep are fed. Though the small portion of arable land is well cultivated, it does not produce sufficient corn for the consumption of the inhabitants; but the deficiency is made up partly by potatoes and fruit, and partly by the exchange of Schabzuger cheese and wood, for what is wanted. A part of the inhabitants find employment in manufactures of woollen and cotton, of hosiery and caps, and in what was formerly of greater consumption than at present, namely, making slates for writing, which are sent by the Rhine to Holland. The government is a pure democracy, in which all the inhabitants who possess property have an equal share of political power, and equally assist in defending their country. The executive magistrate is the landamman. The religion is partly Protestant reformed, and partly Catholic. Those of the former sect are the majority, and choose all the magistracy for five years, and the latter for three years. When the Catholics are chosen to offices, they are selected by the Protestants; and when the Protestants’ turn comes, the individuals are nominated by the Catholics. The two sects have their separate tribunals in civil and criminal matters. This canton contributes to the general confederacy 1615 francs yearly, and provides a contingent of 482 men for the common defence of the states.

Glarus, a town, the capital of the Swiss canton of that name, is situated under the mountain Garnish, which is nearly 9000 feet in height. It contains about 3000 inhabitants, who are employed in various manufactures. The general assembly of the cantons is held in a meadow near the town. Long. 8. 57. 50. E. Lat. 47. 2. 43. N.
