GREEN, one of the original prismatic colours exhibited by the refraction of the rays of light.

• Green- Cloth, a board or court of justice held in the counting-house of the king’s household, composed of the lord steward and officers under him, who sit daily. To this court is committed the charge and superintendence of the king’s household in matters of justice and government, with a power to correct all offenders, and to maintain the peace of the verge, or jurisdiction of the court-royal, which is about two hundred yards every way from the last gate of the palace where his majesty resides. It takes its name, board of green cloth, from a green cloth spread over the board where the members sit. Without a warrant first obtained from this court, none of the king’s servants can be arrested for debt.

Clerks of the Green Cloth were two officers of the board of green cloth, who appointed the diet of the king and his household; kept all records, ledgers, and papers relating thereto; and made up bills, parcels, and debentures for salaries, provisions, and necessaries for the officers of the buttery, pantry, cellar, and the like. They also waited upon foreign princes when entertained by his majesty. But these clerkships have been abolished.

Green- House, or Conservatory, a house in a garden, contrived for the purpose of sheltering and preserving the most curious and tender exotic plants, which in our climate will not bear to be exposed to the open air, especially in winter. Conservatories are generally large and beautiful structures, equally ornamental and useful.
