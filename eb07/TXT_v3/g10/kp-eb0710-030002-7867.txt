GALLIPOLI, a sea-port, the seat of a bishop, in the province of Otranto, in the kingdom of Naples. It is situated on an island in the Bay of Taranto, but connected by a bridge with the main land. The haven is connected by a mole, but the entrance is dangerous on account of the rocks. It is strongly fortified both on the land and the sea side. It contains, besides the cathedral, ten churches, an ecclesiastical seminary, with some other establishments for education, and, with the suburbs, 8141 inhabitants. The land near it yields oil of great celebrity. In the city, cotton, hosiery, and muslins, are manufactured, and an extensive tunny fishery is carried on. Long. 17. 2. E. Lat. 40. 20. N.
