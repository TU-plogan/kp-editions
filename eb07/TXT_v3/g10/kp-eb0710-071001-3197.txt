GRANGE, an ancient term for a barn or place in which to lay up and thrash corn. The word is formed from the Latin granea or granum, grain or corn. Hence also granger or grangier, a grange-keeper or farmer. Grange is also used, in a more extensive sense, to signify a whole farm, with all the appendages of stables for horses, stalls for cattle, and the like.
