GLOBE, in Geometry, a round or spherical body, commonly called a Sphere. Globe is more particularly used for an artificial sphere of metal, plaster, paper, or other matter, on the convex surface of which is delineated a map, or representation either of the earth or heavens, with the several circles of the sphere.

Globes are of two kinds, terrestrial and celestial; both of considerable use, the one in astronomy, and the other in geography, for performing many of the operations in these sciences, in an easy and obvious manner, so as to be conceived without any knowledge of their mathematical principles.

The fundamental parts, common to both globes, are an axis, representing that of the world; and a spherical shell, or cover, forming the body of the globe, on the external surface of which the representation is drawn.
