BAMBA, a province of the kingdom of Congo, in Africa. It is situated between the rivers Ambriz and Lose, the last of which separates it from Pemba on the east, as the Ambriz does from the province of Sogno on the north. Along the sea-coast Bamba extends itself northward to the river Lelunda, and on the south to that of Danda. Ambriz is the chief sea-port, and the character of the coast corresponels with that generally described under the head of Angola; but the interior is known only from the imperfect and doubtful accounts of the Portuguese missionaries, who penetrated into it more than two centuries ago.
