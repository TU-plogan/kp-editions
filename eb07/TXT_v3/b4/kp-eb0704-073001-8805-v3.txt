BOG properly signifies a quagmire, covered with grass, but not solid enough to support the weight of the body; in which sense it differs only from marshes or fens, as a part differs from the whole. But some restrict the term bog to quagmires pent up between two hills; whereas fens lie in champaign and low countries, where the descent is very small.

Bog, or Bog of Gight, a small town of Scotland, seated near the mouth of the river Spey, in long. 2. 23. W. lat. 57. 48. N.
