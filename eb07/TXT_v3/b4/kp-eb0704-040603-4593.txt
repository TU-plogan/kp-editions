BARRATRY. See Barretry. Barratry, in a shipmaster, consists in defrauding the owners. If goods delivered on ship-board are embezzled all the mariners are bound, by the maritime law, to contribute to the satisfaction of the party that has lost his goods; and the cause is to be tried in the admiralty. In a case where a ship had been insured against the barratry of the master, and the jury found that the ship was lost by the fraud and negligence of the master, the court ruled that the fraud was barratry, though not named in the covenant, but that negligence did not amount to that offence.
