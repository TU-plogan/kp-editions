BOREAS, a Greek name for the north wind. The Greeks erected an altar to Boreas; and he is represented on the temple at Athens with his robe at his mouth, as if he felt the cold of the climate over which he presides, agreeably to the description of Ovid, who calls him gelidus tyrannus, the shivering tyrant. But he is usually described by the Roman poets as violent and impetuous; and in painting he is represented as an old man with a horrible look, having his hair and beard covered with snow or hoarfrost, while the feet and tail of a dragon terminate the figure.
