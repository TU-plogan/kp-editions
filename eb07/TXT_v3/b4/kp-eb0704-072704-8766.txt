BOEDROMIA, in Antiquity, solemn feasts held at Athens in memory of the succour brought by Ion to the Athenians, when invaded by Eumolpus, son of Neptune, in the reign of Erectheus. Plutarch gives another account of the Boedromia, which, according to him, were celebrated in commemoration of the victory obtained by Theseus over the Amazons, in the month of Boedromion.
