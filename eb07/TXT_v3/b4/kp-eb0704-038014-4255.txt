BARLEY. See Agriculture and Brewing. Pearl Barley and French Barley, barley freed of the husk by a mill; the distinction between the two being, that the pearl barley is reduced to the size of small shot, all but the very heart of the grain being ground away.

Barley- Water is a decoction of either of these, reputed soft and lubricating, and of frequent use in physic.

Barley- Corn is used to denote a measure, containing in length the third part of an inch, and in breadth the eighth. The French carpenters also use barley-corn, grain d’orge, as equivalent to a line, or the twelfth part of an inch.
