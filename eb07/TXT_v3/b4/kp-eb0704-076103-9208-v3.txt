BOLOGNA, one of the provinces called delegations, into which the papal dominions are divided. It is bounded on the north by Ferrara, on the east by Ravenna, on the south by Tuscany, and on the west by Modena. It extends over 1450 square miles, and comprehends two cities, twenty-one towns, and 371 villages, with a population of 297,510 inhabitants. It is a district of great natural fertility, and, though but indifferently cultivated, produces abundant crops of rice, barley, wheat, and pulse, besides hemp, flax, silk, oil, wine, figs, almonds, chestnuts, and other fruits. The capital, from which the delegation takes its name, is situated between the rivers Savena and Reno, and is an ancient though not regularly built place, but clean and well paved. It is said to contain near 150 churches and chapels, many of which have celebrated paintings of the peculiar school to which the city has given its name. It contains about 70,000 souls, including the numerous students of the university; and is a place of manufacturing industry, chiefly for making silk goods. Long. 11. 15. 17. E. Lat. 44. 29. 30. N.
