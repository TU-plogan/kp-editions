BEVERLAND, Hadrian, a man of considerable genius, who flourished in the end of the seventeenth century, but prostituted his powers in the study and composition of books of a very obnoxious kind. He was a perfect master of Ovid, Catullus, Petronius, and authors of that stamp. In his infamous book on original sin, he maintained that Adam’s sin consisted in his commerce with his wife, and that original sin is nothing more than the inclination of the sexes to each other. This insane abomination was justly condemned to undergo cremation under the auspices of the hangman. Beverland led a scandalous life, but seems to have repented of his evil manners and lewd writings; for towards the end of his life he published a treatise De Fornicatione Cavenda, in which there are some indications of a better spirit. He is said to have died mad; a natural catastrophe of such opinions and such conduct.
