BARTOLOMEO, Francisco, a celebrated painter, born at Savignano, near Florence, in the year 1469, was the disciple of Cosimo Rosselli, but was much more beholden to the works of Leonardo da Vinci for his extraordinary skill in painting. He was so well versed in the principles of design, that Raphael, after quitting the school of Perugino, applied to this master, and studied under him the rules of perspective, with the art of managing and uniting his colours. He painted both portraits and historical pieces; but his scrupulous conscience would hardly ever suffer him to draw naked figures, though nobody understood them better. He died in 1517, aged forty-eight. .
