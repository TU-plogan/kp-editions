BETHLEHEM, a town of Palestine, famous as the birth-place of our Saviour. It was once a flourishing place, but is now only a paltry village. It is situated on an eminence two leagues south-east of Jerusalem, in a country full of hills and valleys, and might be rendered very agreeable, as the soil is fertile, and fruits, vines, and olives are produced in abundance. Several antique remains are found at this place; but most of them have been built by the Turks into their mosques.
