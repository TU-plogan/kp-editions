BERRETONI, Nicoo, historical painter, was born at Macerata in 1617, and became a disciple of Carlo Maratti, under whom he studied design and colouring for several years, and attained such excellence that he excited the jealousy and envy of his master, who seemed to be apprehensive of finding a powerful competitor and rival in his pupil. He died in 1682.
