BELPER, a market-town in the hundred of Appletree, in the county of Derby, 134 miles from London. The whole is the property of the family of Strut, who have erected most extensive cotton works, which have caused a great increase of dwellings and population. A new church, and several dissenting places of worship, have been built within the last ten years. The inhabitants amounted in 1801 to 4500, in 1811 to 5778, and in 1821 to 7235, but they have rapidly increased since the last census.
