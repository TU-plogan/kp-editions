BATTALION, the lowest integral denomination in an army or national military force. Hence two or more battalions constitute a regiment, two or more regiments a brigade, two or more brigades a division, two or more divisions a corps d’armée, and two or more corps d’armée a grand army. A battalion therefore is the unit or integer in all the combinations of an armed force. A battalion usually contains from 500 to 800 men; but the number it consists of is not determined. They are armed with firelocks, swords, and bayonets; and divided into eight or more companies, one of which is grenadiers. Some regiments consist of but one battalion, others are divided into four or five. ∙"
