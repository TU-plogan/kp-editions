BATRACHOMYOMACHIA, or “battle of the frogs and the mice,” the title of a burlesque poem generally ascribed to Homer. The subject of the work is the death of Psycharpax, a mouse, son of Toxartes, who having mounted on the back of Physignathus, a frog, was being conveyed to her palace, to which she had invited him, when, seized with fear at seeing himself in the middle of the pond, he tumbled off and was drowned. Physignathus being suspected of having intentionally shaken off Psycharpax, the mice demanded satisfaction, and unanimously declared war against the frogs.
