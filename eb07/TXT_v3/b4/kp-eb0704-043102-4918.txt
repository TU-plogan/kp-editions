BASNAGE, James, a learned author, and pastor of the Walloon church at the Hague, was born at Rouen in Normandy on the 8th of August 1653. He was the son of Henry Basnage, one of the ablest advocates in the parliament of Normandy. At the age of seventeen, having made himself master of the Greek and Latin authors, as well as of the English, Spanish, and Italian languages, he went to Geneva, where he began his theological studies under Mestrezat, Turretin, and Tronehin; and completed them at Sedan, under the professors Jurieu and Le Blanc de Beaulieu. He then returned to Rouen, where he was received as minister, in September 1676; and in this capacity he remained till the year 1685, when the exercise of the Protestant religion being suppressed at Rouen, he obtained leave of the king to retire to Holland. He settled at Rotterdam, and continued a minister pensionary there till 1691, when he was chosen pastor of the Walloon church of that city. In 1709 Pensionary Heinsius got hip elected one of the pastors of the Walloon church at the Hague, intending to employ him not only in religious, but also in civil affairs. Accordingly he was engaged in a secret negociation with Marshal d’Uxelles, plenipotentiary of France at the congress of Utreeht; a service which he executed with so much success, that he was afterwards intrusted with several important commissions, all of which he discharged in such a manner as to establish a high character for ability and address. Indeed, a celebrated modern writer has said of him, that he was fitter to be a minister of state than a minister of a parish. The Abbé Dubois, who was sent to the Hague in 1716, as ambassador plenipotentiary from his most Christian Majesty, in order to ne-gociate a defensive alliance between France, England, and the States General, received instructions from the duke of Orleans, then regent of France, to address himself to Μ. Basnage, and to follow his advice: they accordingly acted in coneert, and the alliance was concluded in January 1717. Basnage maintained an epistolary correspondence with several princes, noblemen of high rank, and ministers of state, both Catholic and Protestant, and with a great many learned men in France, Italy, Germany, and England. The Catholics esteemed him no less than the Protestants; and the works he wrote, which are mostly in French, spread his reputation over the greater part of Europe. Among these are, The History of the Religion of the Reformed Churches; Jewish Antiquities; The History of the Old and New Testament. He died on the 22d September 1723.

Basnage, Henry, Sieur de Beauval, second son of Henry Basnage, and brother of James mentioned in the last article. He applied himself to the study of the law, and was admitted an advocate in the parliament of Rouen in the year 1679. He did not, however, devote himself to the bar immediately on his admission, but went to Valencia, where he studied under Μ. de Marville. Upon his return he practised with great reputation till the year 1687, when the revocation of the edict of Nantes obliged him to fly to Holland, where he composed the greater part of his works, and died on the 29th of March 1710. His chief work is Histoire des Ouvrages des Scavans^ Rotterdam, [7:4:432]24 vols. 12mo. When he arrived in Holland, Mr Bayle, through indisposition, had been obliged to drop his Nouvelles de la République des Lettres, which induced Μ. Basnage to undertake a work of the same kind under a different title.
