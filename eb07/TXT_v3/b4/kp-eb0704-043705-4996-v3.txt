BASTON, Paton, or Patune, is a French word signifying a staff or eudgel; but is by many English writers eor-ruptly spelt as above. It is borne in English coats of arms, as a badge of illegitimacy.

Baston, Robert, a Carmelite monk, afterwards prior of the convent of that order at Scarborough, and also poet lauréat and public orator at Oxford, flourished in the fourteenth century King Edward I. in his expedition into Scotland in 1304, took Robert Baston with him in order to celebrate the victories he was to gain over the Scots; but the poet having been taken prisoner, was obliged to change his note and sing to another tune, “the Bruce of Bannockburn.” He wrote several pieces in Latin, on the Wars of Scotland, the Luxury of Priests, Synodical Sermons, &c.; and also a volume of tragedies and comedies, in English. He died about the year 1310.
