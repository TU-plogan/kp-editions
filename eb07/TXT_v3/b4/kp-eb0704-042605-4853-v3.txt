BASILICA is also used by ecclesiastical writers for a church; in which sense the name frequently occurs in St Ambrose, St Austin, St Jerome, Sidonius Apollinaris, and other writers of the fourth and fifth centuries. The name was probably thus applied from many of the ancient churches having been formed out of the Roman halls or basilicae above described.

Basilica is chiefly applied, in modern times, to churches of royal foundation, as those of St John de Lateran and St Peter of the Vatican at Rome, founded by the emperor Constantine.

Basilics were also little chapels built by the ancient Franks over the tombs of their great men, so caļled from their resembling the figure of the sacred basilicae or churches.
