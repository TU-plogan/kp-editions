BERCHETT, Peter, an eminent historical painter, was born in France in 1659, and at the age of eighteen was employed in the royal palaces. He came to England in 1681, to work under Rambour, a French painter of architecture; but after staying a year, he returned to Marli. He revisited this country, however, and was sent by King William to the palace then building at Loo, where he was employed fifteen months; after which he came a third time to England, where he had sufficient business, and painted the ceiling of the chapel of Trinity College, Oxford, the staircase at the Duke of Schomberg’s in Pall-mall, and the summer-house at Ranelagh. Towards the close of his life he retired to Marybone, where he painted only small pieces of fabulous history, and died there in January 1720.
