BENEFIELD, Sebastian, an eminent divine of the seventeenth century, was born in 1559, at Prestonbury in Gloucestershire, and educated at Corpus Christi College, Oxford. In 1608 he took the degree of doctor in divinity, and five years afterwards was chosen Margaret professor in that university. Several years before, he had been presented to the rectory of Meysey-Hampton, in Gloucestershire. He published commentaries upon the first, second and third chapters of Amos; a considerable number of sermons; and some Latin treatises. He died in 1630.
