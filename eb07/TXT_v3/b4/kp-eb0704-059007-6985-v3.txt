BERNO, abbot of Richenou, in the diocese of Constance, flourished about the year 1008, and is celebrated as a poet, rhetorician, musician, philosopher, and divine. He was the author of several treatises on music, particularly of one De Instrumentis Musicalibus, which he dedicated to Arrabon, archbishop of Mentz; and he also wrote De Mensura Monochordes. But the most celebrated of his works is a treatise De Musica seu Tonis, which he wrote and dedicated to Pclcgrin, archbishop of Cologne. This latter tract is part of the Baliol manuscript, and follows the Enchiridion of Odo; containing a summary of the doctrines delivered by Boethius, an explanation of the ecclesiastical tones, intermixed with frequent exhortations to piety, and the application of music to religious purposes.

He was highly favoured by the Emperor Henry II. for his great learning and piety, and succeeded so well in his endeavours to promote learning, that his abbey of Riche- ∏ou was as famous in his time as those of St Gal and Cluni, then the most celebrated in France. He died in 1048, and was interred in the church of the monastery, which, but a short time before,he had dedicated to St Mark.
