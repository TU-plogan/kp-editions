BEHABAN, a town of Persia, and capital of a mountainous district. It is pleasantly situated in the middle of an extensive valley, which is of considerable extent, highly cultivated, and watered by the rivers Zab and Jerahi. The walls are about three miles in circumference. It is the seat of a governor, whose palace is at the north-west corner of the town; and contains, according to the best information, 10,000 inhabitants. It is 153 miles from Shiraz, from which it is separated by a mountainous country, entirely uninhabited, and infested by banditti.
