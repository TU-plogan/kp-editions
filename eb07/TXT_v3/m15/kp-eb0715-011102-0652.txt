MINCHINHAMPTON, of a town of the county of Gloucester, in the hundred of Longtree, a hundred miles from London. Some parts of the parish are very romantic, especially one called the Golden Vale. The clothing trade forms the chief occupation. Near to it are several elegant seats. The celebrated Roger Bacon was an inhabitant of the town. The population of the town amounted in 1801 to 3419, in 1811 to 3246, in 1821 to 4907, and in 1831 to 5114; but there are two hamlets within the parish, Rodborough and Nailsworth, and the number of the whole inhabitants appears by the last census to have been 7255.
