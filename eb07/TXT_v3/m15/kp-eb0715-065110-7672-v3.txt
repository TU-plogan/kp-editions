MYMUNSING, a district of Hindustan, in the province of Bengal, situated between the 24th and 28th degrees of north latitude. The boundaries of this territory are the Garrow Mountains and the district of Rungpoor on the north, Dacca Jelalpoor on the south, Silket and Tipperah on the east, and Ranjeshy and Dinagepoor on the west. The country is intersected by the great river Brahmapootra, into which flow innumerable streams from both sides; and, owing to the flatness of the country, it is liable to inundations during the rainy seasons. It produces in consequence very abundant crops of rice, of a coarse quality^ which is its staple produce. Some parts of the country are overrun with wood or jungle, and are but thinly inhabited. The chief town is Bygonbary, which is the residence of the judge and collector, who are subordinate to [7:15:652]the Dacca court of circuit. The population consists of pretty nearly equal numbers of Hindus and Mahommedans. According to a census taken by orders of the Marquis Wellesley in 1801, the population amounts to 600,000.
