MYRMILLONES were gladiators of a certain kind at Rome, who fought against the Retiarii. Their arms were a sword, head-piece, and shield. On the top of the headpiece they wore a fish embossed, called μοξμυζος, whence their name is by some supposed to be derived. The Retiarii, in their engagements, made use of a net, in which they endeavoured to entangle their adversaries; and sung during the fight, Nan tepeto, piseem peto ; quid me f agis, Galle? “I aim not at thee, but I aim at thy fish; why dost thou shun me, Gaul ?” The Myrmillones were called Galli, because they wore Gallic armour; and they were also named Secutores. This kind of gladiators was suppressed by Caligula.
