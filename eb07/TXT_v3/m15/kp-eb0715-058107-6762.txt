MOUJGUR, a town of Hindustan, in the province of Ajmeer. It is surrounded with a high wall and towers, and has a conspicuous mosque, which stands over the gateway, and a tomb with a cupola ornamented with painted tiles. Its situation is in the middle of the desert of Bicaneer; but it has several good wells, and reservoirs of rain water. It belongs to a Mahommedan chief, whose capital, Bahawul-pore, stands on the bank of the Gharra or Hyphasis River, and who is tributary to the king of Afghanistan. The inhabitants are partly Hindus and partly Mahommedans. Mr Elphinstone, on his embassy to Cabul in 1808, visited this place, and was hospitably entertained. Long. 72.20. E. Lat. 28. 57. N.
