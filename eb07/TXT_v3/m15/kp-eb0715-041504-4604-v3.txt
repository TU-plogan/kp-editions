MONJOUS, a people inhabiting the interior of Eastern Africa, in a north-easterly direction from Mozambique. They occupy a portion of that space which, in our early maps, is allotted to the empire of Monumugi. They are negroes of the ugliest description, of a deep shining black, with high cheek-bones, thick lips, and small knots of woolly hair on their heads. Their only weapons are bows and arrows, in the use of which they are dexterous. With regard to the extent of country over which they are spread, no correct estimate can be formed.
