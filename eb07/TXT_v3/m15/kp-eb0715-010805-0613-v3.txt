MINA, or Manch, a species of money which properly signifies one part or ounce. It is observed that this word occurs only in the books of Kings, Chronicles, Ezra, and Ezekiel. The prophet (xlv. 12) tells us, that the mina or maneb was valued at sixty shekels, which in gold are equivalent to L.54. 15s. of English money, and in silver to about L.7. Thus for the Hebrew manch. But the Greek or Attic mina, which is probably that mentioned in the books of the Maccabees and in the New Testament, is valued at a hundred drachmae, or about L.2. 17s. sterling. There was also a lesser mina, which ⅜tas valued at seventy-five drachmae.

Mina, a small town of Arabia, about twenty miles to the south of Mecca, on the way to Mount Arafat. It is situated between two granite mountains, and consists of a single long street, containing several handsome houses.
