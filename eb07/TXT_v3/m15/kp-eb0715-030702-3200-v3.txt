MITTIMUS, as generally used, has two significations. First, it signifies a writ for removing or transferring of records from one court to another. Secondly, it signifies a precept or command in writing, under the hand and seal of a justice of the peace, directed to the gaoler or keeper of some prison, for the receiving and safe keeping of an offender charged with any crime, until he be delivered by due course of law.
