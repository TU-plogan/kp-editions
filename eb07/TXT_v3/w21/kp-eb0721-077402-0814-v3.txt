WARE, a market-town of the county of Hertford, in the hundred of Braughin, twenty-one miles from London. It stands on the river Lea, which is navigable to the metropolis, and by which much malt, the principal commodity of the place, is conveyed to the great porter breweries and distilleries in London. It is a well-built town, and consists of one long street, with several minor ones intersecting it. The church is an ancient and noble structure. Near to it is the spring by which the new river is mainly supplied. Ware has a good market on Tuesday, and two yearly fairs. The population amounted in 1821 to 3844, and in 1831 to 4214.
