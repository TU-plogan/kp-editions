WANLOCKHEAD, a village in the parish of Sanquhar and county of Dumfries, nearly 1500 feet above the level of the sea. It is famed for the lead mines which have been worked there from the middle of the sixteenth century to the present time, with various success, but which are now on the decrease. Gold was at one time worked for, and it is still collected by the miners in small particles. Between the years 1831 and 1835, two specimens were found which weighed respectively ninety and sixty grains. The quantity of lead raised in 1829 was 596 tons, and in 1830, 461 tons, which was sold at L.13 per ton. The number of persons employed in the works in 1835 amounted to 208. The miners have established a subscription library for their own use. The population amounted in 1821 to 706, and in 1831 to 675.
