WANSTEAD, a parish of the county of Essex, in the hundred of Becontree, six miles from London. It is a scattered place, containing many fine residences belonging to the richer class of the inhabitants of the metropolis. It was chiefly remarkable for the magnificent mansion recently destroyed, to the great regret of the public. The church is a modern elegant edifice. The population amounted in 1821 to 1354, and in 1831 to 1403.
