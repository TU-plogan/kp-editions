WOODCHESTER, a town of the county of Gloucester, in the hundred of Longtrees, 104 miles from London. It is a manufacturing place for broad cloths, but the trade is on the decline. There is an endowed grammar school; and near to it is the magnificent scat of Lord Ducie. The population amounted in 1821 to 929, and in 1831 to 885.
