WALLINGFORD, a market and borough town of the county of Berks and hundred of Moreton, 46 miles from London. It stands on the river Thames, over which is a fine stone bridge of 19 arches, 300 yards in length, with drawbridges to admit the passage of barges. It is an ancient town, once consisting of twelve parishes, now reduced to four. The corporate body consists of a mayor, four aldermen, and eleven councillors. One member is returned to the House of Commons by the borough. The little trade there is depends principally on the river-navigation. There is a well-endowed free school, four churches, and several chapels for dissenters; also a county-hall, in which the assizes were occasionally held. The markets are on Tuesday and Friday. The population amounted in 1821 to 2493, and in 1831 to 2467
