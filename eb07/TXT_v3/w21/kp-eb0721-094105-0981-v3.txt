WORKINGTON, a market-town of the county of Cumberland, in the ward of Allerdale, 311 miles from London. It stands on the sea-shore, where the rivers Derwent and Cocker enter the ocean. The coal-mines near it are the chief source of the trade, as they supply annual loading to hundreds of ships. There are also a considerable salmon fishery, and some works for refining salt. The population of the town amounted in 1821 to 6439, and in 1831 to 6415; but the parish contains other four townships, and the collective number of inhabitants at the census of 1831 was 7196.
