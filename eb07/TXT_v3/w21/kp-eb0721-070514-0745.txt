WAIFS, Βova Waviata, are goods stolen, and waived or thrown away by the thief in his flight, for fear of being apprehended. These by the law are given to the king, as a punishment upon the owner for not himself pursuing the felon, and taking away his goods from him. And therefore if the party robbed do his diligence immediately to follow and apprehend the thief (which is called making fresh suit), or convict him afterwards, or procure evidence to convict him, he shall have his goods again.
