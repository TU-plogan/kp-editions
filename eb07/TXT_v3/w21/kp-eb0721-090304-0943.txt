WINTER, one of the four seasons or quarters of the year. Winter commences on the day when the sun’s distance from the zenith of the place is greatest, and ends on the day when its distance is at a mean between the greatest and least. Under the equator, the winter, as well as other seasons, returns twice every year, but all other places have only one annual winter; which in the northern hemisphere begins when the sun is in the tropic of Capricon, and in the southern hemisphere when in the tropic of Cancer; so that all places in the same hemisphere have their winter at the same time.
