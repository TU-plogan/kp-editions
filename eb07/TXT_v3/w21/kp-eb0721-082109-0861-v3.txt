WAY, a passage or road. The Roman ways were divided into consular, praetorian, military, and public; and of these we have four remarkable ones in England. The first is Watling Street or Watheling Street, leading from Dover to London, Dunstable, Towcester, Atherston, and the Severn, extending as far as Anglesea in Wales. The second, called Hihenild or Ihenild Street, stretches from Southampton over the river Isis at Newbridge; thence by Camden and Litchfield; then passes the Derwent near Derby, and ends at Tynemouth. The third, called Fosse-wαy, because in some places it was never perfected, but lies as a large ditch, leads from Cornwall through Devonshire, by Teth-bury, near Stow in the Wold, and beside Coventry, to [7:21:822]Leicester, Newark, and so to Lincoln. The fourth, called Erming or Errninage Street, extends from St David’s, in Wales, to Southampton.
