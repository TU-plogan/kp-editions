WIMBLEDON, an extensive parish of the county of Surrey, in the hundred of Brixton, seven miles from London. The village consists of one main street on the great road to Portsmouth, but is most remarkable for the number and elegance of the residences around its common, and in other parts of the parish. The most striking of these is the seat of Earl Spencer, and the park which surrounds it, originally built by Lord Burleigh in 1588, and afterwards rebuilt by Sarah duchess of Marlborough. Many others are deserving of attention. The population of the parish amounted in 1821 to 2195, and in 1831 to 2195.
