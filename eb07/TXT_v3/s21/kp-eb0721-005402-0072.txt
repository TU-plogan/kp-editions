SYMPOSIARCH, in Antiquity, the director or manager of an entertainment. This office was sometimes performed by the person at whose charge the entertainment was provided, sometimes by another named by him; and at other times, especially in entertainments provided at the common expense, he was elected by lot, or by the suffrages of the guests.
