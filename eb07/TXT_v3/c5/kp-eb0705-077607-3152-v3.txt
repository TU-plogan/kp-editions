CAETERIS Paribus, a Latin term in frequent use among mathematical and physical writers. The words literally signify the rest, or other things, being alike or equal. Thus we say, the heavier the bullet, coeteris paribus, the greater the range; that is, by how much the bullet is heavier, if the length and diameter of the piece and strength of the powder be the same, by so much will the utmost range or distance of a piece of ordnance be the greater. Thus also, in a physical way, we say, the velocity and quantity circulating in a given time through any section of an artery, will, coeteris paribus, be according to its diameter, and nearness to or distance from the heart.
