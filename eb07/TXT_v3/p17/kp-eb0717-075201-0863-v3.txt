PISTIL, amongst botanists, the little upright column which is generally found in the centre of every flower. According to the Linnaean system, it is the female part of generation, the office of which is to receive and secrete the pollen, and produce the fruit. It consists of three parts; the germen, stylus, and stigma. See Botany.
