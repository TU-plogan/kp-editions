PEDIAEAN, in Grecian antiquity. The city of Athens was anciently divided into three different parts; one on the descent of a hill, another on the sea-shore, and a third in a plain between the other two. The inhabitants of the middle region were called ∏iδ∕αo∕, Pediaeans, from τrοδιον, plain or flat; those of the hill, Diacrians; and those of the shore, Paralians. These quarters usually composed as many different factions. Pisistratus made use of the Pediaeans against the Diacrians. In the time of Solon, when a form of government was to be chosen, the Diacrians chose the democratic, the Pediaeans demanded an aristocracy, and the Paralians a mixed government.
