PATANY, a port of Asia, on the eastern coast of the peninsula of Malacca, and near the mouth of the Gulf of Siam, situated almost six miles up a river which falls into a bay and forms a good roadstead. It had formerly a considerable trade, which, however, has greatly fallen oft’. The Chinese now carry on the trade, which consists chiefly in the importation of European goods from Batavia, and the exportation of gold dust, canes, rattans, dragon’s blood, &c. Long. 101. 40. E. Lat. 6. 50. N.
