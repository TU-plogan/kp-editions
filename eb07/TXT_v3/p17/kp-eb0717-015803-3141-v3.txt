PAULINUS, a bishop who flourished in the early part of the seventh century. He was the apostle of Yorkshire, and the first archbishop of York. This dignity seems to have been conferred upon him about the year 626. He built a church at Almonbury, which he dedicated to St Alban, and there he preached to and converted the Brigantes. Camden mentions a cross at Dewsborough, which had been erected to him, with this inscription, “Paulinus hic praedicavit et celebravit.” About this time York was so small that there was not so much as a church in it in which King Edwin could be baptized. Constantius is said to have made it a bishopric; and Pope Honorius erected it into a metropolitan see. We are told that Paulinus baptized in the river Swale, in one day, ten thousand men, besides women and children, on the first conversion of the Saxons to Christianity. At Walstone, in Northumberland, he baptized Segbert king of the East Saxons. Bede says, “Paulinus coming with the king and queen to the royal manor called Ad Gebdrin (now Yeverin), staid there thirty-six days with them, employed in the duties of catechizing and baptizing. In all this time he did nothing from morning to night but instruct the people, who flocked to him from all the villages and places, in the doctrine of Christ and salvation; and, after they were instructed, he baptized them in the neighbouring river Glen.” According to the same venerable author, “he preached the word in the province of Lindissi; and first converted the governor of the city of Lindocollina, whose name was Blecca, with all his family. In this city he built a stone church of exquisite workmanship, whose roof being ruined by long neglect or the violence of the enemy, only the walls are now standing.” He is also said to have founded a collegiate church of prebends near Southwell, in Nottinghamshire, dedicated to the Virgin Mary. This church he is stated to have built when he baptized the Coritani in the Trent.
