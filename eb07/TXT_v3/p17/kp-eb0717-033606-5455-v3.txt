PEZAY, N. Masson, Marquis de, born at Paris, where he early applied himself to the study of letters, and afterwards went into the army. He was made a captain of dragoons, and had the honour of giving some instructions in tactics to the ill-fated Louis XVI. Being appointed inspector-general of some coasting vessels, he repaired to the maritime towns, and executed his commission with more care and attention than was to be expected from a votary of the muses. But as he had at the same time displayed too much haughtiness, a complaint was made against him to the court, and he was banished to his country-seat, where he died soon afterwards, in the beginning of 1778. He was the intimate friend and companion of Dorat, whom he had studied, and successfully imitated; but his poems have more delicacy, and are less disfigured with trifling conversations of gallantry. He left behind him, 1. aTransla-tion[7:17:337] of Catullus, which is not much esteemed; 2. Les Soirées Helvetiennes, Alsaciennes, et Franc-Comtoises, 1770, in 8vo; 3. Les Soirées Provençales, in manuscript; 4. La Rosière de Salency, a pastoral in three acts, which was performed with success in the Italian theatres; 5. Les Campagnes de Mailebois, in three vols. 4to, and a volume of maps.
