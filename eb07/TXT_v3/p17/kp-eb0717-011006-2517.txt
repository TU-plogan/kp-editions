PASSAMAN, a small province of Sumatra, being one of the most northerly, and situated immediately under the equinoctial line. It was formerly subject to the dominion of Menancabow, but is now subject to the Achinese. It is divided into a number of petty kingdoms, each of which is governed by a rajah, and was formerly a place of considerable trade. Besides exporting large quantities of pepper, it received much fine gold from the mountains that are situated about three days’ journey inland.
