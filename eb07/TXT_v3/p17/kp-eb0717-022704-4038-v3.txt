PENUMBRA, in Astronomy, a partial shade observed between the perfect shadow and the full light in an eclipse. It arises from the magnitude of the sun’s body. For were he only a luminous point, the shadow would be all perfect; but, by reason of the diameter of the sun, it happens that a place which is not illuminated by the whole of the sun does yet receive rays from a part of that body.
