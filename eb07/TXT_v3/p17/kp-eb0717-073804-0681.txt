PICKETS, in fortification, are stakes sharpened at one end, and sometimes shod with iron, being used in laying out the ground. They are about three feet in length, but when used for pinning the fascines of a battery they are made from three to five feet in length.

Pickets, in artillery, are about five or six feet in length, and shod with iron, being used to pin the lines, in laying out the boundaries of the park.

Pickets, in the camp, are also stakes of about six or eight inches in length, being used to fasten the tent cords in pitching the tents; also stakes of about four or five feet in length, driven into the ground near the tents of the cavalry, to tie the horses to.
