PECULIAR, in the Canon Law, signifies a particular parish or church that has jurisdiction within itself for granting probates of wills and administrations, exempt from the ordinary or bishop’s courts. The king’s chapel is a royal peculiar, exempt from all spiritual jurisdiction, and reserved to the visitation and immediate government of the king himself. There is likewise the archbishop’s peculiar; for it is an ancient privilege of the see of Canterbury, that wherever any manors or advowsons belong to it, these forthwith become exempt from the ordinary, and are reputed peculiars. In the see of Canterbury there arc fifty-seven such peculiars.

Besides these, there are some peculiars belonging to deans, chapters, and prebendaries, which are only exempted from the jurisdiction of the archdeacon. They are derived from the bishop, who may visit them, and to whom there lies an appeal.

Court of Peculiars is a branch of, and annexed to, the court of arches. It has a jurisdiction over all those parishes dispersed throughout the province of Canterbury [7:17:168]in the midst of other dioceses, which are exempted from the ordinary’s jurisdiction, and subject only to the metropolitan.
