PHRYNE was a celebrated courtezan, who flourished at Athens about 328 years before the Christian era. She was mistress to Praxiteles, who drew her picture, which was one of his best pieces, and placed in the temple of Apollo at Delphi. We are told that Apelles painted his Venus Anadyomene after he had seen Phryne on the sea-shore naked, and with dishevelled hair. Phryne became so very rich by the liberality of her lovers, that she offered to rebuild, at her own expense, Thebes, which Alexander had destroyed, provided this inscription were placed on the walls, Alexander diruit, sed meretrix Phryne refecit; but her offer was rejected.
