PIZZO, a city of Italy, in the province of Calabria Ulteriore 1I., and kingdom of Naples. It is situated on a promontory’ on the south side of the Gulf of Euphemia. It was destroyed by the tremendous earthquake of 1783, but has been again rebuilt, and contains upwards of 5000 inhabitants, the most industrious of the population of Calabria. They have been freed from taxes on salt, and from some other imposts, since 1815, when they resisted the attempt of Murat, who landed near it. This has promoted the fishery, and especially the curing of fish. The country around it is highly productive of corn, oil, figs, and mulberry trees, and yields much silk.
