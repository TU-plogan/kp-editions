PIAS, or Bias, a town of Asiatic Turkey, supposed to be the site of the ancient Issus, near which was fought the celebrated battle that decided the fate of the Persian empire. Not many years since it was the residence of a powerful and warlike chief, who rebelled against the grand signior, plundered caravans, and laid the neighbouring countries under contribution. The Turkish ruler, provoked by these outrages, fitted out a fleet, which took the town of Pias, and reduced it to a heap of ruins.
