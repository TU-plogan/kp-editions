GULE of August, the day of St Peter ad vincula, which is celebrated on the first of August. It is called the pule of August, from the Latin gula, a throat, because one Quirinus, a tribune, having a daughter with a disease in her throat, went to Pope Alexander, the sixth in succession from St Peter, and desired of him to see the chains with which St Peter was bound under Nero. His request was granted; and the young woman, having kissed the fetters, was cured of her disease; whereupon the pope instituted this feast in honour of St Peter, and the day was on this occasion called indifferently either the day of St Peter ad vincula, from the fetters which wrought the miracle; or the gule of August, from that part of the virgin on which the miracle was wrought.
