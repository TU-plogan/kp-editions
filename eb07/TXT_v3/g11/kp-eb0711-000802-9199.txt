Ground, in etching, denotes a gummy composition smeared over the surface of the metal to be etched, to prevent the aquafortis from eating, except in the places where this ground is cut through with the point of a needle or style.

G round- Angling, fishing under water without a float, only with a plumb of lead, or a bullet, placed about nine inches from the hook. This method of fishing is most proper in cold weather, when the fish swim very low.
