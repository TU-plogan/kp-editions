JORDAN, a celebrated river of Palestine, which has its rise in a mountain called Jebel Sheik, and passing by Caesarea Philippi, now called Panias, is increased by other tributary streams from the adjacent mountains, when it becomes a considerable river. It rolls on for ten miles through rocky and wooded banks, when it enters the great Lake of Tiberias on the north side, and again issues from its southern extremity. It then meanders in a southern direction through an extensive plain, and passing to the east of Jericho, falls into the Dead Sea, or Lake Asphaltites. The lower part of its course is through the middle of a barren valley, with hills of white clayey soil on each side, about 200 feet in height. Its banks, when it was crossed by Mr Buckingham, and when it was at its lowest ebb, were fourteen or fifteen feet high. On each side the stream is lined by close thickets, which would afford ample shelter to wild beasts; and which, being driven away by the swelling of the river, has given rise to the Scripture expression, like “a lion from the swelling of Jordan.” Near Jericho the Jordan is deep and very rapid, nearly equal in breadth to the Thames at Windsor. It overflows its banks both in the spring and during the time of harvest, from the early and the later rains.
