JACOBIN Monks, the same with Dominicans.

Jacobins, the name assumed by a party or club at the beginning of the French revolution, composed of members of the National Assembly. The club held its meetings in the hall belonging to the Jacobin friars, and from the place of assemblage derived its name.
