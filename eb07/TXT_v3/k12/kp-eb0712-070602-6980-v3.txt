KETTLE, in the art of war, a term which the Dutch apply to a battery of mortars, because it is sunk under ground.

KETTLE-Drums are formed of two large basins of copper or brass, rounded at the bottom, and covered over with vellum or goat-skin, which is kept fast by a circle of iron, and by several holes fastened to the body of the drum, with a like number of screws to screw up and down, and a key for the purpose. The two basins are kept fast together by two straps of leather which go through two rings, and are fastened the one before and the other behind the pommel of the kettle-drum’s saddle. They have each a banner of silk or damask, richly embroidered with the sovereign’s arms, or with those of the colonel, and are fringed with silver or gold; and, to preserve them in bad weather, they have each a cover of leather. The drumsticks are of crabtree or of any other hard wood, of eight or nine inches long, with two knobs on the ends, which beat the drum head and produce the sound. The kettle-drum with trumpets is the most martial sound of any. Each regiment of horse has a pair.

KETTLE-Drummer, a man on horseback appointed to beat the kettle-drum, from which he takes his name. He marches always at the head of the squadron, and his post is on the right when the squadron is drawn up.
