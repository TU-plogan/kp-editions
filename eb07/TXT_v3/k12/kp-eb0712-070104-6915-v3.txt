KERESOUN, a sea-port of Rumiyah, in Asiatic Turkey, situated in a gulf of the Black Sea bearing the same name. It consists of about 700 ruinous houses, of which 500 are inhabited by Turks, 150 by Greeks, and fifty by Armenians, the only industrious portion of the community. The town is built on an elevated rocky promontory which bounds the bay, and is supposed to be the ancient Cerasus. The inhabitants trade with the Crimea. It is seventy miles west-south-west of Trebisond.
