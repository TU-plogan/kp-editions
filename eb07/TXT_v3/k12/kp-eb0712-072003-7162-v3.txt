KIMCHI, David, a Jewish rabbi, famous as a commentator on the Old Testament, who lived at the close of the twelfth and beginning of the thirteenth century. He was a Spaniard by birth, son of Rabbi Joseph Kimchi, and brother of Rabbi Moses Kimchi, both men of eminent learning amongst the Jews; but he excelled them both, being the best Hebrew grammarian the Jews ever could boast of. He wrote a Grammar and Dictionary of the Hebrew language, from the former of which Buxtorf compiled his Thesaurus Linguae ĩlebreae, and from the latter his Lexico Linguae Hebreoe. His writings have been held in such estimation amongst the Jew's, that no one can arrive at any reputation in letters and theology without studying them.
