KERN, or Kerne, a term in the ancient Irish militia, signifying a foot soldier. Camden tells us that the armies of [7:12:702]Ireland consisted of cavalry, called galloglasses ; and infantry, lightly armed, called kernes. The kernes were armed with swords and darts; and to the latter were fitted cords, by which they could recover them after they had been launched out.
