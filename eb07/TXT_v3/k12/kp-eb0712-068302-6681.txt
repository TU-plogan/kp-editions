KAZEROON, a town of Persia, in the province of Farsistan. It is situated in a valley about thirty miles long by seven or eight broad, bounded on the north by a salt lake, and fertilized by a number of rivulets of excellent water, producing in consequence abundant crops of grain, which are often destroyed by flights of locusts, the frequent and unwelcome visitors of all the country properly called Persia. It formerly consisted of three distinct villages. It was almost entirely depopulated during the late civil wars. It is now, according to Fraser, a heap of ruins, and does not contain above 3000 or 4000 inhabitants. It is a considerable mart for horses, which are bred in the vicinity, and are highly esteemed on account of their Arab blood. It is celebrated for its wrestlers, and for a class of birdcatchers, who practise a curious mode of taking sparrows.
