KINZIG, one of the six circles into which the grand duchy of Baden is divided. It extends over 543 square miles, comprehending twenty-seven cities and markettowns, 180 villages, and 518 hamlets, with 198,500 inhabitants. About two thirds of the population adhere to the Catholic church, and the remainder are chiefly Lutherans. The greater part of the circle consists of the most lofty parts of the Black Forest; but between the hills, in which many rivulets and rivers run, there are some beautiful and fruitful valleys, which are well cultivated. The circle yields more corn than is wanted for consumption at home. The wine is of moderate quality, and, in some of the districts, excellent. The chief articles which are exported are corn, wood, hemp, flax, tobacco, straw-plat, and many wooden clocks, on the last of which great ingenuity is displayed. The circle is divided into fifteen bailiwicks. The capital is Offenburg. The name is derived from the river Kinzig, which« falls into the Rhine.
