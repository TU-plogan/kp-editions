KONGSBURG, a city of Norway, in the province of Aggerhuus. It is situated on the Lovenelf, in a deep and wild valley, which the mountain Jons Knuber, 2800 feet high, overlooks. It contains 1500 houses, and 6800 inhabitants. It was formerly the head of a mining department, and near it the silver mines were extensively worked for several ages, till, in the present century, it was found that the expense exceeded the value of the gross proceeds, and the works were abandoned. The establishment of the cotton manufacture now gives employment to the population, who would be otherwise in a most destitute condition.
