KILLALOE, a town of Ireland, in the county of Clare, situated on the western bank of the Shannon, over which there is a bridge of nineteen arches. It is an old town, and possesses little or no trade; but there is a water communication with Dublin by means of a canal. Killaloe lies eleven miles north-north-east of Limerick.
