KONJEUR, a small district of Hindustan, in the province of Orissa, situated principally between the twenty-first and twenty-second degrees of north latitude. It is bounded on the north by the districts of Singboom and Mohurbunge, and to the south by the province of Cuttack. It was formerly tributary to the Mahrattas, but is now occupied by independent chiefs. It is fertilized by many streams, but is now in a neglected state. The principal towns are Konjeur, Ogurapoor, and Andapoorgur.
