XIXONA, a city of Spain, the capital of the fertile partido of that name, in the province of Valencia. It is to the north-east of the port of Alicant, from which its chief productions are exported. The vicinity is covered with abundant woods of palm-trees; and mixed with them are extensive plantations of almonds, which form the greatest article in its commerce. From almonds mixed with honey a conserve is made, which is very delicious, and much in demand in almost every part of Spain. The grapes are abundant, and much brandy is distilled from them. The population of the city is stated to be 5000 souls.
