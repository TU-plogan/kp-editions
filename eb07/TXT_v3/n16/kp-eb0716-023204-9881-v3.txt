NIRGUA, a town of Colombia, in South America. It is situated upon a low mountain ridge, which extends from the Sierra Nevada of Merida to the north-east, separating the head waters of the Apure and Orinoco from the streams which fall into the Carribbean Sea, or the Lake of Maracaybo. The climate is very hot, and not at all salubrious, which, with other causes, has contributed to reduce the city; the latter is now in decay, and contains only about three thousand inhabitants. Depons describes the people as robust and strong, but lazy, and addicted to every species of vice. They consist wholly of Zamboes', that is, a mixed race, composed of negroes and Indians. There are some gold mines situated in the valley of Nirgua; and silver is likewise found in the vicinity. Nirgua is in lat. 10° north, and long. 71° 10' west of Paris, about forty-eight leagues west of Caraecas.
