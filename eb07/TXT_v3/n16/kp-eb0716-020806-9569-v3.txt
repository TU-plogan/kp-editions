NICOT, John, seigneur of Villemain, and master of the French king’s household, was born at Nismes, and sent in 1559 as ambassador to Portugal, whence he brought the plant which, from his name, was called Nicoiana, but is now more generally known by the name of tobacco. He died at Paris in the year 1603. Nico wrote a French and Latin dictionary, in folio; a Treatise on Navigation; and some other works.
