NETOPION, a name given by the ancients to a very fragrant and costly ointment, consisting of a great number of the finest spicy ingredients. Hippocrates, in his treatise on the Diseases of Women, frequently prescribes the netopion in diseases of the uterus; and in other places he speaks of its being poured into the ear as a remedy for deafness. The word netopion is also sometimes used to express the unguentum Egyptiacum, and sometimes simply oil of almonds.
