NOVATUS, a priest of Carthage in the third century, who, to avoid being punished for a crime, joined with the deacon named Felicissimus against St Cyprian. In 251 he went to Rome, and there found Novatian, who had acquired great reputation’ by his eloquence, but who murmured at his not being raised to the see of Rome in preference to Cornelius. Novatus soon contracted a friendship with him, and afterwards promoted the consecration of Novatian. This irregular proceeding produced a very great schism. Novatus also maintained that the church had not the power to receive those into communion who had fallen into idolatry.
