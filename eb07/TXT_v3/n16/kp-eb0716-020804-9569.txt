NICOPOLIS, a province of European Turkey, which extends in north latitude from 42. 44. to 43. 46. and in east longitude from 23. 30. to 26. 4. This district is naturally fertile; but agriculture is in a neglected state, and the chief product is cattle. The capital, of the same name, is situated on the Lower Danube. It is fortified, and connected with a strong citadel, and it is said to contain 10,000 inhabitants. It is the seat of a Catholic and also of a Greek bishop.
