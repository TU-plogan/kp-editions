NITHSDALE, Nithisdale or Niddisdale, a district of Dumfriesshire, in Scotland, lying to the westward of Annandale. It is a large and mountainous tract, deriving its name from the river Nid or Nith, which rises on the borders of Ayrshire, and, running by Sanquhar and Dumfries, discharges itself into the Solway Frith.
