NETRAVUTTY, a river of the south of India, in South Canara, which has its source in the western range of the Ghauts, whence its flows in a westerly direction, runs into the lake of Mangalore, and then discharges itself in the sea. It passes by the towns of Arcola and Buntwalla. It is navigable for small vessels as far as the tide flows, which is to Arcola, and afterwards by smaller boats twenty or thirty miles inland.
