NUNDINA, a goddess amongst the ancient heathens, supposed to have had the care of the purification of infants. Because male infants were purified nine days after their birth, her name is derived from nonus, or the ninth; although female infants were also purified on the eighth day, which purification was by the Romans called lustration.
