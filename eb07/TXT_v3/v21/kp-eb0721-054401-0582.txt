VALDEPENNAS, a town of Spain, in the province of La Mancha and the partido of Ciudad Real, of which partido it is the capital. It is surrounded with walls, is well built, having a college, three churches, nine monasteries and five hospitals, with about 9000 inhabitants. It has some manufactures of gloves and woollen goods, and some tanneries, [7:21:545] and is celebrated for the wine which bears its name. In taste and colour it resembles the best of the Burgandy wine. In former times, a portion of it was always engaged for the table of the king; but very little of it finds its way to other countries, from the want of casks to contain it; and from being conveyed in goats’ skins it acquires a disagreeable flavour. Good wheat is produced in the neighbourhood. The town is about eighty miles south-east from Toledo, and one hundred and ten south of Madrid.
