VITTORIA, a city of the kingdom of Naples, in the island of Sicily. It is in the province of Noto, and is the capital of a circle of it called the Contea of Modica, which contains 120,000 acres of land, and 80,000 inhabitants. It is 130 miles from Palermo, and is oddly situated among straggling craggy rocks, but boasts of a few fine edifices. It is the seat of an independent local court of justice, and one of the parliamentary cities. It is rather an unhealthy place, but contains 10,000 inhabitants, who are chiefly occupied in agriculture, rear a great number of horned cattle, and produce a large quantity of silk. It likewise yields much wax and honey.
