VESTRY, a place adjoining to a church, where the vestments of the minister are kept; and also a meeting at such place, consisting of the minister, church-wardens, and chief men of most parishes, who make a parish vestry or meeting. By custom there are select vestries, being a certain number of persons chosen to have the government of the parish, make rates, and take the account of churchwardens, &c.
