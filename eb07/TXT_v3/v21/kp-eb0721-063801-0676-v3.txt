VEVAY, a town of Switzerland, the capital of a bailiwick of the same name in the canton of Vaud. It is finely situated on the lake of Geneva, where the climate is mild, and the prospects around are of the most exciting description. In this town many English families find a retreat. There is a college, an hospital, and other benevolent institutions. Vevay has little trade, and that mostly in native productions. It contains 430 houses, with 4500 inhabitants. There are two churches, in one of which, St Martin’s, are monuments to two Englishmen, Ludlow and Broughton, who had sat as judges at the trial of Charles I. and found refuge here.
