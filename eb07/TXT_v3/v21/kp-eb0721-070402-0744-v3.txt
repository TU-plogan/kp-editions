VOURLA, a sea port of Asia Minor, on the site of the ancient Clazomene, one of the twelve great cities of Ionia. It is built on two eminences; and one division is inhabited by Christians, who occupy about 500 houses, and possess two churches; the remainder of the town is inhabited by Turks. It is now of little importance. Vourla is twenty-five miles west of Smyrna.
