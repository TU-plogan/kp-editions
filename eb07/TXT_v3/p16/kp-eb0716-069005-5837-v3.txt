PACE, a measure taken from the space between the two feet of a man in walking, being usually reckoned two feet and a half, and in some men a yard or three feet. The geometrical pace is five feet; and 60,000 such paces make one degree on the equator.

Pace, in the manège, is of three kinds, viz, walk, trot, and gallop; to which may be added an amble, because some horses have it naturally. Horses which go shuffling, or with mixed paces between the walk and amble, are for the most part of no value. This commonly proceeds from their fiery temper, but sometimes from a weakness in their reins or legs.
