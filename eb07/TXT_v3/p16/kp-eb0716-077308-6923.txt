PALMUS, a long measure used both by the Greeks and the Romans. The Grecian palmus was of two sorts; the greater, which contained nine finger-breadths, and the less, which contained four. The Roman palmus was also of two sorts; the greater, which contained twelve fingerbreadths, or eight inches and a half English; and the less, which contained four finger-breadths, or nearly three inches English. The great palmzis was taken from the length of the hand or span, the less from the breadth of it.
