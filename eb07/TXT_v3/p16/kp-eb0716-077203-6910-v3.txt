PALLIATAE, a name which the Romans gave to such plays as laid the plot in Greece, and required the performers to appear in Grecian habits. It is used in contradistinction to togatae, in which the scene was laid at Rome, and in which the dresses were Roman. The word ραlliata is derived from pallium, which was a part of dress peculiar to the Greeks; whereas the toga belonged exclusively to the Romans.
