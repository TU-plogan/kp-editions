RULE, in matters of literature, a maxim, canon, or precept, to be observed in any art or science.

Rule, in a monastic sense, a system of laws or regulations, according to which religious houses are governed, and which the religious make a vow, at their entrance, to observe. Rules of Court, in Law, are certain orders made from time to time in the courts of law, which attorneys are bound to observe, in order to avoid confusion; and both the plaintiff and defendant are at their peril also bound to pay obedience to rules made in court relating to the cause depending between them.
