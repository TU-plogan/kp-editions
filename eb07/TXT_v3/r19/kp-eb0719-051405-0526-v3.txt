RUANELLI, a valley in the island of Ceylon, famed for its precious stones. The river on which Columbo, the capital, is situated, is navigable to this place by boats. The precious stones and other metallic substances are found in the environs of Ruanelli, amongst the sand and gravel of the river. They consist chiefly of sapphires, topazes, garnets, amethysts, moonstone, tourmalines, and cats-eyes. The land is let on short leases to the highest bidder; and although they are exempted from duties, it produces, after all, but a trifling revenue.
