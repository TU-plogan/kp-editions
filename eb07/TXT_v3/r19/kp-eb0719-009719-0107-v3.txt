REGIFUGIUM, was a feast celebrated at Rome on the 24th of February, in commemoration of the expulsion of Tarquin the Proud, and the abolition of the regal power. It wasalso performed on the 26th of May, when the king of the sacrifices, or Rex Sacrorum, offered bean-flour and bacon in the place where the assemblies were held. The sacrifice being ended, the people hastened away with all speed, to denote the precipitate flight of Tarquin.
