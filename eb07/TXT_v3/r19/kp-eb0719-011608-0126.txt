REMORSE, in its worse sense, signifies that pain or anguish which one feels after having committed some wicked action. It also means tenderness, pity, or sympathetic sor[7:19:117]row; but it is most generally used in a bad sense, and is ’ applied to persons who feel compunction for some great crime, as murder, and the like. Murders which have been committed with the utmost circumspection and secrecy, and the authors of which could never be discovered by any human investigation, have frequently been disclosed by the remorse and confession of the perpetrators, and that, too, many years afterwards.
