REGNIER, Mathubin, the first French poet who succeeded in satire, was born at Chartres in the year 1573. He wa9 brought up to the church, a vocation for which his debaucheries rendered him very unsuitable; and these, by his own confession, were so excessive that at thirty he laboured under all the infirmities of age. Yet he obtained a canonry in the church of Chartres, with other benefices, and died in 1613. There is a neat Elzevir edition of his works, Leyden, 1652, in 12mo; but the most elegant is that with notes by Brossette, London, 1729, in 4to.

Regnikr des Mabets, Séraphin, a French poet, born at Paris in the year 1632. He distinguished himself early by his poetical talents, and in 1684 was made perpetual secretary to the French Academy on the death of Mezeray. It was he who drew up all the papers in the name of the academy against Furetière. The king gave him the priory of Gram-mont, and he had also an abbey. Regnier died in 1713, and his works, in French, Italian, Spanish, and Latin poems, are contained in two vols.; besides a French grammar, and an Italian translation of Anacreon’s Odes, with some other translations.
