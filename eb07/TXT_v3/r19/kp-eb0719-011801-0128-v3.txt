REMUS, the brother of Romulus, was exposed, together with his brother, by the cruelty of his grandfather. In the contest which happened between the two brothers about building a city, Romulus obtained the preference; and Remus, for ridiculing the rising walls, was put to death by his brother’s orders, or by Romulus himself. After this murder the Romans were afflicted with a plague; upon which the oracle was consulted, and the manes of Remus were appeased by the institution of the Remuria.
