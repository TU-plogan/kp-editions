RIGHT, in Geometry, signifies the same with straight; thus, a straight line is called a right one.

Right is a title conferred, 1. together with Reverend, upon all bishops; 2. together with Honourable, upon earls, viscounts, and barons; 3. by courtesy, together with Honourable, upon the sons of dukes, marquises, and the eldest sons of earls; 4. together with Honourable, upon the speaker of the House of Commons, but upon no other commoner excepting those who are members of her majesty’s most honourable privy council, and the three lords mayors of London, York, and Dublin, and the lord provost of Edinburgh, during their office.
