IRROGATIO, a term of the Roman law, signifying the instrument in which were put down the punishments that the law provided against such offences as any person was accused of by a magistrate before the people. These punishments were first proclaimed viva voce by the accuser, and this was called Inquisitio. But the same being immediately afterwards expressed in writing, took the name of Pogatio, in respect of the people, who were to be consulted or asked about it, and was called Irrogatio in respect of the criminal, as it imported the mulct or punishment assigned him by the accuser.
