INCOMBUSTIBLE Cloth. See Mineralogy. On this Cronstedt observes, that the natural store of the asbesti is in proportion to their economical use, both being very inconsiderable. “It is an old tradition,” says he, “that in former ages they made cloths of the fibrous asbesti, which is said to be composed of the word byssus ; but it is not probable, since, if one may conclude from some trifles now made of it, as bags, ribbons, and other things, such a dress could neither have an agreeable appearance, nor be of any conveniency or advantage. It is more probable that the Scythians dressed their dead bodies which were to be burned, in a cloth manufactured of this stone; and this perhaps has occasioned the above fable.” Μ. Magellan confirms this opinion of Cronstedt’s, and informs us that some of the Romans also enclosed dead bodies in cloth of this kind.

Incombustible, something that cannot be burned or consumed by fire. See Asbestos.
