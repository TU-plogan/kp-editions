ISCHIA, an island in the Mediterranean Sea, on the north-west side of the Bay of Naples, of volcanic origin, but fertile in wheat, wine, and fruits. It contains about twenty-seven square miles. The mountain Spomea, in height 2500 feet, is an extinguished volcano, but has woods and good pasture land, and several dairies are maintained, in which excellent cheese is made. It contains the capital, of the same name as the island, with 3140 inhabitants. The whole of the population amounts to 22,470 persons, who are active in producing silk, wine, excellent oil, and various kinds of fruit.
