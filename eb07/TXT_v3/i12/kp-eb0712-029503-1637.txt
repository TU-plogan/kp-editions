INSPECTOR, a person to whom the care and conduct of any work is committed.

Inspectors, in the Roman law, were such persons as examined the quality and value of lands and effects, in order to the adjusting of taxes and impositions in proportion to every man’s estate.

The Jews have also an officer in their synagogue, whom they call p∏, hhazen, or inspector. His business consists principally in inspecting or overlooking the prayers and lessons, in preparing and shewing them to the reader, and in standing by him to see he reads correctly; and, if the latter make mistakes, he is to correct him.
