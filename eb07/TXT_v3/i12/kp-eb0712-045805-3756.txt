ISAURIA, a rugged and mountainous country, touching Pamphylia and Cilicia on the north, situated almost in Mount Taurus, and taking its name from Isaura; and, according to some, extending by a narrow slip to the Mediterranean. Stephanus, Ptolemy, and Zosimus, make no mention of places on the sea; though Pliny and Strabo do; but the latter are doubtful whether these are places in Isauria Proper, or in Pamphylia, or in Cilicia.
