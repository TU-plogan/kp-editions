INCEPTIVE, a word used by Dr Wallis to express such moments, or first principles, as, though of no magnitude themselves, are yet capable of producing results which are. Thus a point has no magnitude itself, but is inceptive of a line which it produces by its motion. So a line, though it have no breadth, is yet inceptive of breadth; that is, it is capable, by its motion, of producing a surface which has breadth.
