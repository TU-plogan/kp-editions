IDIOT, or Ideot, in our laws, denotes a natural fool, or a fool from his birth. See Idiocy.

The word is originally Greek, iδιωrτ l ς, which primarily imports a private person, or one who leads a private life, without any share or concern in the government of affairs.

Idiot is also used, by ancient writers, to signify a person ignorant or unlearned, and answers to illiteratus, or imperitus. In this sense, Victor tells us, in his Chroni-eon, that in the consulship of Messala, the Holy Gospels, by command of the Emperor Anastasius, were corrected and amended, as having been written by idiot evangelists: Tanquam ab idiotis evangelistis composita.
