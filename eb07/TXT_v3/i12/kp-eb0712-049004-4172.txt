IVAHAH, the name of a canoe employed by the South Sea islanders for making short excursions to sea. It is wall-sided, flat bottomed, and of different sizes, varying from seventy-two feet to ten; but its breadth is by no means in proportion; for canoes of ten feet are about a foot wide, and those of more than seventy are scarcely two. The fighting wahah is the longest, and has its head and stern considerably raised. The fishing wahahs are from ten to forty feet in length; those of twenty-five feet and upwards occasionally carry sail. The travelling wahah is always double, and furnished with a small neat house.
