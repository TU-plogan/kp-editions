NACHITSCHEVAN, a city of Russia in Europe, in the eastern division of the circle of Rostow, in the province of Katerinoslaw. It stands on the river Don, which here frequently overflows its banks. Its inhabitants are almost exclusively of the Armenian race and religion; and, by their eastern costume and manners, they are in a great measure kept separate from the Russians. The city contains 2400 houses, and about 14,000 inhabitants. In their eastern way they produce much silk, having planted more than 20,000 mulberry trees. They also grow much hemp and flax; make linen, cotton, and silk goods; and have iron-works, soap-works, and numerous distilleries. These people were brought from the Crimea.
