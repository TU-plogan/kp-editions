NATIVITY, or Natal Day, is the day of a person’s birth. The word nativity is chiefly employed in speaking of the saints; as, the nativity of St John the Baptist, &c. But when we say the Nativity, it is understood of that of Jesus Christ, or the feast of Christmas.

Nativity, nativùas, a term in ancient law-books, which signifies bondage or servitude.

Nativity, in Astrology, the theme or figure of the heavens, particularly of the twelve houses, at the moment when a person was born, and called also the horoscope. Casting the nativity, or by calculation seeking to know how long the queen should live, &c. was made felony by the 23d Eliz. c. 2.
