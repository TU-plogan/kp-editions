THULE, or Thylae, in Ancient Geography, an island in the most northern parts of the German Ocean. Its situation was never accurately ascertained by the ancients, hence its present name is unknown by modern historians. Some suppose that it is the island now called Iceland, or part of Greenland, and others that it is Foula.
