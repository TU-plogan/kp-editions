Tabernacles, Feast of, a solemn festival of the Hebrews, observed after harvest, on the fifteenth day of the month Tisri, instituted to commemorate the goodness of [7:21:67]God, who protected the Israelites in the wilderness, and made them dwell in booths, when they came out of Egypt. On the first day of the feast they began to erect booths of the boughs of trees, and in these they were obliged to continue seven days. The boughs were placed in the open air, and were not to be covered with cloths, nor made too close by the thickness of the boughs, but so loose that the sun and the stars might be seen, and the rains descend through them.
