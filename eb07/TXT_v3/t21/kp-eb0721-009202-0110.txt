TATTOOING, or Tattowing, an operation in use among the islanders in the South Sea, for marking their bodies with figures of various kinds, which they consider as ornamental. It is performed by puncturing the skin, and rubbing a black colour into the wounds. The instrument used somewhat resembles a comb, the teeth of which are repeatedly struck into the skin by means of a small mallet. It is very painful; but the children are forced by their relations to submit to it.
