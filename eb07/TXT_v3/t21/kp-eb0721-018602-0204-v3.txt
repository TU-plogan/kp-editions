TERRACINA, a city of Italy, in the papal delegation of Frosinone. It stands on the sea-shore, at the foot of a hill, where the Pontine marshes terminate. It is the seat of a bishop, has a cathedral, and is surrounded with walls; and being a frontier place, is furnished with a garrison. It is deemed unhealthy, but contains 4170 inhabitants. Near to it are the façade of a temple of Jupiter, and the remains of the palace of Theodoric. It has wood near it, which yields cork. Long. 13. 13. 2. E. Lat. 41. 18. 14. N.
