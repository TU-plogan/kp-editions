TAR, a thick, black, unctuous substance, obtained chiefly from old pines and fir trees by burning them with a close smothering heat. It is prepared in great quantities in Norway, Sweden, Germany, Russia, and North America, and in other countries where the pine and fir abound. Becher the celebrated chemist first proposed to make tar from pit-coal. Manufactures for this purpose were established many years ago in the bishopric of Liege, and in several parts of England. In the year 1781, the earl of Dundonald obtained a patent for extracting tar from pit-coal by a new process of distillation. Great hopes were entertained of the value of this discovery, but we have not heard that it answered his expectations. Tar, which is well known for its economical uses, is properly an empyreumatic oil of turpentine, and has been much used as a medicine both internally and externally. Tar-water, or water impregnated with the more soluble parts of tar, was formerly a very popular remedy, and was most earnestly recommended by Bishop Berkeley.
