TURSHEEZ, a considerable city of Persia, in the province of Khorassan, situated on the verge of the Salt Desert. There is an old city, Sultanabad, which is small; but a new one has been added, in which the governor and his principal officers reside; and the two cities contain about 20,000 inhabitants, among whom are 100 Hindu families. The chief imports are indigo and other drugs from the west, and wool, cloth, and rice from Herat. The chief export is iron. The small quantity of European goods which are used is brought from Mazanderan. Tur-sheez is 160 miles west-north-west of Herat. The intervening country is wild, mountainous, and uncultivated.
