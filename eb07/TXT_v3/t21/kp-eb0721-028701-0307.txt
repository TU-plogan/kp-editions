TIDESWELL, a market-town of the hundred of High Peak, in the county of Derby, 160 miles from London. It is in a lofty situation, and takes its name from a well near it, which, like the sea, ebbs and flows at intervals, rapidly in wet, but slowly in dry seasons. It is an ill-built place, with a large old church, and has a market on Wednesday. The inhabitants amounted in 1821 to 1543, and in 1831 to 1553.
