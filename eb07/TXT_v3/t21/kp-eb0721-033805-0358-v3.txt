TOR, an ancient town of Arabia, near the head of the Red Sea, and once a place of importance, and a great emporium of Indian trade. It has been supplanted by Suez, and has now sunk to a mere village. The harbour is formed by a reef of coral rocks, and to the northward by a low point of land, on which is placed a beacon. The population consists of Greeks and Bedouin Arabs; and here is also a convent of the monks of Mount Sinai, to which they sometimes retire. It has good water, better than any which is found on the Red Sea; but there are no other refreshments nearer than Sinai. Long. 33. 28. E. Lat. 28. 19. N.
