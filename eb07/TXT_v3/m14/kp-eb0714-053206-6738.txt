MEDWAY, a river of England, which rises in the Weald of Sussex, and entering Kentnear Ashurst, runs by Tunbridge, and thence continues its course towards Maidstone. It is navigable for large ships to Rochester bridge, and thence for vessels and barges to Maidstone, the tide flowing up to that town. The distance between the mouth of this river, where the fort at Sheerness is erected, and Rochester bridge, is between sixteen and eighteen miles. In this part of the river the channel is so deep, the banks so soft, and the reaches so short, that it is one of the best and safest harbours in the world; and ships of eighty guns ride afloat at low water, within musket-shot of Rochester bridge. Nor is there a single instance upon record, that any of the royal navy ever suffered here by storms, except in the dreadful tempest which happened in November 1703, when the Royal Catherine was sunk and lost.
