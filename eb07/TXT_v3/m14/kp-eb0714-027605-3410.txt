MASHAM, a town of Yorkshire, in the wapentake of Hang‘East, in the north riding, 224 miles from London. It stands on the river Ure. Near to it was formerly the large Cistertian Abbey of Jervaux, founded in 1145, whose walls, which may now be traced, extended nearly two miles. There is a market, which is held on Tuesday. The population amounted in 1801 to 1012, in 1811 to 1014, in 1821 to 1171, and in 1831 to 1276.
