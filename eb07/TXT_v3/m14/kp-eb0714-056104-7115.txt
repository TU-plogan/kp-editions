MENSORES, amongst the Romans, were harbingers, whose business it was to go before the emperor, and fix upon lodgings for him when he travelled into any of the provinces. They also marked out encampments, and assigned every regiment its post.

Mensores were likewise land-surveyors, architects, or appraisers of houses and public buildings. The distributors of provisions in the army were called mensores frumentarii ; and the appellation of mensores was also applied to servants who waited at table.
