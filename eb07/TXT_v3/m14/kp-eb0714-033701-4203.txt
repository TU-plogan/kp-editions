MAYERNE, SirTheodore de, baron of Aulbone, was the son of Louis de Mayerne, the celebrated author of the General History of Spain, and of the Monarchie Aristo-Democratiqυe, dedicated to the States-General. He was born in 1573, and had for his god-father, Theodore Beza. He studied physic at Montpellier, and was made physician in ordinary to Henry IV. who promised to do great things for him, provided he would change his religion. He declined the offer, and James I. of England having invited him to that country, made him first physician to the household, an office in which he served the royal family till the time of his death in 1655. His works were printed at London in 1700, and occupy a large folio, divided into two books; the first containing his Consilia·, Epistolae, et Observationes ; the second his Pharmacopoeia variceque Medicamentorum forrnulae.
