MARSALA, a parliamentary city of the island of Sicily, in the kingdom of Naples, in the province of Mazzara, and seventy miles from Palermo. It was the Lilybaeum of the ancients, the capital and chief fortress of the Carthaginians. It is now an old wall, with four bastions, but no glacis, and has neither ordnance, quarters, nor bomb-proof stores. It is situated on the sea-shore, but the harbour is nearly choked up with mud. The situation is healthy, and it contains 2450 houses, and 20,550 inhabitants, who depend for subsistence on the productions of the soil, which yields large quantities of fruit, wine, and barilla. Near to it are the salt lagunes, which yield large supplies of culinary salt. Long. 12. 25. 10. E. Lat. 37. 48. 10. N.
