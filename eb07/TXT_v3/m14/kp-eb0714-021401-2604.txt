MANAAR, an island situated on the north-west coast of Ceylon, giving name to ι the gulf which separates Hindustan from Ceylon. The island, which is about fifteen miles in length by three in average breadth, is separated from Ceylon by an arm of the sea about two miles broad, and at low water almost dry, excepting a small channel in the middle, of no greater breadth than about thirty or forty yards. The distance from the western point of this island to that of Ramiseram is twelve leagues, and the intervening space is occupied by a line of sand banks, called Adam’s Bridge, but which, according to a tradition of the Hindus, was constructed by their demigod Ram when he invaded Ceylon. Between these two islands small boats constantly ply, and thus keep open the communication between the two coasts. This island, which was first occupied by the Portuguese in 1560, was taken from them in 1658 by the Dutch, who banished thither their refractory subjects. Long. 79. 58. E. Lat. 9. 6. N.
