MEGARIS, in Ancient Geography, the country of the Megarians, is described as a rugged region, like Attica; the mountain called Oneian or Asinine, now Macriplayi or the löng mountain, extending through it towards Boeotia and Mount Cithaeron. It belonged to Ionia or Attica, until it was taken by the Peloponnesians in the reign of Codrus, when a colony of Dorians settled in it. This territory had Attica to the east, Boeotia to the north and west, and the isthmus of Corinth to the south.
