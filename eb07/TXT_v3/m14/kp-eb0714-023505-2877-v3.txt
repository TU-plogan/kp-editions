MANOR, Maneri um (a manendo, because it was the usual residence of the owner), seems to have been a district of ground held by lords or great personages, who kept in their own hands as much land as was necessary for the use of their families; and this was called terra dominicalis, or demesne land, being occupied by the lord, as dominus mane-rii, and his servants. The other, called tenemental lands, they distributed amongst their tenants; and these, from the different modes of tenure, were distinguished by two different names. The first kind was booh-land, or charter-land, which was held by deed under certain rents and free services, and in effect differed nothing from free soccage lands; and hence arose most of the freehold tenants who hold of particular manors, and owe suit and service to the same. The second species was called folk-land, which was held by no assurance in writing, but distributed amongst the common folk or people, at the pleasure of the lord, and resumed at his discretion, being indeed land held in villenage.
