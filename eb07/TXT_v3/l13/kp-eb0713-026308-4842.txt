LEWES, a borough-town of the rape of Swanbrough, in the county of Sussex, situated on the right bank of the Ouse, from which it gradually rises, forty-nine miles from London. It stands at the foot of the chalk hills, and is well built and pleasantly situated. It was anciently walled, and still retains the remains of an ancient fortress. It formerly had twelve churches, now reduced to six, and before the reformation several religious houses. It has now several charity schools, and other benevolent institutions. It is not incorporated, but returns, and will continue to do so, two members to the House of Commons. The summer assizes are held here. There is some trade by the river, which is navigable for barges to Newhaven. On its banks are some cast-iron founderies. The market is held on Saturday. The population amounted in 1801 to 4909, in 1811 to 5221, in 1821 to 7083, and in 1831 to 8592.
