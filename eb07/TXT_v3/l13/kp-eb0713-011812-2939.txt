LATOMIA properly signifies a stone quarry ; but the places whence stones had been dug having been made use of sometimes as dungeons, jails, or prisons for criminals, it is often applied as a name for a prison. There was a place of confinement of this sort at Rome, near the Tullianum, and another at Syracuse, in which Cicero says Verres had shut up Roman citizens.
