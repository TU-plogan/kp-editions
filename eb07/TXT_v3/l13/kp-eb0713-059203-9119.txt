LUD, a British king mentioned in our old chronicles, and said to have reigned about the year of the world 3878. He is reported to have enlarged and walled round Troy- novant, or New Troy, where he kept his court, and made it his capital. The name of London is derived from Lulls town, and Ludgate from his being buried near it; but this is only one amongst many other derivations of the name of London, which are at least equally probable.
