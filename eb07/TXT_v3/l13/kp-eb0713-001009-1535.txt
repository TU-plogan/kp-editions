LADY, a title derived from two Saxon words, signifying loaf-dαy, words which have in time been contracted into the present appellation. It properly belongs only to the daughters of earls, and all of higher rank; but custom has made it a word of complaisance for the wives of all gentlemen. As to the original application of this expression, it may be observed, that in former times it was the fashion for opulent families to live constantly at their mansion-houses in the country, where once a week, or oftener, the lady of the manor distributed to her poor neighbours, with her own hands, a certain quantity of bread.

Lady-Duij, in Law, the 25th of March, being the annunciation of the Holy Virgin.
