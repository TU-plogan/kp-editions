LUBIN, Eilhard, was professor of poetry in the uni [7:13:583]versity of Rostock in 1595, and ten years afterwards he was promoted to the professorship of divinity. He wrote notes upon Anacreon, Juvenal, Persius, and several other classics; but that which attracted the most notice was a treatise on the nature and origin of evil, entitled Phosphorus de Causa prima et Natura Mali, printed at Rostock in 1596, in which we find a curious hypothesis to account for the origin of moral evil. He supposed two coeternal principles, not matter and vacuum, as Epicurus did, but God, and Nihilum, or Nothing. This hypothesis being attacked by Grawer, was defended by Lubin; but, after all, he is deemed to have been better acquainted with polite literature than with divinity. He died in 1621.
