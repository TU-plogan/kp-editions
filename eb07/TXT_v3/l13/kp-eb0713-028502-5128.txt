LIBITINARII, were undertakers whose office it was to take care of funerals, prepare all things necessary upon this solemn occasion, and furnish every article required. They obtained their livelihood by this gloomy business, and kept a number of servants to perform the working part of the profession, such as the pollinctores, vespillones, and others. The name Libitinarii is derived from Libitina, the goddess of funerals, in whose temple were sold all things relating to funerals. See Funeral.
