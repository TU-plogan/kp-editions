LENTINI, a parliamentary city of the island of Sicily, in the kingdom of Naples, and province of Noto, 120 miles from Palermo. It is situated on some broken ground above the Leontine fields. The situation is subject to malaria, and, though it contains 1400 houses, the inhabitants scarcely exceed 5000. The surrounding district is highly productive of rice, hemp, corn, oil, and liquorice.
