                    personal injuries, resorted to by mankind, were probably the different parts of
                    vegetables produced in their respective countries; and hence we find that most
                    savages are acquainted with vulneraries prepared by the hand of nature, or that
                    they seek to improve them from decoctions and infusions of roots, flowers, and
                    leaves. Among the <pb break="no" facs="nls:193193501" xml:id="kp-eb0704-3501-0322"/>more precious substances obtained from plants,
                    applied as curative of wounds by the ruder inhabitants of the eastern climates,
                    the balm of Gilead, or balsam of Mecca, has been eminently distinguished during
                    many ages. But although the balm of Gilead is well known from several scriptural
                    allusions, and highly esteemed, it is only of secondary quality to the balsam of
                    Mecca, for which it is frequently substituted; and illustrations of its nature
                    and properties must chiefly be derived from the latter. This balsam is a
                    resinous matter, exuding, like ordinary resin, from incisions in the bark of two
                    different vegetables; at least there are apparently two, though the distinction
                    is not well characterized or described by naturalists, which circumstance has
                    excited conjectures that there is only one, and that it is subject to certain
                    external modifications from soil and climate. The plant producing the balsam of
                    Mecca was first ascertained by Forskal to belong to the genus <hi rend="italic">Amyris.</hi> He transmitted one or two specimens to Linnaeus, who has
                    characterized it as the “<hi rend="italic">Amyris Opobalsamum,</hi> leaves
                    pinnate, with sessile leaflets, a native of Arabia while he characterizes the
                    other as “<hi rend="italic">Amyris Gi-leadensis,</hi> leaves ternate, very
                    entire peduncles, one flowered lateral, a native of Abyssinia.” We shall,
                    however, consider it more in detail. This plant grows to the height of fourteen
                    feet, flourishingin a hot climate,and in a stony barren soil. In general it is
                    lower; and Mr Bruce describes a specimen five feet and a half in height, and
                    five inches across the stem where thickest. The wood is white, light, and of
                    open texture, covered with a smooth bark, reddish or bluish white, resembling
                    that of a healthy standard cherry-tree, green within, and emitting a very
                    fragrant odour; that of the branches, which are very flexible and resinous,
                    being equally agreeable. The leaves, which are evergreen and scanty, bear some
                    resemblance to those of rue; and the flowers, which are leguminous and of a
                    purplish colour, resemble those of the acacia. The fruit consists of small
                    pointed ovoidal berries, containing a yellowish fluid similar to honey, of a
                    bitterish taste, and exhaling a pleasant perfume, approaching the odour of balm.
                    This plant is called <hi rend="italic">Palessan</hi> in the East; but it would
                    require new botanical researches to ascertain definitely, and beyond dispute,
                    whether it is of different species, as is most probable, and what is its real
                    character; —points which we must consider as remaining to be established.</p><p>It has been maintained that the plants producing the balsam of Mecca are
                    restricted to a plantation of little more than thirty acres in extent, at Beder
                    Hunein, a station for pilgrims in Arabia, half-way between Mecca and Medina. Yet
                    it cannot be positively affirmed that this is one distinct species; that
                    Abyssinia, the country ascribed to the other, is deprived of it; or that the
                    balm of Gilead grows exclusively in Abyssinia. These are facts which require
                    elucidation from future botanical researches. The plantation belongs to a noble
                    family of Arabs, of the tribe Beni Koreish, from which Mahommed originated,
                    unless the incursions of the Wahabees, who interrupted the wonted pilgrimages,
                    have dispossessed them.</p><p>The balsam in question flows from incisions in the tree, which are made with an
                    axe, in July, August, and the beginning of September, when the circulation of
                    the sap is in the greatest activity; and it is received into a small earthen
                    bottle. Each day’s produce is collected, and poured into one of larger
                    dimensions; but the quantity obtained is very small, and its collection is
                    tedious and troublesome; for the total exudation is usually but three or four
                    drops in a day, nor does the most productive tree afford above sixty. Its
                    scarcity, therefore, and the difficulty of procuring it, have no inconsiderable
                    effect in enhancing its value. The odour is at first strong and pungent, occa
                    sioning a sensation like that of volatile salts rashly i∏. haled. Its intensity
                    is proportioned to its freshness and the care it receives; for if neglected and
                    exposed to the influence of the air, the fragrance entirely decays. It is also
                    of a rough, acrid, pungent taste. Originally the balsam is of a light yellow
                    colour, somewhat turbid, and of a whitish cast, which is supposed to arise from
                    the globules of air absorbed along with it; and it dissolves readily in water.
                    It then acquires greater consistence, resembling honey, and becomes pellucid;
                    and after the lapse of some years grows of deeper yellow, or gold colour, when
                    it is very tenacious, and may be drawn out in threads. It is difficult, however,
                    to obtain the balsam in astate of purity; for several different substances are
                    employed in its adulteration, to detect which various experiments are resorted
                    to. If dropped into a glass of clean water, it falls to the bottom without
                    rising again to the surface; or if it remain still on the surface, like oil in a
                    drop, it is certainly adulterated. If, on the contrary, it spreads on the
                    surface of the water, diffusing itself in a thin pellicle, scarcely visible to
                    the eye, and capable of being collected with a thread or a feather, it is the
                    pure and natural product. In this state it will coagulate like milk, but not if
                    otherwise. If pure it collects in a globule when dropped on hot iron; if
                    adulterated, it runs and spreads itself all around. The different substances
                    used in the adulteration of this balsam are honey, wax, oil of sesamum,
                    turpentine, and ostrich fat. Sweetness of taste betrays the honey, and a turbid
                    appearance the presence of wax. Adulteration with oil is detected by its
                    yielding a darker and grosser flame than that which issues from the genuine
                    balsam when dropped on burning coals. When the consistency becomes too great,
                    which seems a consequence of age and long preservation, fluidity is restored by
                    the simple application of heat.</p><p>Besides the balsam now described, which is the purest and most valuable kind, and
                    is called Opobalsamum, other two of inferior quality are obtained from the
                    balessan; first, Carpobalsamum, which is prepared by expression from the fruit
                    when it has attained maturity, and which, if good, should be ponderous, of a
                    pungent taste and balsamic odour; secondly, Xylobalsamum, which is elaborated
                    from a decoction of the twigs. The latter are collected in small faggots and
                    sent to Venice, and the circumstance which determines them to be the shoots of
                    the year is said to consist in their being knotty, the bark red, and the wood
                    white, resinous, and exhaling balsamic odour. Various impostures are likewise
                    practised here, in substituting spurious compounds for the real drug; and the
                    ingenuity of mankind in this species of deception has been carried to such an
                    extent that detection proves extremely difficult.</p><p>Numerous virtues are ascribed to the balm of Gilead,— so numerous, that modern
                    empirics, availing themselves of that credulity which characterizes our nature
                    in all matters connected with health, do not hesitate to offer specifics of
                    their own invention, under the same name, with bold asseverations that the human
                    race will there find a palliative for most of the evils with which they are
                    afflicted. Prosper Alpinus, one of the older naturalists, ascribes many
                    properties to the balsam of Mecca, esteemed the most precious of all that bear
                    the appellation of balsam,and in ordinary description considered as synonymous
                    with the balm of Gilead; and the modern Arabs, Turks, and Egyptians, entertain
                    great confidence in its efficacy. It is a powerful vulnerary, a quality of which
                    Mahomet took advantage; for he affirmed that a grove of the trees sprung up from
                    the blood of his own . tribe killed in battle, the juice of which cured the
                    wounds of the faithful, however deadly, nay, that it recovered some of them from
                    death itself. Hasselquist says it is useful as a stomachic <pb break="no" facs="nls:193193514" xml:id="kp-eb0704-3514-0323"/>in doses of
                    three grains. It is also taken for complaints in the breast, and in fevers, and
                    is applied for rheumatism. Its repute as an antiseptic is very great; and it is
                    esteemed so effectual an antidote against the plague, that when this distemper
                    makes its appearance the Egyptians take a certain quantity daily. The balsam of
                    Mecca, however, is principally used as a cosmetic by the eastern females of
                    rank. After being kept in a very warm bath, the face and breast are anointed
                    with it; and the same process is continued every third day during a month. Oil
                    of almonds and other cosmetics are then rubbed over the same parts, by which
                    means the skin and complexion are beautifully renovated. Lady Mary Wortley
                    Montague relates that she was induced to try the experiment; and that, in
                    consequence, her face became swelled and red for three days, during which time
                    she suffered so much pain as to restrain her from repeating the application. But
                    her complexion was greatly improved; and she adds, that the ladies of
                    Constantinople, by whom it is used, have the finest bloom imaginable.</p><p>The balm of Gilead has been celebrated from a very remote antiquity. We have the
                    testimony of Moses that it was an article of commerce in the earlier periods of
                    Jewish history; for at the time Joseph was confined by his brethren in a pit,
                    and during their deliberations on his fate, it is said, “And they sat down to
                    eat bread,—and they lifted up their eyes and looked, and behold a company of
                    Ishmaelites came from Gilead, with their camels bearing spicery, and <hi rend="italic">balm,</hi> and myrrh, going to carry it down to Egypt.” Jeremiah
                    particularly alludes to the virtues of the <hi rend="italic">balm in
                    Gilead.</hi> Josephus, however, does not carry the knowledge of it so high; for
                    he observes, that the queen of Sheba or Saba, “who was inquisitive into
                    philosophy, and on that and other accounts was also to be admired,” brought the
                    balm of Gilead as a present to Solomon, on her visit to Jerusalem, about a
                    thousand years before the Christian era. “They say also that we possess the root
                    of this balsam, which our country still bears, from that woman’s gift.” This is
                    not inconsistent with the words of Jeremiah, who probably flourished about four
                    thousand years later; and to reconcile the statement of Moses with this account,
                    some critics have supposed that Judea did not possess the real balm of Gilead
                    earlier than the queen of Sheba’s gift, but an inferior kind of balsam ;—a fact
                    not improbable. Further, it appears, that what was in highest esteem as the balm
                    of Gilead, was in truth the balsam of Mecca. The best testimony of its value is
                    its having been the subject of royal donation among the rarities brought for the
                    acceptance of so illustrious a prince as Solomon. It appears from the writings
                    of the ancients who were contemporary with Josephus, that Judea was generally
                    believed to be exclusively possessed of this product. Pliny remarks,—“but to all
                    other odours whatsoever is to be preferred that balsam which is produced in no
                    other part of the world than the land of Judea, and there in two gardens only,
                    both belonging to the king, one not exceeding twenty acres in size, and the
                    second still smaller.” Strabo, however, m the opinion of Mr Bruce, ascertained
                    the real spot where the balsam originated, in ascribing it to that country over
                    or near to which the queen of Sheba reigned. “Near to this,” he says, “is the
                    most favoured land of the Sabaeans, and they are a very great people.
                    Frankincense, myrrh, and cinnamon, grow among them, and on ffie coast that is
                    about Saba, the balsam also.” Whence Mr Bruce observes, that “among the
                    myrrh-trees behind Asab, all along the coast to the Straits of Babelmandel, is
                    its native country. It grows to a tree above fourteen θet high spontaneously and
                    without culture, like the ŋiyrrh, the coffee, and the frankincense tree; they
                    are all equally the wood of the country, and occasionally cut down for fuel.”
                    Diodorus Siculus likewise affirms that this balsam grew in a valley of Arabia
                    Felix. But Mr Bruce, who investigated the subject with considerable care,
                    supposes that it was towards the era of Pliny that it received its name of <hi rend="italic">Balsamum Judaicum,</hi> or balm of Gilead, and thence became an
                    article of commerce and fiscal revenue, which might probably operate as a
                    discouragement to bringing it from Arabia; as also that it might be prohibited
                    as contraband. Some centuries later, than the time of those ancient authors, we
                    see that it was known in Arabia, and perhaps in the place now most celebrated
                    for it. A traveller who assumes the name of Ali Bey says that there is no balsam
                    made at Mecca; that, on the contrary, it is very scarce, and is obtained
                    principally in the territory of Medina; and also that it was called <hi rend="italic">belsan.</hi> As the repute of the balsam of Mecca rose, the balm
                    of Gilead disappeared; though in the era of Galen, who flourished in the second
                    century, and travelled into Syria and Palestine purposely to obtain a knowledge
                    of this substance, it grew in Jericho, and many other parts of the Holy Land.
                    The cause of its total decay has been ascribed, not without reason, to the royal
                    attention being withdrawn from it by the distractions of the country. In more
                    recent times its naturalization seems to have been attempted in Egypt; for
                    Prosper Alpinus relates, that forty plants were brought from Arabia by a
                    governor of Cairo, to the garden there, and ten remained when Belon travelled in
                    Egypt, nearly 250 years ago; but whether from not agreeing with the African soil
                    or otherwise, only one existed in the last century, and now there appears to be
                    none.</p><p>The balsam of Mecca has always been deemed a substance of the greatest value.
                    When Selim, emperor of the Turks, reduced Arabia and Egypt under his dominion in
                    the year 1516, he exacted a tribute of three pounds weight of it yearly; which
                    continues to be sent to Constantinople to this day. Besides this, part of the
                    governor of Cairo’s appointments include a right to receive a pound of balsam;
                    the like quantity was due to an officer who conducted the caravan of pilgrims to
                    Mecca, and half a pound to the pasha of Damascus, who superintends the whole
                    pilgrimage.</p><p>Notwithstanding the celebrity of this plant, Mr Bruce denies that it had ever
                    been seen by the ancients, by whom he probably means the Romans, as their
                    descriptions are so various and discordant. Prosper Alpinus, who lived in the
                    sixteenth century, does not seem to know the real class to which it belongs; and
                    even within these few years Μ. Duplessy, who has paid much attention to the
                    exudations of vegetables, is apparently not aware of its having been figured by
                    Bruce, and also more recently by Dr Woodville. Such uncertainties of old excited
                    a violent dispute between the inhabitants of Rome and Venice whether the drug
                    used in medicinal compounds was truly the balm of Gilead; and the point being
                    referred to the pope, his holiness directed that information should be obtained
                    from Egypt, in consequence of which he decided in favour of the Venetians.</p><p>The balsam of Mecca is not the only one possessing exclusive medicinal
                    properties, though it is, perhaps, more eminently distinguished for them.
                    Sixteen balsamic plants of the same genus are enumerated by botanists, each
                    exhibiting some peculiarity; and the balsam of Tolu, obtained from incisions on
                    a shrub growing in some of the South American provinces, is thought to approach
                    the nearest to the virtues of this famous balm. It is highly aromatic, a
                    powerful antiseptic, and not less efficacious as a vulnerary. It is also very
                    rare and difficult to be procured, which has induced impostors to offer
                    adulterations <pb break="no" facs="nls:193193527" xml:id="kp-eb0704-3527-0324"/>or counterfeits under its name. That which is
                    particularly substituted is the balsam of Peru, the product of another tree,
                    which can be obtained in abundance either from incisions or decoction of the
                    different parts. The secretions of these plants, however, are neither invariably
                    odoriferous nor salutary: the balsam of Carthagena exhales a penetrating
                    disagreeable smell; and there is a low evergreen shrub, a native of North
                    Carolina and the Bahama Islands, producing a fruit which is deadly poison, and a
                    balsam as black as ink.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
