                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">BLACKMORE, <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir Richard</hi></label>, a
                    physician, and voluminous writer of theological, poetical, and physical works.
                    Having early declared in favour of the Revolution, King William, in 1697, chose
                    him one of his physicians in ordinary, and conferred on him the honour of
                    knighthood. On Queen Anne’s accession, Sir Richard was also appointed one of her
                    physicians, and continued so for some time. But Dryden and Pope treated the
                    poetical performances of Blackmore with great contempt; and in a note to the
                    mention made of him in the Dunciad, we are informed that his “indefatigable muse
                    produced no less than six epic poems: Prince and King Arthur, in twenty books;
                    Eliza, in ten; Alfred, in twelve; The Redeemer, <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> φ
                    <hi rend="superscript"> s</hi> * <hi rend="superscript"> x</hi> ’ besides Job,
                    in folio; the whole book of Psalms; The Creation, in seven books; the Nature of
                    Man, in three books; and many more.” But notwithstanding that Blackmore was
                    greatly ridiculed by the wits, he is not without merit; and Addison, in the
                    Spectator, has bestowed some liberal commendations on his poem on the Creation.
                    It must be mentioned, too, in honour of Sir -Richard, that he was a chaste
                    writer, and a warm advocate for virtue, at a time when an almost universal
                    degeneracy prevailed. He had been very free in his censures <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 0</hi> the libertine writers of his age; and it was owing to
                    some liberty he had taken of this kind, that he drew upon himself the resentment
                    of Mr Dryden. He had likewise given offence to Mr Pope; for having been informed
                    by Mr Curl that the “bard of Twickenham” was the author of a travestie of the
                    first Psalm, he took occasion to reprehend him for it in his Essay on Polite
                    Learning. Besides the works above mentioned, Sir Richard wrote some theological
                    tracts, and several treatises on the plague, small-pox, consumptions, the
                    spleen, gout, dropsy, and a variety of small poetical pieces. He died on the 9th
                    of October 1729.</p>
