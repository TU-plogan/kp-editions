                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">BENTLEY, <hi rend="smallcaps">Richard</hi></label>, one of
                    the greatest critics of modern times, was a native of Oulton in the parish of
                    Rothwell and the West Riding of Yorkshire, and was born on the 27th of January
                    1662. His ancestors belonged to the higher class of English yeomen. During the
                    civil wars, his grandfather, James Bentley, had been a captain in the royal
                    army, and having fallen into the hands of the enemy, he ended his life as a
                    prisoner in Pontefract Castle. His father, Thomas Bentley, who was the possessor
                    of a small estate at Woodlesford, married, as his second wife, Sarah the
                    daughter of Richard Willie, a stone-mason at Oulton; and their first child was
                    the individual who afterwards rendered the family illustrious. For the first
                    elements even of classical learning he is said to have been indebted to his
                    mother, who is described as a woman of an excellent understanding. After having
                    been a day-scholar at the neighbouring hamlet of Methley, he was sent to the <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193196790" xml:id="kp-eb0704-6790-0575"/> grammar school of
                    Wakefield, where John Potter, afterwards archbishop of Canterbury, likewise
                    received his early education. On the 24th of May 1676, he was entered as a
                    subsizar of St John’s College, which was then the largest in the university of
                    Cambridge: his tutor was Joseph Johnston, and the master of the college Dr
                    Francis Turner, afterwards bishop of Ely. Of the peculiar direction of his
                    academical studies no record has been preserved: that he cultivated classical
                    learning with great energy and perseverance, cannot well be doubted; and we are
                    led to infer that he was far from neglecting the mathematical sciences. Having
                    continued at college for upwards of two years, he became a scholar on the
                    foundation of Dr Dowman; and at the expiration of the third year, he succeeded
                    to one of the Yorkshire scholarships founded by Sir Marmaduke Constable. At the
                    regular period he took the degree of A. B. From a fellowship of his college he
                    was excluded by a provision in the statutes, which prohibited more than two
                    fellows from being chosen from the same county. He was however appointed
                    headmaster of the grammar school of Spalding in Lincolnshire, the nomination to
                    this office having lapsed to the college. On attaining the age of majority, he
                    disposed of his interest in the Oulton property to his brother James, the issue
                    of his father’s first marriage; and the money thus procured he devoted to the
                    purchase of books, which are not less necessary to a scholar than tools to a
                    carpenter. Bentley did not long retain the functions of a schoolmaster; for,
                    after an interval of about twelve months, he became domestic tutor to the son of
                    Dr Stillingfleet, dean of St Paul’s, who had formerly been a fellow of St John’s
                    College. In the month of July 1683 he took the degree of A. Μ. Soon after the
                    Revolution, the eminent merits of Stillingfleet were rewarded with the bishopric
                    of Worcester; and about the same period he sent his son James to the university
                    of Oxford, where both he and his tutor became members of Wadham College. Bentley
                    was incorporated A. Μ. on the 4th of July 1689.</p>
                <p>He now projected editions of Greek grammarians and of Latin poets; he indeed
                    pursued an arduous course of study, which gradually prepared him for any
                    department of classical enterprise. The plan which he contemplated as the
                    foundation of his fame was a complete collection of the fragments of the Greek
                    poets. This plan he never executed; but of his competency for such a task he has
                    left sufficient evidence in his collection of the fragments of Callimachus,
                    afterwards communicated to Graevius. At the suggestion, as is supposed, of the
                    very learned Bishop Lloyd, he undertook the stupendous task of publishing a
                    complete edition of the Greek lexicoraphers: but the general design, which was
                    too vast to be properly executed by one individual, appears to have been
                    abandoned after a short interval; and it is much to be regretted that he did not
                    at least publish an edition of Hesychius, an author in whom he professes to have
                    made upwards of five thousand corrections. Of his familiarity with this
                    lexicorapher he exhibited a sufficient specimen in ⅛ <hi rend="superscript">

                    of the chronicle of Joannes Malela Antiochenus, which was printed at Oxford in
                    the year 1691. By the publication of this little work, at the age of
                    twenty-nine, he laid the foundation of a high reputation among men of
                    learning.</p>
                <p>His next appearance before the public was in the character of a divine. He had
                    received deacon’s orders from Compton, bishop of London, in the year 1690, and
                    soon afterwards had been appointed one of the bishop of Worcester s chaplains.
                    In 1692 the four trustees, one of whom was Evelyn, honoured him with the first
                    nomination <hi rend="superscript"> t0 β</hi> °yle’s lectureship. The eight
                    discourses which he preached in consequence of this appointment, embrace a
                    confutation of atheism: they are in a great degree directed against the
                    principles of Hobbes and Spinoza, which have too certain a tendency to atheism,
                    although they are not professedly atheistical; and Bentley claims the merit of
                    having been the first to display the discoveries of Newton in a popular form,
                    and to explain their irresistible force in the proof of a Deity. His reputation
                    was greatly augmented by the publication of his lectures; of which the sixth
                    edition, including other three discourses, was printed at Cambridge in the year
                    1735. The lectures were translated into Latin by Jablonski, who was himself a
                    writer of distinguished learning. Nor did the merit of the author remain without
                    its reward: in 1692, soon after he had taken priest’s orders, he obtained a
                    prebend in the cathedral of Worcester; and in the course of the following year,
                    he succeeded Henry de Justel as keeper of the king’s library. In 1694 he was
                    again appointed to preach the Boyle lectures, and he then selected as their
                    subject the defence of Christianity against infidels; but this series of
                    discourses his friends could not prevail upon him to publish, nor has it been
                    ascertained that the manuscript is still preserved. In the following year, his
                    patron the bishop of Worcester gave him the rectory of Hartlebury, to be held
                    till his old pupil should arrive at the canonical age. The interest of the same
                    worthy prelate had, about this period, procured him the nomination of chaplain
                    in ordinary to the king. It must be recqrded as an instance of scandalous
                    ingratitude, that, when the bishop’s grandson Benjamin Stillingfleet was left an
                    orphan, and was sent in the humble capacity of a sizar to Trinity College,
                    Bentley refused to give him a fellowship, and preferred several competitors of
                    inferior attainments. At the beginning of the year 1696, he ceased to reside in
                    the bishop’s house in Park-street, Westminster, and took possession of the
                    librarian’s apartments in St James’s Palace; and in the month of July lie took
                    the degree of D. D. at Cambridge.</p>
                <p>Dr Bentley was now making a rapid approach to the full height of his literary
                    fame; and his principal efforts were more the result of accidental excitements
                    than of his own deliberate plans. In the year 1692 Sir William Temple, one of
                    the most fashionable writers of the age, had published an <hi rend="italic"
                    >Essay upon the Ancient and Modern Learning,</hi> in which he strenuously
                    opposed the opinions of Fontenelle and Perrault, who had given a very decided
                    preference to the moderns. But his own learning was inadequate to so serious an
                    undertaking, and his commendation of the ancients is therefore of very doubtful
                    value. Of his mode of estimating the merit of modern writers, it has been justly
                    mentioned as a curious specimen, that the names of Shakspeare, Milton, Bacon,
                    and Newton, have not found a place in his essay. In confirmation of his
                    position, that the oldest books extant are still the best of their kind, he
                    produces the Fables of Aesop and the Epistles of Phalaris, which he believed to
                    be the most ancient pieces of prose written by profane authors. And in reference
                    to the work which bears the name of the ancient tyrant, he is pleased to remark,
                    “I think he must have little skill in painting, that cannot find out this to be
                    an original.” The attention thus directed to Phalaris seems to have suggested
                    the expediency of a new edition; and the dean of Christ Church, Dr Aldrich,
                    committed the task of editing his epistles to the Honourable Charles Boyle,
                    brother to the earl of Orrery; a young gentleman of pleasing manners, and of a
                    relish for learning creditable to his age and station. On his admission at
                    Christ Church, he was placed under the tuition of Atterbury, who, if not a
                    profound, was at least an elegant scholar. In his editorial labours he was aided
                    by his private tutor John Freind, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193196803"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0704-6803-0576"/>then one of the junior students, and afterwards a
                    physician of no small celebrity. The editor of Phalaris wished to procure a
                    collation of a manuscript belonging to the royal library; but, instead of making
                    any direct application to the librarian, he had recourse to the agency of Thomas
                    Bennet, a bookseller in St Paul’s Churchyard, who appears to have executed his
                    commission with no extraordinary degree of zeal or dispatch. In order to conceal
                    his own negligence, he is supposed to have misrepresented the entire transaction
                    to his employers at Oxford; and the preface to Mr Boyle’s edition of Phalaris,
                    published in the year 1695, contains a sarcastic reflection on Bentley for his
                    want of civility. To the editor he immediately addressed a letter, explaining
                    the real circumstances of the case; but instead of receiving an answer in the
                    spirit of conciliation, he was given to understand that he might seek redress in
                    any way he pleased. It is however dangerous to take a lion by the beard.</p>
                <p>Dr Wotton, his friend and fellow-collegian, had recently engaged in the
                    controversy respecting the comparative excellence of the ancients and moderns;
                    and after he had sent to the press his <hi rend="italic">Reflections upon
                    Ancient and Modern Learning,</hi> Bentley happened to state, in the course of
                    their conversation, and in reference to the extravagant commendation bestowed by
                    Sir William Temple, “that the Epistles of Phalaris are spurious, and that we
                    have nothing now extant of Aesop’s own composition.” This casual remark was
                    converted into a promise that he would furnish a written statement of his
                    opinion, to be added to the second edition of the Reflections. To the second
                    edition, which appeared in 1697, was accordingly subjoined Dr Bentley’s
                    “Dissertation upon the Epistles of Phalaris, Themistocles, Socrates, Euripides,
                    and others, and the Fables of Aesop.” Of the spuriousness of all the productions
                    thus enumerated, his demonstration is by every competent judge admitted to be
                    very complete; but his most vigorous efforts are directed against the Epistles
                    of Phalaris. After having produced the chronological proofs of their spurious
                    origin, he considers the language, and next the matter, of the Epistles, and
                    concludes with an argument drawn from what he calls their late appearance in the
                    world. This work certainly betrays some symptoms of hasty composition; but the
                    number of mistakes or oversights which his adversaries were capable of detecting
                    was surprisingly small. The entire disputation is managed with great learning,
                    and with sagacity not inferior to his learning. The contemptuous strain of
                    Bentley’s animadversion excited great indignation in the members of Christ
                    Church; and an answer was speedily prepared by a confederacy, which, however
                    deficient in critical learning, was by no means deficient in self-esteem. The
                    leaders were Francis Atterbury and George Smalridge, both of whom were
                    afterwards elevated to the episcopal bench: Robert Freind, afterwards
                    head-master of Westminster school, his brother John Freind, and Anthony Alsop,
                    all students of Christ Church, are generally understood to have lent their aid.
                    The share of Atterbury is sufficiently ascertained from a passage in one of bis
                    letters to Boyle, in which he reminds him that, “in writing more than half the
                    book, in reviewing a good part of the rest, and in transcribing the whole, half
                    a year of his life had passed away.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>The motley production, bearing the title of “Dr Bentley’s Dissertations on the
                    Epistles of Phalaris and the Fables of Aesop, examined by the Honourable Charles
                    Boyle, Esq. was published in the year 1698; and in the following year Bentley
                    published “A Dissertation upon the Epistles of Phalaris, with an Answer to the
                    Objections of the Honourable Charles Boyle, Esquire.” They are both in the
                    octavo form; the former extending to about 300 pages, and the latter to 655. The
                    wits of Christ Church were overwhelmed with an immense mass of learning, and
                    that so well digested, and animated with so much spirit, that it would be
                    difficult to mention many critical works worthy of being compared with Bentley’s
                    Dissertation. His learning was superior, immeasurably superior, to that of the
                    Oxford combination; nor did they find him inferior in the use of their now
                    weapons of wit and sarcasm. Bentley’s wit is not without a certain tinge of
                    rusticity, but it is nevertheless full of poignancy. He everywhere maintains an
                    air of undaunted confidence, and he doubtless felt for his adversaries that
                    contempt which he so strongly expressed. As he has incidentally discussed many
                    different topics of classical erudition, his work is interesting and valuable
                    even to those who may not deem the principal question of much importance. The
                    extent of his learning, and the dexterity with which he applies it to every
                    subject that presents itself, are not more conspicuous than the intuitive
                    sagacity of his conjectural emendations.</p>
                <p>This controversy produced an ample number of tracts, which are chiefly anonymous,
                    and have little intrinsic merit. On the side of Bentley’s nominal antagonist,
                    prejudice, as well as fashion, was strongly arrayed. It is not a little curious
                    to read the following couplet in Garth’s Dispensary, and to compare the partial
                    estimate of contemporaries with the mature decision of posterity.</p>

                <p>But it is only by himself that an author can be written down. A confederacy of
                    wit and fashion may for a certain time succeed in exalting one writer above, and
                    in depressing another below, his proper standard; but as no large community of
                    men is without a latent sense of justice, no attempt of this nature can be
                    attended with ultimate success; nor is it more certain that heavy or light
                    bodies will sink or float according to their specific gravity, than that the
                    reputation of good and bad writers will finally maintain some perceptible
                    relation to their actual desert.</p>
                <p>When Bentley produced this singular work, he was in the thirty-eighth year of his
                    age. His literary merit, though not duly appreciated by the public, was well
                    known to the most competent judges; and on the promotion of Dr Montague to the
                    deanery of Durham, he was recommended to the vacant office of master of Trinity
                    College, Cambridge. To this office he was admitted on the first of February
                    1700, and was thus placed in a situation of dignity and emolument; but his
                    appointment was unpopular from the beginning, and his administration was marked
                    by a series of the most flagrant acts of rapacity, injustice, and oppression. On
                    the 4th of January 1701, he married Joanna the daughter of Sir John Bernard,
                    Bart, of Brampton in the county of Huntingdon. In the course of the same year,
                    Bishop Patrick bestowed upon him the archdeaconry of Ely, which, being endowed
                    with the two livings of Haddenham and Wilburton, was an office of emolument as
                    well as dignity. The residue of his ecclesiastical history we shall compress
                    within the compass of a few sentences. His stall at Worcester he had resigned in
                    1700. In 1709 he was an unsuccessful candidate for the bishopric of Chichester.
                    In 1717 he was elected regius professor of divinity. In 1724 he refused the
                    bishopric of Bristol, and in 1730 the deanery of Lincoln<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193196816" xml:id="kp-eb0704-6816-0577"/>. If he had not disgraced
                    himself by the indecent violence of his conduct, he would in all probability
                    have ìttained to one of the highest stations in the church; but the history of
                    his proceedings at Cambridge presents a ⅛kening detail, which is happily
                    unparalleled in the academical annals of the united kingdom. His great
                    prosperity, operating upon the native arrogance of his disposition, and
                    unattended by the salutary restraint of religious feeling, seems to have
                    produced a total disregard of every consideration except those of his own power
                    and interest. His government of Trinity College was that of an unprincipled
                    despot. In the course of three years, he had no fewer than six lawsuits before
                    the court of king’s bench; and these animosities and contentions, injurious to
                    the university, and scandalous to the church, commenced in the vigour of his
                    manhood, and were only terminated with his long life.</p>
                <p>Some of the fellows of the college made repeated and strenuous attempts to
                    procure his removal from the office of master. Their first petition, dated in
                    February 1709- 10, was addressed to Dr Moore, bishop of Ely, as visitor of
                    Trinity College; and among the thirty fellows who subscribed it was the
                    celebrated Conyers Middleton, who afterwards proved the most formidable of his
                    literary antagonists. After many proceedings of a preliminary nature, the cause
                    at length obtained a hearing at Ely House in the year 1714, and was before the
                    court for the period of six weeks. The visitor came to the conclusion that the
                    charges of wasting the goods and violating the statutes of the college had been
                    sufficiently established; and he accordingly directed a sentence of ejectment
                    from the mastership to be prepared in due form; but having caught cold in
                    consequence of his long sittings in the hall, he was seized with an illness
                    which terminated fatally before judgment could be pronounced. To his successor
                    in the see of Ely, Dr Fleetwood, fresh articles of accusation were speedily
                    presented by one of the fellows, Edmond Miller, serjeant at law, subscribed by
                    him “in the name and behalf of many of the fellows but the bishop declined to
                    take cognizance of the cause, apd a petition, subscribed by nineteen fellows,
                    was in 1716 presented to the king. This attempt likewise proved ineffectual; and
                    Dr Greene having succeeded to the bishopric of Ely, a petition was presented to
                    him in the year 1729. The promoter in this suit was Robert Johnson, B. D., one
                    of the fellows; and the articles of accusation, which are sixty-four in number,
                    embrace almost all the material events in the history of the college for the
                    space of eighteen years.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>See Bishop Monk’s <hi rend="italic">Life of Richard Bentley, D. D.</hi>
                    Lond. 1830, 4to.</p></note> The final decision of the visitor was preceded by
                    much litigation in the king’s bench and house of lords; but at length, on the
                    27th of April 1734, he pronounced sentence of deprivation against the master,
                    for dilapidating the goods and violating the statutes of the college. Bentley’s
                    usual intrepidity and address did not forsake him on so critical an occasion;
                    and he placed his chief reliance on the very defective provision of the fortieth
                    statute, according to which a master, convicted before the visitor of any of the
                    greater offences there specified, is immediately to be deprived by the
                    vice-master of the college. Soon after the sentence had been pronounced, his
                    devoted adherent Br Walker was appointed to this office. Notwithstanding various
                    applications to the court of king’s bench, the sentence was never carried into
                    execution; and Bishop Greene dying in the year 1738, the course of nature, and
                    not of law, put a period to the contest. In this protracted and complicated suit
                    the master’s share of the expenses amounted to no less than four thousand
                    pounds; and this sum he had no scruple in drawing from the funds of the
                    college.</p>
                <p>In addition to these disgraceful contentions with his own college, he engaged in
                    a violent contention with the university. During the royal visit of 1717,
                    several doctors of divinity were created by mandate; and on the performance of
                    the ceremony by Dr Bentley as regius professor, he made an unauthorized demand
                    of four guineas from each candidate. One of these was Dr Middleton, who paid the
                    fee, and .afterwards brought an action for its recovery in the vice-chancellor’s
                    court. The professor was convicted of contempt, and was deprived of all his
                    degrees, which were only restored in consequence of a mandamus from the king’s
                    bench.</p>
                <p>Soon after the first petition against him had been presented to the bishop of
                    Ely, he had sufficient energy of mind to compose one of his most remarkable
                    works, his <hi rend="italic">Emendationes in Menandri et Philemonis
                    Reliquias,</hi> in which Le Clerc is treated with the most caustic severity.
                    Under the borrowed name of Phileleutherus Lipsiensis, they were committed to the
                    press by Burman,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">Trajecti ad Rhennm,</hi> i7iθ, 8vo.</p></note> who was a willing
                    agent on such an occasion. His next literary enterprise was his famous edition
                    of Horace, which was printed at Cambridge, and was completed in the year 1711.
                    In 1713, Anthony Collins published his <hi rend="italic">Discourse of
                    Free-thinking;</hi> and his work was followed by several answers, but the most
                    effective of these was Dr Bentley’s “Remarks upon a late Discourse of
                    Free-thinking, in a Letter to F. FI. D. D., by Phileleutherus Lipsiensis.” The
                    friend thus designated in the title-page was Francis Hare, D. D., who was then
                    dean of Worcester, and was afterwards successively bishop of St Asaph and
                    Chichester. Collins’s superficial learning was exposed with unrelenting
                    severity, and his arrogance was repelled by the most arrogant of mankind. Even
                    the most pious may sometimes do well to be angry; but when a religion, breathing
                    peace and gentleness, is defended in the worst spirit of its enemies, the cause
                    of truth is but imperfectly promoted. Bentley’s remarks were however written
                    with much ability, and were received with much applause; nor did he leave his
                    adversary the same power of imposing on the ignorant and unwary. In 1720 he
                    issued proposals for publishing a critical edition of the Greek Testament, which
                    were attacked by Dr Middleton with much ability, and perhaps with virulence not
                    inferior to his ability. There is little or no reason to believe that his scheme
                    was defeated by this angry exposure: he long afterwards reverted to the plan of
                    such an edition; nor were his nerves so infirm, or his mind so unaccustomed to
                    the utmost bitterness of invective, as to render it probable that he could be
                    deterred by any literary opposition, however formidable. His edition of Terence
                    and of Phaedrus was published at Cambridge in 1726. At the suggestion of Queen
                    Caroline, he afterwards undertook to prepare an edition of Milton’s Paradise
                    Lost;<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Lond. 1732,
                    4to.</p></note> a task for which he was neither qualified by the elegancĉ of his
                    taste nor by the course of his previous studies; and, of all his literary
                    enterprises, this was the most injudicious and most unsuccessful. It greatly
                    contributed to impair his general reputation as a critic; for many readers,
                    unprepared to judge of his violent distortions in the text of Horace, were
                    sufficiently prepared to judge of his violent distortions in the text of Milton;
                    and certainly those who were left to form an opinion of his literary merits from
                    the mere inspection of his lucubrations on the English poet, <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193196829" xml:id="kp-eb0704-6829-0578"/>could not but be astonished
                    at his former renown. He resorts to the extraordinary device of introducing an
                    imaginary editor, whom he chooses to represent as having not merely committed
                    many unintentional errors, but even as having made various additions according
                    to his own judgment or caprice. Another labour of his declining years was a
                    projected edition of Homer; and it is deeply to be regretted that he did not
                    relinquish more unprofitable pursuits, and devote himself to an undertaking so
                    worthy of his name and reputation; but his literary projects were numerous, and
                    his thoughts must often have been distracted by the perpetual succession of his
                    quarrels and contentions. One object to which he directed much of his attention
                    was the poet’s versification, of which he proposed to effect a general
                    restoration, derived from ancient manuscripts, the examination of the numerous
                    quotations dispersed in ancient writers, and, beyond all other sources, the
                    systematic insertion of the Aeolic digamma. His edition of Manilius, which he
                    had prepared about forty-five years before, was published in 1739, under the
                    superintendence of his nephew, Richard Bentley, D. D.</p>
                <p>The death of Bishop Greene, in 1738, had relieved him from the hazard of
                    deposition; and he continued to enjoy his offices till 1742, when he died on the
                    14th of July, after having completed the eightieth year of his age. His wife had
                    died two years before. His only surviving son, who bore the same name, was
                    educated to no profession: it was one of the many scandalous acts of the
                    father’s administration, that the son was elected a fellow of Trinity College at
                    the age of fifteen. The younger Bentley, who was considered as a man of
                    excellent talents, was the author of several works, but is best remembered as
                    the friend of Gray. When his father once found him reading a novel, “Why,” said
                    he, “read a book which you cannot quote?” The doctor’s two daughters, Elizabeth
                    and Joanna, were both married: the latter was the wife of Denison Cumberland,
                    who was grandson to the learned bishop of Peterborough, and who himself became
                    bishop of Kilmore, and the father of Richard Cumberland, one of the most eminent
                    of the recent English dramatists.</p>
                <p>The principal works published during the author’s lifetime have already been
                    enumerated; but we must not neglect to mention the posthumous collection
                    entitled “Richardi Bentleii et doctorum Virorum Epistolae partim mutuae. Acccdit
                    Richardi Dawesii ad Joannem Taylorum Epistola singularis.” Lond. 1807, 4to. Of
                    this splendid volume two hundred copies were printed at the expense of the late
                    Dr Burney, not with any view to publication, but as presents from the munificent
                    editor. An enlarged edition of the same collection has very recently been
                    printed in a more accessible form: “Richardi Bentleii et doctorum Virorum
                    Epistolae partim mutuae: ex editione Londinensi Caroli Burncii repetiit,
                    novisque additamentis, et Godofredi Hermanni Disscrtatione de Bentleio ejusque
                    Ed. Terentii, auxit Frid. Traug. Friedemann.” Lipsiae, 1825, 8vo. (x.)</p>
