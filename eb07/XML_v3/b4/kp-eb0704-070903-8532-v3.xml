                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                <p><label type="entry">BLOND, <hi rend="smallcaps">Christopher le</hi></label>, a
                    painter of portraits in miniature, and all kinds of subjects, on paper, was born
                    in 1670. Very few circumstances relative to his education or life are mentioned
                    by any writers till he became known at Rome in the year 1716, being at that time
                    painter to the Count Martinetz, ambassador at the court of Rome. By the
                    solicitation of Overbeke he was induced to go to Amsterdam, and in that city he
                    was employed in painting small portraits for bracelets, rings, and snuff-boxes,
                    of all which, although done in water-colours, the colouring was as lively and
                    natural as if they had been painted in oil. But as he found his sight much
                    impaired by the minuteness of his work, he discontinued water-colour painting,
                    and attempted the use of oil with a reasonable degree of success. After he had
                    resided for some years in the Low Countries he came to England, and set up a new
                    method of printing mezzotinto plates in colours, so as to imitate the pictures
                    of which they were copies. In this manner he executed in England several large
                    plates, from pictures of the greatest masters, and disposed of the prints by
                    lottery. But those who obtained the prizes, Mr Strutt says, appear not to have
                    held them in any very great estimation. His method consisted in having several
                    mezzotinto plates for one piece, each expressing different shades and parts of
                    the piece in different colours. He was not, however, the original inventor of
                    that manner of managing colours, but borrowed it from Lastman and others, who,
                    with much greater regularity of morals, equal capacity, and more discreet
                    conduct, had before undertaken it without success. Le Blond, whose head was
                    continually full of schemes, next set on foot a project for copying the cartoons
                    of Raphael in tapestry, and made drawings from the pictures for that purpose.
                    Houses were built and looms erected at the Mulberry Ground at Chelsea; but the
                    expenses proving too great, or the contributions not being equal to the first
                    expectations, the scheme was suddenly defeated, and Le Blond disappeared, to the
                    no small dissatisfaction of those who were engaged with him. He proceeded to
                    Paris, where Basan informs us he resided in the year 1737, and where he died in
                    1740, in an hospital. Le Blond was also author of a treatise in French on ideal
                    beauty. It was published in 1732, and has since been translated into
                    English.</p>
