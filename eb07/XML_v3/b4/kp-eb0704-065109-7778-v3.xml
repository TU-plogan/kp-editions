                <p><label type="entry">BISHOP</label>, a prelate or person consecrated for the
                    spiritual government and direction of a diocese. The word comes from the Saxon
                    <hi rend="italic">bischop,</hi> which again is derived from the Greek <hi
                    rend="italic">i</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> r</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >χut^M∙τrος,</hi> an <hi rend="italic">overseer, inspector,</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">superintendent,</hi> a title given by the Athenians to those whom
                    they sent into the provinces subject to them, to see whether every thing was
                    kept in order. The Romans applied the same designation to those who were
                    appointed inspectors and visitors of the bread and provision.</p>
                <p>A bishop discharges the same relative functions as an archbishop, though of
                    course in a lower sphere. An archbishop with bishops consecrates a bishop, a
                    bishop with priests ordains a priest; the archbishop visits a province, the
                    bishop a diocese; the archbishop convocates a provincial synod, the bishop a
                    diocesan one; and the archbishop has canonical authority over all the bishops of
                    his province, the bishop over the priests in his diocese.</p>
                <p>The election of bishops was anciently placed in the clergy, and the people of the
                    parish, province, or diocese; but afterwards, princes and magistrates,
                    patriarchs and popes, usurped the power. The election was required to be within
                    three months after the vacancy of the see; and the bishop to be chosen from
                    among the clergy of that church. Formerly the bishop claimed a share in the
                    election of an archbishop; but this was set aside by the popes.</p>
                <p>In England, during the Saxon times, all ecclesiastical dignities were conferred
                    by the king in parliament. At length, however, after several contests,
                    especially between Archbishop Anselm and Henry I. in consequence of a grant of
                    King John, recognised in Magna Charta, and <pb break="no" facs="nls:193197791"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0704-7791-0652"/>established by the 25 Edw. III. stat. 6, § 3,
                    bishops were elected by the chapters of monks or canons, some shadow of which
                    still remains in the present method of disposing of bishoprics; but by the 25
                    Henry VIII. c. 20, the right of nomination was restored to the crown.</p>
                <p>Ordinarily, three bishops at least are required in the ceremony of consecrating a
                    bishop; but in some cases a single one will suffice. The English succession of
                    Protestant bishops stands on this last ground. In England, the king being
                    certified of the death of a bishop by the dean and chapter, and his leave
                    requested to elect another, the <hi rend="italic">congé d’élire</hi> is sent to
                    them, with a letter missive, nominating the person whom he would have chosen.
                    The election is to be within twelve days after the receipt of it, otherwise the
                    king by letters patent appoints whom he pleases; and the chapter, in case of
                    refusing the person named by the king, incurs a <hi rend="italic"
                    >praemunire.</hi> After election, and its being accepted by the bishop, the king
                    grants a mandate under the great seal for confirmation, which the bishop
                    consigns to his vicar-general, consisting mostly of a solemn citation of such as
                    have any objections to the bishop elect, a declaration of their contumacy in not
                    appearing, and an administration of the oaths of allegiance and supremacy, of
                    simony, and canonical obedience. Sentence being read by the vicar-general, the
                    bishop is installed in the province of Canterbury by the archdeacon; the fact is
                    recorded by a public notary; and the bishop is invested with full powers to
                    exercise all spiritual jurisdictions, though he cannot sue for his temporalities
                    till after consecration. Then follows the consecration by the archbishop or some
                    other bishop appointed by lawful commissions, and two assistant bishops. The
                    ceremony is much the same as in the Roman Catholic church, save that having put
                    on the episcopal robes, the archbishop and bishops lay their hands on the new
                    prelate’s head, and consecrate him with a certain form of words. The process of
                    the translation of a bishop to another bishopric differs only in this, that
                    there is no consecration. The age of a bishop is to be at least thirty years;
                    and, by the ancient discipline, none were to be chosen but those who had passed
                    through all the inferior orders; but in some cases of necessity this was
                    dispensed with, and deacons, nay laymen, were raised at once to the episcopal
                    dignity.</p>
                <p>The form of consecrating a bishop is different in different churches. In the
                    Greek church, the bishop elect being by the assistant bishops presented for
                    consecration, and the instrument of election put in his hand, after several
                    prayers, the first of which is called <hi rend="italic">diaconicum,</hi> he
                    demands consecration, and makes profession of his faith, after which he receives
                    a benediction. He is then interrogated as to his belief of the Trinity; to which
                    he answers by a long profession of faith, and receives a second benediction.
                    Lastly, he is asked what he thinks of the incarnation; to which he answers in a
                    third profession of faith, which is followed by a third benediction; after which
                    the consecrator gives him the pastoral staff. He is then led up to the altar,
                    where, after certain prayers, and three crosses on his head, he receives the <hi
                    rend="italic">pallium,</hi> if he be an archbishop or patriarch; then the kiss
                    of peace from his consecrator and two assistants; and sitting down, reads,
                    prays, and gives the communion to his consecrator and others.</p>
                <p>In the Roman Catholic church, the bishop elect being presented by the elder
                    assistant to the consecrator, takes the oath; he is then examined as to his
                    faith; and after several prayers, the New Testament is drawn over his head, and
                    he receives the chrism or unction on his head. The pastoral staff, ring, and
                    gospel, are then given him, and after communion the mitre is put on his head;
                    each ceremony being accompanied with suitable prayers. The consecration ends
                    with <hi rend="italic">Te Deum.</hi> These last-mentioned ceremonies are laid
                    aside in the consecration of English bishops. Nevertheless, the book of
                    consecration set forth in the time of Edward VI. and confirmed by act of
                    parliament, in which some of them are enjoined, is declared to be the standard
                    for this purpose by the thirty-sixth article.</p>
                <p>The function of a bishop in England may be considered as twofold, namely, what
                    belongs to his order, and what belongs to his jurisdiction. To the episcopal
                    order belong the ceremonies of dedication, confirmation, and ordination; to the
                    episcopal jurisdiction, by the statute law, belong the licensing of physicians,
                    chirurgeons, and schoolmasters, the uniting of small parishes (though this last
                    privilege is now peculiar to the Bishop of Norwich), assisting the civil
                    magistrate in the execution of statutes relating to ecclesiastical matters, and
                    compelling the payment of tenths and subsidies due from the clergy. By the
                    common law, the bishop is to certify the judges touching legitimate and
                    illegitimate births and marriages; and by that and the ecclesiastical law, he is
                    to take care of the probate of wills and granting administrations, to collate to
                    benefices, grant institutions on the presentation of other patrons, command
                    induction, order the collecting and preserving the profits of vacant benefices
                    for the use of the successors, defend the liberties of the church, and visit his
                    diocese once in three years. To the bishop also belong suspension, deprivation,
                    deposition, degradation, and excommunication.</p>
                <p>All bishops of England are peers of the realm, except the Bishop of Sodor and
                    Man, and, as such, sit and vote in the House of Lords. They are barons in a
                    threefold manner; feudal, in regard to the temporalities annexed to their
                    bishoprics; by writ, as being summoned by writ to parliament; and, lastly, by
                    patent and creation. Accordingly, they have the precedence of all other barons,
                    vote as barons and bishops, and claim all the privileges enjoyed by the temporal
                    lords; excepting that they cannot be tried by their peers, because, in cases of
                    blood, they themselves cannot pass upon the trial, for they are prohibited by
                    the canons of the church from being judges of life and death. They have the
                    title of <hi rend="italic">Lords</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Right Reverend
                    Fathers in God.</hi> Besides two archbishops, there are twenty-four bishops in
                    England, exclusive of the Bishop of Sodor and Man, who has no scat in the House
                    of Peers. The Bishops of London, Durham, and Winchester, take precedence of
                    other bishops, who are to rank after them according to their seniority of
                    consecration. There is also a bishop in our settlement of Nova Scotia, and
                    recently one in Barbadoes. In Ireland there are four archbishops and eighteen
                    bishops. eIn Scotland, before the Presbyterian establishment, there were two
                    archbishoprics and twelve bishoprics.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Bishop’s</hi><hi rend="italic">Court,</hi> an ecclesiastical
                    court, held in the cathedral of each diocese, the judge in which is the bishops
                    chancellor, who decides according to the civil and canon law; and if the diocese
                    be large, he has his commissaries in remote parts, who hold what are called <hi
