                    Chichester, descended of an ancient family in Wales, was born in the county of
                    Essex. In his youth he favoured the Reformation, and travelled into Germany to
                    be instructed by Luther and other preachers of the new doctrine. How long he
                    continued a Protestant is uncertain; but from his letter to king Henry VIII.
                    quoted bclow, it appears that he wrote several books against the church of Rome.
                    However, he was a regular canon in the Augustine monastery of St Osith in the
                    county of Essex, and studied some time at Oxford with the brothers of that
                    order, where he took the degree of doctor in divinity. He was then made prior of
                    the convent at Bisham in Berkshire, and afterwards succeeded to the several
                    priories of Blackmore, Typtree, Lega, Bromhole, and Haverford-West. On the
                    dissolution of abbeys, he not only resigned with a good grace, but persuaded
                    several other abbots to follow his example. King Henry was so pleased with his
                    ready obedience on this occasion, that he sent him in 1535 on an embassy to
                    Scotland, in the same year made him bishop of St Asaph, in two months after
                    translated him to the see of St Davids, and in 1547 to that of Bath and Wells.
                    During this time he was, or pretended to be, a stanch Papist; but when Edward
                    VI. came to the crown, he again became a Protestant; and for that reason, on
                    Queen Mary’s accession, was deprived of his bishopric, and sent prisoner to the
                    Fleet, where he continued for some time. At length he found means to escape, and
                    immediately joined the other English Protestants in Germany. When Queen
                    Elizabeth ascended the throne, our prelate was raised to the see of Chichester,
                    and soon after made first prebendary of the collegiate church of Westminster. He
                    died in 1568, and was buried in the cathedral of Chichester. He had five
                    daughters, each of whom married a bishop. He wrote, 1. <hi rend="italic">The

                    whilst his father was bishop of St David’s. In 1560 he was entered a commoner of
                    Balliol College, in Oxford; and in 1564 took a degree in arts, after which he
                    left the university and went to sea, but in what capacity is uncertain: however,
                    he acquired considerable knowledge in the art of navigation. About the year 1573
                    he entered into orders, and became prebendary of Winchester, and rector of
                    Easton, near that city. In 1588 he was made prebendary of Lichfield, which he
                    exchanged for the place of treasurer of that church. Some years after he was
                    made chaplain to Prince Henry, the son of King James I., and, in 1614,
                    archdeacon of Salisbury. He was the first writer on the nature and properties of
                    the magnet. Barlow died in the year 1625, and was buried in the church at

                    was appointed fellow of Queen’s College, Oxford, in 1633, and two years after
                    chosen reader of metaphysics to the university. He was keeper of the Bodleian
                    library, and in 1657 was chosen provost of Queen’s College. After the
                    restoration of King Charles II. he was nominated one of the commissioners for
                    restoring the members unjustly expelled in 1648. He wrote at that time <hi rend="italic">The Case of Toleration in Matters of Religion,</hi> to Mr R.
                    Boyle. In 1675 he was made bishop of Lincoln. After the popish plot he published
                    several tracts against the Roman Catholic religion, in which he showed an
                    uncommon extent of learning, and skill in polemical divinity. Nevertheless, when
                    the duke of York was proclaimed king, he took all opportunities of expressing
                    his affection towards him; but after the Revolution he as readily voted that the
                    king had abdicated his kingdom, and was very rigorous in excluding from their
                    benefices such of the clergy as refused the oaths.</p><p>Mr Granger observes that “this learned prelate, whom nature designed for a
                    scholar, and who acted in conformity with the bent of nature, was perhaps as
                    great a master of the learned languages, and of the works of the celebrated
                    authors who have written in those languages, as any man in his age. The greatest
                    part of his writings, of which Mr Wood has given us a catalogue, are against
                    popery; and his conduct for some time, like that of other Calvinists, appeared
                    to be in direct opposition to the church of Rome. But after James ascended the
                    throne, he seemed to approach much nearer to popery than he had ever done
                    before. He sent the king an address of thanks for his declaration in favour of
                    liberty of conscience, and is said to have written reasons for reading that
                    declaration. His compliances were much the same after the Revolution. His
                    moderation, to call it by the softest name, was very great; indeed, so great as
                    to bring the firmness of his character into question. But casuistry reconciles
                    seeming contradictions. He was, abstracted <hi rend="superscript"> roirι</hi><hi rend="subscript"> 1 j</hi> this laxity of principles, a very great and
                    worthy man. He died at Buckden, in Huntingdonshire, on the <hi rend="superscript"> ,</hi>-h of October 1691, in the 85th year of his age.</p><p>1 <hi rend="italic">∖√</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> l</hi><hi rend="italic">°</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> w,</hi><hi rend="italic">F</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> rαιlc</hi><hi rend="italic">ι</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> s</hi><hi rend="italic">&gt;</hi><hi rend="superscript"> an</hi> English painter, was born in Lineonshire. On his
                    coming to London he was placed with one Shephard, a limner; but his genius led
                    him chiefly to the drawing of birds, fishes, and other animals. There are six
                    books of animals from his drawings; and he painted some ceilings with birds for
                    noblemen and gentlemen in the country. His etchings are numerous, but his
                    illustration of Aesop is his greatest work. He died in 1702. There is something
                    pleasing in the composition and manner of this master, though neither is
                    excellent. His drawing too is very indifferent, nor does he characterize any
                    animal justly. His birds in general are better than his beasts.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Barlow,</hi><hi rend="italic">Joel,</hi> an American
                    literary and political character of considerable note, was born in the year
                    1756, in the village of Reading, state of Connecticut, and appears to have been
                    the youngest of ten children. His father died when he was yet a boy; but his
                    friends, attentive to his instruction, employed his portion of the paternal
                    inheritance for his education, at the College of Newhaven, in his native state.
                    Here he commenced his studies in 1774. In the course of the prescribed exercises
                    of composition he discovered a taste for poetry, and two productions crept into
                    public view, one entitled <hi rend="italic">The Prospect of Peace;</hi> the
                    other <hi rend="italic">An Blegy on the Death of Mr Hosmer,</hi> member of the
                    American congress. It appears that Mr Barlow was destined for the clerical
                    profession; and that his friends solicited and obtained for him the appointment
                    of chaplain to a militia company of Massachusetts, the functions of which he
                    performed till the event of peace. One of his panegyrists has observed, in
                    reference to his subsequent change of profession, that, “amongst the
                    Presbyterians of New England, the priesthood is nothing else than a species of
                    civil ordination. He who receives it may pass to another employment; and it is
                    common enough to see young men preach the gospel in order to have time to
                    prepare themselves for another profession.” This explanation, however, is hardly
                    reconcilable with the spirit of the New England theologians, who even now
                    require from the candidate for holy orders a solemn declaration, that he is
                    moved to this calling by a certain species of inspiration or divine impulse, and
                    not by any carnal or interested motive.</p><p>In 1781, while he followed the army in quality of chaplain, he contracted a
                    marriage with Miss Baldwin of Newhaven; and it was during this period of his
                    life that he planned the edifice of his future fame in his poem destined to
                    celebrate the discovery and prospects of America. It was also during this period
                    that the patriarchs of Connecticut proposed to adopt a new metrical translation
                    of the psalms, which excited to emulation all the poetical genius of the state.
                    The version of Barlow carried the prize, and is to this day sung in the churches
                    of New England.</p><p>At the conclusion of peace between the United States and Great Britain, he
                    abandoned the ecclesiastical life, and settled at the village of Hartford,
                    where, two years afterwards, he published the poem alluded to, entitled <hi rend="italic">The Vision of Columbus,</hi> which he afterwards gave to the world
                    in a more expanded and imposing form.</p><p>After quitting the service of the church, he appears for some time to have
                    practised law; but in 1788 he likewise abandoned that profession to become the
                    agent of a mercantile company, who had purchased some millions of acres of land
                    situated on or near the river Ohio, which they proposed to sell to foreigners at
                    an enhanced price. For this purpose Mr Barlow was sent to Europe; and it is said
                    that he was fortunate in the execution of this commission.</p><p>Having during this period become deeply interested by the events of the French
                    revolution, he published, in the yeará 1791 and 1792, the following political
                    pieces:—</p><pb break="no" facs="nls:193194281" xml:id="kp-eb0704-4281-0382"/><p>1. Advice to the Privileged Orders. 2. The Conspiracy of Kings. 3. Letter to the
                    National Convention of France. 4. The Royal Recollections. Towards the end of
                    the year 1792, he, being then in London, was appointed by the Constitutional
                    Society of London one of a deputation to present an address to the National
                    Convention of France; a circumstance which attracted the notice of the British
                    Parliament, it having been stated by a member that the Convention had received
                    an address by means of two <hi rend="italic">fellows</hi> calling themselves the
                    representatives of Great Britain, viz. Frost and Barlow.</p><p>In 1793 Barlow, from motives of curiosity, accompanied the four commissioners of
                    the National Convention who were sent to Mont Blanc to organize that department;
                    and this excursion gave rise to another production, entitled <hi rend="italic">A
                    Letter to die People of Piedmont.</hi> About this time, also, he translated
                    Volney’s well-known work, entitled <hi rend="italic">Ruins of Empires.</hi></p><p>Objects of a commercial nature at length drew him to Hamburg, and afterwards to
                    the coast of Africa, where he received the commission of consul-general of the
                    United States, with instructions to enter into and conclude treaties with the
                    Barbary powers for the purpose of procuring the ransom of the American citizens
                    who were detained as slaves in those countries. The execution of this commission
                    was prompt and fortunate; and, after residing for some time in Paris, to which
                    he returned from Barbary, he, in 1805, proceeded to America, and purchased a
                    neat habitation in the territory of Columbia, the seat of the general
                    government, to which he gave the name of <hi rend="italic">Kahrarna.</hi> Here
                    he formed an acquaintance with certain considerable members of Congress, to whom
                    he greatly recommended himself by the publication of a short sketch of a plan of
                    national education, and an address to the citizens of Washington upon occasion
                    of one of the anniversaries of American independence. He now also published the
                    superb quarto edition of his national poem, to which he finally gave the name of
                    <hi rend="italic">The Columbian.</hi></p><p>Soon after his return from Europe, he was admitted to the confidence of the first
                    magistrate of the United States; and, in 1811, he received the valued
                    appointment of minister-plenipotentiary to the court of France. This nomination
                    met with powerful opposition in the senate, and passed only by a small
                    majority.</p><p>He sailed for his destination on board of the Constitution frigate, disembarked
                    at Cherbourg in September 1812, and proceeded to the French capital, where he
                    was received, in the emperor’s absence, by the minister of foreign affairs, who
                    “was instructed to say the most flattering things relative to his appointment.”
                    The great object of his mission was to obtain compensation for the American
                    property confiscated in virtue of the Berlin and Milan decrees. This arrangement
                    was to be regulated in a manner the least onerous to the French treasury.
                    American ships and cargoes were, at the same time, to be freed from unjust
                    detention, and a new commercial treaty to be formed on principles of national
                    justice and reciprocity.</p><p>In pursuit of this object he followed the Emperor Napoleon to Wilna in the
                    memorable winter of 1812; but this diplomatic journey was without advantage, and
                    the failure was the more mortifying, as it was undertaken without the advice or
                    instructions of the American government. Mr Barlow was returning to Paris, when
                    he was seized with a violent inflammatory disease, of which he died on the 26th
                    of December, in the fifty-eighth year of his age. His nephew, a midshipman on
                    board of the Constitution frigate, whom he took from his studies to accompany
                    him in this journey, and a secretary of the French Legation in the United
                    States, were witnesses of his last moments, and saw him interred at the place
                    where he closed his eyes, an obscure village of Poland.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
