                    upon for ease, rest, or sleep, consisting generally of feathers, down, or other
                    soft material, enclosed in a ticken case. In the first ages it was universally
                    the practice for mankind to sleep upon skins of beasts. This was originally the
                    custom of the Greeks and Romans, as also of the ancient Britons previous to the
                    Roman invasion; and the skins thus employed were spread on the floor of their
                    apartments. But they were afterwards changed for loose rushes and heath; and in
                    process of time the Romans suggested to the central Britons the use, and the
                    introduction of agriculture supplied them with the means, of the greater
                    conveniency of straw beds. The beds of the Roman gentry at this period were
                    generally filled with feathers, and those of the inns with the soft down of
                    reeds. But for many ages the beds of the Italians had been constantly composed
                    of straw; it still formed those of the officers and soldiers present at the
                    conquest of Lancashire; and from both, it is probable, our countrymen learnt the
                    use of it. It appears, however, to have been used only by gentlemen, as the
                    common Welsh had their beds thinly stuffed with rushes as late as the end of the
                    twelfth century; and with the gentlemen it continued for many ages afterwards.
                    Straw was used in the royal chambers of England as late as the close of the
                    thirteenth century. Most of the peasants in different parts of the country sleep
                    on chaff beds at present; in the Highlands heath is also very generally employed
                    as bedding; and in France and Italy straw beds remain in general use to this
                    day.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Dining</hi><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Bed,</hi><hi rend="italic">lectus tricliniaris</hi> or <hi rend="italic">discubitorius,</hi>
                    that on <pb break="no" facs="nls:193195971" xml:id="kp-eb0704-5971-0512"/>which the ancients reclined at meals. The dining
                    or dis-cubitory beds were four or five feet in height. Three of these beds were
                    ordinarily ranged by a square table, (whence both the table and the apartment
                    where it stood were called <hi rend="italic">triclinium),</hi> in such a manner
                    that one of the sides of the table remained open and accessible to the waiters.
                    Each bed was fitted to receive three or four, rarely five persons. These beds
                    were unknown before the second Punic war; for the Romans till then had sat down
                    to eat on plain wooden benches, in imitation of the heroes of Homer, or,
                    according to Varro, after the manner of the Lacedaemonians and Cretans. But
                    Scipio Africanus first introduced a new mode, having brought from Carthage some
                    of the little beds called <hi rend="italic">punicani</hi> or <hi rend="italic">archaici,</hi> which were constructed of a wood common enough, very low,
                    stuffed only with straw or hay, and covered with goats’ or sheeps’ skins, <hi rend="italic">haedinis pellibus strati.</hi> In point of luxury, there was
                    really no great difference between these new beds and the ancient benches; but
                    the custom of frequent bathing, which already began to be general, by softening
                    and relaxing the body, put men on trying to rest themselves more commodiously
                    than by sitting down in an upright posture. As to the ladies, it did not seem
                    consistent with modesty for them to adopt the recumbent posture, and,
                    accordingly, they kept to the old custom during the continuance of the
                    commonwealth, and only began to use <hi rend="italic">triclinia</hi> in the
                    times of the first Caesars. The youth, again, who had not yet put on the <hi rend="italic">toga virilis,</hi> were long kept to the ancient discipline, and,
                    when admitted to table, only sat on the edge of the beds of their nearest
                    relations. Never, says Suetonius, did the young Caesars, Caius and Lucius, eat
                    at the table of Augustus; they were set <hi rend="italic">in ∙ imo loco,</hi>
                    or, as Tacitus expresses it, <hi rend="italic">ad lecti fulcra.</hi> But, from
                    the greatest simplicity, the Romans by degrees carried their dining beds to the
                    most surprising magnificence. Pliny assures us it was no uncommon thing to see
                    them covered over with plates of silver, and adorned with the softest mats and
                    richest counterpanes. Lampridius, speaking of Heliogabalus, says, he had beds of
                    solid silver, <hi rend="italic">solido argento habuit lectos et tricliniares, et
                    cubiculares.</hi> We may add, that Pompey, in his third triumph, brought in beds
                    of gold. The Romans had also beds on which they studied, and beds on which the
                    dead were carried to the funeral pile.</p><p><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Bed</hi><hi rend="italic">of Justice,</hi> in

                    concerned the state, and then all the officers of parliament were clothed in
