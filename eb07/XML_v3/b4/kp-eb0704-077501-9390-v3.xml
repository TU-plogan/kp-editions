                    whether in public offices, manufacturing establishments, or mercantile
                    counting-houses', but the name is generally applied to the books of merchants,
                    on account of the complexity of their transactions, and the care consequently
                    required to prevent obscurity or confusion. It was accordingly among merchants,
                    and in particular among those of Venice, Genoa, Pisa, and other trading towns in
                    Modern Italy, that book-keeping was first reduced to a system, and that the
                    remarkable refinement of double entry was adopted. This, like the discoveries of
                    the Italians in manufactures, the fine arts, navigation, and commerce, was
                    owing, not, as some imagine, to any peculiarity of disposition, or power of
                    invention, inherent in that people, but <pb break="no" facs="nls:193199403" xml:id="kp-eb0704-9403-0776"/>to their
                    country being the part of Europe in which, in modern times, town-population
                    first became considerable, and men derived advantage from living together in
                    large communities. It is in populous towns that employment is divided and
                    subdivided; that discoveries and inventions take place; and that the education
                    of youth exchanges its antiquated and scholastic form for one of direct utility,
                    adapted to the progress and the wants of the existing generation.</p><p>The first printed work on book-keeping was the production of an Italian teacher,
                    who, without knowing much of trade by his own experience, observed the manner in
                    which the intelligent merchants of his country kept their accounts. It was
                    published as early as 1495, and was followed in the succeeding century by
                    several works on bookkeeping in French, composed with evident care and
                    solicitude to explain the art, but affording by their complexity a remarkable
                    contrast to the short and clear system afterwards adopted by merchants. English
                    publications on book-keeping came forth somewhat later, but all resembled the
                    foreign treatises in being the composition, not of merchants, but of teachers
                    and accountants. In 1652 Collins, a well-known London accountant, published a
                    long work entitled <hi rend="italic">An Introduction to Merchants Accounts,</hi>
                    which, like the work of one of his contemporaries on a very different topic
                    (Rich <hi rend="italic">On Short Handi),</hi> continued during a century the
                    best, or, to speak more correctly, the least imperfect publication on the
                    subject of which it treated. About a hundred years later, Mair, a well-known
                    writer of books on education, published his <hi rend="italic">Book-Keeping
                    Modernized,</hi> a work containing a correct statement of the principles of
                    double entry, but in other respects much less clear and concise than it might
                    have been had the author adopted the method of our principal merchants, who had
                    now greatly simplified their plan of keeping accounts.</p><p>A number of lesser publications on book-keeping appeared in succeeding years,
                    each possessing, in the view of its author, a superior claim to public favour;
                    but all, or almost all, were composed by teachers and accountants. At last, in
                    1789, appeared the work of a practical merchant, under the title of <hi rend="italic">A Complete System of Pooh-Keeping,</hi> by Benjamin Booth, London,
                    4to. Mr Booth had been long in business, first at New York, and afterwards in
                    London, having at one time managed extensive transactions, and at another kept
                    complete sets of books. “What I now offer to the public,” he observes in his
                    introduction, “has long appeared to be much wanted among our traders. Many are
                    the bankruptcies which happen in trade from irregular accounts only: persons are
                    employed as book-keepers who have got little more than the theory of their art
                    from some obsolete treatise. The <hi rend="italic">desideratum</hi> is a system
                    of book-keeping drawn up with sufficient ability and experience, that might be
                    considered as a standard, and received into every counting-house as a decisive
                    authority. How surprising that, in a commercial country like this, there should
                    not be one treatise which, when applied to a large scale of business, can be
                    reduced to practice. Those I have seen appear generally to have been written by
                    persons who never had an opportunity of bringing their theories to the test of
                    experience. On a large scale of business it is almost impossible to prevent the
                    books from getting behind hand when every transaction is entered singly by
                    itself. The system I have laid down possesses the facility of single entry, with
                    the advantages of the double. All extraneous matter is lopt off from the
                    journal, and the ledger is prevented from swelling to¢n enormous size.”</p><p>The favourable expectation excited by Mr Booth’s experience in business was fully
                    confirmed by his book, which contained a great deal of information in short
                    compass, unembarrassed either by minute detail or fanciful theory. The plan
                    which he recommended and exemplified was the Italian method of double entry, in
                    conformity with the practice of the first merchants in this country and the
                    Continent, for more than a century. Practical men could no longer complain of
                    the non-existence of a correct summary of the principles and practice of
                    bookkeeping; and the Italian method seemed likely to be as firmly fixed in the
                    admiration of cur young merchants, as it had long been in that of their
                    predecessors, when its title to clearness and accuracy was strongly called in
                    question by a writer at that time unknown to the mercantile public.</p><p>Mr Edward Thomas Jones, educated in Bristol to the business of accountant, had
                    occasion, like Mr Booth, to see a series of perplexities and losses arising from
                    books being badly kept, namely, disputed accounts, actions at law, and
                    occasionally even bankruptcies. In the case of many merchants the books
                    submitted to him had remained for years unbalanced; in others the balancing had
                    been incorrect, and deception had been practised either on a partner or the
                    creditors. Such irregularities, ascribed by Mr Booth wholly to the misconduct of
                    book-keepers, is charged by Mr Jones on the system itself, which (the Italian
                    method) he does not scruple to describe as “insufficient to prevent or detect
                    error, rendering the process of balancing very difficult, and not necessarily
                    correct when the balance is completed.” To find a safeguard against such errors,
                    to devise a method by which accuracy in bookkeeping might be insured, and the
                    perplexity in balancing removed, was, said Mr Jones, a work of great time and
                    difficulty. He began to give his plan to the public in 1796, and improved on it
                    in the succeeding years. For a time he was indefatigable in bringing it, both by
                    explanatory statements and personal application, under the notice of merchants,
                    the result of which was a very long list of subscribers to his first work, and
                    the receipt of what authors so seldom either obtain or acknowledge, a fair
                    remuneration for his labour. This, however, was accompanied by a good deal of
                    jealousy and opposition on the part of rival accountants, and Mr Jones was
                    induced to do what is often done by ardent, inventive, but impatient minds,
                    namely, turn aside from his professional employment, and give a very different
                    direction to his labours. This change of occupation continued during many years,
                    in which the circulation and adoption of his system of book-keeping by merchants
                    was in a great measure suspended. Taught, however, at last, that the obstacles
                    to success in one line of business were as great as, or greater than in the
                    other, <hi rend="italic">il revint sur son erreur,</hi> resumed business as an
                    accountant, and fixed his thoughts anew on the means of improving his system of
                    book-keeping. He published on this subject in 1821, but in a much more extended
                    form so lately as last year (1831). The latter work is in 4to., and bears the
                    title of <hi rend="italic">The Science of Book-Keeping Exemplified.</hi> It
                    treats first of single entry, and contains formulas evidently superior to most
                    of those which are now in use by the persons who are contented to use this
                    primitive method. Next comes the more difficult department of double entry,
                    exhibiting Mr Jones’ method in contrast with the Italian system, and claiming
                    for it a decided superiority in clearness and accuracy. Of this we shall treat
                    more fully in the subsequent part of the present article, after explaining to
                    our readers the nature of the system in question. The other part of Mr Jones’
                    volume contains instructions to bankers, manufacturers, public accountants, and
                    retailers, in regard to the mode of keeping their respective accounts, all
                    appropriate and useful to a degree which leaves very little to be complained of
                    except that the volume should be so high priced (L.4. 4s.); an objection <pb break="no" facs="nls:193199416" xml:id="kp-eb0704-9416-0777"/>which might be easily lessened by the author dividing the work, and selling
                    the single entry part separate from that of the double entry.</p><p>In the earlier stages of commerce, such as the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries
                    were for the north of Italy, and the seventeenth for England, the transactions
                    of merchants, though varied in their nature, were on a small scale as regarded
                    any particular department. The same individual did business in a number of
                    articles, but in none to an extent to require separate books of account. Hence
                    the practice of recording all transactions, whether purchases, sales, receipts,
                    or payments, in a diary, which, from the rough manner in which it was kept, was
                    commonly called a waste-book. The practice in those days was for a merchant or
                    his chief clerk, as soon as any transaction was made or agreed on, to insert a
                    memorandum of it in this book, minuting the particulars correctly, but taking
                    little trouble as to the form of the entry: for that they relied on the
                    book-keeper, who was not then a partner, or even clerk in the house, but
                    generally gave his aid by intervals in different counting-houses, passing one or
                    two days in the week at each, and bringing the rude entries in their waste-books
                    into regular form in the journal. At present, and for a great length of time,
                    each mercantile house has its own book-keeper; the art being simplified so as to
                    be within the attainment of most clerks of ability, instead of being, as in
                    remote times, a mystery to all except men of long standing and more than usual
                    instruction. But in process of time, as mercantile concerns have acquired
                    extension, the art of book-keeping has been simplified, because particular
                    departments of business have required separate books. Thus money receipts and
                    payments, instead of being mixed, in the waste-book, with the amount of
                    invoices, account sales, and other entries quite different in their nature, are
                    all registered in the cash-book, or book for that special purpose. The same
                    principle of division holds in regard to bills; also as to invoices, account
                    sales, and, in short, every department of business.</p><p>We shall now give a practical illustration of book-keeping, by exhibiting the
                    course followed by a mercantile establishment. Let the example to be given be a
                    London house under the supposed firm of Baring, Hall, &amp; Co., established
                    during several years, and engaged in the West India and North American trade.
                    Their journal ought to contain, at the beginning of each year, a summary of the
                    monies owing by and to them; in other words, of their debts and assets, in the

                    and the foregoing is, it must be admitted, much more satisfactory than balance
                    sheets in general; because, from the nature of foreign business, the funds of
                    almost every house become unavoidably much more scattered than is stated in this
                    outline. All countries recently settled, such as North America and the West
                    Indies, are bare of capital, and have an interest in drawing money from Europe.
                    This they have found it practicable to do to a great extent from England and
                    Holland, where money is in general abundant, and the rate of interest low. In
                    recently settled countries there generally prevails a spirit of adventure, a
                    strong desire to extend their undertakings; hence a high interest for money, and
                    sometimes little scruple as to the means of obtaining it. To apply to a merchant
                    in London or Amsterdam for a loan of L.2000, for a year, at five per cent,
                    interest, would in general be fruitless; but the case is different when the
                    correspondent abroad holds out the tempting prospect of selling manufactures to
                    the amount of L.2000, and remitting for them in cotton, tobacco, or sugar. Such
                    a transaction offers a double commission, viz. 5 per cent, on the amount
                    exported, and 2∣ per cent, on the amount received in return; advantages which
                    incline a merchant, in particular a young merchant, to take a favourable view of
                    the chances of the proposition. The usual result, however, is, that the balance
                    sheet of a house in such a line of business generally exhibits a long list of
                    debts on the part of correspondents abroad, the recovery of which is more or
                    less doubtful according to the prudence, integrity, or health of the debtor, or
                    according to the degree of prosperity in the country of his residence; for,
                    being obliged to sell on credit, his means are generally dependent on those of
                    his customers.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">The Cash-Book.</hi> —Of the entries for the various receipts

                    advantage of putting them in the journal form. There are, in most of the
                    preceding, two transactions belonging to each account, and these two are merged
                    in the journal in one entry, which abridges and simplifies the posting in the
                    ledger. But in houses of extensive business the cash transactions for a month
                    are as ten, or rather as twenty to one compared to the preceding specimen, and
                    the number of entries collected under one title, such as bills receivable or
                    bills payable for the month, is consequently large. The result is to facilitate
                    greatly the posting in the ledger, and of course the balancing of the books at
                    the end of six or twelve months.</p><p>What, it maybe asked, is the rule for making cash debtor in some cases and
                    creditor mothers? The rule is clear and uniform. For all monies received cash is
                    made debtor, or accountable, as these sums arc to be accounted for under the
                    head of cash; while for all monies paid, cash is made creditor, the parties who
                    have to account for the sum being made debtors.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Bill Books.</hi> —Next in importance to the cash are the
                    bill transactions of a mercantile house, whether bills receivable or drafts on
                    other merchants, or bills payable, meaning by the latter the acceptances or
                    bills which the house are bound to pay. For each is appropriated a separate
                    book, in which the respective bills are entered, with a minute notice of
                    particulars, thus:</p><table><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell cols="11" role="data" rows="1"><hi rend="smallcaps">BILLS RECEIVABLE.</hi> Form of Entry.

                    make payments to each other without the risk and delay attendant on transmitting
                    the precious metals to a distance. A, a merchant in Liverpool, Dublin, or in
                    Jamaica, having a payment to make in London, instead of collecting and
                    forwarding specie, looks out on his own exchange until he find another merchant,
                    B, who having money to receive in London, is inclined to give him an order to
                    obtain it in his stead. They discuss the terms or rate of exchange; and when
                    these are agreed on, the bill is drawn by B and delivered to A, who then, or
                    soon after, pays the amount to B. The result is, that the one acquits his debt
                    in London, and the other draws his funds from it, without quitting their place
                    of residence or incurring any expense of consequence.</p><p>Bills of Exchange firstbccame general in the middle ages, and were used chiefly
                    by Jews. In the case of this, as of many other discoveries, the time and manner
                    of their introduction is uncertain; but the accommodation from them must have
                    been so great, and the mode of obtaining it so obvious, that we may safely take
                    it for granted that they were adopted as soon as merchants accounted each other
                    trust-worthy, or the transactions of towns at a distance from each other became
                    such as to supply sums en any considerable amount to be drawn for.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Town Notes</hi> are bills drawn by persons residing in the

                    same town with the acceptors, generally by the seller of goods on the purchaser,
                    who, instead of paying for them in cash, gives his acceptance, payable in two,
                    three, or more months after date. Take, for example, the draft of a West India
                    merchant in London on a sugar refiner, for sugar sold by the former to the
                    latter; or by a wholesale warehouseman on a West India merchant for linen or
                    cottons supplied to the merchant. It is evident that bills between parties
                    residing in the same town are not strictly <hi rend="italic">en regle,</hi> as
                    in their case there can be no expense or risk in forwarding money. Still they
                    can hardly be objected to in transactions like the preceding, which are
                    evidently <hi rend="italic">bona fide</hi> from the respective lines of business
                    of the parties. The Bank of England sanctions town notes as regards the
                    metropolis, by appropriating a day in each week (Wednesday) for discounting
                    them, and by often carrying such discounts to a very large amount.. During the
                    war, when monied capital was comparatively scarce, town notes were extremely
                    common. They are still very frequent, but not in so great a degree, first-rate
                    houses being unwilling to give their acceptances where a payment in cash is the
                    regular mode of settling an account. This feeling differs according to the line
                    of business of the parties. Thus, London houses in the East India trade being
                    generally large establishments, confine their acceptances to bills from abroad,
                    and decline giving them to persons in London, such as the wholesale dealers in
                    cloth or hardware, from whom they purchase goods for shipment. They prefer
                    paying such persons in cash, even when not altogether convenient, to the
                    animadversions that might attend thch affixing their acceptance to a town note.
                    On the other hand, London booksellers, though often possessed of considerable
                    capital, are obliged, by the nature of their business, to give such long
                    credits, that the postponement of a payment during several months, obtained by
                    giving their acceptance, is an accommodation they readily embrace. Besides, the
                    custom of the trade, in this as in various other lines of business, prevents
                    such acceptances from being an object of much animadversion.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">The Invoice Book.</hi> A mercantile house connected, as we
                    have supposed, with North America and the West Indies, receives from time to
                    time requisitions, or, as they are commonly termed, orders, from their
                    correspondents abroad for manufactured goods, whether woollens, linens, cottons,
                    or hardware. An order of only moderate amount is generally of the length of
                    several pages, embracing both a number of different articles and various
                    qualities of each particular article. The first step on the part of the London
                    merchant is to analyse this order, and to share or distribute its various parts
                    among a number of wholesale dealers, whether in London, Manchester, Birmingham,
                    or Sheffield, that each may supply the articles in his line of business. A few
                    weeks suffice for their getting ready the goods, when they send in their several
                    accounts, or bills of parcels, as they are termed, thus:</p><p><hi rend="italic">London,</hi> lst <hi rend="italic">February</hi> 1831</p><table><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Messrs <hi rend="smallcaps">Baring, Hall,</hi> &amp; Co.</p><p>A.

                    they are almost always drawn in the same form, containing many particulars in
                    short compass; viz. the mark, numbers, and value of each package, also the
                    nature of the goods contained in it, as far as can be expressed by a short
                    general notice. It was formerly the practice to make invoices very long, and to
                    copy into them each bill of parcels literally; but the usage is now to assign
                    only one or two lines in the invoice to the articles supplied by each dealer,
                    and to send out duplicate bills of parcels by the vessel. The house abroad has
                    thus the satisfaction of seeing the different bills of parcels exactly as
                    furnished by the dealer or tradesman.</p><p>The sum insured is somewhat more than the amount of the Invoice, that, in the

                    above. It began with <hi rend="italic">a</hi> statement of the contents of the
                    packages sold, and the charges were subjoined; but the plan of putting the goods
                    on one side, and the charges on another, on the principle of debtor and
                    creditor, is evidently an improvement. Several<pb break="no" facs="nls:193199494" xml:id="kp-eb0704-9494-0783"/> other entries
                    in this account are entitled to the attention of a commercial student. The
                    freight is charged, not, as might naturally be expected, on the total weight
                    brought home, but on the weight of the goods exclusive of the packages. Of the
                    allowances for weight, the larger, tare, is the exact weight of the cask; the
                    lesser, draft, is a deduction made by the seller to the buyer, its rate being
                    fixed by custom, and bearing no reference to the weight of the package.</p><p>If there be found a deficiency in the original weight, from sea damage, from
                    waste, or any other cause, the amount of such deficiency, and the manner of its
                    occurring, must be explicitly stated in the account sale. The same holds in

                    counting-house; from the cashbook, the invoice and account sales book, as well
                    as from the bills payable and receivable. After these comes the petty journal or
                    record of such occasional entries as do not belong to the preceding, or any
                    other subsidiary books. Such entries are in general very few, because, in every
                    regular counting-house, the subsidiary books contain almost every transaction
                    that takes place.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Insurances.—</hi> It is customary to have an insurance policy
                    book, a folio book of the length and breadth of a printed policy, and containing
                    a quantity of such policies bound up, unstamped. In these are filled in, by a
                    clerk, literal copies of the insurances effected by the house, with the names of
                    the underwriters, and the amount of their respective subscriptions. From this is
                    posted the insurance ledger, containing the accounts of the underwriters for
                    premiums and returns.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Bought Booh, or Booh of Bills of Parcels.—</hi> In former
                    times, when mercantile transactions were on a limited scale, the practice of a
                    merchant, as of private individuals at present, was merely to fold up the bills
                    of parcels, or accounts delivered to him by dealers, in a uniform size, and,
                    after writing on the back the names of</p><p>• the parties, to put them away in bundles. But the preferable plan, wherever
                    such accounts are numerous, is, after arranging them alphabetically, to have
                    them pasted in a large quarto or folio volume of blue or sugar-loaf paper. A
                    surprising number of accounts may be contained in one of these books; and its
                    pages being numbered, any account may, by the aid of an alphabetical index, be
                    referred to with the same ease as an entry in a ledger.</p><p>Drawbacks payable at the custom-house on goods exported, and for which the
                    merchant holds a debenture or acknowledgment of debt on the part of the
                    custom-house. Of these a list or register should be kept, either in a small
                    separate book, called the <hi rend="italic">debenture booh,</hi> or in a
                    specific part of one of the larger books.</p><p>The <hi rend="italic">petty cash-book</hi> contains the disburse for postages and
                    other small matters; the amount is entered weekly or monthly in the regular
                    cash-books.</p><p>We have now recapitulated the various subsidiary books which form the groundwork
                    or authorities for the journal. The ledger comes next, and by way of affording a
                    specimen of this, the <hi rend="italic">finale</hi> of book-keeping labour, we
                    shall exhibit the preceding journal entries, carried to their respective heads
                    in the ledger.</p><p>LEDGER.</p><table><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell cols="8" role="data" rows="1"> Dr. ∙ <hi rend="smallcaps">Stock.</hi> Cr. </cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>1831.</p><p>Jan. 1.</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Folio Journal,</p><p>2</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"> To Sundries </cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p><hi rend="italic">L. s. d.</hi></p><p>19,660 0 0</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>1831.</p><p>Jan. 1.</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Folio Journal.</p><p>1</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"> By Sundries </cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p><hi rend="italic">L. s. d.</hi></p><p>67,792 0 0</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell cols="8" role="data" rows="1"> Dr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Cash.</hi> Cr. </cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"> Jan. 1. 31. </cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>1</p><p>2</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>To Stock</p><p>To Sundries</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>3,775 10 0</p><p>3,224 16 0</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"> Jan. 31. </cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"> 4 </cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"> By Sundries </cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"> 2,623 6 7 </cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell cols="8" role="data" rows="1"> Dr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Exchequer Bills.</hi> Cr. </cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"> Jan. 1. </cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"> 1 </cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"> To Stock </cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"> 10,750 0 0 </cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"/><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"/><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"/><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"/></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell cols="8" role="data" rows="1"> Dr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Three per Cent.

                    over the account is quickly informed of the nature of the different entries.
                    They may therefore be inserted wherever the business is on a small scale,
                    because in such a case they do not add much to the labour of the kook-keeper;
                    but wherever the business is extensive, all detail in the ledger ought to be
                    avoided, and the entries made in the most concise form possible, for the
                    following reasons.</p><p>1. The explanations never can be so full and circumstantial as to supersede the
                    necessity of an account-current book.</p><p>2. Nor can they supersede a reference to the journal in what may be called
                    collective entries, such, we mean, as the bills payable discharged, or the bills
                    receivable encashed, in a particular month; entries in which a number of
                    particulars are collected in the journal, and carried to the ledger in one sum.
                    And,</p><p>3. It is desirable to have as many of such collective entries as possible,
                    limiting thereby the number of postings in the ledger, and lessening the
                    difficulty of balancing it at the end of the year. Such was the recommendation
                    of Mr Benjamin Booth, in his printed work, nearly half a century ago; and such
                    had long before been the practice of our best merchants.</p><p>It follows therefore that the ledger ought to be merely an index to the journal,
                    exactly as the journal is an index to the various subsidiary books of the house.
                    To aim at more, and to repeat in any one of these books statements or
                    particulars already contained in the other, would be quite a work of
                    supererogation.</p><p><hi rend="italic">JBalancing the Ledger.—</hi> At the end of each year, and, in
                    some houses, of each half year, the ledger is balanced; that is, the debtor and
                    creditor side of each account in the ledger is added up, and the balance or
                    difference entered in a general list or balance-sheet. Thus a few accounts taken
                    from the preceding fragment of a ledger exhibit the following balances :—</p><table><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"> Debtors. </cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"> Creditors. </cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"> J.

Story &amp; Co. 796 11 0 </cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"> Gregg &amp; Lindsay 498 10 0 </cell></row></table><p>The balance-sheet is generally very long, comprising on one side or the other
                    every open or unclosed account in the ledger. The rule in all regular counting
                    houses is to make the sum of the debtors in the balance-sheet correspond with
                    the sum of the creditors, and to spare no pains to accomplish such agreement,
                    because until it be done there must evidently be an error in some part or other
                    of the journal or ledger. Unluckily, the amount of the difference gives almost
                    no clue towards tracing either how it has taken place, or the part of the
                    journal or ledger where it is to be looked for: it may be in any day of the
                    year, or in any of the entries (1000, 2000, or perhaps 3000) w <hi rend="superscript"> 7</hi> hich the ledger for the year contains. The dif
                    ference is sometimes very small; a few pounds, a few shillings, or a few pence;
                    but the fractional errors are often as difficult to detect as a large sum; and
                    in fact it is not unfrequent, in the process of examining, to discover new
                    errors, which, instead of diminishing, add to the amount of the existing
                    difference, carrying it from L.10 to L.100, or even to L.1000. Hence the
                    necessity of experience and habitual accuracy in a book-keeper. To one deficient
                    in these respects balancing a ledger of length is generally a most laborious and
                    tedious task, requiring week after week to be passed in the dry labour of
                    collating, adding, and subtracting. Mr Jones’ method will, it is to be hoped, be
                    the means of preventing the continuance of these unprofitable searches; for we
                    are satisfied that the labour given to the precautionary arrangements
                    recommended by him will be saved, and doubly saved, in the final winding up of
                    the books.</p><p>We have already adverted to Mr Jones’s first publication on book-keeping; his
                    second, in 1821, was intended to counteract the inconvenience attendant on the
                    form of his ledger, which required that the accounts should be opened anew each
                    year. His third work, published so lately as last year (1831), is of a much more
                    comprehensive character, and may be said to exhibit the result of more than
                    thirty years’ experience as a public accountant. It is printed in the quarto
                    form, and consists of a number of distinct parts; first, explanatory statements
                    of his mode of book-keeping by single as well as double entry, with a number of
                    <hi rend="italic">formula,</hi> in which the same transactions are exhibited by
                    the Italian and by his method, so as to bring into view the various advantages
                    of the latter. These are followed by a series of instruction to persons in
                    different branches of business, viz. bankers, manufacturers, brokers, wholesale
                    and retail dealers, in regard to the books of account best fitted to their
                    respective occupations; the whole followed by a treatise in the form best
                    adapted to the government offices. Such are the contents of the first or printed
                    half of Mr Jones’s book; the other half is lithographed, and exhibits two sets
                    of books, each for a year, one kept by single, the other by double entry. Along
                    with these are given a balance-book and an abstract-book, devised for the
                    purpose of leading promptly to the detection of errors or false entries. This
                    they will fully accomplish if the plan laid down by Mr Jones is carried into
                    effect; and they seem to us also well calculated to save the perplexity and loss
                    of time at present so often incurred in efforts to find the general balance. The
                    Italian method, ingenious as it was, and a surprising improvement at the time on
                    the primitive system of single entry, is not an effectual preventive of
                    erroneous or fraudulent insertions in the books; nor does it present any ready
                    method to facilitate the laborious task of balancing the ledger. It is
                    consequently the practice of Messrs Barings, and several mercantile houses of
                    the first rank, to keep two sets of books as a check on each other; but the
                    object of Mr Jones is to attain correctness in the first instance, by submitting
                    to some extra trouble as the posting of the books proceed. Thus, his
                    abstract-book is a classed <hi rend="italic">epitome</hi> of his journal, and
                    forms the first check against posting -entries to wrong accounts; while his
                    balance-book is an <hi rend="italic">epitome</hi> of the ledger, and forms
                    another check, both against carrying entries to a wrong head, and making a
                    mistake in the figures so carried. In many counting-houses the uncertainty of
                    the Italian method is counteracted by habitual accuracy in the book-keeper; but
                    Mr Jones’s auxiliary books are devised with the view <hi rend="superscript">
                    7</hi> of enabling even <hi rend="italic">a mediocre</hi> book-keeper to avoid
                    mistakes, or to detect them soon after they are made. By means of these books he
                    may prove his ledger not only in any month, but in any week, or even in any day,
                    of the year.</p><p>Nothing is more desirable than frequent balancing of <pb break="no" facs="nls:193199572" xml:id="kp-eb0704-9572-0789"/>the books of a
                    merchant, and frequent transmission of accounts to his connections. A year is
                    evidently too long for accounts-current to remain open; six months are a more
                    suitable period; and if the improvements we have described have the effect of
                    lessening the difficulty of general balances, an important service will thereby
                    be rendered to persons in trade.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">The title of Mr Jones’s publication is

                    business the rule is to have a new ledger for every year; but three or four
                    years are the more usual time of a ledger remaining in use. The latter has the
                    advantage of showing the transactions of a long period in succession, as well as
                    of saving the repeated opening of the same accounts.</p><p>The stock account has no entries during the currency of the year, but at its
                    close (on 31st December) the balances of profit and loss, bad and doubtful
                    debts, and a few such accounts, are carried, as the case maybe, to its debit or
                    credit.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Collective Entries in the Journal.—</hi> It may be proper to
                    explain what is meant by such entries in the journal. While in the bill-books
                    every bill is entered the day it comes to hand, and in the cash-book every
                    payment or receipt is entered on the day it takes place, the journal entries are
                    made to comprise in one amount a number of transactions occurring at different
                    dates in the course of the month. Thus the entry of “Sundries Drs. to Bills
                    Payable” exhibit in succession all the bills accepted during the month; they are
                    then added in one sum, which sum alone is carried to the ledger. In like manner,
                    in the entry of “Bills Receivable Drs. to Sundries,” the aggregate alone is
                    posted in the ledger; and the same in a variety of cases, the effect of which is
                    to lessen greatly the difficulty of agreeing the books at the end of the year.
                    We cannot, therefore, approve of the practice of those book-keepers who, to save
                    themselves the trouble of re-writing the cashbook in the journal form, are
                    content to post each separate sum directly from the cash-book to the ledger.
                    They thus avoid, it is true, the copying of eight or ten folio pages a month;
                    but by giving up the advantage of joining in one sum the different payments made
                    under such heads as bills payable, charges, house expenses, they have to carry
                    to the ledger during the month above 100 entries instead of perhaps only thirty
                    or forty.</p><p><hi rend="italic">The Waste-Book.—</hi> This book has long been disused by
                    regular merchants, and the name itself would have been forgotten, had it not
                    been reprinted from one work on bookkeeping to another, the authors of which,
                    being generally teachers, were unacquainted with the improvements introduced
                    into the practice of merchants. The wastebook of former times consisted of a
                    series of memoranda, so miscellaneous as to comprehend every transaction of the
                    house, whether a sale, a purchase, a payment, or a receipt. From this general
                    receptacle the book-keeper composed the journal, which was then, as at present,
                    a narrative or record, in regular form, of the transactions of the house. As
                    mercantile establishments acquired extension, separate books became necessary,
                    as well for the cash and bills as for goods exported and imported. These books
                    were found the fittest authorities for the journal, and the waste-book or diary
                    fell altogether into disuse.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Single Entry.—A.</hi> wholesale dealer occupying a warehouse,
                    and whose business consists in supplying such articles as woollen, cotton,
                    linen, or hardware, to exporting <pb break="no" facs="nls:193199585" xml:id="kp-eb0704-9585-0790"/>merchants, is
                    generally satisfied with few books. He is accustomed to enter each delivery of
                    goods in his daybook, and to get copied into his invoice-book the bills of
                    parcels made out for his customers, of which examples have been given above in
                    the names of Balmanno and Oakey &amp; Company. He seldom keeps a journal, but a
                    ledger is indispensable, though not kept by double entry. It consists on one
                    part of the names of his customers (the exporting merchants), and, on the other,
                    of those of the manufacturers from whom he makes his purchases. From the latter
                    he receives credit, and to the former he gives it; hence the necessity of
                    opening accounts for both. At the end of the year, a person in such aline of
                    business is accustomed to form an estimate of the state of his affairs by adding
                    up on one side the sums due <hi rend="italic">by</hi> him to the manufacturers,
                    and on the other those due <hi rend="italic">to</hi> him by the merchants. He
                    takes, moreover, an account of his stock, or goods in hand, which being valued,
                    and the amount added to the sums due to him, the difference between their
                    conjunct amount and the total of his debts affords a tolerably correct idea of
                    the state of his property. It would, however, be much more clear and
                    satisfactory were his books kept by double entry, that is, were every debtor to
                    have a creditor, or, in other words, were every entry to have its counterpart.
                    Suppose him, for example, to make a purchase from Messrs Greenup of Halifax, for
                    L.1250 of the coarse woollens called penistones, he merely enters in his ledger
                    that sum to the credit of Messrs Greenup; but the proper course would be to find
                    a debtor for the same amount by such an entry as “Penistones Dr. to Messrs
                    Greenup, L1250.” Subsequently, on effecting sales of the article to exporting
                    merchants, the proper course would be to make entries such as “Baring, Hall,
                    &amp; Co. Drs. to Penistones for L.225 and by continuing such entries, that is,
                    by crediting the account of Penistones for the sales as successively made, until
                    the whole was disposed of, the ultimate result would be that the creditor side
                    would exhibit a total equal to the L.1250 paid to Messrs Greenup, and’ to the
                    profit accruing from the transaction.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Double Entry</hi> has farther and more important advantages to
                    a merchant than to a tradesman, because his dealings are much more varied and
                    complicated. It forms the connecting link of his accounts, and shows in what
                    manner his funds have been successively invested. As every debtor in his books
                    has a creditor, no part of his property is unaccounted for; and when in doubt as
                    to any specific portion, he will find a solution of the difficulty in his own
                    journal. Those who know how soon money becomes absorbed, or at least
                    appropriated in business, and in how few years a large sum may be vested in
                    machinery, shipping, or other fixed capital, are aware that merchants would
                    often consider themselves deceived, if they had not in double entry an unfailing
                    clue to the appropriation of their capital. .</p><p>Next, as to the degree of intricacy in double entry. In the case of a shipment of
                    goods, the merchant abroad who receives the goods is made debtor to the several
                    dealers at home who have supplied them; <hi rend="italic">e. g.</hi> A. Dixon
                    &amp; Co. of New York are Drs. to Spitta &amp; Co., Jobson &amp; Co., &amp;c. In
                    like manner, in the case of produce imported, the brokers, Trueman &amp; Cook,
                    who sell it and receive the amount, are made debtors to Simon Fraser, for whose
                    account the produce was shipped. All this is clear and free from intricacy, as
                    also such farther entries as Cash Dr. to Trueman &amp; Cook, on their paying
                    over the proceeds of the sale, or Bills Receivable Drs. to A. Dixon &amp; Co.,
                    on their remitting or sending home a bill for the amount of the goods forwarded
                    to them. It is true that a young merchant beginning to study book-keeping will
                    not all at once comprehend such an account as Bills Receivable, nor its
                    counterpart Bills Payable, nor a few other accounts, such as Charges and
                    Merchandise; but practice will convey a distinct conception of them, and render
                    them in time as clear as personal accounts.</p><p>The advantages of double entry may fortunately be imparted to almost any
                    account-books, without sacrificing much time and labour. Persons engaged in such
                    business as that of wholesale warehousemen, manufacturers, or retailers, may
                    keep the chief part of their books by single entry, making use of double entry
                    to the extent of a few pages at the end of the month or quarter, to obtain a
                    clear and summary view of their transactions.</p><p>As to the money or currency in which the books of a merchant should be kept, it
                    is evident, first, that it can be money of one kind only; and, next, that it
                    must be the money of the country in which the merchant resides Thus, an English
                    house in Bordeaux must keep its accounts in French money, although its chief
                    business may be the export of wines to London and Dublin.</p><p>We come, in the last place, to <hi rend="italic">Accounts-current,</hi> which,
                    though a most important portion of the accounts of a merchant, are rather the
                    result than a constituent part of his system of book-keeping, being in general
                    written out from the ledger and journal, with very slight variation or addition.

                    to the different correspondents as soon as possible after the day to which they
                    are made up. To effect that, they ought to be copied out, in part at least,
                    before the 31st December or 30th June, the dates at which they generally close,
                    particularly as the interest and commission cannot be calculated until they are
                    written out; and the whole has then to be copied into the account-current
                    book.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Mode of computing Interest.—</hi> To do this correctly on the
                    different sums in an account-current, it is requisite to take the number of days
                    between each transaction, and the state at which the account-current is closed.
                    Take, for example, a sum of L.531 paid on 5th October, and bearing interest
                    consequently during eighty-seven days, until 31st December. On ascertaining the
                    number of days, compute the interest, either by referring to a book of interest
                    tables, or by the following operation.</p><p>Multiply the pounds, 531, by 87, the number of days, and the product will be
                    46,197; divide that sum by 7300, and the quotient, L.6. 6s. 7d., will be the
                    interest required. The reasons for this process are as follows: interest at 5
                    per cent, for one year forms a twentieth part of the principal, there being a
                    shilling of interest for every pound of principal. On multiplying the number of
                    pounds by the number of days, the product 46,197, is so many 365th parts of a
                    shilling; divide it by 365, and the quotient, L.126. 7d., will be the interest.
                    But as it is desirable to have the quotient in pounds, alter your divisor so as
                    to obtain it in that form; that is, multiply 365 by 20, and make the product
                    7300 your divisor, or, preferably, 73 by striking off two figures from it, and
                    the same from the dividend; the quotient is the interest in pounds, shillings,
                    and pence.</p><p>As to the comparative ease of the two processes, where the entries are few the
                    interest tables may be used with advantage; but whenever they are numerous, as
                    they very often are in accounts-current, it will save time to multiply and
                    divide as above.</p><p>A compounding subtraction will give the interest at other rates, such as 3∣, 3,
                    or 2⅜ per cent.; so that the plan of multiplying the pounds by the days, and
                    dividing by 73, is applicable to any of the different rates of interest.</p><p>When accounts-current are made out, as in general they ought to be, every six
                    months, the 30th June is the concluding date for the earlier half year. West
                    India houses are accustomed to balance their books and close their
                    accounts-current once a year, viz. on 30th April.</p><p>There are two modes of preparing accounts-current in a counting-house. The more
                    usual course is to write <hi rend="subscript"> l</hi> them out from the ledger
                    and journal, and afterwards to copy them into the account-current book. The
                    other plan is to make no reference, in the first instance, to the ledger or
                    journal, but to post the account-current book from the cash-book, bill-books,
                    account-sales, invoices, and other authorities in the counting-house, so as to
                    render it (the account-current book) a check on the ledger. This, however, is of
                    less importance than may at first be thought, because, from the plan of the
                    journal and ledger, omissions are not so likely to occur in them as in the
                    account-current book; and the chief advantage of a separately posted
                    account-current book consists in having it brought up to a day, as it may easily
                    be at a time that the journal and ledger are in arrear.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Boohs of Account required by a Merchant.—</hi> Journal; ledger;

                    remains that we notice a recent work on book-keeping, which has attracted
                    attention in Germany; we mean that of Mr F. W. Cronhelm, published at Hamburg in
                    1818. The author makes use of terms that are new and somewhat strange to an
                    English book-keeper, giving the name of “additive property” to the assets of a
                    mercantile house, viz. goods, cash, or bills receivable; while the debts, such
                    as bills payable, are termed “subtractive property.” Still his work is the
                    result, not of theory, but of a series of improvements on the books of an
                    extensive mercantile house. A clear and circumstantial publication it certainly
                    is, yet not materially different from the systems of book-keeping adopted during
                    many years in respectable counting-houses in England and Holland. Mr Cronhelm’s
                    cash-book, bill-books, and his ledger-accounts of merchandise, profit and loss,
                    stock, commission, interest, are all on a plan similar to those of our regularly
                    managed counting-houses; and had the author resided in London or Amsterdam, he
                    would probably have been aware that many of his improvements had been
                    anticipated under a different name. <hi rend="smallcaps">(μ. μ.)</hi></p></div></body></text></TEI>
