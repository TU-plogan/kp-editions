                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                <p><label type="entry">BANDA ISLANDS</label>. These islands, situated 130 miles to
                    the south-east of Amboyna, are ten in number, viz. Banda Neira, Gonong Apee,
                    Banda Lantoir, Pulo Ay or Way, Pulo Rondo or Pulo Roon, Rosyngen, Pulo Pisang,
                    Craka, Capella, and Sonangy.</p>
                <p>Of these, Banda Neira is the seat of the supreme government, and it is secured by
                    one principal fortification, situate on the south side of the island, consisting
                    of a small square fort, having a wet ditch, with a horn-work towards the sea.
                    This fortification, which is called Fort Napau, forms the chief defence of the
                    Banda Islands. The troops are quartered, and the public granaries are kept, in
                    this fort; but the storehouses for the nutmegs and mace are on the outside, as
                    well as the government-house. Above Fort Napau, on a neighbouring eminence,
                    stands the castle of Belgica, an old pentagon, with round towers at the angles.
                    It is surrounded with a wall, secured by small bastions, but has no ditch, and
                    is said to have been built by the Portuguese.</p>
                <p>Banda Lantoir or Great Banda is to the northward of Banda Neira. It is commanded
                    by a considerable fort, which also domineers over the harbour, and is called
                    Fort Hollandia. At first view the situation of this fort appears preferable to
                    Banda Neira for the residence of government, not only on account of its strong
                    and commanding situation, but because the island is the largest as well as the
                    richest in the produce of spices. Its unhealthiness has been found, however, to
                    be a sufficient objection. The water is said to be bad, and the vapour which
                    sometimes descends from the volcanic mountain of the neighbouring island, Gonong
                    Apee, is represented as particularly noxious. Such fatal effects were produced
                    by these causes, that when the Wirtemberg Company formerly garrisoned the
                    island, out of a hundred men eight died and forty fell sick in the course of two
                    months. The numbers of decayed houses, also, which are seen in different parts
                    of the island, show that the experiment of a settlement has already been tried,
                    and has not been found to answer. This island appears very high from the sea;
                    its sides are steep, and from the top of them there is a sort of table-land,
                    which extends nearly from one end of the island to the other.</p>
                <p>Gonong Apee is to the northward of Banda Neira, and derives its name from a large
                    volcano about 2000 feet above the level of the sea, which constantly emits
                    smoke, and sometimes cinders and ashes, accompanied with a crackling noise. On
                    the south side of this island are two forts, originally intended to defend the
                    west channel of Lantoir harbour; but, owing to an eruption of the volcano in
                    1778, at the same time that a dreadful hurricane laid waste the island, the lava
                    flowed down in such quantities as to form a considerable promontory between
                    these batteries and the channel they were intended to defend, so that they are
                    now in a great measure useless. This island is generally unproductive, its
                    surface being covered with a quantity of sulphur and chalk. There is no
                    vegetation whatever on upwards of one third of the eminence on which the volcano
                    is situated. Towards the sea the descent is exceedingly steep; but towards the
                    harbour the declivity slopes gradually to the water, on the side of which are
                    some plantations and a few straggling houses.</p>
                <p>Pulo Way is about nine miles to the westward of Gonong Apee, and is defended by a
                    strong fort. Įt is esteemed the most healthy of the whole group, and produces
                    abundance of nutmegs, of a kind superior in quality to those of the other
                    islands. Pulo Rondo, or Pulo Roon, is about four miles farther, in a somewhat
                    more northerly direction. On this island the English had a factory, from which
                    they were expelled by the Dutch about the period of the massacre of Amboyna; and
                    the island having been since abandoned, has become a wilderness. Rosyngen is '
                    about seven miles to the south-east of Lantoir. It p <hi rend="subscript">
                    ro</hi>. duces nutmegs, mace, yams, and subsistence for a few cattle. The
                    convicts of Amboyna were formerly kept on this island, and were compelled to
                    cultivate the land for the use of the supreme government. Pulo Pisang is about
                    two miles north-east from Banda Neira, and yields some fine fruits, as well as
                    nutmegs and mace. The other three islands are uninhabited, being little more
                    than barren rocks.</p>
                <p>The Banda Islands were discovered in the year 1511 by the Portuguese, who
                    immediately took possession of them in the name of their sovereign. About the
                    year 1603 they were expelled by the Dutch. In 1608 the English, with the
                    permission of the king, built a factoryhouse on Pulo Way, which the Dutch
                    demolished as soon as the ship which brought out the factors returned to
                    England. The natives of Banda, notwithstanding the opposition of the Dutch,
                    assisted the English in forming a new colony; and shortly afterwards they, along
                    with the natives of Lantoir, made a formal resignation of their respective
                    islands to the new settlers. In 1620 Pulo Roon and Pulo Way were added to the
                    English dominions, and these cessions were confirmed by a treaty concluded
                    between the English and the Dutch. But, in defiance of this treaty, the latter
                    determined on the expulsion of their rivals from those islands, in the
                    possession of which they appeared to be gradually establishing themselves. They
                    accordingly attacked them with a strong force, seized their factories,
                    magazines, and shipping, and, after stripping the factors naked, first whipped
                    and then loaded them with irons. Some notion may be formed of the trade, then in
                    its infancy, by the quantity of spices seized here, which amounted to 23,000
                    lbs. of mace and 150,000 lbs. of nutmegs. In 1654 the Dutch were compelled, by
                    the firmness of Cromwell, to restore the island of Pulo Roon, and to make
                    satisfaction for the massacre of Amboyna. But the English settlers not being
                    adequately supported from home, were unable to resist the power of their rivals,
                    and the island was retaken by the Dutch in 1664. They retained undisturbed
                    possession of their conquests in this quarter of the globe until the year 1796,
                    when the Banda Islands, along with all the other Dutch colonies, were conquered
                    by the British. They were restored by the treaty of Amiens in the year 1800, but
                    were again captured, and finally restored by the treaty of Paris concluded in
                    the year 1814.</p>
                <p>In the space between Banda Lantoir and the islands of Banda Neira and Gonong Apee
                    there is a very good harbour formed with entrances both from the east and west,
                    which enable vessels to enter it from either of the monsoons. These channels are
                    well defended with several batteries, particularly the western one, which is
                    very narrow. Between Gonong Apee and Banda Neira there is a third channel into
                    this harbour from the north, but it is navigable only for small vessels.</p>
                <p>The great articles of commerce in these islands are nutmegs and mace, which are
                    engrossed at a fixed price, for the benefit of the Dutch East India Company; and
                    the laws and regulations generally established are calculated to support and
                    promote this monopoly rather than the happiness of the people or the improvement
                    of the country. With this view, the cultivation of the nutmeg is only allowed in
                    the islands of Banda Neira, Gonong Apee, Banda Lantoir, and Pulo Ay. In all the
                    other islands the tree has been carefully extirpated, because, being at a
                    distance from the seat of government, they were supposed to afford better
                    opportunities for smuggling. In the islands which <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193193748" xml:id="kp-eb0704-3748-0341"/>are appropriated to the
                    cultivation of the nutmeg, they neither feed cattle nor produce grain sufficient
                    for the maintenance of the inhabitants; and they are on this account dependent
                    on Batavia for annual supplies of rice, <hi rend="subscript"> a</hi> nd other
                    articles of provision. In consequence of the low state of agriculture occasioned
                    by this policy, the inhabitants are few, and the number of hands that would be
                    necessary to bring the nutmeg plantations into the highest state )f cultivation
                    cannot be procured. This scarcity of hands renders it necessary to recruit the
                    declining population by the importation of slaves. It would appear, also, that
                    the inhabitants suffer severely when the supplies of provisions, on which they
                    depend from abroad, happen to be interrupted. About fifteen months before these
                    islandswere lastconquer-edby the British, some reforms in the system of
                    administration were carried into effect by a new governor, who had been
                    appointed for that purpose. But before this period most of the planters were in
                    great distress, having been charged with very heavydebts, incurred on account
                    otloans in rice and money, made at different periods by the former governors;
                    and this circumstance, joined to the great loss which they sustained by the
                    dreadful hurricane of 1778, entirely ruined their private fortunes as well as
                    their plantations. While they were in these distressed circumstances, the Dutch
                    government, with an unfeeling avarice, aggravated their misery by compelling
                    them to deliver their nutmegs at the reduced price of three farthings per pound,
                    and the mace at a still lower rate. Under this accumulated distress, the spirit
                    which had animated their fathers in the days of their independence seemed once
                    again to revive, and they remonstrated in bold and determined language. They
                    claimed the lands as their own prescriptive inheritance, which was undoubtedly
                    the case, and actually proceeded to portion out their respective properties to
                    each other. The Dutch, though they were touched by no feeling for the deplorable
                    situation to which they had reduced the country, were nevertheless alarmed when
                    they saw their discontented subjects determined to resist, and it was thought
                    advisable to adopt a more just and conciliatory conduct. With this view, the
                    accumulated arrear of debt claimed by the company from the planters, and which
                    most of them were unable to pay, was cancelled. Several judicious regulations
                    were also adopted regarding the management of slaves, and the prices at which
                    the government received the spices of the planters were at the same time
                    increased from the low rate to which it had been reduced to seven and a half
                    stivers per lb. for mace, and to two and a half stivers for nutmegs, with a
                    deduction of 17 per cent, in favour of the company and their servants.</p>
                <p>In return for these concessions, it would appear that the company, after having
                    pacified their subjects, seized their lands; and in this manner they continued
                    to practise the same oppression as before, though the mode adopted was somewhat
                    different. The planters in general, if they had once been freed from the
                    enormous debt claimed by government, would, from the produce of their
                    plantations, have speedily discharged all other claims; and they considered it
                    hard, therefore, that, under colour of remitting this debt, they should be
                    deprived of their respective properties, to which prescription gave them an
                    undoubted right.</p>
                <p>The nutmeg-tree is a native of several of the islands to the eastward; but it has
                    been in a great measure extirpated from all of them except Banda. It begins to
                    bear f ruit at ten years’ growth, the fruit improving in quality, and increasing
                    in quantity, until the tree has attained the age of an hundred years. In its
                    appearance it is handsome and spreading; the bark is smooth, and of a brownislι
                    gray colour. The leaves resemble those of the laurel, and af ford, when bruised,
                    a grateful aromatic odour. When the tree first begins to produce fruit, little
                    yellowish buds make their appearance, out of which small white flowers are
                    blown, two or three hanging upon slender peduncles. In the centre of the flower
                    is an oblong reddish knob, from which the fruit is produced, though no more than
                    one blossom out of three commonly ripens to a nutmeg. It is eight or nine months
                    before the fruit arrives at maturity; but blossoms and ripe fruit are found
                    together on the same tree, and the nutmegs are generally gathered three times in
                    a year. The nutmeg, when ripe on the tree, has a very curious and beautiful
                    appearance. It is almost the size of an aprico, and nearly of the same colour,
                    with the same kind of hollow mark all round it In shape it is somewhat like a
                    pear. When perfectly ripe, the rind over the mark, which is nearly half an inch
                    thick, and of a whitish colour, opens and displays the nutmeg in its black and
                    shining shell, encircled by a net-work of scarlet mace. The shell in which the
                    nutmeg is inclosed is about as thick as that of a filbert, and very hard. In
                    preparing the fruit for use, the mace is first stript off and kept in baskets to
                    dry in the sun, and the nutmeg in its shell is placed before a slow fire to dry,
                    in five different houses made of split bamboos, fitted up for the purpose. In
                    each of these houses it remains a week, till it is heard to shake within the
                    shell, which is then easily broken. The nutmegs thus prepared are sorted into
                    separate parcels. Each sort is put up by itself into baskets, and soaked three
                    times in tubs of sea-water and lime; after which they are put into distinct
                    closets, where they are left for six weeks to sweat, that the lime, by closing
                    the pores of the nutmeg, may prevent its strength from evaporating. The lime is
                    necessary to preserve the fruit from worms and other insects; and it requires
                    much experience, as well as a considerable degree of judgment, to ascertain the
                    precise time that the fruit should be suffered to remain in the lime; for if it
                    be taken out too soon, it is worm-eaten, and if it is left to remain too long in
                    the lime, it is burnt up and rendered useless.</p>
                <p>The nutmeg is distinguished into three sorts, namely, the male or barren nutmeg,
                    the royal nutmeg, and the queen nutmeg. The two last, species are distinguished
                    by the different sorts of fruit which they produce, that of the royal nutmeg
                    being longer and more pointed, and its green shell being also thicker. It does
                    not ripen so fast; and after opening it preserves its freshness eight or nine
                    days. The mace is more substantial and three times as long as that of the queen
                    nutmeg, and its stripes or thongs, of which there are from 15 to 17 principal
                    ones, are of a livelier red; they are also broader, longer, and thicker, and not
                    only embrace the nut through it whole length, but pass it, and cross under it as
                    if to prevent it from falling. The royal nutmeg is generally from 15 to 17 lines
                    long, and thick in proportion. It remains on the tree a long time after the
                    opening of the green shell, and gives birth to an insect in the shell, which
                    feeds upon and destroys it. The queen nutmeg produces much smaller nuts, only
                    nine or ten lines long, not so thick by a third, and well marked by a
                    longitudinal groove on one side. They are round, and the green shell is not so
                    thick as that of the royal nutmeg. The mace, which is composed of nine or ten
                    principal stripes, grows only half down the nut; thus leaving it at liberty to
                    detach itself, and to escape from the insect formed in the shell. In two or
                    three days also the green shell, losing its freshness, soon falls away from the
                    nut.</p>
                <p>Nutmegs should be chosen large, round, heavy, and firm; of a lightish gray colour
                    on the outside, and the inside finely marbled; of a strong fragrant smell, warm
                    aromatic taste, and a fat oily body. The oblong kind and smaller <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193193761" xml:id="kp-eb0704-3761-0342"/>ones should be rejected. The
                    real quantity of nutmegs produced has never been exactly ascertained. The
                    largest quantity sold by the Dutch East India Company at one time was 280,694
                    lbs. in the year 1737. In 1756 there were sold 241,427 lbs.; and in 1778,
                    264,189 lbs. The average quantity annually sold in Europe has been stated at
                    250,000 lbs. exclusive of about 100,000 lbs. disposed of in the East Indies. The
                    produce, however, has since greatly declined, which may be imputed to various
                    causes. In the year 1778 the nutmeg plantations were laid waste by a tremendous
                    hurricane; and this calamity was succeeded by oppressions on the part of the
                    government, and by disturbances among the people. Agriculture and industry were
                    in consequence neglected, and the annual produce of spices of all sorts, which
                    amounted to 600,000 lbs. was suddenly reduced to 50,000 lbs. For seven years
                    previous to the commencement of the war with France in 1793, the average
                    quantity of nutmegs sold in Holland amounted only to 22,459 lbs. and that of
                    mace to 7504 lbs. When Banda was taken by the English in 1796, the quantity of
                    spices in the warehouses amounted to 84,777 lbs. of nutmegs, and to 19,587 lbs.
                    of mace. In the several years of 1803, 1804, and 1805, when the Banda Islands
                    were in possession of Britain, there were imported of nutmegs 104,094, 117,936,
                    and 35,851 lbs., which were sold for L.46,233, L.54,733, and L.23,742. The
                    quantity retained for home consumption amounted on an average to 39,071 lbs. per
                    annum, and the revenue which they yielded to L.7879. The permanent duty levied
                    on nutmegs imported from any British possessions is 2s. 6d. per lb., and from
                    other parts 3s. 6d. per lb.</p>
                <p>Of mace, the quantity consumed in Britain has decreased since the establishment
                    of the East India Company. In the year 1615, the consumption amounted to 15,000
                    lbs. In 1803, when the islands were in possession of Britain, the whole quantity
                    amounted only to 24,234 lbs., and the total value was L.53,356. The quantity
                    retained for home consumption is on an average about 5400 lbs. per annum. The
                    duty on mace imported is 3s. 6d. per lb. when imported from any British colony;
                    from other parts it is 4s. 6d. Mace should be' chosen fresh,’rough, oleaginous,
                    of a fragrant smell, and a bright reddish yellow colour. The smaller pieces are
                    esteemed the best. (See Milburn’s <hi rend="italic">Oriental Commerce,</hi> and
