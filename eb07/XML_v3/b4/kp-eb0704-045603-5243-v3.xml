                    in Paris, distinguished by his knowledge of chemistry, and by his practical
                    application of that knowledge, was born at Senlis in 1728. He was the son of an
                    innkeeper, and was put as apprentice to the eminent chemist Geoffroy. He had not
                    received a regular school education; a defect that occasioned him many
                    difficulties in prosecuting his scientific researches, which he nevertheless did
                    with much ardour. In 1752 he was admitted a member of the College of Pharmacy;
                    soon after he was appointed professor of chemistry at that establishment; and in
                    his lectures he displayed the excellent arrangement which is seen in his
                    published works. He carried to a great extent his commercial establishment in
                    Paris for the preparation of drugs for medicine and the arts, such as the
                    acetate of lead, the muriate of tin, mercurial salts, and antimonial mixtures.
                    At the same time he published papers on the crystallization of salts, on the
                    phenomena of congelation, on those of fermentation, on the combinations and
                    preparations of sulphur, opium, mercury, boracic acid, platina, and Peruvian
                    bark, on the metallic oxides, the acetates of the alkalis, on emetic tartar, on
                    vegetable fecula, and on vegetable extracts. In consequence of these scientific
                    works, Baumé was elected a member of the Academy of Sciences. He wrote a great
                    many articles in the <hi rend="italic">Dictionnaire des Arts d Metiers,</hi> and
                    had previously published several technological papers; namely, on dyeing, on the
                    gilding of clockwork, on a method for extinguishing fires, on the mode of
                    keeping corn, on buildings of plaster, on soap-making, on clay, and on the
                    nature of soils fitted for agriculture. He made numerous experiments, along with
                    Macquer, for the purpose of fabricating in France a porcelain equal to the
                    Japanese. He established the first manufactory of salammoniac in France, a
                    substance which before that time had been obtained from Egypt. He was the first
                    who devised and set on foot a process for bleaching raw silk. Having acquired a
                    competency by the success of these different undertakings, he retired from
                    trade, and devoted his time to the application of chemistry to the arts. He
                    improved the process for dyeing scarlet at the manufactory of the Gobelins, and
                    published a cheap process for purifying saltpetre. He bestowed much time in
                    forming an areometer intended for general use; and published a process for
                    obtaining a mild fecula from the horse-chestnut. By the revolution he lost his
                    fortune, but was not thereby disheartened; for this calamity led him to resume
                    his trade. He was chosen a correspondent of the Institute in 1796, and died in
                    1804, at the age of seventy-six. He was tem∙ perate, regular in his habits, and
                    active. Many of his papers are published in the <hi rend="italic">Mémoires de
                    l’Académie des Sciences.</hi> Of his separate publications, the following may be
