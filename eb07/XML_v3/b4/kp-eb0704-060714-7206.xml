                    geographers. It extends from about 72. 10. to 75. 15. east longitude, and from
                    27. 40. to 29. 45. north latitude; and its superficial area probably amounts to
                    not less than 17,000 square miles. It is bounded on the north by a country
                    occupied by the Batties or people of Bat-neer; on the east by the territories of
                    Hurriana or Shck-hawuttee, in the province of Delhi; on the south-east by
                    Jeypour; on the south-west by Jesselmere; and on the west by Bahawulpoor. But
                    these may be deemed obscure limits, for the countries named in them are scarcely
                    better known than the subject of this article.</p><p>A vast proportion of the soil of Beykaneer is a barren sandy desert, or a hard
                    flat clay, sounding like a board under horses’ feet, and entirely destitute of
                    inhabitants, water, and vegetation. Many miles are occupied in hills and valleys
                    of loôse heavy sand; the former, from twenty to a hundred feet in height,
                    shifting their position and altering their shape according to the influence of
                    the wind; and, during the heats of summer, clouds of moving sand threaten to
                    overwhelm the traveller. Sometimes the phenomenon called <hi rend="italic">mirage</hi> is exhibited in this desert, being that species of optical
                    illusion, by which a spectator is induced to believe that he beholds a lake or a
                    wide river well defined before him, reflecting surrounding objects, while there
                    is nothing in view but a level uninterrupted surface.</p><p>Vegetation is exceedingly scanty throughout, except in a few patches, which are
                    skilfully and industriously cultivated; and the whole country seems to depend on
                    external supplies of grain. Nevertheless, in the midst of arid tracts, the
                    water-melon, a juicy fruit, grows in profusion, attaining the remarkable size of
                    three or four feet in circumference, from a stalk no larger than that of the
                    common melon. The seeds are sown by the natives, and also grow wild; but it is
                    difficult to account for such an enlargement of size with so little moisture.
                    Water seems to be obtained only at an immense depth. The wells at Beykaneer are
                    often from 300 to 345 feet in depth, yet not above three in diameter; they are
                    all lined with masonry; and one of the most curious objects in the city of
                    Beykancer is considered to be a well 300 feet deep, and fifteen or twenty in
                    diameter, worked by four pair of oxen drawing as many buckets of water. The
                    water is always brackish, scanty, and insalubrious; and this, combined with the
                    nature of the soil, principally occasions the prevalent sterility of the
                    country.</p><p>The wild ass, remarkable for its speed and its shyness, is found here, sometimes
                    solitary, but oftener in herds. At a kind of shuffling trot, peculiar to itself,
                    it will leave the best horses behind. Antelopes are seen in some parts; also
                    foxes, but smaller than those of Britain; and the desert rat is found in great
                    numbers, occasioning serious inconvenience to equestrians, from the holes it
                    makes where the ground is sufficiently solid. Of domesticated animals, horses,
                    bullocks, and camels, are in abundance; the last being kept in great herds for
                    various purposes. The horses brought from the vicinity of the Lacky Jungle, an
                    adjoining district, where they are reared on excellent pasture, and with the
                    strictest attention, are much prized. But the original breed was greatly
                    improved by the introduction of fine Persian horses, brought hither during the
                    successive invasions of Hindostan by Nadir Shah and other eastern potentates. At
                    present they bear very high prices, some of them bringing even L.250 sterling, a
                    large sum in a poor country. But some decrease in the extent and quality of the
                    breed has lately resulted from the impolitic conduct of the officers of the
                    rajah of Beykaneer, by whom the owners are compelled to sell them at an under
                    value. When purchased thus, the horses are sent on speculation to different
                    parts of the Indian peninsula.</p><p>We are little acquainted with the manners and customs of the inhabitants of this
                    country, otherwise than by their correspondence with those of the same tribes
                    disseminated elsewhere in India. The natives are divided into two principal
                    classes, Rajpoots and Jauts; the former the rulers, the latter the mass of the
                    people. The Jauts are of small stature, black, ill-looking, and bear strong
                    indications of poverty and wretchedness; the Rajpoots are stout and handsome,
                    with Jewish features, of haughty manners an indolent disposition, and greatly
                    addicted to intoxication with opium. It is doubtful whether the Rajpoots of
                    Beykaneer entertain those elevated and magnanimous sentiments so peculiar to
                    their tribe, whether they are animated by that high sense of honour and
                    impatience of indignity which, united to the violence of their passions, lead to
                    the most terrible catastrophes. When a man of rank finds himself beset by an
                    enemy, from whom he has no chance of escape, he inquires whether, by surrender,
                    he can preserve the honour of his family; should the answer be equivocal or
                    unfavourable, he clothes himself in yellow, the symbol of despair, and repairing
                    along with his nearest relatives to the apartments of the females, the whole are
                    involved in promiscuous destruction; nor is it uncommon, on such occasions, for
                    the women themselves to commit suicide. The Rajpoot then rushes furiously
                    against his enemies, and though he should be successful and prevail over them,
                    rather than survive his dire calamity he plunges his sword in his own breast.
                    The same sense of dishonour induces females of rank to deem themselves
                    contaminated by the gaze of any man but their most intimate relatives; and it
                    also leads them to ascend the funeral pile of their husbands, lest, by
                    survivance, they should lose the consideration of the world. The people of the
                    East, while more placid and resigned to fate, are, at the same time, agitated by
                    more acute and ungovernable passions than the inhabitants of the Western World.
                    A Mahommedan officer of high rank, who was hard pressed by a victorious enemy,
                    approaching the place where his wife and daughter had sought refuge on the banks
                    of a river, gave the following account of his conduct: “I leapt from my horse,
                    and seizing each by a hand, rushed with them into the water up to their waists,
                    and covered the rest of their persons with a cloth: I drew my sword to defend
                    them with my life from further insult, and, happily for my honour, their faces
                    were not seen by the eyes of a stranger.” Of late the Rajpoots of Beykaneer have
                    been accused of being cruel and treacherous.</p><p>The population of this territory is altogether uncertain; but, from the scarcity
                    of water, it is probably very much restricted. The inhabitants are dispersed in
                    towns and villages, of which Beykaneer, near the southern frontier, in about 27°
                    55' north latitude, the capital, and Churoo, on the eastern frontier, are the
                    principal. Beykaneer, surrounded by lofty white walls, strengthened with
                    numerous round towers crowned by battlements, presents the imposing picture of a
                    great and magnificent city in the midst of a wilderness. But on entering the
                    gates the illusion vanishes; and it is found to consist, for the most part, of
                    huts built of mud, and painted red. Nevertheless, there are some high houses,
                    several temples, and at one corner ι lofty and fine-looking fortress, a quarter
                    of a mile square, environed by a wall thirty feet high, and a good dry ditch.
                    The interior is a confused assemblage of towers and battlements, overtopped by
                    houses; and it contains the royal palace, a curious old edifice. Churoo,
                    independent of the suburbs, is above a mile and a half in circuit, and, althoug
                    situate among sand hills, has a handsome appearance. A the houses have terraces,
                    and are built of a pure win e limestone, like those of Beykaneer. Villages are
                    occasionally seen in the most dismal situations, to which their mi <pb break="no" facs="nls:193197232" xml:id="kp-eb0704-7232-0609"/>
                    serable aspect corresponds. They consist of a few round huts of straw, with low
                    walls, and conical roofs like little stacks of corn, and surrounded by hedges of
                    thorny branches stuck in the sand. A modern traveller, describing the town of
                    Pooggul, observes, “If I could present to my reader the foreground of high sand
                    hills, the village of straw huts, the clay walls of the little fort going to
                    ruins, as the soil which supported them was blown away by the winds, and the sea
                    of sand which formed the rest of the prospect, he would probably feel, as I did,
                    a sort of wonder at the people who could reside in so dismal a wilderness, and
                    of horror at the life to which they seemed to be condemned.” The city of
                    Beykaneer is said to stand 219 miles north-west of Delhi, but its real position
                    is southwest, and we conceive the distance to be not less than 260 or 280 miles.
                    Fortresses are not so common in this territory as in a large portion of
                    Hindostan, owing to the equality of the surface.</p><p>Scarcely any thing definite can be said regarding the occupation and pursuits of
                    the people in their trade and manufactures. Cattle of an inferior breed, and
                    horses, are the only exports; rice, sugar, opium, and indigo, are obtained from
                    the Punjab; salt from Samber; wheat from Jeypour; and spices, copper, and coarse
                    cloth, are imported from Jesselmere.</p><p>Beykaneer is governed by a rajah, who is a sovereign and independent prince,
                    though he seems formerly to have been tributary to the monarch of Delhi, and
                    even acknowledged the supremacy of Britain when Delhi had fallen under a foreign
                    power. He enjoys an absolute sway over the lives and property of his subjects,
                    and maintains considerable state in his reception of strangers. His revenues do
                    not exceed L.50,000 per annum, though occasionally augmented to nearly double
                    that sum by vexatious imposts on merchandise <hi rend="italic">in transitu.</hi>
                    The consequence is, that those caravans which were accustomed to take the route
                    of this province from Surat to Tatta, a town on the Indus, follow another
                    course, in order to avoid such exactions. The resources of Beykaneer are thus
                    very small, which is not surprising, considering they are derived from a country
                    that becomes an absolute desert even within a few yards of the capital. The
                    forces amount to about 10,000 men, of whom 2000 are cavalry, and these troops
                    are paid by assignments of land. The rajah Soorut Sing having profusely
                    dissipated the treasure accumulated by his predecessors, became cruel and
                    tyrannical. Oppressive exactions to relieve pressing necessities alienated the
                    regard of his subjects, and an army of mercenaries became necessary to preserve
                    his authority. He was suspected of poisoning an elder brother, and undoubtedly
                    murdered the envoy of another prince passing through his dominions. Yet, being
                    strict in his external devotions, and religiously abstaining from prohibited
                    food, his people have admitted him to the character of sanctity. The sovereign
                    of Beykaneer has to contend with many enemies, who, in their turn, are opposed
                    by the most powerful obstacles. Water must be earned by an invading army; for
                    the natives either poison the wells, fill them up, or cover them over in such a
                    manner that they cannot possibly be found; and, besides, they <hi rend="superscript"> n</hi><hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi><hi rend="superscript">
                    ux</hi> arsenic with bread, which is insidiously disposed of in the hostile
                    camp. A number of years ago, George Thomas, <hi rend="superscript"> a</hi>
                    celebrated adventurer, who raised himself to the government of a neighbouring
                    territory, invaded Beykaneer, ≡nd compelled the rajah to purchase peace with
                    L.25,000. He also aided the Batties in expelling him, on occasion of an
                    incursion he had made into their country. More recently, a war having commenced
                    between the rajahs of Joudpour and Jeypour contending for the hand of an eastern
                    princess, the interference of Soorut Sing excited the <hi rend="superscript">
                    wr</hi> ath of some of the competitors against himself. Five different armies
                    invaded Beykaneer in 1808, when the rajah filled up all the wells within ten
                    miles of the walls of his capital. The contest was protracted for a considerable
                    time, but the rajah succeeded in maintaining himself as an independent prince.
                    His existence as such was further secured to him by his being admitted, in 1818,
                    within the line of British protection.</p><p>See Franklin’s <hi rend="italic">Memoirs of General Thomas;</hi> Scott’s <hi rend="italic">Memoirs of Eradut Khan;</hi> Franklin’s <hi rend="italic">Tracts;</hi> Elphinstone’s <hi rend="italic">Account of Cabul.</hi></p></div></body></text></TEI>
