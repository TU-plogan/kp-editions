                    sacrament by which a person is initiated into the Christian church. The word is
                    drived from the Greek <hi rend="italic">βαπτf</hi><hi rend="italic subscript">

                    ecclesiastical writers by divers other names and titles. Sometimes it is called
                    <hi rend="italic">palingenesia,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">regeneration;</hi>
                    sometimes <hi rend="italic">salus,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">life and

                    administered to departing persons; sometimes <hi rend="italic">sacerdotium
                    laici,</hi> or the <hi rend="italic">lay priesthood,</hi> because allowed, in
                    cases of necessity, to be conferred by laymen; sometimes it is called the <hi rend="italic">great circumcision,</hi> because it was imagined to succeed in the
                    room of circumcision, and to be a seal of the Christian covenant, as
                    circumcision was the seal of the covenant made with Abraham. In respect that
                    baptism had Christ for its author, and not man, it was anciently known by the
                    name of <hi rend="italic">δωgoν</hi> and <hi rend="italic">γαpδμα Kυξ∣oυ, the
                    gift of the Lord;</hi> sometimes it was simply called δωgov, without any other
                    addition, by way of eminence, because it was both a gratuitous and singular gift
                    of Christ. In reference to the making men complete members of Christ’s body, the
                    church, it had the name of τfλi∕ωo ’ ∕i, and nλε∕η, the <hi rend="italic">consecration</hi> and <hi rend="italic">consummation,</hi> because it gave men
                    the perfection of Christians, and a right to partake of <hi rend="italic                     smallcaps"> to</hi> τελε∕ov, which was <hi rend="italic">the Lords Supper.</hi>
                    It had also the name of <hi rend="italic">μυrβις,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">μυσταγωγία,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">irìu tiation,</hi> because it was the
                    admittance of men to all the sacred rites and mysteries of the Christian
                    religion.</p><p>Baptism has been supposed by many learned authors to have had its origin in the
                    Jewish church, iñ which, as they maintain, it was the practice long before
                    Christ’s time to baptize proselytes or converts to their faith, as part of the
                    ceremony of admission; and this practice, according to some, obtains among them
                    to this day, a person turning Jew being first circumcised, and, when healed,
                    bathed or baptized in water, in presence of the rabbin, after which he is
                    reputed a good Jew. Others, however, insist that the Jewish proselyte baptism is
                    not by far so ancient; and that John the Baptist was the first administrator of
                    baptism among the Jews. Of this opinion were Deylingius, J, G. Carpzovius,
                    Boernerus, Werns-dorfius, Zeltnerus, Owen, Knatchbull, Jennings, Gill, and
                    others.</p><p>Grotius is of opinion that the rite of baptism derives its origin from the time
                    of the Deluge, immediately after which, he thinks, it was instituted in memory
                    of the world having been purged by water. Some learned men think it was added to
                    circumcision soon after the Samaritan schism, as a mark of distinction to the
                    orthodox Jews. Spencer, who is fond of deriving the rites of the Jewish religion
                    from the ceremonies of the Pagans, lays it down as a probable supposition, that
                    the Jews received the baptism of proselytes from the neighbouring nations, who
                    were wont to prepare candidates for the more sacred functions of their religion
                    by a solemn ablution, that, by this affinity of sacred rites, they might draw
                    the Gentiles to embrace their religion, and that the proselytes, in the gaining
                    of whom they were extremely diligent, might the more easily comply with the
                    transition from Gentilism to <pb break="no" facs="nls:193193904" xml:id="kp-eb0704-3904-0353"/>Judaism. In confirmation of this opinion, he
                    observes, first, that there is no divine precept for the baptism of proselytes,
                    God having enjoined only the rite of circumcision for the admission of strangers
                    into the Jewish religion; and secondly, he contends, that, among foreign
                    nations, the Egyptians, Persians, Greeks, Romans, and others, it was customary
                    for those who were to be initiated into their mysteries or sacred rites, to be
                    first purified by dipping the whole body in water. The same learned writer adds,
                    as a further confirmation of his opinion, that the cup of blessing, added to the
                    paschal supper, seems likewise to have been derived from a pagan original; as
                    the Greeks at their feasts had one cup called <hi rend="italic">ποrng∕av αγα3ου
                    δaιμovoς, the cup of the good demon or god·,</hi> which they drank at the
                    conclusion of their entertainment when the table was removed. Since, then, a
                    rite of Gentile origin was added to one of the Jewish sacraments, namely, the
                    passover, there can be no absurdity, he thinks, in supposing that baptism, which
                    was added to the other sacrament, namely circumcision, might be derived from the
                    same source. In the last place, he observes, that Christ, in the institution of
                    his sacraments, paid a peculiar regard to those rites which were borrowed from
                    the Gentiles; for, rejecting circumcision and the paschal supper, he adopted
                    into his religion baptism and the sacred cup; thus preparing the way for the
                    conversion and reception of the Gentiles into his church.</p><p>The design of the Jewish baptism, if baptism was practised by them, is supposed
                    to have been to import a regeneration, whereby the proselyte was rendered a new
                    man, and from being a slave became free. The effect of it was, to cancel all
                    former relations; so that those who were before akin to the person, after the
                    ceremony ceased to be so. It is to this ceremony Christ is supposed to have
                    alluded, in his expression to Nicoemus, that it was necessary that he should be
                    born again, in order to become his disciple. The necessity of baptism to
                    salvation is grounded on these two sayings of our Saviour, “He that believeth,
                    and is baptized, shall be saved ;” and “Except a man be born of water and of the
                    Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.” The ancients did not generally
                    think the mere want of baptism, where the procuring of it was impracticable,
                    excluded men absolutely from the hopes of eternal salvation. Some few of them,
                    indeed, are pretty severe upon infants dying without baptism; and others seem
                    also, in general terms, to deny eternal life to adult persons dying unbaptized.
                    But when they interpret themselves, and speak more distinctly, they make some
                    allowances, and specially except several cases in which the want of baptism may
                    be supplied by other means. Such is martyrdom, which commonly goes by the name
                    of “second baptism in men’s own blood” in the writings of the ancients, because
                    of the power and efficacy it was thought to have m saving men by the invisible
                    baptism of the Spirit, without the external element of water. Faith and
                    repentance were also esteemed a supplement to the want of baptism, in such
                    catechumens as died whilst they were piously preparing themselves for baptism.
                    Constantly communicating with, the church was also thought to supply the want of
                    baptism to persons who had been admitted to communion on a presumption of their
                    having been duly baptized, though the contrary afterwards appeared. For infants
                    dying without baptism, the case was thought more dangerous; as here, no personal
                    faith, repentance, or the <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> ke, could be pleaded,
                    to supply the defect, and to wash away original sin. On this account, they who
                    spoke most avourably of them, as Gregory Nazianzen, and Severus, ιshop of
                    Antioch, only assigned them a middle state, neither in heaven nor hell. But the
                    Latins, as St Augus- <hi rend="superscript"> ιn</hi>, fulgentius, Marius
                    Mercator, and others, who never admitted the opinion of a middle state,
                    concluded, that, as they could not be received into heaven, they must go ' to
                    hell. Pelagius and his followers, who denied original sin, asserted that they
                    might be admitted to eternal life and salvation, although not to the kingdom of
                    heaven; between which a distinction was made. Where the fault lay not on the
                    side of the child, nor his parents, but on that of the minister, or where any
                    unavoidable accident rendered baptism absolutely impossible, Hinemar and others
                    made an exception, holding that the child might in that case be saved without
                    baptism.</p><p>The receiving of baptism is not limited to any time, nor to any age of life. Some
                    contend for its being administered like circumcision, precisely on the eighth
                    day, as Gregory Nazianzen; while others would have it deferred till the child is
                    three years of age, and able to hear the mystic words, and make answer thereto,
                    though he do not understand them. In the canon law we find divers injunctions
                    against deferring the baptism of infants beyond certain days, as the ninth,
                    thirtieth, and thirty-seventh, some of them involving pecuniary forfeitures in
                    case of disobedience.</p><p>Salmasius, and Suiccrus after him, deliver it as authentic history, that for the
                    first two ages no one received baptism who was not first instructed in the faith
                    and doctrine of Christ, so as to be able to answer for himself that he believed;
                    and this by reason of the words, “He that believeth and is baptized which in
                    effect is to say, that no infant, for the first two ages, was ever admitted to
                    Christian baptism. They own, however, that paedobap-tism afterwards came in,
                    upon the opinion that baptism was necessary to salvation. But Vossius, Dr
                    Forbes, Dr Hammond, Mr Walker, and especially Mr Wall, who has exactly
                    considered the testimony and authority of almost every ancient writer who has
                    said any thing upon this subject, endeavour to evince that infants were baptized
                    even in the apostolical age; and it is certain that Tertullian pleads strongly
                    against giving baptism to infants; which at least shows that there was some such
                    practice in his age, though he disapproved of it. But the ordinary subjects of
                    this sacrament in the first ages were converts from Judaism and Gentilism, who,
                    before they could be admitted to baptism, were obliged to spend some time in the
                    state of catechumens, to qualify them for making their professions of faith and
                    a Christian life, in their own persons; for, without such personal professions,
                    there was ordinarily no admission of them to the privilege of baptism. Those
                    baptized ’n their sick beds were called <hi rend="italic">clinici,</hi> and held
                    in some reproach, as not being reputed good Christians; and hence we meet with
                    several censures of clinic baptism in councils and ecclesiastical writers. But
                    this clinic baptism was not sufficient to qualify the person, in case of
                    recovery, for ordination. Some had their baptism put off by way of punishment,
                    when they fell into gross and scandalous crimes, which were only to be expiated
                    by a long course of discipline and repentance. This sometimes included five,
                    ten, twenty, or more years; in particular cases the whole of life to the very
                    hour of death, when very flagrant crimes had been committed.</p><p>In the earliest ages of the church, there was no stated time or place for the
                    reception of baptism. Afterwards, Easter, Whitsuntide, and Epiphany, became
                    solemn seasons, out of which baptism was not administered, except in cases of
                    necessity. The catechumens who were to receive it at these times were called <hi rend="italic">competentes</hi><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> ;</hi> and it is to
                    these that St Cyril addresses his catecheses. In the apostolical age, and some
                    time after, before churches and baptisteries were generally erected, they
                    baptized in any place where they had convenience; for example, John baptized in
                    Jordan, Philip baptized the eunuch in the <pb break="no" facs="nls:193193917" xml:id="kp-eb0704-3917-0354"/>wilderness, and
                    Paul baptized the jailer in his own house. But in after-ages baptisteries were
                    built adjoining to the churches; and then rules were made that baptism should
                    ordinarily be administered nowhere except in these buildings. Justinian, in one
                    of his novels, refers to ancient laws appointing that none of the sacred
                    mysteries of the church should be celebrated in private houses.. Men might have
                    private oratories for prayer in their own houses; but they were not to
                    administer baptism or the eucharist in them, unless by a particular license from
                    the bishop of the place. Such baptisms are frequently condemned in the ancient
                    councils, under the name <hi rend="italic">π</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">αgα∕3aπ</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">- τιSμaτα, baptisms in private
                    conventicles.</hi></p><p>As to the attendant ceremonies and manner of baptism in the ancient church, the
                    person to be baptized, if an adult, was first examined by the bishop or
                    officiating priest, who put some questions to him; as, first, whether he abjured
                    the devil and all his works, and, secondly, whether he gave a firm assent to all
                    the articles of the Christian faith; to each of which he answered in the
                    affirmative. If the person to be baptized was an infant, these interrogatories
                    were answered by his <hi rend="italic">sponsores</hi> or godfathers. Whether the
                    use of sponsors was as old as the days of the apostles is uncertain; the
                    probability is it was not, since Justin Martyr, speaking of the method and form
                    of baptism, says not a word of them. After the questions and answers, followed
                    exorcism, the manner and end of which was this: The minister laid his hands on
                    the person’s head, and breathed in his face, implying thereby the driving away
                    or expelling of the devil, and preparing the convert for baptism, by which the
                    good and holy spirit was to be conferred upon him. After exorcism followed
                    baptism itself. And, first of all, the minister, by prayer, consecrated the
                    water for that purpose. Tertullian says, “any waters may be applied to that use;
                    but then God must be first invocated; on which the Holy Ghost presently comes
                    down from heaven, and moves upon them, and sanctifies them.” The waters having
                    been consecrated, the person was baptized “in the name of the Father, and of the
                    Son, and of the Holy Ghost ;” by which “dedication of him to the blessed
                    Trinity, the person,” says Clemens Alexandrinus, “is delivered from that corrupt
                    trinity, the devil, the world, and the flesh.” In performing the ceremony of
                    baptism, the usual custom, except in clinical cases, or where there was scarcity
                    of water, was to immerse the whole body. Thus St Barnabas, describing a baptized
                    person, says, “We go down into the water full of sin and filth, but we ascend
                    bearing fruit in our hearts.” And this practice of immersing the whole body was
                    so general, that we find no exception made from respect either to the tenderness
                    of infants or the bashfulness of the other sex, unless in case of sickness or
                    disability. But, to prevent any indecency, men and women were baptized apart; to
                    which end, either the baptisteries were divided into two apartments, one for the
                    men, the other for the women, as Bingham has observed; or the men were baptized
                    at one time and the women at another, as is shown by Vossius, from the <hi rend="italic">Ordo Romanus,</hi> Gregory’s <hi rend="italic">Sacramentarium</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> i</hi> and other authorities. Add to this, that
                    there was anciently an order of deaconesses, one part of whose business was to
                    assist at the baptism of women. These precautions, however, rather indicate a
                    scrupulous attention to delicacy, than imply any indecency in the circumstance
                    of immersion itself. From the circumstance of candidates being immersed,
                    however, there is no reason to infer that immersion was made in a state of
                    nudity. The present Baptists never baptize naked, though they always immerse.
                    After immersion followed the unction; by which, according to St Cyril, was
                    signified that they were now cut off from the wild olive, and were ingrafted
                    into Christ, the true olive tree; or else to show that they were now to be
                    champions for the gospel, and were anointed thereto, as the old athletae were
                    for their solemn games. With this anointing was joined the sign of the cross,
                    made upon the forehead of the person baptized; which being done, he had a white
                    garment given him, to denote his being washed from the defilements of sin, or in
                    allusion to that of the apostle, <hi rend="italic">“As</hi> many as are baptized
                    in Christ have put on Christ.” From this custom the feast of Pentecost, which
                    was one of the annual seasons of baptism, came to be called <hi rend="italic">White-Sunday</hi> or Whitsunday. The garment in question was afterwards laid up
                    in the church, that it might be an evidence against such persons as violated or
                    denied that faith which they had owned in baptism. When the baptism was
                    performed, the person baptized, according to Justin Martyr, “was received into
                    the number of the faithful, who then sent up their public prayers to God for all
                    men, for themselves, and for those who had been baptized.”</p><p>The ordinary ministers, who had the right of administering this sacrament, that
                    is, of applying the water to the body, and pronouncing the formula, were
                    presbyters or bishops; but on extraordinary occasions laymen were admitted to
                    perform the same.</p><p>The present form of administering baptism in the church of Rome is as follows
                    :—When a child is to be baptized, the persons who bring it wait at the door of
                    the church for the priest, who comes thither in his surplice and purple stole,
                    attended by his clerks. He begins with questioning the godfathers, whether they
                    promise, in the child’s name, to live and die in the true Catholic and Apostolic
                    faith, and what name they would give the child. Then follows an exhortation to
                    the sponsors; after which the priest, calling the child by its name, asks, “What
                    dost thou demand of the church ?” The godfather answers, “Eternal life.” The
                    priest proceeds: “If you are desirous of obtaining eternal life, keep God’s
                    commandments, thou shalt love the Lord thy God,” &amp;c.; after which he
                    breathes three times in the child’s face, saying, “Come out of this child, thou
                    evil spirit, and make room for the Holy Ghost.” Then he makes the sign of the
                    cross on the child’s forehead and breast, saying, “Receive the sign of the cross
                    on thy forehead and in thy heart;” upon which, taking off his cap, he repeats a
                    short prayer, and laying his hand gently on the child’s head, repeats a second
                    prayer; then he blesses some salt, and, putting a little of it into the child’s
                    mouth, pronounces these words, “Receive the salt of wisdom.” All this is
                    performed at the church door. The priest, with the godfathers and godmothers,
                    coming into the church, and advancing towards the font, repeat the apostles’
                    creed and the Lord’s prayer. Arrived at the font, the priest exorcises the evil
                    spirit again; and taking a little of his own spittle, with the thumb of his
                    right hand rubs it on the child’s ears and nostrils, repeating, as he touches
                    the right ear, the same word, <hi rend="italic">Ephatha, be thou opened,</hi>
                    which our Saviour made use of to the man born deaf and dumb. Lastly, they pull
                    off its swaddling-clothes, or strip it below the shoulders, during which the
                    priest prepares the oil. The sponsors then hold the child directly over the
                    font, observing to turn it due east and west; whereupon the priest asks the
                    child, “whether he renounces the devil and all his works ;” and the godfather
                    having answered in the affirm- ∙ative, the priest anoints the child between the
                    shoulders in the form of a cross; then taking some of the consecrated water, he
                    pours part of it thrice on the child’s head, at each perfusion calling on one of
                    the persons of the Holy Trinity. The priest concludes the ceremony of baptism
                    with an exhortation. It may be added, that the Romish church allows midwives, in
                    cases of danger, to baptizθ a <pb break="no" facs="nls:193193930" xml:id="kp-eb0704-3930-0355"/>child before it comes entirely out of its mother’s
                    womb; but it is to be observed, that as some part of the body of the child must
                    appear before it can be baptized, it is baptized on that which first appears; if
                    it be the head, it is not necessary to rebaptize the child; but if only a foot
                    or hand appears, baptism must be repeated. A still-born child thus baptized may
                    be buried in consecrated ground.</p><p>The Greek church differs from the Romish as to the rite of baptism, chiefly in
                    performing it by immersion, or plunging the infant all over in the water.</p><p>The forms of administering baptism among us being too well known to require a
                    particular description, we shall only mention one or two of the more material
                    differences between the form as it stood in the first liturgy of King Edward,
                    and that in the English Common Prayer Book at present. First, the form of
                    consecrating the water did not make a part of the office in King Edward’s
                    liturgy, as it does in the present, because the water in the font was changed
                    and consecrated but once a month. The form itself likewise was something
                    different from that now used, and was introduced with a short prayer, that Jesus
                    Christ, upon whom (when he was baptized) the Holy Ghost came down in the
                    likeness of a dove, would send down the same Holy Spirit, to sanctify the
                    fountain of baptism; which prayer was afterwards left out at the second review.
                    By King Edward’s first book the minister was required to dip the child in the
                    water thrice; first, the right side; secondly, the left; and, lastly, the face
                    toward the foot. This triple immersion was a very ancient practice in the
                    Christian church, and used in honour of the Holy Trinity; though some later
                    writers say that it was done to represent the death, burial, and resurrection of
                    Christ, together with his three days’ continuance in the grave. But afterwards,
                    when the Arians made an improper use of it, persuading the people that it
                    denoted a distinct substantiality of the three persons in the Trinity, the
                    orthodox left it off and used only one single immersion.</p><p>By the first common prayer of King Edward, after the child was baptized, the
                    godfathers and godmothers were to lay their hands upon it, and the minister was
                    to put on him the white vestment, commonly called the <hi rend="italic">chrysome,</hi> and to say, “Take this white vesture as a token of the innocency
                    which, by God’s grace, in this holy sacrament of baptism, is given unto thee,
                    and for a sign whereby thou art admonished, so long as thou livest, to give
                    thyself to innocence of living, that after this transitory life thou mayest be
                    partaker of the life everlasting.” As soon as he had pronounced these words he
                    was to anoint the infant on the head, saying, “Almighty God, the father of our
                    Lord Jesus Christ, who hath regenerated thee by water and the Holy Ghost, and
                    hath given unto thee remission of all thy sins, may he vouchsafe to anoint thee
                    with the unction of his Holy Spirit, and bring thee to the inheritance of
                    everlasting life.”</p><p>The custom of sprinkling children instead of dipping them in the font, which at
                    first was allowed in case of the weakness or sickness of the infant, has so far
                    prevailed that immersion is now quite excluded. What principally tended to
                    confirm the practice of affusion or sprinkling was, that several of our
                    Protestant divines flying into Germany and Switzerland during the bloody reign
                    of Queen Mary, and returning home when Queen Elizabeth came to the crown,
                    brought back with them a great zeal for the Protestant churches beyond sea where
                    they had been sheltered and received; and having observed that at Geneva and
                    other places baptism was administered by sprinkling, they thought they could not
                    do the church of England a greater piece of service than by introducing a
                    practice dictated by so great an authority as Calvin. This, together with the
                    coldness of our northern climate, was what contributed to banish entirely the
                    practice of immersing infants in the font.</p><p>The different notions which have been entertained concerning the effects of
                    baptism, it would be endless to enumerate. The Remonstrants and Socinians reduce
                    baptism to a mere sign of divine grace. The Romanists, on the contrary, exalt
                    its power, holding, that thereby all sin is entirely taken away by it; that it
                    absolutely confers justification, and consequently grace <hi rend="italic">ex
                    opere operato.</hi> Some also speak of an indelible character impressed on the
                    soul by it, called <hi rend="italic">character dominicus,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">character regius;</hi> but others hold this a mere chimera,
                    maintaining that the spiritual character conferred in regeneration may easily be
                    effaced by mortal sins. Dodwell contends that it is by baptism that the soul is
                    made immortal, and that those who die without it cannot rise again; but he
                    limits this effect to episcopal baptism alone. From the effects ordinarily
                    ascribed to baptism, even by ancient writers, it would seem that the ceremony is
                    as much of heathen as Jewish origin, since Christians do not restrain the use of
                    it, like the Jews, to the admission of new members into the church, but hold,
                    with the heathens, that it contains a virtue for remitting and washing away
                    sins. The Brahmins are still said to baptize with this latter view at certain
                    seasons in the river Ganges, to the waters of which they ascribe a cleansing or
                    sanctifying quality; and hence it is that people flock from all parts, even of
                    Tartary, in expectation of being thus eased of their load of sins. But in this
                    point many Christians seem to have gone beyond the folly of the heathens. It was
                    only the smaller sins of infirmity which these latter held to be expiable by
                    washing; for crimes of a blacker dye, they allowed, no water could efface, no
                    purgation discharge them. The Christian doctrine of a total remission of sins by
                    baptism could not fail, therefore, to scandalize many amongst the heathen, and
                    furnished the apostate Julian with an occasion for ridiculing Christianity
                    itself: “Whoever,” says he, “is guilty of rapes, murders, sacrilege, or any
                    abominable crime, let him be washed with water, and he will become pure and
                    holy.”</p><p>In the ancient church, baptism was frequently conferred on Jews by violence; but
                    the church itself never seems to have allowed of force on this occasion. By a
                    canon of the fourth council of Toledo, it is expressly forbidden to baptize any
                    one against his or her will. That which looks most like force in this case is to
                    be found in two orders of Justinian; one of which appoints the heathen, and the
                    other the Samaritans, to be baptized, with their wives and children and
                    servants, under pain of confiscation. By the ancient laws, baptism was not to be
                    conferred on imagemakers, stage-players, gladiators, <hi rend="italic">aurigae</hi> or public drivers, magicians, or even strolling beggars, until
                    they quitted such professions. Slaves were not allowed the privilege of baptism
                    without the testimony and consent of their masters; excepting the slaves of
                    Jews, heathens, and heretics, who were not only admitted to baptism, but, in
                    consequence of the rite, had their freedom conferred on them.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Baptism by Fire,</hi> spoken of by John the Baptist, has given
                    rise to much conjecture. The generality of the fathers held that believers,
                    before they enter paradise, must pass through a certain fire, which is to purify
                    them from all pollutions remaining unexpiated. But some, with St Basil,
                    understand it of the fire of hell; others, of that of tribulation and
                    temptation; while a few, with St Chrysostom, will have it to denote an abundance
                    of graces. Some suppose it to mean the descent of the Holy Ghost on the
                    apostles, in the form of fiery tongues; others maintain, that the word <hi rend="italic">fire</hi> here is an interpolation, and that we are only to read
                    the text, “He that shall come after me will baptize you with the Holy Ghost.”

                    The ancient Selucians and Hermians, understanding the ' passage literally,
                    maintained that material fire was necessary in the administration of baptism.
                    But we do not find how or to what part of the body they applied it, or whether
                    they were satisfied with obliging the person baptized to pass through the fire.
                    Valentinus rebaptized all who had received water-baptism, and conferred on them
                    the baptism of fire.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Bis

                    says that some applied a red-hot iron to the ears of the person baptized, as if
                    to impress some mark upon him.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Baptism of the Dead,</hi> a custom which anciently prevailed
                    among some people in Africa, of giving baptism to the dead. The third council of
                    Carthage speak of it as a thing which ignorant Christians were fond of. Gregory
                    Nazianzen also takes notice of the same superstitious opinion prevailing among
                    some who delayed to be baptized. In his address to this kind of men, he asks,
                    whether they stayed to be baptized after death. Philastrius also notices it as
                    the general error of the Montanists or Cataphrygians, that they baptized men
                    after death. The practice seems to have been grounded on a vain opinion, that
                    when men had neglected to receive baptism in their life-time, some compensation
                    might be made for this default by receiving it after death.</p><p>Baptism of the dead was also a sort of vicarious baptism, formerly in use, when,
                    in the case of a person dying without baptism, another was baptized in his
                    stead. This, St Chrysostom tells us, was practised among the Marcionites with a
                    great deal of ridiculous ceremony. When a catechumen happened to die, they hid a
                    living man under the bed of the deceased: then coming to the dead man, they
                    asked him whether he would receive baptism; and he making no reply, the other
                    answered for him, and said he would be baptized in his stead; and so they
                    baptized the living for the dead. Epiphanius assures us the like was also
                    practised amongst the Corinthians. This practice they pretended to found on the
                    Apostle’s authority, alleging that text of St Paul for it, “If the dead rise not
                    at all, what shall they do who are baptized for the dead ?” a text which has
                    given occasion to a great variety of different systems and explications. Vossius
                    enumerates no less than nine different opinions among learned divines concerning
                    the sense of the phrase, being “baptized for the dead.”</p><p><hi rend="italic">Hypothetical Baptism</hi> was that formerly administered in
                    certain doubtful cases, with the formula, “If thou art baptized, I do not
                    rebaptize; if thou art not, I baptize thee in the name of the Father,” &amp;c.
                    This sort of baptism, enjoined by some ancient constitutions of the English
                    church, has now fallen into disuse.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Solemn Baptism</hi> was that conferred at stated seasons. Such,
                    in the ancient church, were the paschal baptism, and that at Whitsuntide. This
                    is sometimes also called general baptism.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Lay Baptism</hi> we find to have been permitted both by the
                    common prayer-book of King Edward and by that of Queen Elizabeth, when an infant
                    is in immediate danger of death, and a lawful minister cannot be had. This was
                    founded upon the mistaken notion of the impossibility of salvation without the
                    sacrament of baptism; but afterwards, when they came to have clearer notions of
                    the sacraments, it was unanimously resolved, in a convocation held in the year
                    1575, that even private baptism, in a case of necessity, was only to be
                    administered by a lawful minister.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Baptism</hi> is also applied abusively to certain ceremonies
                    used in giving names to things inanimate. The an cients knew nothing of the
                    custom of giving baptism to inanimate things, as bells, ships, and the like, by
                    a superstitious consecration of them. The first notice we have of this is in the
                    capitulars of Charles the Great,, where it is mentioned with censure; but
                    afterwards it crept by degrees into the Roman offices. Baronius carries its
                    antiquity no higher than the year 968, when the great bell of the church of
                    Lateran was christened by Pope John III, At last it grew to such superstitious
                    height as to form a ground of complaint in the <hi rend="italic">Centum
                    Gravamina</hi> of the German nation, drawn up in the public diet of the empire
                    held at Nuremberg in the year 1581; where, after describing the ceremony of
                    baptizing a bell, with godfathers, who made responses as in baptism, and gave it
                    a name, and clothed it with a new garment as Christians were used to be clothed
                    withal, and all this to make it capable of driving away tempests and devils,
                    they conclude against it as not only a superstitious practice, but contrary to
                    the Christian religion, and a mere seduction of the simple people.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
