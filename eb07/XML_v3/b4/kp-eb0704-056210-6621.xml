                    Lambertini of Bologna), celebrated for his learning and moderation, which gained
                    him the esteem of all Protestants. He was the patron of learned men and
                    celebrated artists, and an elaborate writer on theological subjects. His works
                    fill 12 vols. in folio. He died in 1758.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Benedict, St,</hi> the founder of the order of the
                    Benedictine monks, was born in Italy about <hi rend="smallcaps">a. d.</hi> 480.
                    He was sent to Rome when he was very young, and there received the first part of
                    his education. At fourteen years of age he was removed from this to Sublaco,
                    about forty miles distant. Here he lived a most ascetic life, having shut
                    himself up in a cavern, where nobody knew any thing of him except St Romanus,
                    who used to descend to him by a rope, and to supply him with provisions. But
                    being afterwards discovered by the monks of a neighbouring monastery, they chose
                    him for their abbot. Their manners, however, not agreeing with those of
                    Benedict, he returned to his solitude, whither many persons followed him, and
                    put themselves under his direction; so that in a short time he was enabled to
                    build twelve monasteries. In the year 528 or 529 he retired to Mount Cassino,
                    where idolatry was still prevalent, a temple of Apollo having been erected
                    there. He instructed the people in the adjacent country, and, having converted
                    them, broke in pieces the image of Apollo, and built two chapels on the
                    mountain. Here he also founded a monastery, and instituted the order of his
                    name, which in time became so famous, and extended itself all over Europe. In
                    this place, too, he composed his <hi rend="italic">Regula Monachorum,</hi> which
                    Gregory the Great speaks of as the most sensible and best written piece of the
                    kind ever published. The period of his death is uncertain. He was looked upon as
                    the Elisha of his time, and is reported to have wrought a great number of
                    miracles, which are recorded in the second book of the Dialogues of St Gregory
                    the Great.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Benedict,</hi> abbot of Peterborough, was educated at
                    Oxford, became a monk in the monastery of Christ Church in Canterbury, and was
                    some time afterwards chosen prior by the members of that society. Although he
                    had been a great admirer of Archbishop Becket, and wrote a life of that prelate,
                    he was so much esteemed by Henry II., that, by the influence of that prince, he
                    was elected abbot of Peterborough <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> 1177. He
                    assisted at the coronation of Richard I. in 1189, and was appointed keeper of
                    the great seal in 1191. But he did not long enjoy this high dignity, as he died
                    on Michaelmas day 1193. Besides his life of Archbishop Becket, he composed a
                    History of Henry II. and Richard L, from 1170 to 1192. A beautiful edition of
                    this work was published at Oxford, in two volumes, by Mr Hearne, A. <hi rend="smallcaps">d.</hi> 1735.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
