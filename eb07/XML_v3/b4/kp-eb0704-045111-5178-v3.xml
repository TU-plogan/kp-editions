                    Battle</hi></label>, in English law, a species of trial of great antiquity, but
                    now abrogated by positive statute. It seems to have owed its origin to the
                    military genius of our ancestors, joined to a superstitious notion that Heaven
                    would interpose, and give the victory to him who had the right. The decision of
                    suits, by an appeal to the God of battles, is believed by some to have been
                    invented by the Burgundians, one of the northern or German clans who established
                    themselves in Gaul; and it is certain that the earliest written injunction of
                    judiciary combats to be found is in the laws of Gundebal, which are preserved in
                    the Burgundian code. Yet it does not seem <pb break="no" facs="nls:193195191"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0704-5191-0452"/>to have been merely a local custom peculiar to
                    particular tribes, but the common usage of all those warlike nations from the
                    earliest times. From a passage in Velleius Paterculus, it appears that the
                    Germans, when they first became known to the Romans, were accustomed to decide
                    all contests of right by the sword; for when Quintilius Varus endeavoured to
                    introduce among them the Roman laws and method of trial, it was looked upon,
                    says the historian, as a <hi rend="italic">novitas incognitae disciplinée, ut
                    solita armis de~ cerni jure terminarentur:</hi> and among the ancient Goths in
                    Sweden we find the practice of judicial duels established upon much the same
                    footing as they formerly were in our own country.</p>
                <p>This species of trial was introduced into England, along with other Norman
                    customs, by William the Conqueror: but it was only used in three cases; first,
                    in the court martial, or court of chivalry and honour; secondly, in appeals of
                    felony; and thirdly, upon issue joined in a writ of right, the last and most
                    solemn decision of real property. In the two former cases this method of trial
                    may seem natural enough in a military and superstitious age, but the reason or
                    ground of its admission in the last is not so obvious. That usually assigned is
                    the difficulty, in writs of right, of determining the <hi rend="italic">jus
                    proprietatis;</hi> but another and more plausible pretext for allowing it, in
                    such cases, was for the sake of those claimants who might have the true right,
                    but yet by the death of witnesses or other defect of evidence might be unable
                    to^ prove it to a jury.</p>
                <p>The last trial of battel that was waged in the court of common pleas at
                    Westminster,—though there was afterwards one in the court of chivalry in 1631,
                    and another in the county palatine of Durham in 1638,—took place in the
                    thirteenth year of Queen Elizabeth, <hi rend="smallcaps">a. d.</hi> 1571, as
                    reported by Sir James Dyer, and was held in Tothillfields, Westminster, <hi
                    rend="italic">non sine magna jurisconsultorum perturbatione,</hi> says Sir Henry
                    Spelman, who was himself a witness of the ceremony. In this trial by battel, on
                    a writ of right, the battle was waged by champions, and not by the parties
                    themselves; because in civil actions, if any party to the suit dies, the suit
                    must abate, and be at an end for the present; and therefore no judgment could be
                    given for the lands in question if either of the parties were slain. Another
                    reason was, that no person might claim an exemption from this trial, as was
                    allowed in criminal cases. An account of the form and laws of the judicial
                    combat, which are now merely matters of history, may be found in any of the
                    institutional works on English law.</p>
                <p>In appeal of felony, the trial by battel might be demanded, at the election of
                    the appellee, either in an appeal or an approvement; and it was carried on with
                    equal solemnity as that on a writ of right, but with this difference, that in
                    this case the parties fought in their proper persons. Hence if the appellant or
                    approver happened to be a woman, a priest, an infant, or of the age of sixty, or
                    lame, or blind, he or she might counterplead, refuse the wager of battel, and
                    compel the appellee to put himself upon the country. A peer of the realm who
                    brought an appeal was also privileged to decline wager of battel, <hi
                    rend="italic">propter dignitatem personae;</hi> and the citizens of London had
                    the same immunity conferred on them by special charter, doubtless because
                    fighting seemed foreign to their education and employment. Again, if the crime
                    was notorious, as if the thief had been taken with the <hi rend="italic"
                    >mainour,</hi> or the murderer in the room with a bloody knife, the appellant
                    might refuse the tender of battel from the appellee, because it was deemed
                    unreasonable that an innocent man should stake his life against one who was
                    already half-convicted. The form and manner of waging battel upon appeals were
                    much the same as upon a writ of right; only the oaths of the two combatants were
                    incomparably more"striking and solemn.</p>
                <p>The last case of this kind which occurred was that of Abraham Thornton in 1819.
                    This man having been tried upon charge of murder, and acquitted, was appealed of
                    felony by a brother of the deceased, a young woman for whom he had pretended an
                    attachment. But after much grave consideration on the part of the judges, the
                    appeal was disallowed, in consequence, we believe, of the tender age of the
                    appellant, or, at all events, his evident physical inability to contend with the
                    appellee; and shortly after an act was passed abolishing this antiquated and
                    barbarous method of trial in all cases whatsoever. This, act which is the 59th
                    Geo. III. c. 46, is entitled, “An act to abolish appeals of murder, treason,
                    felony, or other offences, and wager of battel, or joining issue and trial by
                    battel in writs of right and it proceeds on the allegation, in the preamble,
                    that “appeals of murder, treason, felony, and other offences, and the manner of
                    proceeding therein, have been found oppressive,” and that “the trial by battel
                    in any suit is a mode of trial unfit to be used, and that the same should be
                    wholly abolished.” This act was passed on the 22d June 1819.</p>
