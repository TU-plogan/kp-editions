                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">BANNERETS</label>, an ancient order of knights, or feudal
                    lords, who led their vassals to battle under their own flag or banner, when
                    summoned by the king. The word seems formed from <hi rend="italic">banner,</hi>
                    a square flag, or from <hi rend="italic">band,</hi> which anciently denoted a
                    flag. Bannerets are also called by ancient writers <hi rend="italic">milites
                    vexilliferi,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">vexillarii banneraríi, bannarii,
                    banderisii, &amp;c.</hi></p>
                <p>Anciently there were two kinds of knights, <hi rend="italic">great</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">little;</hi> the first, called <hi rend="italic">bannerets,</hi>
                    composed of the upper, and the second, called <hi rend="italic">bachelors,</hi>
                    of the middle nobility. The banneret was allowed to march under his own flag,
                    whereas the <hi rend="italic">bachelarius eques</hi> followed that of
                    another.</p>
                <p>Banneret, according to Spelman, was a middle order between a baron and a simple
                    knight. Hence he was sometimes called <hi rend="italic">vexillarius minor,</hi>
                    to distinguish him from the greater, that is, from the baron, to whom alone
                    properly belonged <hi rend="italic">jus vexilli,</hi> or privilege of the square
                    fiag. Hence the banneret was also called <hi rend="italic">bannerettus, quasi
                    bαrο minor;</hi> a word frequently used by English writers in the same sense as
                    banneret was by the French, though neither of them occur before the time of
                    Edward II.</p>
                <p>Some are of opinion that bannerets were originally persons who had a portion of a
                    barony assigned them, and enjoyed it under the title of <hi rend="italic">baro
                    proximus,</hi> with the same prerogatives as the baron himself. Others, again,
                    find the origin of bannerets in France, in Brittany, or in England; attributing
                    the institution to Conan, lieutenant of Maximus, who commanded the Roman legions
                    in England under the sway of Gratian in <hi rend="smallcaps">a. d.</hi> 383.
                    According to them, this general having revolted, divided England into forty
                    cantons, and among these cantons distributed forty knights, to whom he gave
                    power of assembling, on occasion, under their several banners, as many effective
                    men as were to be found in their respective districts; whence they are called
                    <hi rend="italic">bannerets.</hi> But however this be, it appears from Froissart
                    and others that, anciently, such of the military men as were rich enough to
                    raise and subsist a company of armed men, and had a right to do so, were called
                    <hi rend="italic">bannerets:</hi> not, however, that these qualifications
                    rendered them knights; they were only bannerets, and the appellation of knight
                    was added thereto because they were simple knights before.</p>
                <p>Bannerets were second to none but knights of the garter. They were reputed the
                    next degree below the nobility, and were allowed to bear arms with supporters,
                    which is competent to none else under the degree of a baron. In France, it is
                    said, the dignity was hereditary; but in England it died with the person who
                    gained it. On the institution of baronets by King James I. the order dwindled,
                    and at length became extinct. The last person created banneret was Sir John
                    Smith, who received the dignity after Edgehill fight, for his gallantry in
                    rescuing the stand ard of King Charles I.</p>
