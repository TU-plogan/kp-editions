                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">BAMBOUK</label>, a country in the interior of western Africa,
                    situated between the Ba-Fing and the Faleme, the two great upper tributaries of
                    the Senegal. The chief characteristic of this country is the quantity of gold
                    with which its soil is almost universally impregnated. This precious metal
                    exists in a perfectly pure state, mechanically united with earth or stony
                    substances in the form of dust, grains, and sometimes little fragments. Almost
                    every spot throughout the country which is within the reach of river inundation
                    is covered with a portion of the ghingam or yellowish earth, which contains gold
                    dust. A portion of this earth is poured into a wooden vessel called a calabash,
                    which is then filled with water, and agitated till the coarse earthy matters are
                    cleared off, and there remains at the bottom a black dust, which by careful
                    washing leaves the gold dust in a pure state. Besides this golden sand or earth,
                    however, Bambouk contains several conical hills entirely filled with that metal,
                    mingled with earth and stony substances, and occurring sometimes in pieces of
                    considerable size. The mine of Semayla is the richest; but the metal is there
                    imbedded in hard substances, and can only be extracted by reducing them to
                    powder, for effecting which the natives have only a pestle of hard wood, which
                    is soon worn away by the attrition of these substances. The mine of Natakon,
                    though less absolutely rich, has the gold only imbedded in softer matters, from
                    which it can be easily extracted. In working the mine one person digs out the
                    sand or stony <hi rend="superscript"> 7</hi> fragments which contain the gold,
                    and hands them to another, who extracts the metal by the process of pounding or
                    agitation. The natives, finding often a rich vein suddenly terminate, and coming
                    to earth that is wholly unproductive, fancy gold a capricious being, who
                    delights in mocking their research. They often dig out deep pits with
                    perpendicular sides, which fall in and bury the unfortunate workmen employed.
                    The survivors, however, very coolly conclude that a certain potent subterranean
                    deity, whom Europeans name the devil, has carried them off to assist in his own
                    mining operations; but that he treats them well; and when in digging deeper they
                    find the bodies, they merely conclude that this mysterious personage has found
                    them unfit for his purpose, and disdainfully thrown them back. We have seen no
                    estimate, nor do there appear any data from which to form one, of the quantity
                    of gold drawn from the mines of Bambouk; but it is certainly considerable, and
                    is exported partly by way ’ of ti <hi rend="superscript"> ιe</hi> coast, partly
                    through Bambarra to Timbuctoo.</p>
                <p>The Portuguese, it appears, penetrated early into Bambouk, and were even for some
                    time masters of the country; but the inhabitants, inflamed by their oppressions,
                    made a general rising, and completely drove them out. Since that time the people
                    of Bambouk, with the most extreme jealousy, have excluded all foreigners from
                    their territories. The French, when they formed their settlement on the Senegal,
                    soon directed their eager search <pb break="no" facs="nls:193193722"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0704-3722-0339"/>towards a country abounding in so valuable a
                    commodity; but their efforts to penetrate into it proved for a long time
                    abortive. At length, in 1716, one Compagnon succeeded, by great address, and not
                    without risk, in gaining the favour of some leading persons, and obtaining a
                    view of the mineral treasures of this country. David and Levens, two successive
                    French governors, afterwards contrived to effect an entrance. Sieur Brue, the
                    most enterprising of the Governors of Senegal, laid before the French
                    administration a plan, by which, with 1200 men, he undertook to conquer and
                    maintain Bambouk. Such an expedition might very probably have been in the first
                    instance successful, and the French might probably, by skilful work-ino have
                    greatly increased the produce of the mines; but when we consider the various
                    casualties and difficulties attendant on the occupation of this interior region,
                    it must appear very doubtful if this would have been in the end a profitable
                    possession.</p>
                <p>Bambouk is fertile and populous along the banks of the rivers, but many of the
                    interior districts are arid and barren. There is a king, but the farims or
                    chiefs compose nearly an independent feudal body. The population is Manding, yet
                    the Mahommedan religion is professed; but the observance consists chiefly in
                    some outward ceremonies, and the marabouts or priests of that faith are
                    carefully excluded from the kingdom. <hi rend="smallcaps">(e.)</hi></p>
