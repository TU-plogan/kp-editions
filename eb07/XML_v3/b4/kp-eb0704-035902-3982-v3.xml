                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">BARBADOES</label>, one of the Caribbees, is the most easterly
                    of the West India islands, and the oldest colony of the British empire. It was
                    probably discovered by Columbus or some of his companions, but they seem to have
                    deserted it in pursuit of more splendid acquisitions; as, on the landing of the
                    English in 1605, it was covered with thick forests, and destitute both of
                    inhabitants and cultivation; they found a breed of swine, however, a proof of
                    its having been previously visited. The favourable reports which these
                    navigators gave of it on their return induced some enterprising Englishmen to
                    plant a colony in it; and the island becoming a sanctuary for the royalists
                    during the civil wars, it was rapidly peopled, and soon rose to great opulence.
                    The earl of Marlborough obtained a grant of the island from James I.; and in
                    1627 it was made over by patent to the earl of Carlisle, from whom it was taken
                    and given to the earl of Pembroke, but afterwards restored. When at the height
                    of its prosperity, which was about the time of the restoration of Charles IL,
                    upon the planters appealing to the king, the earl of Carlisle was deprived of
                    the hereditary proprietorship, and the legislation vested in the crown; the
                    planters being confirmed in their possessions by submitting to a duty of four
                    and a half per cent, on all the exported produce of the island; which tax is
                    still continued, and is considered by the proprietors and merchants as an
                    oppressive and vexatious impost.</p>
                <p>Barbadoes is about twenty-one miles in length by nine of average breadth, and
                    contains above , <hi rend="subscript"> i</hi> 100,000 acres of land, of which
                    80,000 are under cultivation. The country is comparatively very level, and
                    without the high central hills so frequent in the Antilles; the highest being
                    only 1100 feet above the level of the sea. This is centrally situated, and
                    called Mount Hillaby; the north-eastern part is hilly and bleak, and is in
                    consequence called Scotland. The primeval forests having at length been cleared
                    away, i there is now a scarcity of wood throughout the island; although the
                    proprietors, where they conveniently can, plant cocoa-nut, mahogany, and other
                    tropical trees. The estates are said to average about 200 acres, and upon each
                    of these there are a number of negro dwelling-houses, the planter’s house, and a
                    sugar-work; which, uniting with the great varieties of tropical trees and
                    shrubs, form a scene highly picturesque, and give Barbadoes the appearance of a
                    cluster of villages, and a characteristic beauty,— that of finished cultivation
                    and domestic comfort. The soil covers a coralline rag, and has not only been
                    long exhausted, but, being in general very thin, requires the utmost degree of
                    manuring before it can be rendered productive. The mould varies in colour and
                    quality according to the situation, but the black is considered best suited for
                    the cultivation of the cane. Unlike the neighbouring islands, it is only very
                    partially irrigated with one or two small streams; but the rains, which commence
                    in May or June, and continue for several months, afford a sufficient supply of
                    moisture. There are also a number of springs, but few of them good, the water
                    being in general brackish. One of these casts up a bituminous matter called
                    Barbadoes tar, which is useful in some complaints of cattle; and another of them
                    emits a constant stream of sulphuretted hydrogen gas, which may be lighted with
                    an ignited match. The productions of the soil are various, comprising all the
                    fruits and other trees peculiar to such climates; but the article for which it
                    is distinguished, and accordingly that by far the most extensively cultivated,
                    is the sugar-cane. Ginger and aloes are also grown to a great extent; besides
                    which maize and Guinea corn are raised in very considerable quantities; but no
                    coffee plantations remain. There are upon the island a very great number of
                    oxen, horses, and other cattle, which are not only valuable for the purposes of
                    labour, but for the manure they supply. Oxen are in most general use, and only
                    on the principal estates horses are employed.</p>
                <p>Considerable numbers of hogs and poultry are reared, principally by the negroes,
                    on the little plots of ground allotted them, by which provision their comforts
                    are materially increased; the overplus goes to supply ships, or is exported to
                    various neighbouring islands. Wild fowl, such as the plover and curlew, annually
                    frequent the island in great numbers; and wild duck, teal, with many other
                    descriptions of water-game, also abound in their season. The climate of
                    Barbadoes is comparatively salubrious, and the hurricanes which frequently
                    desolate the other islands have not visited it with any severity since the
                    memorable one of 1780, which laid it waste.</p>
                <p>Bridgetown, the capital, and the mart of commerce, lies on the south-west coast,
                    in the interior of Carlisle Bay, and is about two miles in length by half a mile
                    in breadth. The population exceeds 20,000. The city, without exhibiting much
                    regularity or splendour in its buildings, possesses many handsome edifices,
                    uniting elegance, convenience, and comfort in a higher degree than is to be
                    found in any other of the English islands. There is a large and plain cathedral,
                    with a number of other churches and chapels. Beyond the cathedral is the king’s
                    house, occupied by the commander of the forces on the station; a little farther
                    in the country stands the government-house, called Pilgrim; and at the southern
                    extremity of the town is the garrison of St Ann’s, possessing large and spacious
                    barracks, with a very fine parade ground. There are a number of charitable
                    institutions ia this town and throughout the island, particularly the central
                    school, where white boys are educated upon the plan of the national schools of
                    England, and another in the neighbourhood where girls are taught; besides which
                    there are a <pb break="no" facs="nls:193193995" xml:id="kp-eb0704-3995-0360"
                    />variety of seminaries for the tuition of coloured and slave children, several
                    societies for the poor, and a house of industry where trades are taught; and all
                    are well supported, either by government or the more opulent inhabitants.
                    Libraries and literary societies have also been formed. Fourteen miles from
                    Bridgetown stands the college, founded and liberally endowed by Colonel
                    Codrington, where young men have not only the benefit of a university education,
                    but receive orders, and are allowed to exercise their pastoral functions
                    throughout the Leeward Islands. It is also intended to appropriate this seminary
                    for the reception and instruction of catechists. Upon the estates of the college
                    there is a chapel, a school, and an hospital, almost exclusively for the use of
                    the negroes. There are three other towns on the island. Holetown lies about
                    seven miles from the capital; it is very small, and only remarkable for being
                    the first settlement of the English, who landed in the neighbourhood, and named
                    their hamlet Jamestown, in honour of the first Stuart. Speight’s Town, seven
                    miles farther to the north, is a considerable place: it has a roadstead and
                    wharf, and formerly exported sugar directly to England; but the practice is now
                    to send it to Bridgetown, with which there is a daily communication by water. It
                    possesses several religious houses, and some other neat buildings, with a
                    considerable population, for the most part coloured. There is a fortress and
                    signal station situated on Dover Hill, about half a mile from this place. The
                    other town, called Oistins or Austins, is very inconsiderable; it stands a few
                    miles to windward of the capital.</p>
                <p>Barbadoes is peculiarly distinguished from most of the West India colonies, by
                    the large quantity of provisions which is raised within the island, instead of
                    depending upon foreign supplies. This is no doubt attributable to the crowded
                    state of the population, to the traffic with the troops, and to many local
                    circumstances consequent upon the great division of property. The exports of
                    sugar are large, amounting on an average to 300,000 cwts. annually. Maize is
                    also exported to the amount sometimes of 20,000 bushels yearly; besides rum,
                    molasses, and other articles. The importations chiefly consist of articles of
                    clothing, rice, corn, meal, flour, &amp;c. and prepared wood, such as staves,
                    shingles, lumber, and hoops; besides horses and oxen in very considerable
                    numbers. Barbadoes lies twenty leagues east of St Vincent’s, and sixty
                    north-east of Trinidad. Long. 59. W. Lat. 13. 10. N. The population of the
                    island in 1829, according to returns made to parliament, was as follows: whites,
                    14,959; free coloured, 3119; free black, 2027; slaves, 81,086.</p>
