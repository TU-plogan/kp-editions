                    significant corrections to the OCR text, predominantly in cases of confusing "c"
                    and "e." Isolates 90 entries that were mistakenly included at the end of prior
                    entries in v1 and v2. Normalizes ordinal numbers. Separates metadata in
                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,
                    the end fragment is now joined to the start fragment, making a machine-readable
                    word.</change>

                <p><label type="entry">BLACKWELL, <hi rend="smallcaps">Thomas</hi></label>, an
                    eminent Scottish writer, was the son of a minister at Aberdeen, and born there
                    in 1701. He received his grammatical education at a school in Aberdeen, studied
                    Greek and philosophy in the Marischal College there, and took the degree of A.
                    Μ. in 1718. Being distinguished for uncommon-parts, and an early proficiency in
                    letters, he was, in December 1723, made Greek professor in the college where he
                    had been educated; and continued to teach that language with applause till his
                    death. In 1735 was published at London, but without his name, <hi rend="italic"
                    >An Inquiry into the Life and Writings of Horner,</hi> 8vo, a second edition of
                    which appeared in 1736; and not long after, he gave to the world <hi
                    rend="italic">Proofs of the Inquiry into Homer s Life and Writings,</hi> being a
                    translation of the Greek, Latin, Spanish, Italian, and French notes, subjoined
                    to the original work. In 1748 he published <hi rend="italic">Letters concerning
                    Mythology,</hi> 8vo, but without his name. The same year he was made principal
                    of Marischal College in Aberdeen; being the only layman who had been appointed
                    to that office since the patronage came to the crown, by the forfeiture of the
                    Marischal family in 1716, all the other principals having been ministers of the
                    church of Scotland. In March 1752 he took the degree of doctor of laws; and the
                    year following published the first volume of his <hi rend="italic">Memoirs of
                    the Court of Augustus,</hi> 4to. The second volume appeared in 1755; and the
                    third, which was posthumous, and left incomplete by the author, was prepared for
                    the press by John Mills, Esq. and published in 1764. At the same time a third
                    edition of the two former volumes appeared; which is a proof of the good
                    reception the work met with from the public, although it must be acknowledged
                    that the parade with which it is written, and the peculiarity of its language,
                    exposed it to some severity of censure.</p>
                <p>Soon after he became principal of his college, he married the daughter of a
                    merchant in Aberdeen, by whom he had no children. Several years before his
                    death, his health had begun to decline. His disorder was of the consumptive
                    kind, and was probably accelerated by the excessive abstemiousness which he had
                    imposed upon himself. His disease increasing, however, he was advised to travel,
                    and accordingly set out in February 1757; but he was not able to proceed farther
                    than Edinburgh, in which city he died on the 8th of March following, in his
                    fifty-sixth year. Blackwell was both an ingenious and a learned man. He had an
                    equable flow of temper and a truly philosophic spirit, and maintained to the
                    last that serenity and composure of mind which, whether they be the result of a
                    happily-constituted temperament, or of a long course of self-discipline, may
                    well be accounted the greatest of earthly blessings.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Blackwell,</hi><hi rend="italic">Alexander,</hi> son of a
                    dealer in knit-hose at Aberdeen, where he received a liberal education. He
                    afterwards studied physic under Boerhaave at Leyden, took the degree of doctor
                    of physic, and acquired a proficiency in the modern languages. Happening to stay
                    some time at the Hague on his return home, he contracted an intimacy with a
                    Swedish nobleman. Having married a gentleman’s daughter in the neighbourhood of
                    Aberdeen, he proposed practising professionally in that part of the kingdom; but
                    finding his expectations disappointed, he went to London, where he met with
                    still less encouragement as a physician, and commenced corrector of the press
                    for Mr Wilkins, a printer. After some years spent in this employment he set up
                    as a printer himself, and carried on several large works till 1734, when he
                    became bankrupt. In what manner he subsisted for a considerable time after this
                    event we are not informed, though it was probably by the ingenuity of his wife,
                    who published “<hi rend="italic">A curious Herbal,</hi> containing 500 Cuts of
                    the most useful Plants which are now used in the Practice of Physic, engraved on
                    folio Copperplates, after Drawings taken from the Life, by Elizabeth Blackwell;
                    to which is added a short Description of the Plants, and their common Uses in
                    Physic, 1739,” 2 vols. folio. About the year 1740 he went to Sweden, and
                    renewing his intimacy with the nobleman whom he had met at the Hague, again
                    assumed the medical profession, in which he was tolerably successful; but
                    turning projector, he laid before his Swedish majesty a scheme for draining the
                    fens and marshes, which was well received, and many thousands employed in
                    prosecuting it under the doctor’s direction, while some small allowance was made
                    to him by the king. This scheme succeeded so well, that he turned his thoughts
                    to others of greater importance, which in the end proved fatal to him. Suspected
                    of being concerned in a plot with Count Tessin, he was put to the torture; and
                    this not producing the desired confession, he was beheaded on the 9th of August
                    1748. Soon afterwards appeared “A Genuine Copy of a Letter from a merchant in
                    Stockholm to his correspondent in London, containing an Impartial Account of
                    Doctor Alexander Blackwell, his Plot, Trial, Character, and Behaviour, both
                    under Examination and at the Place of Execution; together with a Copy of a Paper
                    delivered to a Friend upon the Scaffold.” Blackwell possessed good natural
                    genius, but was somewhat flighty, and not a little conceited. His conversation,
                    however, was facetious and agreeable; and although an indiscreet man, he was
                    allowed to have been a well-bred and accomplished gentleman.</p>
