                    towards its eastern extremity, between the 21st and 27th degrees of north
                    latitude. It is bounded on the north by the kingdom of Nepaul, the territories
                    of the Sikkim Raja, and by the high country of Bootan; it has the bay of Bengal
                    on the south; Assam, and Ava the country of the Burmese, on the east; Bahar on
                    the west, for the greater part of its frontier; and towards the south-west the
                    provinces of Gundwana and Orissa. Its length, including Midnapoor, maybe
                    estimated at 350 miles, and its average breadth at 300.</p><p>Bengal, especially as it approaches the sea, may be designated a level country.
                    Even in its northern parts it is scarcely reached by any of the branches that
                    diverge from the great Himalaya range; and such elevated tracts as it does
                    contain can only be considered as exceptions to the uniformity of level which
                    prevails throughout the province. The hills that occasionally occur are besides
                    of no elevation; and it is only from the contrast of the adjacent ground that
                    they have acquired this appellation. These hilly parts are mostly situated in
                    the districts of Birboom, Silhet, Chittagong, and the eastern boundaries of
                    Tiperah, and form but an inconsiderable proportion of the whole area. The
                    Ganges, which enters on the western frontier, and runs diagonally across Bengal,
                    gives to the country its peculiar character and aspect. About 200 miles from its
                    mouth it spreads out into numerous branches, forming a large delta, composed,
                    where it borders on the sea, of a labyrinth of creeks and rivers, named the
                    Sunderbunds, about 200 miles broad, and exhibiting, during the annual
                    inundation, the appearance of an immense sea. At this time the rice fields to
                    the extent of some hundreds of miles are submerged, and are navigated by boats
                    of various sizes and shapes, many of them handsome, and fitted both for commerce
                    and for state. The scene presents to a European eye many objects of singular
                    novelty and interest; namely, the fields covered with water to a great depth,
                    with ears of rice floating on the surface; the stupendous dikes, which restrain,
                    without altogether preventing, the excesses of the inundations; and peasants in
                    all quarters repairing to the markets, and even to the fields, on embarkations
                    prepared for themselves, their families, and their domestic animals, from a fear
                    of the swelling waters sweeping away their habitations, with all that they
                    contain, in the absence of their boats. The many navigable streams which fall
                    into the Ganges intersect the country in every direction, and afford a wonderful
                    facility of internal communication. In most parts boats can approach by means of
                    lakes, rivulets, and water-courses, to the door of almost every cottage; and
                    even in the driest season there is scarcely any spot 20 miles distant from a
                    navigable river. Those parts of Bengal which in general lie beyond the annual
                    inundation are, however, reached by extraordinary floods, which frequently cause
                    the most extensive damage, carrying away the cattle, grain, and habitations of
                    the peasants. In this general devastation, houses and fields are seen raised
                    above the level of the surrounding flood, and exhibiting the triumph of art and
                    industry over every natural disadvantage. The lower region of the Ganges is the
                    richest and most productive portion of Bengal, abounding in valuable produce and
                    manufactures. The elevated tract occupying the south-west angle of the country
                    is of less value, and also inferior in extent. The Brahmaputra is another great
                    river, of which the sources are unknown, but supposed to be at no great distance
                    from those of the Ganges; and these two streams taking opposite courses until
                    they are more than 1200 miles asunder, and again approaching each other,
                    intermix their waters before they reach the ocean. The other principal rivers of
                    Bengal are the Roop-narrain, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193196660" xml:id="kp-eb0704-6660-0565"/>the Dummooda, Teesta, Kooram, Korotaya, Ma' nas,
                    Cosi, Conki, &amp;c. In a level country such as Bengal, where the soil is
                    composed of yielding and loose materials, the courses of the rivers are
                    continually shifting, from the wearing down of their different banks, and also
                    from the water being turned off, by obstacles in its course, into a different
                    channel. As this channel is gradually widened, the old bed of the river is left
                    dry, or, ceasing to have a current, it is converted into a stagnant marsh. These
                    changes in the courses of the rivers lead to other important changes in the
                    existing arrangements of society, and affect in a most serious manner the
                    condition of landed property. A river is the basis of population and improvement
                    Land is cultivated, manufactures are established, and towns are built in its
                    vicinity, because it affords the easy means of transporting the produce, whether
                    of land or labour, to the most distant market; and hence a change in its course
                    is necessarily attended with the most injurious consequences. The new channel
                    into which the river flows is of course so much land lost, while the old one is
                    a lake or marsh; and the adjacent lands are overflowed, while the lands lying on
                    the former bank lose their fertility from the want of water, as well as the
                    means of transporting their produce. Thus one man’s property is diminished,
                    while that of another is enlarged or improved; and in the mean time the land-tax
                    on both continues the same. Owing to these frequent aberrations of rivers, towns
                    disappear, and the inhabitants are deterred, by the uncertainty of retaining for
                    any length of time their places of abode, from rearing comfortable or
                    substantial dwellings. The rich will not lay out their wealth on magnificent
                    villas which the capricious flood may sweep away; and hence they have little
                    comfort in their houses, and the country is destitute of ornament. The dwellings
                    of the poorer classes are composed of such slight materials that they seldom
                    last for more than three years; and villages are removed to a distance of four
                    or five miles with little inconvenience, a change of the site being considered
                    an ordinary casualty, frequently occasioned by an unseasonable shower.</p><p>The position of Bengal places it within the range of the tropical heats; and the
                    year is distinguished into three seasons, the cold, the hot, and the rainy. The
                    cold season begins in October, when the rains cease. During the succeeding four
                    months the temperature is mild and agreeable; Fahrenheit’s thermometer falling
                    frequently to 70°. The spring and the dry season then succeed, and continue for
                    four months, during which the heat continues progressively to increase, until it
                    becomes almost intolerable to the natives themselves; the thermometer in the
                    shade rising to 100°. In the beginning of April occasional thunder storms, in
                    the middle and in the south-eastern parts of Bengal, with rain or hail driven by
                    sudden tempests of north-west wind, temper the immoderate heat. In the eastern
                    districts mild and refreshing showers of rain are still more frequent; but
                    towards the west, in the country contiguous to Bahar, a parching west wind
                    prevails in the day-time during the greater part of the hot season, and at night
                    a cool breeze from the opposite quarter. These west winds sometimes give place
                    to easterly gales, which continue for days and weeks. The southerly and
                    northerly winds, which alternately prevail in the bay of Bengal during the
                    summer and the winter, extend their influence over that part of the flat country
                    which faces the bay, until they are diverted in their progress up the country by
                    mountains corresponding with the course of the Ganges. About the beginning of
                    June the south-west Monsoon, with thunder and lightning that seems to rend the
                    sky, ushers in the periodical rains, which refresh the atmosphere and the
                    parched earth. The rains continue <hi rend="superscript"> 0r</hi> four months,
                    when all the rivers are in flood; and in the latter part of this season, in
                    September, if the rains break up early, the weather is extremely close and
                    sultry, and the inhabitants, especially the Europeans, become sickly. Fogs are
                    frequent during the dry months; and dews continue copious and refreshing, and
                    greatly assist vegetation, as they afford nearly as large a supply of moisture
                    as the loose soil of the country appears to require. These heavy dews are
                    supposed to be no more than sufficient to compensate the daily evaporation by
                    the sun during the dry season, and so far to contribute to salubrity. The damp
                    of the climate is ascribed to the want of any general system of drainage in a
                    level country; to the luxuriant vegetation; and to the denseness of the woods,
                    which obstruct the free circulation of the air, and retain an undue quantity of
                    moisture, amid decayed leaves and other putrid vegetable substances. This is
                    found in all countries to be a fertile source of disease; and there is little
                    doubt that the clearing of the forests and a judicious system of drainage would
                    be followed in Bengal, as in all other parts, by a decided improvement in the
                    climate.</p><p>The soil of this province is generally composed of clay mixed with a considerable
                    proportion of siliceous sand, fertilized by various salts, and by decayed
                    substances, animal and vegetable. In the flat country the soil is generally
                    alluvial; the basis is sand, on which, in the inundated tracts, are annually
                    deposited, by the retiring waters, clay, calcareous matter, and other
                    fertilizing substances. In the tracts which lie beyond the reach of the
                    inundation a period of thirty years is scarcely sufficient to cover the barren
                    sand with soil sufficient to fit it for the labours of the husbandman; and in
                    the lapse of half a century the superincumbent soil is not half a span in
                    depth.</p><p>Bengal, refreshed by the periodical rains, followed by a mild and dry winter, and
                    afterwards by great heat, yields in the proper seasons all the productions both
                    of the tropical and the temperate climates. Of the grains which contribute to
                    the subsistence of man, rice is of the first importance; it is the great staple
                    of Bengal agriculture, is particularly luxuriant within the tract of inundation,
                    and thrives in all the southern districts. It is sown at all seasons, and
                    vegetates in low situations, where it ripens during the rains earlier or later,
                    according as the field is overflowed to a greater or less depth. The general
                    seasons of cultivation, joined to the influence of soil and climate, have
                    produced an endless diversity in the different species of rice. The other grains
                    are limited in their varieties. In ascending the Ganges, wheat and barley occupy
                    the first place in husbandry; they are sown at the commencement of the winter,
                    and reaped in the spring. The different species of pulse, such as peas, chiches,
                    pigeon-peas, kidney-beans, &amp;c. are cultivated throughout Bengal, and no
                    season is without its appropriate species; they are mostly sown or reaped in
                    winter, and thriving on poor soils, and requiring little culture, are highly
                    prized as an article of husbandry. Millet and other small grains, though they
                    constitute the food of the poorest classes, and bear a very low price, are still
                    of importance, because they are restricted to no particular season, and,
                    vegetating rapidly, they fill up an interval after a tardy harvest, which does
                    not permit the usual course of husbandry. Maize is less cultivated in Bengal
                    than in those countries where the climate is suitable, having no preference
                    above millet to compensate the greater labour of its culture. Potatoes have
                    lately been introduced into Bengal, and have succeeded well. They are suited to
                    the climate, and the small potato is little inferior to those raised in England.
                    Esculent plants are found in Bengal in great abundance and variety. The
                    different species of the cucumber are much more numerous than in Europe, and
                    whole fields are covered with them. The water-melon is of incredible size, and
                    its stalk, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193196673" xml:id="kp-eb0704-6673-0566"/>leaves, and blossoms form a finely variegated
                    matting, with which most of the cottages in the village are entirely
                    covered.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Tennant’s <hi rend="italic">Indian Recreations,</hi> vol. ii. p. lõ4.</p></note> Asparagus,
                    cauliflower, and other esculent plants are raised; but they arc entirely
                    tasteless; and fields, after they arc sown, must be watched for several days, to
                    defend them against the depredations of numerous flocks of birds by day and of
                    large bats by night. In some fields which are infested by wild boars, elephants,
                    buffaloes, or deer, a stage is erected, on which a watchman is placed to scare
                    away the wild animals. .</p><p>The universal and vast consumption of vegetable oils which takes place in Bengal
                    is supplied by the extensive cultivation of mustard, linseed, sesamum, and
                    palma-christi; besides what is supplied from the cocoa-nut. The scsa-mum comes
                    to maturity during the rains, or soon after them; the others during the cold
                    season. Among the most important and valuable productions of Bengal are tobacco,
                    sugar, indigo, cotton, and silk, most of which require land solely appropriated
                    to their peculiar culture; and of late years coffee has been successfully
                    cultivated. Tobacco, which was unknown in India before the discovery of America,
                    is now produced everywhere. The sugar-cane has flourished in Bengal from the
                    remotest times; there is now scarcely a district in which it is not successfully
                    cultivated, and there seems to be no limit to its production in Bengal, except
                    the demand for it. It is cheaply and frugally manufactured, and, if it were
                    allowed to come into the British market on equal terms with West India sugar,
                    would form an important article of export. The manufacture of indigo appears to
                    have been known and practised in Bengal from the earliest times; and from the
                    East, Europe was supplied with this dye, until the superior produce of America
                    engrossed the market. But a few Europeans, by their skilful manufacture of
                    indigo, renewed this branch of trade in Bengal, where the natural quality of the
                    commodity is superior to that produced in North America. Cotton is raised in
                    great abundance. The produce was formerly equal to the consumption; but a large
                    quantity is now imported from the banks of the Jumna and the Deccan, where it is
                    raised more cheaply than in Bengal. A fine sort of cotton is still grown in the
                    eastern districts, for the most delicate manufactures. The great supply of
                    cotton required by the flourishing manufactures of Great Britain has gradually
                    given rise to a demand for the cotton of India; and cotton wool is now one of
                    the staple exports of Bengal. Silk is an ancient product of India, originally
                    introduced, it is said, from China. It was brought from India to Greece and
                    Italy, from which Europe was chiefly supplied. Bengal has now recovered its
                    share in supplying this valuable article, although the raw silk which it
                    produces is scarcely equal to the finest Italian silk. A coarse species of silk
                    is procured from the wild silkworm, which is found in the countries bordering on
                    Bengal, and in several districts included within it. It is found useful in the
                    fabrication of inferior silks; though it is far inferior to the produce of the
                    domesticated insect. There are many other articles produced, or which might be
                    produced, in Bengal, that amore extended commerce would bring into notice;
                    various drugs used in dyeing, gum-arabic, and many other sorts of gums and
                    resins for manufactures, which are the produce of trees that grow spontaneously
                    in Bengal. Of hemp and flax in all their varieties, with various substitutes for
                    these articles, Bengal produces a greater abundance than almost any other
                    country; but the true hemp, though it is found in many places, is little used by
                    the natives, except for the seed oil as a medicine, or for an intoxicating in
                    gredient, which is often mixed with the tobacco of the hookah. .</p><p>The orchard is a great object of cultivation with the peasant in Bengal; and it
                    attaches him to his native soil from the superstitious predilection which he
                    feels for the trees planted by his ancestor. The seasons, however from the long
                    continuance of the rains, which occupy the greater part of the summer, are not
                    particularly favourable for bringing fruit to maturity. Orchards of mango-trees,
                    the fruit of which affords a wholesome variety in the diet of the Indian,
                    diversify the plains. The cocoa nut flourishes in all those parts of Bengal
                    which are not remote from the tropic; and plantations of oreca are common in the
                    central parts. The bassia thrives on the poorest soils, especially in the hilly
                    districts; its produce is esculent and nutritious, and it yields an intoxicating
                    spirit. From its seeds is expressed an oil, which in mountainous countries is
                    used instead of butter. There are many other sorts of useful trees, which either
                    grow wild in Bengal, or thrive with little care, a particular enumeration of
                    which is unnecessary. The bamboo, however, may be mentioned on account of its
                    usefulness in supplying the peasant with materials for his buildings, and also
                    in yielding him profit. Clumps of these continue to flourish so long as they are
                    not too abruptly thinned.</p><p>The agriculture of Bengal is in rather a backward state. The plough, which is
                    drawn by a single yoke of oxen, is an awkward implement, and the branch of a
                    tree is a wretched substitute for the harrow. The corn is not threshed, cattle
                    being employed to tread it out from the ear. There are neither barns nor
                    inclosures; and the practice of stacking corn is very unusual. Rice is
                    completely preserved by the husk in which it is inclosed, and requires no
                    further care; and the other grain is thrown aside in the same manner, without
                    being threshed, and having no defence against the inclemencies of the weather.
                    The grain is winnowed in the wind, and is stored either in jars of unbaked
                    earth, or in baskets made of twigs or of grass. The practice of storing grain
                    under ground, which is frequent in Benarcs and the western provinces, is not
                    suitable to the damp climate and soil of Bengal.</p><p>In many parts cultivation depends on the artificial aid of irrigation; and the
                    great object of the Bengal farmer is to procure an equable supply of water.
                    Owing to the inequalities of the country, the lower parts are frequently
                    inundated by sudden rains, while the higher grounds are scorched by the long
                    continuance of dry weather; and, to secure a supply of water, various expedients
                    are resorted to. In the management of forced rice, dams retain the water on
                    extensive plains, or preserve it in tanks to irrigate the lower lands. In some
                    places a supply of water is secured by ridges surrounding the field, or by dams
                    advantageously constructed. In other provinces water is raised from wells by
                    cattle or by the hand, where the supply from the rains is deficient. Each of
                    these methods is resorted to by the peasants themselves; but some considerable
                    works, which require greater contrivance and expense, such as reservoirs or
                    ponds, which are easily formed in hilly countries by constructing dams across
                    the gorges of valleys, as well as water-courses and dikes, are more generally m
                    a progress of decay than of improvement. Many tanks have also been dug, not only
                    for supplying the inhabitants with water for domestic purposes, but also for
                    irrigation. But these excavations have in some parts been increased to a
                    destructive extent from ostentation; and as no one is interested in their
                    repair, which does not, as their original construction, give any reputation for
                    piety, they are soon <pb break="no" facs="nls:193196686" xml:id="kp-eb0704-6686-0567"/>choked up with aquatic plants, which produce
                    putrid smells, bad water, and distempers. The rotation of crops, which is so
                    much attended to in every well-regulated system of husbandry, does not enter
                    into the plans of the Bengal farmer. He never thinks of extending the course of
                    his crops beyond the year, nor of choosing articles for cultivation adapted to
                    restore the fertility of his land, impoverished by a previous crop. The want of
                    capital is a great obstacle to the improvement of agriculture as well as of
                    manufactures. The peasantry, among whom the land is divided in small lots, are
                    too poor and too prejudiced to introduce improved modes of cultivation. They go
                    on in the ordinary routine of their employments handed down from father to son.
                    Capital has not accumulated in the country; the division of labour has not been
                    introduced; and every man is alternately husbandman and artisan, the latter
                    personally conducting the whole process of his art even from the formation of
                    his tools to the sale of his productions. In the intervals of his employment he
                    generally betakes himself to agriculture as a resource; and in this manner the
                    same person always follows a variety of employments. Such farmers are ill
                    qualified to prosecute any improved system of husbandry, or to supply the place
                    of opulent and intelligent proprietors, who would introduce large farms and a
                    better system of cultivation. Other obstacles to the improvement of husbandry
                    consist in the assemblage of peasants in the villages, and in the want of
                    inclosures; yet it is difficult to adopt a different arrangement in a country
                    infested by tigers and gang-robbers or river pirates, and where solitary
                    dwellings and unattended cattle would be dangerous.</p><p>The lands in Bengal, prior to the entrance of the British, were occupied by the
                    rajahs and zemindars, by whom they were let out to tenants of various
                    descriptions. The titles of these different classes of proprietors or occupiers
                    were not very exactly defined; and in the anarchy which prevailed in the
                    country, rights of every description were often violated. When the British
                    obtained possession of Bengal, along with the privileges of collecting the land
                    revenues, great differences of opinion arose among them respecting the character
                    of the zemindars and the rights of the tenantry; some asserting that they were
                    not proprietors of the soil, but merely collectors of the revenue for the behoof
                    of the sovereign, who, according to the eastern maxims of policy, was the
                    proprietor of all the lands in the country. Without entering, however, into
                    tin’s controversy, which appears rather of an abstract than a practical nature,
                    it seems certain, and is indeed admitted on all hands, that the lands were
                    assessed in a certain rate for the public tax; and that as long as this tax was
                    regularly paid, the proprietors or occupiers of land were secured in the
                    possession of their properties, which they mortgaged for debts, and quietly
                    transmitted to their heirs through a series of generations. It was to them that
                    government looked for the immediate payment of the tax, which they again
                    collected from the under-tenants, called the ryots or cultivators. Whether we
                    admit the zemindars to be proprietors, or merely government stewards, it seems
                    clear that the tax was a sort of quit-rent, and that its regular payment was the
                    tenure by which they held meir properties.</p><p>In 1765 the right of collecting the revenues of Bengal <hi rend="superscript">

                    0</hi> several districts, with native officers to assist them. In 1770 this
                    system was changed, and the admi- <hi rend="superscript"> rus</hi> trat ion of
                    the land revenues was committed to two boards, one to sit at Moorshedabad, the
                    other at Patna. In 1772 the lands were farmed out for five years, and Mahommed
                    Reza Khan was deprived of all power by Mr Hastings, who constituted Calcutta the
                    seat of the fiscal government, and employed collectors to receive the land
                    revenues. In 1773 another change took place, these collectors being withdrawn,
                    and six provincial councils appointed; but in 1781 the councils were withdrawn,
                    the former system of collectors was again organized, and a supreme board of
                    revenue, which still continues, was established at Calcutta. It appeared,
                    however, that the great error of the company’s agents consisted in overtaxing
                    the country; and in consequence, the agriculture of Bengal was rapidly declining
                    when Lord Cornwallis, in 1789, took means for a permanent settlement of the land
                    revenues. Accordingly, in 1793, he concluded an agreement for a ten years’ tax
                    with the landholders, which was afterwards made perpetual. The land-tax was,
                    however, still too high, and the lands of many of the most ancient zemindars of
                    the country were brought to sale for arrears of taxes; nor does it appear that
                    the settlement so much boasted of has tended in any degree to promote the
                    prosperity of agriculture. But these details, which relate to the revenue and
                    policy of the East India Company, will be more properly considered under the
                    article <hi rend="smallcaps">Hindostan.</hi></p><p>Cotton piece goods form the staple manufacture of India. The district of Dacca,
                    in the eastern quarter of Bengal, has long been famed for the manufacture of
                    plain muslins, distinguished by various names according to the fineness and the
                    closeness of their texture, as well as for flowered, striped, or chequered
                    muslins, of the most beautiful and exquisite fabrics. Several kinds, woven more
                    closely, are manufactured on the western side of the delta of the Ganges; but
                    those of a more rigid texture do not seem to be limited to particular districts.
                    Coarse turbans and handkerchiefs are also made in almost every province. Under
                    the general appellation of calicoes are included various species of cloth, which
                    are still distinguished by their Indian designations. Khasahs are manufactured
                    to the north and east of the Ganges, in that part of Bengal which is situated
                    between the Mahanuddy and Issamutty rivers, from Maulda to Berbazie. Cloths of a
                    similar quality are made near Tanda, in the nabob of Oude’s dominions, and
                    baftas in the south-east corner of Bengal, near Luckipoor; as also on the
                    western frontier of Benares, near Allahabad, and in some other districts. Other
                    sorts of cloth less familiar to the English reader, and which it would be
                    superfluous to enumerate, are fabricated in various districts. Sackcloth is made
                    from packthread in many places, and especially on the northern frontier of
                    Bengal Proper; and it is there employed as clothing by the mountaineers. Cotton
                    is manufactured into canvass in the neighbourhood of Patna and Chatgaon, flannel
                    is wrought at Patna and other places, and blankets are everywhere made. A coarse
                    cotton cloth, dyed red w itb cheap materials, is generally used, and is chiefly
                    manufactured in the middle of the tract between the Jumna and the Ganges. Other
                    sorts, chiefly dyed blue, as well as fine and coarse calicoes, dyed with
                    permanent or fugitive colours, are prepared for inland commerce or for
                    exportation. The seats of this manufacture in Bengal are the city of Patna and
                    the neighbourhood of Calcutta; and it appears to have been in ancient times
                    brought to so great perfection in India, that the ingenuity of the European
                    manufacturers has added little improvement except in the superior elegance of
                    the patterns. Dimities of various kinds and patterns, and cloths resembling
                    diaper and damask linens, are made at Dacca, Patna, Tanda, and many other
                    places. Moorshedabad and its neighbourhood is the chief seat of the manufacture
                    of woven silk and taffeta, both plain and flowered<pb break="no" facs="nls:193196699" xml:id="kp-eb0704-6699-0568"/>; and the
                    western and southern corner of Bengal, of plain gauzes for home consumption. At
                    Malda, and in some towns of the province of Burdwan, mixed goods of silk and
                    cotton are manufactured.</p><p>The internal trade of Bengal consists chiefly in the exportation from the grain
                    districts of corn and rice, in exchange for salt. This article is monopolized by
                    the grasping policy of the government; and its manufacture is a source of severe
                    oppression to the natives. A great proportion of the salt used in Bengal is
                    manufactured in deserts overflowed at every tide by the sea, and the air of
                    which is extremely noxious, from the combined effect of heat and moisture. These
                    deserts are besides infested by tigers and alligators, by which many of the
                    unfortunate salt-workers annually perish; and to recruit their working numbers
                    fresh supplies are procured by the most unjustifiable artifices, the labourers
                    being either decoyed or compelled to engage in this unhealthy employment. The
                    price of salt being artificially raised by the company’s monopoly, the poor are
                    obliged to use it more sparingly, though it is necessary to give a relish to the
                    naturally insipid provisions of the Hindoo. It is still a great article of
                    internal trade, in exchange for grain, for the supply of the cities and for
                    exportation. Cotton, which is imported from the western provinces, and tobacco,
                    which is exchanged for betel-nut, together with some sugar, make up the
                    principal articles for home comsumption. Piece goods, silk, saltpetre, opium,
                    sugar, and indigo, were formerly engrossed by the Company; but trade has been
                    now laid open to individual enterprise, and these articles are bought and sold
                    by every description of merchants.</p><p>The internal trade of Bengal is greatly aided by the navigable communications
                    which intersect the country in every direction, and, during the rainy season,
                    afford the .only practicable means of conveyance. The boats used in this
                    navigation vary in their form and construction, .being each adapted to the
                    nature of the rivers which they generally traverse. The flat vessels, which make
                    their way in the upper parts of the river, and in its tributary streams, would
                    be ill adapted for the wide and stormy navigation of the lower Ganges; while, on
                    the other hand, the lofty boats used in the Ganges, from Patna to Calcutta,
                    would be equally ill suited to the shallow rivers of the western districts, or
                    to the creeks that occur in the eastern navigation. The windings, and the
                    various breadth and velocity of the stream, must be considered in the
                    construction of the craft which are to ply on it. In some .parts it is found
                    most convenient to descend with the .stream and return with the track rope; in
                    other parts the oar is the chief dependence; and, owing to the windings of the
                    river, no reliance can be placed on the sail; so that, in all these cases, a
                    different construction of boats must be employed. The introduction of steam
                    navigation generally on the Ganges would be a most important improvement; and,
                    where the depth of the river is sufficient to admit steam-vessels, they will of
                    course supersede every other craft. It is on rivers such as the Ganges, which
                    descend with a rapid current to the ocean, that navigation by steam is so
                    peculiarly advantageous; the vessel being propelled with a given velocity, which
                    can be at all times commanded against the force, and through all the windings,
                    of the stream. The number of boatmen that plied on the river Ganges, about fifty
                    years ago, was estimated by Major Rennell at 30,000. They are now supposed to
                    exceed ten times that number. Besides plying on the river, most of them are
                    husbandmen on a small scale; and occasionally join the bands of robbers and
                    river pirates who plunder the. unwary traveller. The highways throughout Bengal,
                    which were formerly in good order, have been allowed to fall into complete
                    disrepair. A magnificent road from the banks of the Goggra or Devra river to the
                    Brahmaputra, formed, for a length of 400 miles, a safe and convenient
                    communication at all seasons through the countries subject to the annual
                    inundations; but of this road the remains can only now be traced. A road from
                    Calcutta to Benares has been constructed by government to facilitate the
                    movement of troops, and has proved of very general utility. In general, however,
                    the traveller is directed through Bengal merely by a beaten pathway; but no
                    artificial road, nor any other accommodation, alleviates his fatigue; and in the
                    rainy season the intercourse by land is entirely stopt. Colebrooke, in his
                    account of the husbandry of Bengal, ascribes the total decay of these
                    magnificent roads, with the ruin of all the public inns or serais built on them,
                    to the want of durable materials for their construction, which would require to
                    be brought from hilly countries, at an enormous expense, or bricks would have to
                    be burned for the purpose. As there are no roads, so neither is there throughout
                    the province, except in large towns, any inn or place of accommodation for the
                    traveller; all that can be procured in the small towns is an empty house or hut,
                    where he may have shelter from the weather. The route from one town to another
                    is often extremely tedious, the towns being scattered in various directions, and
                    at great distances; and although the making of roads, the digging of tanks, and
                    the planting of trees, are among the religious duties of the Hindoos, yet they
                    are seldom exercised with any view to utility; so that the trees soon become a
                    jungle, the haunt of wild beasts, which devour travellers; the tank becomes a
                    dirty puddle; and the road generally leads, not from one market-town to another,
                    but to some river where he performs his ablutions. Such being the state of the
                    roads, they are not adapted for wheel-carriages; and merchandise is accordingly
                    transported on the backs of oxen, sometimes on horses of the tattoo breed, and
                    more rarely on buffaloes; the latter, though more docile, travelling at a slower
                    rate than the ox, and not bearing a much larger burden. The owners of the cattle
                    also act more frequently in the capacity of merchants than of carriers.</p><p>Bengal carries on an extensive commerce with Britain. The exports consist chiefly
                    of all the staple articles of the country, such as cotton, silk, cotton
                    piece-goods, &amp;c. The imports are metals of all sorts, wrought and unwrought:
                    woollen and cotton manufactures of various kinds, which can be sent from
                    Britain, and sold cheaper than the home manufactures of the same description;
                    naval and military stores; gold and silver bullion; and almost every article of
                    British manufacture. To Madras and the coast of Coromandel are exported grain,
                    pulse, sugar, saltpetre, molasses, ginger, long pepper, clarified butter, oil,
                    silk wrought and unwrought, muslins, spirits, and provisions The returns consist
                    of salt, red wood, some fine long cloth, izances and chintzes, and remittances
                    of specie. An extensive trade is carried on to China and the countries and
                    islands to the east. The exports are opium, for which, though it is a contraband
                    article of trade, the demand is increasing in China; saltpetre, gunpowder, iron,
                    firearms, cotton, silk, and cotton piece-goods. From <hi rend="superscript">
                    thf</hi> eastern islands and the Malay coast Bengal receives pepper, tin, wax,
                    dammer, brimstone, gold-dust, specie, bete - nut, spices, benzoin, &amp;c.; from
                    China, tutenague, sugarcandy, tea, alum, dammer, porcelain, lacquered ware, and
                    a variety of manufactured goods; from Manilla, m ı go of a very fine quality,
                    sugar, and sapan wood ar specie. To Bombay and the Malabar coast the <hi rend="superscript"> eχ</hi> P <hi rend="superscript"> or</hi> are mostly the
                    same as to the Coromandel coast an ° Madras. The returns are teak timber,

                    coir-rope, pepper, and cardamum from Malabar. To Arabia and Persia are exported
                    throug <pb break="no" facs="nls:193196712" xml:id="kp-eb0704-6712-0569"/>the Persian Gulf grain, sugar, silk and cotton
                    piece-goods, hardware, small articles of Indian manufacture, &amp;c.; to Ava and
                    the Burman empire, silk and cotton goods, firearms, iron nails, naval and
                    military stores, and a variety of European goods, the demand for which is daily
                    increasing all over the Last.</p><p>The wild animals are such as are commonly found in Hindostan, namely, the tiger,
                    the leopard, the wild boar, the jackal, the buffalo, and the elephant, with
                    apes, monkies, &amp;c. which swarm in all the woods, and sometimes plunder the
                    fruit shops of a village; for, being considered sacred animals; they are never
                    disturbed by the natives. The elephant is tamed for domestic uses, as also the
                    camel and the buffalo, and they are extremely useful in the military service,
                    and as beasts of burden. The buffalo is naturally a fierce animal; it is black,
                    while the common cows and oxen are most of them white, and are so small, that
                    when seen at a distance by Europeans, they are commonly mistaken for flocks of
                    sheep. The breed of the buffalo crossed with the common breed of cattle produces
                    a pleasing variety in the herd of the farmer. The native Bengal horse is a thin,
                    ill-shaped, and poor-looking animal, and is never used in the team. The sheep
                    are naturally of a diminutive breed, thin and lank, and of a dark gray colour;
                    though, when fattened for the table, the mutton equals that of Europe. All the
                    towns of Bengal are infested by Pariah dogs, and by jackals, which, with the
                    approach of evening, begin their howlings in the woods and jungles, when they
                    quit their retreat to prowl for garbage in the streets. The bull being a sacred
                    animal, rambles about the country, and is caressed and fondled by the people; to
                    feed him being deemed a meritorious act of religion. The crow, the kite, mayana,
                    and sparrow, hop about the dwellings of the Bengalese with a familiarity unknown
                    in Europe. Storks are seen in great numbers, and feed on the toads, snakes,
                    frogs, lizards, and insects, which abound in the country. The Ganges and its
                    numerous tributary streams abound in a variety of excellent fish, which are at
                    times so cheap that they become the food of the poorest classes. The smallest
                    kinds are acceptable in a curry, the standing dish of the Bengalese; which, with
                    their pilau, comprehends the whole art of Indian cookery. The bickty or cockup,
                    the sable-fish, and the mangoe, are all excellent and rich, particularly the
                    last, which forms a favourite dish at every European table, especially during
                    the two months when they are in roe. Mullet abound in all the rivers, and may be
                    killed with small shot as they swim against the stream with their heads out of
                    the water. Oysters, not so large, but of fully as good a flavour as those in
                    Europe, are procured from the coast of Chittagong. Alligators and por-puses
                    abound in all the Bengal rivers, which contain incredible quantities of small
                    turtle, but of a bad quality, and only used by the inferior castes among the
                    natives.</p><p>It is extremely difficult to obtain any accurate estimate of the population of
                    Bengal; and the most contradictory accounts have been published on this subject.
                    The heavy assessment imposed on the land by the British on obtaining possession
                    of Bengal, and the various modes of-extortion resorted to in collecting it, had
                    the effect of discouraging agriculture, and of causing a decrease in the
                    population. But since the decennial settlement of 1793 the country has enjoyed
                    comparative tranquillity, having been entirely exempted from the calamity of
                    war, although it has been infested by gang-robbers, or dacoits, who in
                    formidable bands plunder and frequently murder the farmers and cultivators. By
                    the vigilance of the government, this <hi rend="superscript"> evι1</hi> has been
                    greatly diminished; the agriculture of Bengal has flourished under the
                    protection which it has enjoyed; and the population has consequently increased.
                    Various estimates have been made of the inhabitants at different times, on
                    rather imperfect data. But until the administration of the Marquis Wellesley in
                    1801, no actual investigation was ever attempted'. In 1772 Lord Clive computed
                    the population of the British provinces of Bengal and Bahar at 20,000,000; Sir
                    W. Jones at 24,000,000; Mr Colebrooke at 27,000,000; and in 1790 another
                    estimate was made which carried the number to 32,987,000. In 1807 Dr Francis
                    Buchanan was selected by the government to make a survey of the different
                    districts of Rungpoor, Dinagepoor, and Purneah. This survey was executed with
                    the most laborious accuracy, and it is remarkable that it carried the amount of
                    the population far beyond any other estimate. This census, however, high as it
                    may be thought, was completely confirmed by the subsequent survey of Burdwan by
                    Mr Bayley in 1814. The following estimate of the population of the province is
                    founded on the returns of the magistrates and collectors in 1801, on Dr
                    Buchanan’s survey of the three districts above mentioned, and on Mr Bayley’s
                    survey of Burdwan.</p><table><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"> Papulation of the Province of Bengal. </cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"> Inhabitants. </cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell cols="2" role="data" rows="1"> The twenty-four pergunnahs, including Calcutta, 1,625,000

                    forming, in many parts of the country, a continuous town for many miles along
                    the banks of the rivers, and presenting to the inland navigator as he passes
                    along, the cheerful bustle of a crowded population. The genuine Bengalese towns
                    are not arranged into streets, but into divisions of east, west, north, south,
                    and centre. The Hindoos, Mahommedans, and Portuguese, reside each in their own
                    quarter; and the Hindoo portion is further subdivided into quarters for the
                    Brahmins, scribes, weavers, oil-makers, washermen, barbers, cultivators,
                    potters, &amp;c. A Bengal hut has a pent roof, constructed of two sloping sides,
                    which meet in a ridge forming the segment of a circle, so that they have the
                    appearance of a boat turned upside down. The genuine Bengalese has one hut for
                    himself and another for his cattle; and the <pb break="no" facs="nls:193196725" xml:id="kp-eb0704-6725-0570"/>rich increase
                    the number of apartments without altering the plan of the building. The frame of
                    the house in general consists entirely of bamboos; in the houses of the wealthy
                    wooden posts or beams are used, which are neither polished nor painted, and are
                    seldom fastened with nails. The door is the only opening in the hut.</p><p>The elevated tracts in Bengal are inhabited by a race of a different origin from
                    the inhabitants of the plains. In the northern mountains, beyond the limits of
                    the province, the natives appear to be of a Tartar origin, by which race also
                    the northern parts of Bengal are peopled. The high country which Bengal includes
                    on the west is peopled by several races of mountaineers, who are supposed to be
                    the aborigines of the country, being distinguished by religion, character,
                    language, and manners, as well as by features, from the Hindoo natives. The vast
                    mountainous tract which occupies the centre of India is inhabited by various
                    tribes, some of whom have scarcely emerged from a state of barbarity. In the
                    mixed population of Bengal the Hindoos and Mahommedans are easily seen to be a
                    distinct class, as, among the latter, the Mogul, the Afghan, and their immediate
                    descendants, may be distinguished from the naturalized Mussulman. The Bengalese
                    character has never been held in high esteem throughout Hindostan; and those who
                    are of a foreign descent in Bengal are fond of dwelling on their ancient origin
                    and the countries of their ancestors. The native Bengalese are generally
                    considered of a pusillanimous character, and seldom avenge their injuries by
                    open combat; yet many of them have acquired high distinction in the British
                    service as brave and active soldiers. They are in general a lively, handsome
                    race of men, of a brown colour, middling stature, thin, but well made; of an
                    oval countenance, with black eyes and hair, and many with aquiline noses. Like
                    all the Asiatics, they rank very low in the scale of morality, lying, cheating,
                    pilfering, and tricking in all their dealings, without the least scruple or any
                    appearance of shame; so that in Bengal a man of real veracity is a wonderful
                    phenomenon. Forgery is often resorted to, and perjury is so common as frequently
                    to perplex the course of justice, two sets of witnesses swearing to facts
                    directly in the teeth of each other. They are also addicted to robberies,
                    thefts, burglaries, river-piracies, and all sorts of depredations where
                    darkness, secrecy, or surprise, can give them the advantage. They are obsequious
                    to their superiors, but insolent and contumelious to their inferiors. Domestic
                    slaves are numerous both among the Hindoos and Mahommedans; and it is from this
                    class that concubines are selected by the richer classes, all of whom are
                    provided with household slaves. Reading, writing, and arithmetic, comprise the
                    whole course of school instruction in Bengal, which generally lasts about
                    eighteen months. But the influence of the British has now begun to take root,
                    and is rapidly extending itself throughout Bengal. British schools have been
                    established in Calcutta and other parts, where the English language is taught;
                    the Bengalese females are initiated in reading, writing, sewing, knitting, and
                    the other domestic employ, ments of European women; and a great revolution is
                    evidently about to take place in the habits, opinions, and . manners of the
                    people.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Bishop Heber
                    mentions that there are now in Calcutta and the surrounding villages twenty
                    boys’ schools, containing from sixty to a hundred and twenty each, and
                    twenty-three girls’ schools, with twenty-five or thirty pupils
                    each.</p></note></p><p>Of Bengal prior to the Mahommedan conquest in 1303 our knowledge is very
                    imperfect. It was ruled by the sovereigns of Delhi until 1340, when it was
                    erected into an independent monarchy. But the line of independent monarchs ended
                    in 1538, with its conquest by the Afghans. In 1576 it was subdued by the
                    generals of the emperor Acbar; and in 1580 it was formed into a soubah or
                    viceroyalty of the Mogul empire by Raja Tooder Mull. Bengal continued to be
                    ruled by governors under the Mo°∙ul dynasty, and its revenues to be remitted to
                    the imperial treasury, to the amount of about one and a half million, until the
                    year 1740, when the Mogul empire began to fall to pieces. In 1765 Lord Clive
                    procured the right of collecting the revenues; and from this period it has been
                    under the dominion of the East India Company.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Bengal, Bay of,</hi> a portion of the Indian Ocean, of the
                    figure of a triangle, having on its western side the coast of Bengal, and on the
                    east the coast of Arracan, Pegu, and the Malayan peninsula. Its two sides, from
                    Bengal to Ceylon on the west, and to Junkseylon on the east, may be estimated at
                    1120 miles in length, and the whole is comprehended within the latitudes of 8°
                    and 20° N. At the bottom of the bay the breadth from Chittagong to Balasore is
                    not above 250 miles; and at its mouth, from Cape Comorin to the Malayan
                    peninsula, the breadth may be estimated at 1200 miles. The western and eastern
                    coasts of the Bay of Bengal form a singular contrast in all the points most
                    essential to a navigator. On the western coast there are no harbours for large
                    ships, while on the eastern coast there are many excellent harbours, such as
                    Arracan, Cheduba, Negrais, and Syriam, in Pegu: a harbour near Martaban, Tavay
                    River, and King’s Island; and several harbours in the Mergui Archipelago,
                    besides Junkseylon, Telebone, and Pula Lada. Off the west coast of Coromandel
                    there are no soundings about 30 miles from the shore, while the east coast has
                    soundings two degrees from it. Coromandel presents an open country: it is often
                    parched with drought from winds blowing over sultry sands; the mouths of its
                    rivers are shallow from bars of sand, and it is often visited by dangerous
                    gales. The east coast, on the other hand, is covered with wood. The climate is
                    always temperate; the rivers are deep and muddy; and the weather is generally
                    calm. The monsoons blow over the Bay of Bengal, though it is remarkable that
                    here, as in many parts of India, strong winds are found blowing directly from
                    the sea, while at some distance from the land it is a dead calm. Thus in Bengal
                    there are strong northerly winds, while at sea calms prevail until May and June;
                    and on the Malabar coast the south-west monsoon does not commence blowing till
                    the beginning of the rainy season, but on shore there are strong westerly winds
                    about and after the time of the vernal equinox. <hi rend="smallcaps">(f.)</hi></p></div></body></text></TEI>
