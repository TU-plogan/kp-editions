                    celebrated English dramatic writers, who flourished in the reign of James I.,
                    and were so closely connected both as authors and as friends, that it has been
                    judged not improper to give them under one article.</p><p>Francis Beaumont was descended from an ancient family at Grâce-Dieu, in
                    Leicestershire, where he was born about the year 1585 or 1586, in the reign of
                    Queen Elizabeth. His grandfather, John Beaumont, was Master of the Rolls, and
                    his father, Francis Beaumont, one of the judges of the Common Pleas. He was
                    educated at Cambridge, and afterwards admitted of the Inner Temple. It does not,
                    however, appear that he made any great proficiency in the law, that being a
                    study probably too dry and unentertaining to be attended to by a man of his
                    fertile and sprightly genius. Indeed we should scarcely be surprised to find
                    that he had given no application to any study but poetry, nor attended on any
                    court but that of the Muses: our attention might rather fix itself on the
                    opposite extreme, and fill us with admiration of the extreme assiduity of his
                    genius and rapidity of his pen, when we look back on the voluminousness of his
                    works, and then inquire into the time allowed him for them; works, the execution
                    of which might well have occupied a long life. For although, out of fifty-three
                    plays which are collected together as the labours of these authors, Beaumont was
                    concerned in much the greater part, yet he did not live to complete his
                    thirtieth year; death summoning him away in the beginning of March 1616, on the
                    ninth day of which he was interred, in the entrance of St Benedict’s Chapel, in
                    Westminster Abbey. There is no inscription on his tomb; but there are two
                    epitaphs to his memory, one by his elder brother Sir John Beaumont, and the
                    other by Bishop Corbet. He left a daughter, Frances Beaumont, who died in
                    Leicester shire some time after the year 1700. She had in her possession several
                    poems of her father’s writing; but these were lost at sea in a voyage from
                    Ireland, where she had lived for some time in the duke of Ormond’s family.</p><p>John Fletcher was not more meanly descended than his poetical associate; his
                    father, the Rev. Dr Fletcher, having first been made bishop of Bristol by Queen
                    Elizabeth, and afterwards by the same princess, in the year 1593, translated to
                    the rich see of London. Our poet was born in 1576; and, like his friend, was
                    educated at Cambridge, where he made great proficiency in his studies, and was
                    accounted a very good scholar. A natural vivacity of wit, for which he was
                    remarkable, soon rendered him a devotee of the Muses; and his close attention to
                    their service, and fortunate connection with a genius equal to his own, soon
                    raised him to one of the highest places in the temple of poetical fame. As he
                    was born near ten years before Beaumont, so he also survived him by an equal
                    period; the plague, which broke out in the year 1625, having carried him off in
                    the forty-ninth year of his age.</p><p>During the joint lives of these two great poets, it appears that they wrote
                    nothing separately, excepting one little piece each, which seemed of too trivial
                    a nature for either to require assistance in, namely, <hi rend="italic">The
                    Faithful Shepherd,</hi> a pastoral, by Fletcher; and <hi rend="italic">The
                    Masque of Grays Inn Gentlemen,</hi> by Beaumont. Yet what share each had in the
                    writing or designing of the pieces composed by them jointly, there is no
                    possibility of determining. It is however generally allowed, that Fletcher’s
                    peculiar talent was wit, and Beaumont’s, though much the younger man, judgment.
                    Nay, so extraordinary was the latter property in Beaumont, that it is recorded
                    of Ben Johnson, who seems moreover to have had a sufficient degree of self
                    opinion of his own abilities, that he constantly, as long as this gentleman
                    lived, submitted his own writings to his censure, and, as is thought, availed
                    himself of his judgment at least in the correction, if not even in the
                    contrivance of all his plots. It is probable, therefore, that forming the plots
                    and contriving the conduct of the fable, as well as writing the more serious and
                    pathetic parts, and lopping off the redundant branches of Fletcher’s wit, whose
                    luxuriance, it is said, stood frequently in need of castigation, might in
                    general be Beaumont’s portion in the work; whilst Fletcher—-whose conversation
                    with the fashionable world, to which indeed both of them from their birth and
                    station in life had been ever accustomed, added to the volatile and lively turn
                    he possessed, rendered him perfectly master of dialogue and polite
                    language—might execute the designs formed by the other, and raise the
                    superstructure of those lively and spirited scenes of which Beaumont had only
                    laid the foundation; and in this he was so successful, that although his wit and
                    raillery were extremely keen and poignant, yet they were at the same time so
                    perfectly genteel, that they used rather to please than disgust the very persons
                    on whom they seemed to reflect. Yet that Fletcher was not entirely excluded from
                    a share in the conduct of the drama, may be gathered from a story related by
                    Winstanley, that our two bards having concerted the rough draught of a tragedy
                    over a bottle of wine at a tavern, Fletcher said he would undertake to “kill the
                    king ;” which words being caught by the waiter, who had not overheard the
                    context of their conversation, he lodged an information of treason against them.
                    But on their explanation that it only meant the compassing the death of a
                    theatrical monarch, and they loyalty being moreover unquestioned, the affair
                    ended in a jest.</p><p>On the whole, the works of these authors, <hi rend="italic">par nobile
                    fratrum,</hi> have undoubtedly great merit; and some of their dramas deservedly
                    stand on the list of the stock pieces of <pb break="no" facs="nls:193195568" xml:id="kp-eb0704-5568-0481"/>the theatre.
                    The plots are ingenious, interesting, and well managed; the characters are
                    strongly marked; and the dialogue is sprightly and natural; yet there is in the
                    latter a coarseness which is not suitable to the politeness of the present age,
                    and a fondness of repartee, which frequently runs into obscenity, and which we
                    may suppose to have been the vice of the time, since even Shakspeare himself is
                    not entirely free from it. But as these authors have more of that kind of wit
                    than the “Swan of Avon,” it is not to be wondered if, in the licentious reign of
                    Charles II., their works were preferred to his. Now, however, the tables are
                    entirely turned; and while Skakspeare’s immortal works form our constant and
                    daily study, those of Beaumont and Fletcher are only occasionally dipped into.
                    Some of their plays were printed in quarto during the lives of the authors; and
                    in the year 1645 there was published in folio a collection of such plays as had
                    not been printed before, amounting to between thirty and forty. This collection
                    was published by Mr Shirley, after the shutting up of the theatres, and
                    dedicated to the earl of Pembroke by ten of the most famous actors. In 1679
                    there was an edition of all their plays published in folio; and another appeared
                    in 1711 by Mr Tonson, in seven volumes 8vo. The last and best edition is that
                    edited by Mr H. Weber, in 14 vols. 8vo.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
