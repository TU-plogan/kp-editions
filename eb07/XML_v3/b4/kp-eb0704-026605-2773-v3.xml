                <p><label type="entry">BABYLON</label>, the capital of the ancient kingdom of
                    Babylonia or Chaldaea, situated about long. 44.20. E. lat. 32. 30. N. Semiramis
                    is said by some, and Belus by others, to have founded this city. But by
                    whomsoever Babylon was founded, Nebuchadnezzar was the person who completed it,
                    and made it one of the wonders of the world. The most famous works in and about
                    the city were the walls, the temple of Belus, Nebuchadnezzar’s palace, the
                    hanging gardens, the banks of the river, the artificial lake, and the
                    canals.</p>
                <p>The city was surrounded with walls, eighty-seven feet in thickness, 350 feet in
                    height, and 480 furlongs, or sixty of our miles, in compass. Such, at least, is
                    the statement of Herodotus, who was himself at Babylon. Diodorus Siculus,
                    however, diminishes the circumference of these walls very considerably, and
                    takes some what from their height as given by Herodotus. It is observed, that
                    those who make the height of these walls but fifty cubits, speak of them as they
                    existed after the time of Darius Hystaspes, who had caused them to be greatly
                    reduced. These walls formed a square, each side of which was 120 furlongs, or
                    fifteen miles, in length; and they were built of large bricks cemented together
                    with bitumen. The city was encompassed, without the walls, with a vast ditch
                    filled with water, and lined with bricks on both sides; and, as the earth that
                    had been dug out of it served to form the bricks, we may judge of the depth and
                    largeness of the ditch from the height and thickness of the walls. In the whole
                    compass of the wall there were an hundred gates, that is, twenty-five on every
                    one of the four sides, all formed of brass. Between each two of these gates, at
                    proper distances, were three towers, and four more at the four corners of this
                    great square, and three between every corner and the next gate on either side;
                    and these towers were ten feet higher than the walls. But this is to be
                    understood only of those parts of the walls where towers were needed for
                    defence; for in some parts of them, which rested upon a morass and were
                    inaccessible to an enemy, the labour and cost of such defences were spared. The
                    whole number, then, of these towers amounted to no more than 250. From every one
                    of the twenty-five gates on each side of this square there ran a straight
                    street, extending to the corresponding gate in the opposite wall; whence the
                    whole number of the streets must have been only fifty; but then they were each
                    about fifteen miles in length, one half of them, or twenty-five, crossing the
                    other twenty-five at right angles. Besides these whole streets, however, we must
                    reckon four half streets, consisting of rows of houses facing the four inner
                    sides of the walls. But these four half streets were properly the four sides of
                    the city within the walls, and each of them was 200 feet broad, the whole
                    streets being about 150 feet broad. By this intersection of the fifty streets
                    the city was divided into 676 squares, every one of four furlongs and a half on
                    the side, or two miles and a quarter in compass. Round these squares, on every
                    side towards the streets, stood the -houses, many of which were several stories
                    in height, and adorned with all manner of embellishment; while the space within
                    each of these squares was occupied by fields or gardens, either for pleasure or
                    convenience.</p>
                <p>A branch of the Euphrates divided the city into two parts, running through the
                    midst of it from north to south; and over it, in the very middle of the city,
                    was a bridge a furlong or rather more in length. This bridge is said to have
                    been built with wonderful art, in order to supply a defect in the bottom of the
                    river, which was all sandy. At its opposite ends were two palaces, namely, the
                    old palace on the east side, and the new one on the west side of the river; the
                    former of which occupied four of the squares above mentioned, and the latter
                    nine. The temple of Belus occupied another of these squares.</p>
                <p>The whole city stood in a large flat or plain, in a very fat and deep soil; that
                    part or half of it situated on the east side of the river constituted the old
                    city, and the other on the west was added by Nebuchadnezzar, while both were
                    included within the vast square bounded by the walls already mentioned. The form
                    of the whole was probably borrowed from Nineveh, which was also 480 furlongs in
                    circuit. It is supposed that Nebuchadnezzar, who had destroyed the old seat of
                    the Assyrian empire, intende» that this new one should rather exceed it; and
                    that in order to fill it with inhabitants, he transported thither vast numbers
                    of captives from other countries.</p>
                <p>According to the description of Herodotus, Babylon must have covered ten times as
                    large a space as London. It is certain, however, that much of the ground was
                    occupied with fields and gardens; and hence it was rather an inclosed district,
                    with groups of buildings interspersed, than a city in the modern sense of the
                    term.</p>
                <p>One great work of Nebuchadnezzar was the temple of Belus. But the wonderful tower
                    connected with it was built many ages before, and is supposed to have been the
                    same structure with the tower of Babel. This tower is said by Herodotus to have
                    been composed of eight pyramidal ones raised above one another, and to have been
                    a furlong in height. The ascent to the top was by means of stairs on the outside
                    passing round it. Until <pb break="no" facs="nls:193192786"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0704-2786-0267"/>the time of Nebuchadnezzar, it is thought that
                    this tower was the only temple of Belus; but that king made great additions to
                    it by erecting vast edifices round it, in a square of two furlongs on every
                    side, and a mile in circumference. On the outside of these buildings was a wall
                    which inclosed the whole; and in this wall were several gates, all of solid
                    brass, leading into the temple. In the temple thus enlarged were several images
                    or idols of massive gold, and one of them, forty feet in height, is supposed to
                    have been that which Nebuchadnezzar consecrated in the plains of Dura.—On the
                    east side of the river stood the old palace of the kings of Babylon, which was
                    four miles in circumference; and opposite to it, on the other side of the river,
                    was the new palace built by Nebuchadnezzar, eight miles in circumference, and
                    consequently four times as large as the old one.</p>
                <p>But nothing was more wonderful at Babylon than the hanging gardens, which
                    Nebuchadnezzar formed in complaisance to his wife Amyte; who, being a Mede, and
                    retaining a strong predilection for the mountains and forests of her own
                    country, was desirous of having something like them at Babylon. They are said to
                    have contained a square of four plethra, or 400 feet, on each side; and to have
                    consisted of terraces raised one above another, and carried up to the height of
                    the wall of the city, the ascent from terrace to terrace being by steps ten feet
                    wide. The whole pile consisted of substantial arches upon arches, and was
                    strengthened by a wall 22 feet thick surrounding it on every side. The floors on
                    each of them were constructed in this order: first, on the tops of the arches
                    was laid a bed or pavement of stones, sixteen feet long and four feet broad,
                    over which was a layer of reeds mixed with a great quantity of bitumen; and this
                    again was covered with two courses of bricks closely cemented together with
                    plaster; while over all these were placed thick sheets of lead, on which was
                    laid the earth or mould of the garden. This floorage was designed to retain the
                    moisture <hi rend="italic">of</hi> the mould, which was deep enough to give root
                    to the largest trees, that were planted upon every terrace, together with a
                    great variety of other vegetables pleasing to the eye. Upon the uppermost of
                    these terraces was <hi rend="italic">a</hi> reservoir, supplied with water from
                    the river by means of an engine; and from this reservoir the gardens on the
                    other terraces were irrigated, as occasion required.</p>
                <p>The other works attributed to Nebuchadnezzar by Berosus and Abydenus, were the
                    embankments on the side •of the river, the artificial canals, and the great
                    artificial lake said to have been formed by Semiramis. The canals were cut out
                    on the east side of the Euphrates, to convey the waters of the river, when it
                    overflowed its banks, into the Tigris, before they reached Babylon. The site of
                    the lake was to the west of Babylon; and, according to the lowest computation,
                    it was 40 miles square, 160 in compass, and in depth 35 feet, as Herodotus
                    states. This lake was dug to receive the waters of the river, while the
                    embankments were building on each side of it. But both the lake and the canal
                    which led to it were preserved after that work was completed, being found of
                    great use, not only to prevent all overflowings, but to keep water 11 the year,
                    as in a common reservoir, to be let out on proper occasions by sluices for the
                    improvement of the land.</p>
                <p>The embankments were built of bricks and bitumen, on both sides of the river, to
                    keep it within its channel, and extended on each side throughout the whole
                    length of the city and even farther, according to some, who reckon their
                    ongitudinal extent 160 furlongs, or twenty miles; whence it is concluded they
                    must have commenced two miles and a half above the city, and been continued an
                    equal distance below it, the length of the city being no more than fifteen
                    miles. Within the city they were raised from the bottom of the river, and were
                    of the same thickness with the walls of Babylon itself. Opposite to each street,
                    on either side of the river, was a brazen gate in the embankment wall, with
                    stairs leading down from it to the river; and these gates were open by day, but
                    shut by night.</p>
                <p>The tower or temple stood till the time of Xerxes; but that prince, on his return
                    from his Grecian expedition, having first plundered it of its immense wealth,
                    demolished the whole, and laid it in ruins. Alexander, on his return to Babylon
                    from his Indian expedition, proposed to rebuild it, and accordingly set 10,000
                    men to work to clear away the rubbish; but the work proved too herculean for
                    such means, and his death happening soon after, a stop was put to all further
                    proceedings in this design. After the death of the Macedonian conqueror, the
                    city of Babylon began to decline apace; which was chiefly owing to the proximity
                    of Seleucia, built by Seleucus Nicator, and peopled with 500,000 persons drawn
                    from Babylon.</p>
                <p>Such is the description we have received from ancient historians of the grandeur
                    of this city. Many of the moderns, however, are of opinion that their accounts
                    are greatly exaggerated. The remarks of Goguet on this subject are particularly
                    deserving of attention, as embodying sound sense and judicious criticism. We
                    come now to give some account of the ruins of Babylon as they are described by
                    modern travellers.</p>
                <p>Amongst all the remains of ancient grandeur, there are none perhaps which possess
                    equal interest with the ruins of Babylon; none, except those of Egypt, which
                    present so many striking images to the imagination, or carry back the mind into
                    such a depth of antiquity. It happens fortunately that their site, through the
                    learned investigations of Major Rennell, may be considered as completely fixed
                    to the small district situated immediately to the north of the village called
                    Hillah.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Hillah is nine
                    miles from Mohawil, and nearly forty-eight from Bagdad. (Rich’s <hi

                    the fountains of bitumen at Hit or Heet, the distance from the ascertained
                    position of Seleucia and Ctesiphon, and the character of the surrounding
                    country, combine in establishing this point beyond a doubt. The appellation of
                    <hi rend="italic">ruins,</hi> in its proper sense, cannot, however, be applied
                    to the present remains of Babylon, which consist almost wholly of bricks,
                    fragments, and rubbish, piled, as it were, in masses, and serving as quarries
                    for the construction of new cities. In this condition, nevertheless, they have
                    deservedly attracted the attention of modern travellers; and interesting notices
                    have been successively given by Della Valle, Niebuhr, Ives, Otter, and
                    Beauchamp. But the recent observations of Mr Rich, enlightened by the previous
                    inquiries of Major Rennell, have been so much more careful and complete, that
                    they nearly supersede all prior information. We shall therefore, in the first
                    place, give a view of the objects which presented themselves to Mr Rich in
                    traversing this celebrated ground; and then offer some remarks respecting those
                    ancient edifices, of which these objects are to be considered as the
                    remains.</p>
                <p>Mr Rich commenced his observations at Hillah, and proceeded to the north, along
                    the eastern bank of the Euphrates. After passing some smaller mounds, he came to
                    a vast mass, 1100 yards in length and 800 in its greatest breadth, whilst its
                    most elevated part rose 50 or 60 feet above the level of the plain. It consists
                    almost wholly of earth formed from decomposed brick, and strewed with various
                    species of fragments. The name of Amran is given to it from a tradition,
                    seemingly unfounded, of a son of Ali having been buried in it. Then, after
                    traversing<pb break="no" facs="nls:193192799" xml:id="kp-eb0704-2799-0268"/> a
                    valley 550 yards in length, and crossed by some smaller ruins, he came to the
                    second grand mass, forming nearly a square of 700 yards every way. This part of
                    the ruins is extremely interesting, containing several walls in a pretty entire
                    state: these are eight feet thick, in some places ornamented with niches, in
                    others strengthened by pilasters and buttresses. Some remains of painting and
                    sculpture are still to be seen on them. The bricks are of the very finest kind,
                    and cemented with lime. We may here observe that the city, as Major Rennell
                    suspected, appears to have been built partly of burnt and partly of unburnt
                    bricks. Three kinds of cement have also been used. The unburnt bricks are in
                    general merely bound together with reeds or chopped straw, which are still found
                    in great quantities. The burnt bricks are cemented, partly with bitumen, but
                    more frequently with lime; a material, the use of which had escaped the notice
                    of observers previous to Mr Rich. He states it to be much the most efficacious
                    of any. Bricks cemented with bitumen could be easily separated; but where good
                    mortar had been used, no power of art could detach them from the wall, without
                    breaking them in pieces. Some parts of the edifice in question have been deeply
                    excavated, with a view to the removal of the bricks; but the workmen have been
                    intimidated in consequence of the rubbish having fallen in and buried some of
                    their number; and they have given up the walls, on account of the extreme
                    tenacity with which they are cemented. This edifice is called by the natives the
                    <hi rend="italic">Kasr</hi> or palace.</p>
                <p>A mile to the north of the Kasr, and about half a mile from the river, is a mass
                    equally remarkable. It is an irregular oblong, the sides being respectively 200,
                    219,182, and 136yards in length; and the greatest elevation 141 feet. Near the
                    summit of the western side appears a low wall, built of unburnt bricks, cemented
                    with reeds and straw. The summit is covered with heaps of rubbish, and with
                    innumerable fragments of pottery, brick, bitumen, pebbles, vitrified brick, and
                    even shells, bits of glass, and mother of pearl. There are many dens of wild
                    beasts in this part of the ruins, and most of the cavities are filled with bats
                    and owls. As there appeared a niche or recess near the summit of the northern
                    face, Mr Rich caused it to be dug into. The workmen successively extracted two
                    wooden coffins, containing skeletons in high preservation. He was of opinion
                    that the whole passage, whatever might be its extent, would have proved to have
                    been occupied in, the same manner.</p>
                <p>This mass, denominated the <hi rend="italic">Mujelibĕ,</hi> being the most
                    elevated part of these remains, has been considered by most travellers as the
                    Tower of Belus, which formed one of the two grand features in the wonders of
                    ancient Babylon. The other was the palace, with its hanging gardens; and this
                    had been clearly pointed out by ancient authorities as on the side opposite to
                    the tower of Belus. The tower then being on the eastern, the palace was to be
                    sought on the western bank of the river. With the exception, however, of a
                    slight notice collected by D’Anville, modern travellers had given no information
                    of any ruins situate in that quarter. Major Rennell very properly pointed out
                    this as a grand object of investigation lor future inquirers. Mr Rich, on
                    reaching the summit of the Mujelibĕ, whence he commanded an extensive view
                    across the river, was much surprised at discovering no trace of any ruins
                    whatever. Not satisfied with this distant view, he crossed and carefully
                    surveyed the ground, but could discern only some mounds of small dimensions,
                    which conveyed no idea of the immense structures of which he was in search.
                    Before leaving this neighbourhood, however, he went to visit a tower, which had
                    been imperfectly observed by Niebuhr, about six miles southwest of Hillah, and
                    beyond the site assigned to ancient Babylon. Our traveller, who had formed no
                    high expectations from this object, was struck with the utmost amazement at its
                    magnitude and grandeur, which decidedly surpassed any thing he had yet witnessed
                    among these interesting remains. It consists of a mound of an oblong figure, 762
                    yards in circumference; rises in a conical form to the height of 198 feet; and
                    has on its summit a solid pile of brick 37 feet high, diminishing in thickness
                    to the top. The bricks are of the finest description, with inscriptions on them,
                    and so well cemented with lime that it is nearly impossible to extract one of
                    them entire. This ruin is called by the Arabs the <hi rend="italic">Ľirs
                    Nimrod.</hi> Every thing remarkable is by them ascribed to Nimrod; but the
                    meaning of the term <hi rend="italic">Birs</hi> seems unknown even to
                    themselves. By the Jews it is called Nebuchadnezzar’s Prison. At a trifling
                    distance to the east is a mound equal in elevation to the Kasr, and all around
                    are traces of ruins to a considerable extent.</p>
                <p>Mr Rich having thus described these ruins, begins very cautiously to form
                    conjectures respecting their origin and nature. At the first sight of the Birs
                    Nimrod he had involuntarily exclaimed, that if the situation rendered it
                    possible, this certainly must be the tower of Belus. Besides its extraordinary
                    magnitude, there is some appearance of its being built in stages, as described
                    by ancient authors; and the mound on the east might correspond to the temple,
                    which occupied part of the quadrangular inclosure that surrounded the tower.
                    After considering these circumstances, Mr Rich is led on to inquire whether it
                    be so certain as is generally supposed that the tower of Belus must be found on
                    the eastern side of the river, and the palace and hanging gardens on the
                    western. But after some acute remarks his path becomes entangled, and he is
                    obliged to stop without arriving at any satisfactory distribution of the objects
                    which had fallen under his observation. The subject is certainly involved in
                    much darkness and uncertainty; but as it is of considerable interest, we shall
                    present our readers with such observations as its consideration has suggested to
                    us.</p>
                <p>It is stated by ancient writers, in the most positive and circumstantial manner,
                    that the palace, with its grand appendage of hanging gardens, was situate upon,
                    or very near to the river, whence, indeed, the gardens were artificially
                    watered. Now, modern Babylon presents, near to the river, no ruins of any
                    magnitude, except those on its eastern bank,—the Amran, Kasr, and Mujelibĕ. It
                    seems unquestionable, therefore, that these, if any, must be the remnant of
                    those immense structures. Then, following Herodotus, we must look for the tower
                    of Belus on the western side of the river. But here we are crossed by the
                    statement of Diodorus, to which Mr Rich does not seem to have fully adverted.
                    That author reports that there were <hi rend="italic">two</hi> palaces built on
                    the opposite sides of the Euphrates, of which by far the most extensive and
                    magnificent was that on the western bank. This Major Rennell naturally infers to
                    be the one which other writers call <hi rend="italic">the palace.</hi> But it
                    deserves notice that Diodorus is the only authority for there being <hi
                    rend="italic">two</hi> palaces. Herodotus and Curtius, the former an eyewitness,
                    mention only one, and evidently entertain no idea that any more existed. It
                    seems also quite unaccountable, that while inferior structures exhibit vast
                    piles of ruins, this western palace, which must have been the grandest and most
                    extensive of all, should not have left the slightest trace of its exist* ence.
                    It may therefore deserve consideration whether Diodorus, who wrote only from
                    hearsay, might not have been deceived, by varying accounts of one palace, and
                    thus led to form the idea that there were two. The striking similarity in his
                    two descriptions, as to situation, plan, and <pb break="no" facs="nls:193192812"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0704-2812-0269"/>ornament, somewhat favours the conjecture. We are
                    sensible that it is a bold orfe; but can only say, that without it the aspect of
                    modern Babylon is wholly inexplicable; for it seems quite ascertained that there
                    are no ruins of any magnitude close to the river, unless on one side, which is
                    the eastern. It may not be amiss, therefore, to follow out the supposition, and
                    to inquire how far, by its aid, the ancient and the recent descriptions can be
                    brought to accord.</p>
                <p>Ancient Babylon consisted of an immense square, divided by the Euphrates into two
                    nearly equal parts. It is distinctly stated by Herodotus, that the palace and
                    tower were in divisions opposite to each other. If, then, the ruins on the
                    eastern side be the palace, we must look to the western for the tower. And there
                    we find the Birs Nimrod, a stupendous pile, the dimensions and character of
                    which are precisely such as the tower, in a state of total dilapidation, might
                    have been expected to exhibit. Yet, to its really being the remains of that
                    edifice, the objections are formidable. First, its distance of nearly ten miles
                    from the Mujelibé would, to include it within the city, require an extension
                    even of the vast limits assigned by Major Rennell. But it is certain that the
                    extent of Babylon was immense; that it rather resembled an inclosed district
                    than a city. A great part of its area was under cultivation; and it has even
                    been asserted, that the produce raised within the walls could, in case of siege,
                    support its immense population. Without resting on the authority of Herodotus,
                    although it be confirmed by Pliny, even the dimensions of Strabo, reckoned
                    according to his own estimate of the stadium, would give upwards of eleven miles
                    to each side of the square. But it is supposed that the palace and tower must
                    each be in the centre of their respective divisions; an arrangement certainly
                    incompatible with the actual situation of the ruins. The expression of
                    Herodotus, no doubt, is <hi rend="italic">εv μi&lt;sω,</hi> in the <hi
                    rend="italic">middle;</hi> which Major Rennell has translated <hi rend="italic"
                    >centre.</hi> We doubt much, however, if this expression can be understood in so
                    precise and mathematical a sense. It is familiarly said that a building is in
                    the middle or heart of a city, when it is completely inclosed within it, and
                    surrounded by its buildings, even though it may approach to one of its
                    extremities. No one, we suppose, would hesitate to say that Pall-mall or
                    Westminster Abbey was in the middle of London. Such, it appears to us, might be
                    the present meaning, especially since the palace, being upon the river, could
                    not, geometrically speaking, be in the middle of its division. The Kasr above
                    described seems pretty exactly what we should expect in the ornamented and
                    inhabited part of the palace. The Mujelibé, Mr Rich conceives, might be the
                    hanging gardens. We would suggest the mound of Amran as a more probable
                    situation, from its vicinity both to the river and to the palace, while the
                    Mujelibé is at an inconvenient distance ^ <hi rend="superscript"> Ĝm</hi> both.
                    This last structure, from Mr Rich’s observations, seems decidedly to suggest the
                    idea of a royal sepulchre. Of such structures, several are mentioned in
                    Babylonish history, particularly that of Ninus, said to have been built <hi
                    rend="italic">within</hi> the palace, and of extraordinary elevation. (Diod.
                    lib. ii. cap. 7.)</p>
                <p>Since the above was written and published in the Supplement to the last edition,
                    we have had an opportunity f consulting Mr Rich’s second memoir. It does not
                    contain many additional facts; but the examination made on this occasion tended
                    strongly to confirm his first conjecture, that the Birs Nimrod is the remains of
                    the tower of Belus. « The masonry,” says Mr Rich, “is infinitely superior to any
                    thing I have ever seen; and leaving out of the question any conjecture relative
                    to the original destination of this ruin, the impression made by a sight of it
                    is, that it was constructed in receding stages, and faced with fine burnt
                    bricks, having inscriptions on them, laid in a very thin layer of lime cement;
                    and that it was reduced by violence to its present ruined condition. The upper
                    stories have been forcibly broken down, and fire has been employed as an
                    instrument of destruction, though it is not easy to say precisely how or why.”
                    This result is to us gratifying, since he appears to have come to the same
                    conclusion which, as above expressed, we had drawn from the facts stated in the
                    first memoir. Mr Rich indeed adds, that just on closing this memoir, he received
                    at Bagdad a copy of our volume, and expresses in very handsome terms his
                    satisfaction at the coincidence. Mr Buckingham’s more recent observations tend
                    altogether to confirm Mr Rich’s views. On examination he discovered traces of
                    four stages in this pile; and admitting the original height to be a stadium, as
                    Herodotus states, the stadium to be 500 feet, and the stages or stories to be
                    equal, it will follow that vestiges of four stories should exist within the
                    existing elevation of 235 feet.</p>
                <p>Very recently, however, Captain Mignan has published the result of a most careful
                    and meritorious survey of these ruins, with interesting representations of their
                    present condition. This writer, supported by the high authority of Major
                    Rennell, adopts an opinion decidedly opposite. According to him, the Birs Nimrod
                    has no concern whatever with ancient Babylon. The tower of Belus, the most
                    memorable among its structures, is, according to him, the edifice above
                    described, called the Mujelibé. To us, however, all the facts stated by this
                    traveller, and his representations of these remains, which are the best yet
                    given to the public, appear to refute his own opinion, and confirm that which we
                    had previously formed. Let us take a comparative view of these two structures,
                    which contend for the honour of representing the grandest of Babylonie
                    monuments. The Mujelibé is an irregular oblong, without any correspondence as to
                    dimensions, only about half the height of its rival ruin, and composed almost
                    entirely of the inferior material of sun-dried bricks. The Birs Nimrod, on the
                    contrary, is of a form manifestly pyramidal, as the tower is described to have
                    been. It is coated with the very finest materials employed in the construction
                    of Babylon, is much more elevated than any of the other remains, and bears
                    evident marks of having formerly risen considerably higher. There are also
                    manifest traces of its having been built in successive stages. The one,
                    therefore, presents in itself every mark of having been the tower of Belus, the
                    other presents none. Our opinion is much strengthened by the observations of
                    Captain Mignan himself, that this structure, instead of standing solitary, as
                    has been generally supposed, is surrounded by extensive ranges of ruins, bearing
                    in their shattered fragments every mark of ancient importance. There hence
                    appears no room to doubt that this quarter was completely included within the
                    vast circuit of ancient Babylon. When we learn also from Mr Buckingham that the
                    ground to the south of this structure is covered with extensive marshes, and
                    even lakes, and find the ancient authorities describing the approach to the
                    south-west gate of Babylon to be through obstacles of this very description, the
                    conclusion that the Birs was within the limits of Babylon seems no longer to
                    admit of doubt. The idea of Captain Mignan, that it was an advanced bastion of
                    defence, seems not at all to agree with its extraordinary elevation, its
                    superior workmanship, and the fine materials of which it is composed.</p>
                <p>Both Buckingham and Mignan observed a long, hollow space, damp, and sometimes
                    marshy, through which, instead of its present course, it might be supposed that
                    the Euphrates anciently flowed. We do not very much admire<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193192825" xml:id="kp-eb0704-2825-0270"/> the system of supposing
                    changes in the grand features of nature, with the view of adapting them to
                    modern hypotheses. That a canal, perhaps artificial, may have anciently been
                    conducted through this hollow, seems probable enough, though by no means
                    established; but the breadth of the supposed channel, stated by Captain Mignan
                    at not more than 160 yards, seems quite insufficient to contain the main body of
                    the river, which, from his plan, appears to occupy about three times that
                    space.</p>
                <p>Mr Rich collected sundry antiquities among the ruins. These were bricks or pieces
                    of hardened clay, gems, slabs of stone, and bits of brass with engraved figures
                    or characters. But no Babylonian coins or darics have been discovered at Hillah.
