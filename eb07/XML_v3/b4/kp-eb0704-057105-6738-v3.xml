                <p><label type="entry">BENIN</label>, an important country of Western Africa,
                    situated on a bay or bight of the same name, in the most interior part of the
                    great Gulf of Guinea. It forms the eastern limit of that long line of coast to
                    which the name of Guinea is usually applied; and here commences that long chain
                    of estuaries which, as there is now reason to believe, forms the termination of
                    the Niger.</p>
                <p>The first discovery of Benin was made by the Portuguese about the year 1485. It
                    escaped the observation of Diego Cam when he sailed from El Mina to the mouth of
                    the Congo; but tidings of it having been there obtained, Alfonso de Aveiro
                    sailed thither, and brought the first specimen of the plant called long or
                    Guinea pepper. He came accompanied also by an ambassador from the king of Benin,
                    requesting, it is said, that missionaries should be sent to instruct the people
                    in the Christian religion. The king of Portugal, accordingly, dispatched an
                    expedition under Fernando Po, who discovered and gave his name to a fine island
                    near the mouth of the gulf; and having ascended the river, established a
                    settlement at Gatton. A church was built, and upwards of a thousand people
                    received baptism. Much interest was excited by the account of a regular embassy
                    sent at the accession of every new prince to the court of a powerful sovereign
                    named Ogané, whose capital lay about seven hundred miles to the eastward. He was
                    held almost in religious veneration, and his sanction was considered necessary
                    to render valid the title of any new monarch. This mysterious prince maintained
                    himself in retired pomp, and at every audience a silk curtain concealed him from
                    view. At the parting interview, however, his foot was put forth from behind the
                    curtain, and was venerated as a sacred object. He delivered to the ambassador a
                    staff, a helmet, and a cross, all of brass, to be presented to his sovereign.
                    From these circumstances the Portuguese interred that this was the Prester John
                    or Christian prince whom they expected to find in the interior of Africa; but
                    Major Rennell has more reasonably concluded that it was the king of Ghana or
                    Cano, who then held extensive sway over that continent.</p>
                <p>The Portuguese carried on for some time a brisk trade in slaves, who were carried
                    to El Mina and sold to the natives of the Gold Coast. John HL, however,
                    prohibited this nefarious traffic; and as the situation was found very
                    unhealthy, while the conversions were professed only with the view of obtaining
                    military aid against their neighbours, the settlement was ordered to be
                    withdrawn. The Dutch afterwards established factories, and maintained them for a
                    considerable time, chiefly with a view to the slave trade. The English and
                    French have also formed occasional settlements. But all these are at present
                    abandoned, and trading vessels come merely to the mouth of the river. On the
                    whole, the river of Benin has always been, and now is, much less frequented for
                    commercial purposes than that of Bonny and the towns situated at the opening of
                    more southern estuaries.</p>
                <p>The coast of Benin presents a succession of river branches, all probably
                    diverging from one great trunk, connected and interlaced with numerous creeks
                    and channels, which always afford an easy navigation for boats from one to the
                    other. The whole of this territory consists of an immense swamp, either covered
                    with water or composed of mud, in which the foot sinks to a great depth, and out
                    of which rises a dark and impenetrable forest. The waters are so muddy that no
                    fish except eels can subsist in them. The river, called by the Portuguese
                    Formosa, is about two miles wide at its mouth; but it is crossed by a bar of
                    mud, on which there is only twelve feet of water at spring tides, so that
                    vessels drawing more than nine or ten feet cannot conveniently enter. Eighteen
                    miles up is New Town, where vessels can anchor in three and a half fathoms
                    water. It is a mere trading station, consisting of hovels built on a foundation
                    of mud, so soft as to render it necessary to place old canoes, with their
                    bottoms upwards, that the inhabitants may pass over them from house to
                    house.</p>
                <p>At New Town, two branches strike off on each side, and are followed by traders in
                    preference to the main trunk. The left or northern branch leads first to Gatton,
                    the port of Benin, to which barks of sixty tons can ascend, and near which dry
                    land first appears emerging out of the morass. A land journey of forty miles
                    from Gatton leads the traveller to Benin, the capital.</p>
                <p>From information obtained on the Gold Coast, Μ. Dupuis considers Benin as ranking
                    even above Ashantee and Dahomey among the great states of Western Africa;
                    possessing an extensive and highly cultivated territory, and capable of sending
                    200,000 men into the field, although only 10,000 are armed with muskets. But
                    Captain Adams, who appears to be the last that actually penetrated to Benin,
                    leads us to believe this description exaggerated. The city was indeed found to
                    cover a great extent of ground; but the houses were built in so scattered a
                    style that the population did not appear to exceed 15,000. The country around
                    was also fruitful, but by no means very highly cultivated. Sheep, goats, pigs,
                    and poultry, were plentiful; but the vegetable food consisted almost entirely of
                    yams. No information, however, is given respecting the districts in the
                    interior. The king is absolute, being revered by his subjects as a species of
                    divinity. It is a crime to believe that he either eats or sleeps, and all
                    offences against him are punished with the utmost severity, as a species of
                    impiety. At his death, or that of any of his great men, numerous human victims
                    are devoted to attend them in the other world; and every year, at the mouth of
                    the river, three or four are presented as votive offerings, to attract ships and
                    commerce. Yet the practice of human sacrifice does not appear to exist on the
                    same dreadful scale as in Ashantee and Dahomey.</p>
                <p>The large channel which branches off to the right from New Town communicates with
                    the Rio de Forcados, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193196751"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0704-6751-0572"/>and then with another river whose branches inclose
                    the beautiful island of Waree, about five miles in circumference, which seems
                    almost like a spot fallen from the clouds in the midst of a desert. Being
                    somewhat elevated above the surrounding swamps, it is dry, verdant, and
                    cultivated. The soil consists of a tenacious red clay, fitted for the
                    manufacture of earthen jars, which form an article of trade. The island contains
                    two towns, the joint population of which is estimated at 5000. The government is
                    monarchical, but mild; and the natives seem to enjoy a considerable degree of
                    freedom and equality. The houses are neatly built of clay, and some of them
                    ornamented with wooden pillars. Waree carries on a communication with the sea by
                    New Town, which is at present dependent upon it.</p>
                <p>The main stream of the Formosa extends upwards in an east-north-easterly
                    direction, but is not navigable for ships of fifty tons burden for more than
                    fifty miles. Europeans have never ascended it, nor received accounts of any town
                    situated on its banks.</p>
                <p>Since the abolition of the slave trade, the chief commodities to be obtained in
                    the river of Benin are palm oil and ivory, both at tolerably cheap rates. The
                    imports consist of salt, silk and cotton stuffs, guns and gunpowder, coral,
                    beads, iron, brass, brandy, tobacco, &amp;c. The king must be immediately waited
                    upon and presented with a large piece of fine red damask. Captain Adams advises
                    that the trade be carried on by vessels of about 250 tons, lying off. the mouth
                    of the river, outside the bar. They should have two large boats, one
                    communicating with a factory at Lagoa, whilst the other plies up and down the
                    river. Precautions must however be employed against a band of desperadoes,
                    inhabiting what is called the Io Creek, by whom the boats are often attacked and
                    plundered, and even the crews put to death. <hi rend="smallcaps">(e.)</hi><hi
                    rend="smallcaps">BENISH-Days,</hi> among the Egyptians, a term applied to three
                    days of the week, which are days of less ceremony in religion than the other
                    four, and are so called from the <hi rend="italic">benish,</hi> a garment of
                    common use, not of ceremony. In Cairo, on Sundays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays, they
                    go to the pasha’s divan; and these are the general days of business. On Friday
                    they stay at home, and go to their mosques at noon; but although this is their
                    day of devotion, they never abstain from business. The three other days of the
                    week are the benish-days, in which they throw off all business and ceremony, and
                    go to their little summerhouses in the country.</p>
