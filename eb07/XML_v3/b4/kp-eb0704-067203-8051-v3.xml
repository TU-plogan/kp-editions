                <p><label type="entry">BLAKE, <hi rend="smallcaps">Robert</hi></label>, a famous
                    English admiral, born in August 1589, at Bridgewater, in Somersetshire, where he
                    was educated at the grammar-school. In 1615 he went from thence to Oxford, where
                    he was entered at St Alban’s Hall; he subsequently removed to Wadham College;
                    and, on the 10th of February 1617, he took the degree of bachelor of arts. In
                    1623 he wrote a copy of verses on the death of Mr Camden, and soon after left
                    the university. He was pretty early tinctured with republican, principles, and
                    disliking that severity with which Laud, then bishop of Bath and Wells, pressed
                    uniformity in his diocese, he began to fall into the puritanical opinions. His
                    natural bluntness causing his principles to be well known, the puritan party
                    returned him member for Bridgewater in 1640; and he served in the parliament
                    army with great courage during the civil war. But when the king was brought to
                    trial, he highly disapproved the measure as illegal, and was frequently heard to
                    say that “he would as freely venture his life to save the king, as ever he did
                    to serve the parliament.” But this is thought to have been chiefly owing to the
                    humanity of his temper, since after the death of the king he fell in wholly with
                    the republican party, and, next to Cromwell, was the ablest officer of whom the
                    parliament could boast.</p>
                <p>In 1648-9 he was appointed, in conjunction with Colonel Dean and Colonel Popham,
                    to command the fleet; and soon after blockaded Prince Maurice and Prince Rupert
                    in Kinsale harbour. But the latter getting out, Blake followed them from port to
                    port, and at last attacked them in that of Malaga, where he burnt and destroyed
                    their whole fleet excepting two ships; the <hi rend="italic">Reformation,</hi>
                    in which Prince Rupert himself was, and the <hi rend="italic">Swallow,</hi>
                    commanded by his brother Prince Maurice. In 1652 he was constituted sole
                    admiral, and defeated the Dutch fleet commanded by Van Tromp, Ruyter, and de
                    Witt in three several engagements, in which the Dutch lost eleven men of war,
                    thirty merchant ships, and, according to their own account, had 1500 men slain.
                    Soon after, Blake and Ins colleagues, with a fleet of a hundred sail, stood over
                    to the Dutch coast, and forced the enemy’s fleet to fly for shelter into the
                    Texel, where they were blockaded for some time by Monk and Dean, while Blake
                    sailed northward. At last, however, Van Tromp got out, and drew together a fleet
                    of a hundred and twenty men of war. On the 3d of June the generals Dean and Monk
                    came to an engagement with the enemy off the North Foreland, with indifleren
                    success; but the next day Blake coming to their assistance with eighteen ships,
                    gained so complete a victory, that ι the Dutch had not saved themselves on
                    Calais sands, their whole fleet would have been taken or destroyed.</p>

                <p>In April 1653 Cromwell turned the long parliament out of doors, and shortly
                    afterwards assumed the supreme power. The states hoped great advantages from
                    this, but they were disappointed. Blake observed to his officers on the
                    occasion, “It is not for us to mind state affairs, but to keep foreigners from
                    fooling us.” In November 1654, Cromwell sent him with a strong fleet into the
                    Mediterranean, with orders to support the honour of the English flag, and to
                    obtain satisfaction for certain injuries which had been done to our merchants.
                    In the beginning of December, Blake entered the road of Cadiz, where he was
                    treated with all imaginable respect; the Dutch admiral durst not hoist his flag
                    while he was there; and his name had now become so formidable, that a French
                    squadron having stopped one of his tenders, which had separated in a storm, the
                    admiral, as soon as he knew to whom it belonged, sent for the captain on board,
                    and drank Blake’s health with great ceremony, under a discharge of five guns,
                    and then dismissed him. The Algerines were so much afraid of him, that, stopping
                    the Sallee rovers, they obliged the latter to deliver up such English prisoners
                    as they had on board, and then sent them freely to Blake, in order to purchase
                    his favour. This, however, did not prevent his appearing on the 10th of March
                    before Algiers, and sending an officer on shore to the dey to demand
                    satisfaction for the piracies committed on the English, and the release of all
                    the English captives. The dey, in his answer, alleged that the ships and
                    captives belonged to private persons, and therefore he could not restore them
                    without offending all his subjects, but that the English admiral might easily
                    redeem them; and if he thought it proper, they would conclude a peace with him,
                    and for the future commit no acts of hostility against the English. This answer
                    was accompanied with a large present of fresh provisions; on receiving which
                    Blake left Algiers, and sailed on the same errand to Tunis. The dey of the
                    latter place, however, not only refused to comply with his request, but denied
                    him the liberty of taking in fresh water. “Here,” said he, “are our castles of
                    Goletto and Porto Ferino; do your worst.” On hearing this, Blake began, as his
                    custom was when highly excited, to curl his whiskers; and, after a short
                    consultation with his officers, resolved to bear into the bay of Porto Ferino
                    with his great ships and their seconds. On coming within musketshot of the
                    castle and the line, he fired on both so warmly, that in two hours the castle
                    was rendered defenceless, and the guns on the works along the shore were
                    dismounted, although sixty of them played at once on the English. Observing nine
                    ships in the road, Blake ordered every captain to man his long boat with choice
                    men, to enter the harbour and fire the Tunisians; a service which they happily
                    effected, with the loss of only 25 men killed and 48 wounded, while the admiral
                    covered the operation and took off the fire of the castle by playing continually
                    on it with his great guns. This daring action spread the terror of his name
                    throughout all Africa. From Tunis he sailed to Tripoli; caused the English
                    slaves to be set at liberty; and concluded a peace with that government. He then
                    returned to Tunis, upon which the Tunisians implored mercy, and begged him to
                    grant them peace, which he did on terms highly advantageous to England. He next
                    sailed to Malta, and obliged the knights to restore the effects taken by their
                    privateers from the English. And by these, as well as other great exploits, he
                    raised the glory of the English name to such a pitch, that most of the princes
                    and states in Italy thought fit to pay their compliments to the protector, by
                    sending solemn embassies to him.</p>
                <p>Blake passed the next winter either lying before Cadiz or cruizing up and down
                    the straits. He was at his old station, at the mouth of the harbour, when he
                    received information that the Spanish plate fleet had put into the bay of Santa
                    Cruz, in the island of Teneriffe. Upon this he weighed anchor, with twenty-five
                    men of war, on the 13th of April 1657; and on the 20th came to anchor with his
                    ships off the bay of Santa Cruz, where he saw sixteen Spanish ships moored in
                    the form of a half-moon. Near the mouth of the harbour stood a castle furnished
                    with heavy ordnance; besides which there were seven forts round the bay, with
                    six, four, and three guns on each, and connected by a line of communication
                    manned with musketeers. To make all safe, the commander of the Spanish fleet
                    caused all the smaller ships to be moored close in shore; while the six large
                    galleons stood farther out at anchor, with their broadsides towards the sea.
                    Blake having prepared for the fight, a squadron of ships was drawn out to make
                    the first onset, commanded by Captain Stayner in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Speaker</hi> frigate; who, on receiving orders, sailed into the bay and fell
                    upon the Spanish fleet, without the least regard to the forts, which kept up a
                    heavy cannonade. As soon as these had entered the bay, Blake followed, and
                    stationed several ships to pour their broadsides into the castle and forts; and
                    these kept up so heavy and well-directed a fire, that, after some time, the
                    Spaniards found their forts too hot to hold them. In the meanwhile Blake joined
                    Stayner, and bravely fought the Spanish ships, out of which the crews were
                    beaten by two o’clock in the afternoon; when Blake, finding it impossible to
                    carry them away, ordered his men to set them on fire; and this was done so
                    effectually, that they were all reduced to ashes except two, which sunk
                    downright, nothing remaining above the water but part of the masts. The English
                    having now obtained a complete victory, were reduced to another difficulty by
                    the wind, which blew so strong into the bay that they despaired of getting out,
                    and for a time lay under the fire of the castle and of all the forts, which must
                    soon have torn them to pieces. But the wind suddenly shifting, they were enabled
                    to work out of the bay, and left the Spaniards in astonishment at the fortunate
                    temerity of their assailants. This action does honour to Blake; and although
                    fortune favoured him in the opportune shifting of the wind, and his situation
                    was, upon the whole, less trying than that of the gallant men under Lord Nelson,
                    who, in our time, made an attempt on this place, his conduct throughout appears
                    to have been distinguished for the most adventurous daring, and the most
                    consummate nautical skill. “It was so miraculous,” says the Earl of Clarendon,
                    “that all men who knew the place wondered that any sober man, with what courage
                    soever endowed, would ever have undertaken it; and they could hardly persuade
                    themselves to believe what they had done; whilst the Spaniards comforted
                    themselves with the belief that they were devils, and not men, who had destroyed
                    them in such a manner.”</p>
                <p>This was the last and greatest action of the gallant Blake. Consuming with dropsy
                    and scurvy, he hastened home that he might yield up his last breath in the
                    country which he had so much adorned by his valour; and just as he came within
                    sight of land, he expired. Never man, zealous for the interest of a party, was
                    so much respected and esteemed by his opponents. Disinterested, generous,
                    liberal; ambitious of nothing but true glory, and dreadful only to his avowed
                    enemies; he formed one of the prominent characters of an age fertile in great
                    men, and remained untainted with those errors and violences which were then so
                    predominant. The protector ordered him a pompous funeral at the public charge;
                    but the tears of his countrymen were the most honourable panegyric on his
                    memory. Lord Clarendon observes, “that he was the first man who brought ships to
                    contemn castles on shore, which had ever been thought very formidable, and <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193198077" xml:id="kp-eb0704-8077-0674"/> were discovered
                    by him to make a noise only, and to fright those who could be rarely hurt by
                    them. He was the first that infused that degree of courage into seamen, by
                    making them see by experience what mighty things they could do if they were
                    resolved; and the first that taught them to fight in fire as well as in
                    water.”</p>
