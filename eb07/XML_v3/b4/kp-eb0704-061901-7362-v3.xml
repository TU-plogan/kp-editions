                <p><label type="entry">BIBLE SOCIETIES</label>, associations for extending the
                    knowledge of the Scriptures. For a long period this object has been pursued to a
                    considerable extent by several religious institutions, such as the Society for
                    promoting Christian Knowledge, Bartlett’s Buildings, founded in 1699; Baron
                    Cansteen’s Institution at Halle, founded in 1712; and the Danish Society for
                    promoting the Gospel, founded in 1714. But the first British association which
                    professed to have this single purpose in view was the Naval and Military Bible
                    Society, established in the year 1780. The sphere to which this society
                    originally limited its operations, namely, the sailors and soldiers in the
                    service of Great Britain, was not by any means inconsiderable; but it can
                    scarcely be compared in magnitude to that which has been embraced by the British
                    and Foreign Bible Society, founded in the year 1804. The exclusive object of the
                    latter is to promote the circulation of the Scriptures, without note or comment,
                    both at home and abroad. The copies circulated in the languages of the united
                    kingdom are to be those of the authorized version only ;—a condition more vague
                    than the projectors of the society seem to have been aware of. The constitution
                    of the society has hitherto admitted the cooperation of all persons disposed to
                    concur in its support. The proceedings are conducted by a committee of
                    thirty-six laymen; six of them being foreigners resident in London or its
                    vicinity,—half the remainder being members of the Church of England,—and the
                    other half members of other denominations of Christians. Of late there has been
                    an attempt to exclude Arians and Socinians from the direction of the affairs of
                    the society; but a great majority at the annual meeting in May 1831 voted
                    against any change in the original regulation. Every clergyman or dissenting
                    minister who is a member of the society is entitled to attend and vote at all
                    meetings of the committee. In the year 1826 it was resolved that the fundamental
                    law of the society, which limits its operation to the circulation of the
                    Scriptures, be fully and distinctly recognised as excluding the circulation of
                    the Apocrypha. But as the society had for a series of years published various
                    editions in different languages which included the Apocrypha, and as it had
                    formed connections with persons of questionable principles on the Continent,
                    whose alliance it manifested no disposition to renounce, many of its former
                    supporters, particularly in Scotland, have formed themselves into independent
                    societies. The British and Foreign Bible Society, however, has still in Great
                    Britain and the colonies 318 auxiliaries, 438 Branch Societies as they are
                    called, and 1827 Bible Associations, of which about 730 are conducted by ladies.
                    It is connected with fifty-four societies on the continent of Europe, four in
                    India, and one national society in America, which has 645 auxiliaries. The money
                    which has been expended by the British and Foreign Bible Society in the
                    twenty-seven years which have elapsed since its original institution<pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193197375" xml:id="kp-eb0704-7375-0620"/> amounts to
                    L.1,779,973. 5s. 5d. The greatest sum expended in any one year was L. 123,547.
                    12s. 3d. in 1820. The expenditure of the year last accounted for, in May 1831,
                    was L.83,002.10s. 9d. The number of copies of the whole Bible in various
                    languages issued since the commencement of the society has been 2,757,256, and
                    of the New Testament 4,267,471; in all 7,024,727. Of these books forty-four are
                    represented as reprints, five as retranslations, and seventy-two as versions
                    into languages and dialects in which the Scriptures had never been printed
                    before the institution of the society. Of new translations thirty-two are said
                    to have been commenced, though there is no immediate prospect of their
                    completion or publication. Of the Bibles and Testaments issued in twenty-seven
                    years, about five millions have been printed in the languages spoken in the
                    united kingdom, viz. English 4,568,314, Welsh 300,416, Gaelic 115,343, Irish
                    64,188, and Manx 7250. About 2,000,000 have been issued in foreign parts. Some
                    of the societies on the Continent have also circulated great numbers,
                    particularly the Russian Society at St Petersburg, instituted in 1813, which,
                    before its suspension by an imperial ukase in 1826, had 289 auxiliaries and
                    branches, and had printed 861,105 Bibles and Testaments in various languages and
                    dialects. Of the other societies on the Continent, the most active have been
                    those of Berlin, Basel, Paris, Wirtemburg, Dresden, Sweden, and the Netherlands.
                    The American National Society, and the Society of Philadelphia, have printed
                    above 1,256,000 Bibles and Testaments.</p>
                <p>The proceedings of the British and Foreign Bible Society have given rise to
                    several controversies, one of which related to the neglecting to give the Prayer
                    Book with the Bible; a neglect against which strong remonstrances were published
                    by several divines of the church of England, and especially by Bishop Marsh, who
                    also published in 1812 “A History of the Translations which have been made of
                    the Scriptures, from the earliest to the present age, throughout Europe, Asia,
                    Africa, and America; composed chiefly with the view of ascertaining in how many
                    new languages the British and Foreign Bible Society has been the means of
                    preaching the gospel.” This pamphlet was intended as an answer to a statement of
                    Mr Vansittart, that the society, besides reprinting many translations, had
                    published the Scriptures in twenty-five languages, into which they were not
                    known to have been before translated. Dr Marsh maintained that the society had
                    not translated so much as even the four gospels into any one language into which
                    they had not been previously translated, and that, though they had translated a
                    single gospel into two languages (the <hi rend="italic">Bugis</hi> and the
                    J∕αcassar), into which no part of Scripture had been previously translated, they
                    had not then printed even one entire gospel in any one language into which
                    translations of portions of the Scripture had not been executed either before
                    the existence of the society, or independently of its assistance. Another
                    controversy in which the supporters of the society have been involved related to
                    the circulation of the Apocrypha along with the canonical books. Their most
                    distinguished antagonist in this question was the late Dr Andrew Thomson, one of
                    the ministers of Edinburgh. A third serious controversy has been occasioned by
                    the alleged inaccuracy of some of the translations executed under the authority
                    of the society, such as the Turkish New Testament, printed at Paris in 1819; and
                    a fourth, not less serious, appears to be impending over the society, on the
                    admissibility of anti-trinitarians to the privilege of membership.</p>
                <p>The Edinburgh Bible Society consists of all who are disposed to promote the
                    circulation of the Scriptures, being Protestants, and professing their belief in
                    the doctrine of the holy trinity. Its funds arise from subscriptions,
                    collections, and the contributions of nearly 100 associations in different parts
                    of Scotland. In the course of last year it expended about L.4000. In that time
                    it issued above 10,000 Bibles and Testaments in English, and 3000 in Gaelic, in
                    which language it has recently printed 15,000 copies in different sizes, and has
                    in the press a second edition of 10,000 copies of a pocket Bible. It has sent
                    above 3000 Bibles and Testaments to Ireland in the course of the year, and has
                    given L.200 to the Hibernian Bible Society, and L.200 to the Society in Dublin
                    for Education through the medium of the Irish Language. It has in the same
                    period issued 4174 Bibles and 1108 Testaments in foreign languages, including
                    French, German, Spanish, Portuguese, and Italian. It has within the last three
                    years contributed largely to the publication of correct editions of the Bible in
                    the German and French languages. An edition of 10,000 copies of Luther’s Bible,
                    printed at the expense of the society, will soon be exhausted; and a new edition
                    of 10,000 copies of Luther’s New Testament will soon be finished. The Edinburgh
                    Society has also engaged to assist the Glasgow Bible Society in modernizing and
                    republishing the Spanish Protestant Bible of Cypriano at Valero, originally
                    printed at Amsterdam in 1602. It has also given L.400 in aid of the translation
                    of the Scriptures into the oriental languages.</p>
                <p>This society, with some others in Scotland, has within the last few years been
                    engaged in a law-suit with his majesty’s printers for Scotland, who insisted on
                    preventing the importation of Bibles printed beyond the bounds of Scotland.
                    Though the patentees have succeeded in obtaining an interdict against
                    importation, the results of the action has upon the whole been favourable to the
                    public. In a Memorial on the Case of the Bible Societies, printed in 1824, many
                    inaccuracies in the common editions of the Bible were complained of, and in
                    several other respects the Bibles printed in Scotland were alleged to be
                    inferior to some of the English editions. It cannot be denied that a manifest
                    improvement in the appearance of the Edinburgh editions has since taken place;
                    and the printers are fully aware, that if they were to incur the charge of
                    printing carelessly, or imposing unreasonable prices, there are persons alive
                    who would not be slack in complaining of these grievances, and endeavouring to
                    procure redress.</p>
