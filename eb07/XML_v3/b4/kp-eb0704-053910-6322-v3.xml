                    born in the reign of Charles L, but in what year is uncertain. Her father’s name
                    was Johnson; and he having through the interest of Lord Willoughby, to whom he
                    was related, received the appointment of lieutenant-general of Surinam,
                    proceeded to the West Indies, taking with him his whole family, including our
                    poetess, at that time very young. Mr Johnson died on the voyage; but his family
                    reached Surinam, and settled there for some years. Here it was that she learned
                    the history, and acquired a personal knowledge, of the American prince Oroonoco
                    and his beloved Imoinda, whose adventures she has related in her novel of that
                    name, and which Mr Southerne afterwards made use of, adopting them as the
                    groundwork of one of his tragedies.</p>
                <p>On her return to London she became the wife of one Mr Behn, a merchant residing
                    in that city, but of Dutch extraction. How long the husband lived after this
                    marriage is not known, nor indeed is it material to inquire. The wit and
                    abilities of the lady, however, having brought her into high estimation at
                    court, King Charles II. fixed on her as a proper person to transact some affairs
                    of importance abroad during the Dutch war. For this purpose she went over to
                    Antwerp, where, by her intrigues and gallantries, she so far penetrated into the
                    secrets of state, as to accomplish the objects proposed by her mission; and in
                    the latter end of 1666, by means of the influence she had gained over one Vander
                    Albert, a Dutchman of eminence, she wormed out of him the design formed by De
                    Ruyter, in conjunction with the family of the De Wits, of sailing up the Thames
                    and burning the English ships in their harbours; which they afterwards put in
                    execution at Rochester. This she immediately communicated to the English court;
                    but although the event proved her intelligence to have been well founded, it was
                    at this time only laughed at ;—a circumstance which, with the disinclination
                    shown to reward her for her services, determined the lady to drop all further
                    thoughts of political affairs, and, during the remainder of her stay at Antwerp,
                    to give herself up entirely to the gaiety and gallantries of the place. Vander
                    Albert, however, continued his addresses, and after making several unsuccessful
                    attempts to obtain the possession of her person on easier terms than matrimony,
                    at length consented to make her his wife; but whilst lie was preparing for a
                    journey to England with the intention of fulfilling his promise, a fever carried
                    him off, and left the lady free to pursue her inclinations. In her voyage home
                    to England she was very near being lost, the vessel on board of which she had
                    taken her passage having been driven on the coast by a storm; but happening to
                    founder within sight of land, the passengers were fortunately preserved by the
                    timely assistance of boats from the shore.</p>
                <p>From this period she devoted her life entirely to pleasure and the muses. Her
                    works are extremely numerous, and all of them have a lively, licentious, amatory
                    turn. In fact, her wit gained her the esteem of Dryden, Southerne, and other men
                    of genius, as her beauty, of which in her younger days she had a great share,
                    had done the love of the men of gallantry. She published three volumes of
                    miscellaneous poems, and two volumes of histories and novels; translated
                    Fontenelle’s <hi rend="italic">Plurality of Worlds,</hi> with a criticism
                    annexed; and gave to the world four volumes of plays. In the dramatic line the
                    bent of her genius was chiefly to comedy. Her plots are full of business and
                    ingenuity, and her dialogue sparkles with wit. But her comedies are interlarded
                    with the most indecent scenes, and she gives indulgence to her wit in the most
                    licentious expressions. This, however, was as much the fault of the age as of
                    the individual. She wrote for a livelihood, and was obliged to comply with the
                    corrupt taste of the times. This singular woman, after a life of disappointment,
                    died on the 16th of April 1689, and was interred in the cloisters of Westminster
                    Abbey.</p>
