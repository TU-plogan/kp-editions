                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">BLOWING <hi rend="smallcaps">Machines</hi></label>, in the
                    arts and manufactures, and in domestic economy, are instruments for producing a
                    continued current of air, principally for the purpose of facilitating the
                    combustion of fuel. The first idea of such a machine was doubtless derived from
                    the lungs, which we are constantly in the habit of using for the purpose of
                    blowing, but more especially in the simple and useful application of the
                    blow-pipe.</p>
                <p>Of these different machines, the common bellows bears the greatest resemblance to
                    the lungs, and was in all probability the first contrivance for artificial
                    blowing. In the first instance, this instrument might be a simple bag, capable
                    of distension by a mechanical force, the air being drawn in and pressed out of
                    the same aperture in the manner of breathing. The first improvement upon this
                    simple form would be to admit the air by a valve opening inwards when the
                    bellows were distended, the blast outwards being from another aperture. This
                    improvement consists in the air being admitted at a wider aperture, which fills
                    the bellows in less time than would be required by the small pipe through which
                    the air is allowed to escape. The blast, in this state of the machine, is not
                    continuous, but in puffs, at intervals of time required for the air to enter the
                    bellows through the valve; the blowing interval being to the filling interval as
                    the areas of the apertures. This irregular blast was for some time remedied by
                    employing two bellows which blew alternately, the blowing on one taking place
                    while the other was filling. The inconvenience, however, was but partially
                    remedied by this contrivance. The invention of what are called double bellows
                    must have been considered a valuable acquisition in the art of blowing. But
                    previous to describing these, it will be necessary to give a description of
                    single bellows above mentioned.</p>
                <p>It will be needless, however, to say more than refer the reader to common
                    domestic bellows, which are in every respect the same as the single bellows
                    first used. The leather nailed to the upper and lower boards is prevented from
                    collapsing, when the boards are separated, by a hoop of wood contained within,
                    performing the office of the ribs in the sternum of animals, without which the
                    breathing would not be performed. The lower board contains the valve which
                    admits the air. When the two boards are separated, the air lifts the valve in
                    entering the cavity. Men full of air, the closing of the boards causes the air
                    within to close the valve, thus preventing its return in that direction, and
                    compels it to escape at the pipe, the mouth of which is called the nozle or
                    nose-pipe.</p>
                <p>In order to conceive the construction of the double bellows, we have only to take
                    a third board of exactly the same shape as the other two, and connect it with
                    the lower board by a piece of leather similar to that of the single bellows,
                    making two cavities exactly similar, and separated by the lower board of the
                    single bellows, which now becomes the middle board of the double bellows. The
                    third board we shall now call the lower board. This latter has a valve in it
                    exactly similar to the first, which still retains its place in the new
                    construction.</p>
                <p>The middle board is now fixed in a horizontal position, the pipe being placed to
                    the fire to be blown. The lower board is held down by a weight, which keeps the
                    lower cavity constantly full of air. The top board has a weight laid upon it,
                    which presses all the air out of the upper cavity through the pipe.</p>
                <p>The machinal action by which the blowing is performed is, first, to lift up the
                    lower board. This forces the air from the lower into the upper cavity, the valve
                    in the middle board preventing its return. The weight on the upper board now
                    presses the air with a uniform blast through the pipe. During this time the
                    lower board descends, which fills the lower cavity with air from the atmosphere;
                    and this again rises and gives its contents to the upper cavity, and thence
                    passes through the nose-pipe. Hence we see that that irregular puffing blast
                    which belongs to the single bellows is here confined to the lower board, which
                    supplies air to the upper cavity, while the upper board is constantly pressing
                    uniformly upon the air in it. Although this is a considerable improvement upon
                    the single bellows, it does not completely obviate the irregularity of the
                    blast. So long as the lower board is not in action, the pressure on the upper
                    board being uniform, the blast is the same. Every time, however, the bottom
                    board rises to force the air into the upper cavity, an extra pressure is given
                    to the air in the upper cavity, and a temporary puff is produced. In the
                    application of bellows to the smith’s forge, the continued blast was of less
                    importance than in the blast-furnaces applied to the smelting or refining of
                    ores. The single bellows are at present almost exclusively employed by
                    anchor-smiths and cutlers; while the blacksmith and most others use double
                    bellows, which are doubtless better for all purposes.</p>
                <p>In France and other parts of the Continent, bellows have been formed entirely of
                    wood, instead of the flexible sides of leather, which serves to increase and
                    diminish the capacity. The wooden bellows consist of two boxes, each open on one
                    side, the one being just capable of containing the other; the outer box being
                    placed with the mouth upwards, the other is made to descend into it with the
                    mouth downwards, the latter being capable of moving up and down, while the other
                    remains fixed. In the bottom of the fixed box is a valve like the common
                    bellows, and a pipe on the same level to let out the blast. The change of
                    capacity, by the motion of this box, causes the blast, and with less waste of
                    power than that occasioned by the bending of the leather in the common bellows.
                    This advantage is, however, probably more than compensated by the loss of air
                    from the box not fitting on the sides. See a description of this and some other
                    blowing-machines under <hi rend="smallcaps">Pneumatics.</hi></p>
                <p>The common smith’s bellows have lately been construct-1 ed of a circular form.
                    The boards of these bellows arel round, and the movable boards parallel to the
                    horizon and to each other. We have given a view of this construction in Plate
                    CX, figures 4 and 5. A is the blast-pipe, B the movable lower board, C the fixed
                    board, into which the pipe is inserted, and D the upper movable board, on which
                    is placed a weight to regulate the strength of the blast. Motion is given to the
                    lower board by the lever L, and the chain H working on the roller R.</p>
                <p>The form of these bellows being cylindrical, the weight required to produce a
                    certain pressure and strength of blast will be easily determined. If the
                    diameter be one foot, the area will be 113∙19 inches. The most convenient and
                    proper<pb break="no" facs="nls:193198649" xml:id="kp-eb0704-8649-0718"/> blast
                    for smiths’ bellows is about <hi rend="italic">į</hi> lb. upon the inch, or from
                    that to ∣ lb. The upper board, in this case, would require a weight of 56∙5 to
                    give a blast equal to half a pound upon an inch. This pressure would give a
                    velocity equal to about 207 feet in a second. If the diameter of the nose-pipe
                    be changed, the number or length of the strokes, or both, must be changed, in
                    order that the pressure and the corresponding density of the blast may remain
                    the same. If the number and length of the strokes be kept up, and the aperture
                    diminished, at the same time that the capacity of the bellows admits not of
                    enlargement, the pressure and density of blast will be increased, although no
                    additional weight be laid on. This frequently happens in the smith’s bellows
                    when he makes an increased effort to blow after the upper cavity is full. It is
                    much better, however, not to exert the bellows in this way when a stronger blast
                    is required, but to produce the effect by an additional weight. A very strong
                    blast is found to be injurious to the iron when welding heats are required, and
                    still more so in working steel. It is much better that an increase of air, which
                    is frequently wanted, should be furnished by increasing the aperture, supposing
                    the power to be at the time adequate to keep up the increased supply. Bellows
                    should therefore be so constructed that the pressure may be uniform, and not
                    immediately under the control of the workman. When he wishes to quicken his
                    heat, he should have the means of increasing the aperture by a circular plate
                    turning on an axis at right angles to the length of the pipe, as seen in fig. 9.
                    When in the position <hi rend="italic">ab,</hi> the whole area is filled; when
                    in that of <hi rend="italic">cd,</hi> the air passes in its full quantity. The
                    index being placed at any intermediate points <hi rend="italic">er,</hi> will
                    let in any proportionate quantity required.</p>
                <p>The aperture might be made to change, by the increase of power upon the machine,
                    and thus caused to regulate itself. Several simple contrivances of this kind may
                    be applied by any one skilled in machinery.</p>
                <p>These improvements would render the common leather bellows, of the form above
                    given, very useful for smiths. The irregular blast occasioned by their present
                    construction is found to be very injurious to the iron, both as to its quality
                    and economy. This is abundantly shown in the use of some blowing machines lately
                    invented, which have the advantage of a blast that is uniform, and at the same
                    time much softer, being produced by a small pressure.</p>
                <p>These blowing machines are also found to answer very well for melting cast iron,
                    the soft blast having less tendency to destroy the carbon, and the quantity of
                    air being compensated by increasing the aperture.</p>
                <p>One of these machines is the invention of Mr Street, for which he took out a
                    patent. It consists of a barrelshaped vessel, from four to five feet in
                    diameter, and of a length more or less proportionate to the work it has to
                    perform.</p>
                <p>This cylinder is supported on two bearers by the two ends of its axis, like a
                    barrel churn. The cylinder is divided into two equal parts by a plane in the
                    direction of its length, fitting .the two ends and the upper side, watertight,
                    and extending downward to a small distance from the opposite side. This septum
                    is in a perpendicular position when the cylinder is at rest. When this vessel is
                    partly filled with water, and is made to pass through a certain space on its
                    axis, the air which occupies the upper part of the vessel will be compressed on
                    one side by the water, which flows from one side of the septum to the other, and
                    will become in the same degree rarefied on the other, from a contrary cause. If,
                    however, in this situation, a valve be made to open inwards from the atmo-spheιe
                    on the rarefied side, and another to open outwards on the condensed side, two
                    equal and contrary currents will be established, one inwards and the other
                    outwards. On the returning stroke both these valves will shut, and the other two
                    sides will be put in the same situation with the first cavities. If, now, two
                    similar valves to the last be introduced, two similar currents will be produced.
                    If the two valves at which the air escapes from the machine, one on each side of
                    the septum, be made to communicate with one cavity from which a nose-pipe
                    proceeds, while the other two valves communicate with the atmosphere, every
                    stroke will discharge a quantity of air through the nose-pipe from one cavity,
                    and introduce the same volume of air from the atmosphere into the other cavity.
                    These strokes are produced by the oscillating motion of the machine, the limit
                    of its vibrations being about a quarter of the circle, or 90°.</p>
                <p>These alternate puffs of air are first propelled into a vessel containing water
                    to regulate the blast. This vessel is divided into two portions by a septum,
                    which passes from the close cover at the top nearly to the bottom. When the air
                    is forced into the cavity, which is close at the top, it expels the water under
                    the septum at the bottom into the open cavity, so as to keep a constant head in
                    the latter, compressing the air in the former. From this airchest a nose-pipe
                    proceeds to the fire, and the air escapes from it with a uniform velocity so
                    long as the same column of water in the chest is preserved. This description
                    answers to the first machine of the inventor; he has since taken out a second
                    patent, the specification of which is given in the <hi rend="italic">Repository
                    of Arts,</hi> vol. xxviii. p. 193. We shall here give a description of this
                    machine, with the patentee’s improvements. See Plate CX. figs. 1, 2, and 3.</p>
                <p>Fig. 1 is a longitudinal section of this machine. AB is the cylinder resting upon
                    the axis <hi rend="italic">ab</hi> and <hi rend="italic">cd,</hi> which are
                    supported on the uprights <hi rend="italic">gg.</hi> The oscillating motion is
                    given to it by a rod working upon the pivot <hi rend="italic">p,</hi> the other
                    end of which is connected with a crank of such a length as to cause the cylinder
                    to move through an arch of 90 degrees. The vessel is filled with water to the
                    height <hi rend="italic">ws.</hi></p>
                <p>The part CBD (fig. 2) is cut off from the rest of the cylinder by two planes
                    meeting at <hi rend="italic">c,</hi> and continuing down to the axis <hi
                    rend="italic">x,</hi> so as to work upon its convex surface. These planes extend
                    the whole length of the cylinder, and are then divided transversely into three
                    cavities GHI, as seen in fig. 1. The cavity G is for the reception of the
                    external air, and is called by the patentee a receiving box. The cavity H is
                    open to the atmosphere, the periphery of the cylinder being removed in that
                    part. The cavity I is appropriated to the air which is driven out of the
                    machine, through the valves <hi rend="italic">tt</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >qq</hi> (fig. 3), which open alternately on each side. The cavity G is divided
                    longitudinally in the middle, forming two cavities, <hi rend="italic">m</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">n,</hi> fig. 2; two valves, <hi rend="italic">e</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">f,</hi> fig. 1, open into each, one from the end of the cylinder,
                    and the other from the cavity II. Each of the cavities <hi rend="italic">m</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">n</hi> communicate with the body of the cylinder by the
                    holes <hi rend="italic">hh</hi> in the dividing planes. The cavity I has no
                    division, as it receives the air from both sets of exit valves, which escapes at
                    the pipe P.</p>
                <p>The axis <hi rend="italic">av</hi> works within the axis <hi rend="italic"
                    >ab</hi> and <hi rend="italic">cd,</hi> and is rendered air-tight by a
                    stuffing-box within the latter. This axis will have the effect of remaining at
                    rest while the cylinder is in motion, there being no other force exerted to turn
                    it than the friction of the stuffing-box. The use of this axis is to support and
                    turn a swing valve MV, which is made of rolled iron, strengthened by ribs
                    connected with the axis. This valve is a plane, which would exactly sweep the
                    interior surface of the cylinder without touching it. If the axis <hi
                    rend="italic">vx</hi> be held fast, the valve will retain its perpendicular
                    position, while the cylinder performs its vibrating motion. The water would also
                    remain at <pb break="no" facs="nls:193198662" xml:id="kp-eb0704-8662-0719"
                    />rest, with the exception of the motion which its friction and the compression
                    of the air occasions. When the machine moves from D (fig. 3) till the plane DC
                    comes very near to the surface of the water <hi rend="italic">ws,</hi> the
                    valves <hi rend="italic">qq</hi> open, and a volume of air equal to the space
                    DCS will be expelled through the cavity I (fig. 1), along the pipe P, during the
                    time the valves in the cavity <hi rend="italic">m</hi> (fig. 2) have opened to
                    admit the same volume of atmospheric air on the returning stroke. The point B is
                    carried the contrary way, by which another portion of air opens the valves <hi
                    rend="italic">tt</hi> to pass through the pipe P, while the same volume of air
                    from the atmosphere enters the cavity <hi rend="italic">n,</hi> which in its
                    turn is forced through the exit valves <hi rend="italic">tt.</hi></p>
                <p>The use of the swing valve MV will now be obvious. If it did not exist, every
                    time the air was compressed on one side the water would be depressed on that
                    side, and the compression of the air would be limited by the increased column of
                    water on the other side. This valve, however, prevents the water from
                    immediately changing its situation, no more escaping from one side of the valve
                    to the other than what can pass between the edges of the valve and the cylinder,
                    which,-in the short space of one stroke, can be only a very small quantity. This
                    may be considered as a great improvement upon the first machine, which we have
                    before described. The patentee further intends occasionally to give to this
                    swing valve a contrary motion to that of the cylinder, and thus still more to
                    increase the blast. Or, in the use of a very small blast, the valve may be left
                    at liberty, and used merely to prevent the too great agitation of the water,
                    which in the original machine was considered as an objection. Two of those
                    machines are frequently used together, and worked by cranks, forming an angle of
                    45° with each other, to make the strong part of the blast of the one to concur
                    with the weak part of the blast of the other.</p>
                <p>The part I of the exit pipe PL, must be precisely to the centre of motion. The
                    part L works in a stuffing part, or a ground socket connected with the pipe LN.
                    The latter should communicate with a regulator, which the patentee does not
                    describe, but recommends one of water. This may be a vessel at least of the
                    capacity of the cylinder, inverted in a reservoir of water, and may stand near
                    to the bottom. The pipe N is inserted into the bottom, which is now uppermost.
                    The height of the water in the reservoir must be such as to give the required
                    pressure to the air.</p>
                <p>When the air is forced into the inverted vessel by the machinery, the water
                    descends in this, and rises in the reservoir, which now gives a pressure to the
                    contained air equal to the difference of the height of the water in the inverted
                    vessel and the reservoir. The surface of the reservoir should be the greatest
                    possible, in order that it may be raised in the least degree by the water coming
                    from the inverted vessel, which will have the effect of keeping the blast more
                    uniform.</p>
                <p>The water regulator is certainly the best for smiths’ bellows, for refineries,
                    forges, and perhaps the common melting furnace, but they have been found very
                    objectionable in the blowing of large blast-furnaces. The air m the common
                    blowing engine undergoes a great increase of temperature during its passage
                    through the machine, often as much as 40 or 50 degrees. The heated air has the
                    effect of carrying a greater quantity of water along with it into the furnace,
                    which destroys a larger quantity of carbon than the same bulk of common air,
                    without producing an adequate portion of heat. A great part of the heat of the
                    air is doubtless produced by the friction of the piston of the blowing cylinder,
                    which, in this construction, has a very tight wading. In the blow- <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ιn</hi> g machine above described, the water would doubtless
                    be an objection in blast-furnaces, but, as its little friction would not heat
                    the air like the common blowing cylinder used in blast furnaces, the objection
                    would be less formidable. Air must doubtless give out some heat by its decrease
                    of volume, just as it will absorb the heat by rarefaction, as is experienced in
                    exhausting the receiver of an air-pump. The converse of this is equally shown in
                    the little instrument employed to kindle tinder by condensing the air within
                    it.</p>
                <p>The heat by the friction of this piston is probably much more than by the
                    condensation of the air; the latter is obviated in the machine above described,
                    and in another blowing machine lately introduced, of which we shall give a
                    description.</p>
                <p>This machine, in its general appearance, does not seem to have any advantage over
                    the common blowing cylinder, but in practice it is found superior.</p>
                <p>It resembles in some degree the common smith’s bellows of the Chinese, which
                    consists of a square wooden trunk, in the form of a parallelopipedon. A board is
                    made to fit pretty nearly its cross section, to which is attached a long rod, by
                    which the board is pushed backwards and forwards like a pistbn. At one end of
                    the trunk is a valve opening inwards to admit air, and at the same end is a pipe
                    with a valve opening outwards.</p>
                <p>The machine above alluded to as having some resemblance to this, is the invention
                    of a Mr Vaughan, who has fitted up several of them for founderies, and they are
                    much approved. The writer of this article took a drawing from one of these
                    machines employed to melt cast-iron at the Phoenix Foundery in Sheffield.</p>
                <p>Figs. 6 and 7 are two views of the machine. ABCD is a square box formed of pieces
                    of cast-metal, screwed together by hinges. Two of these are placed side by side,
                    as may be seen in the end view, fig. 7. MQ is a piston fitting the square box,
                    which is drawn backward and forward by the rod EF, which works horizontally on
                    the wheels <hi rend="italic">wx</hi> by the spear G, which communicates with the
                    crank of a wheel at a distance.</p>
                <p>The piston MQ, which is the most ingenious part of this machine, is enlarged in
                    fig. 8, to render it clearer. The body of the piston is a cast-iron plate about
                    half an inch thick, with a socket in the middle to receive the rod. The diameter
                    of this plate is about one fourth of an inch less than that of the box. Two
                    pieces of wood, <hi rend="italic">v n,</hi> are cut diagonally, in order to
                    place the pieces of leather, <hi rend="italic">l l,</hi> between them. These
                    leathers, with the wood, are firmly fastened to the plate by bolts, such as <hi
                    rend="italic">gh.</hi></p>
                <p>The leathers extend about two inches beyond the wood; and their slight elasticity
                    keeps them in contact with the metallic surface, which is not required to be
                    very smooth. When the piston moves towards the end of the box, to which the
                    leather projects, the leather claps close to the surface, rendering it
                    air-tight, while the leather on the other side of the piston becomes loose, and
                    has no friction. These leathers will be contrarily acted upon when the piston
                    acts the contrary way. The projecting curved pipes HI form a communication
                    between the box where the piston works and the air-chest N. When the piston
                    moves from B to D, the valves F and V open, while L and S are shut. The air
                    contained in the box is now forced through the valve R into the chest N, and
                    from thence along the blast-pipe P.</p>
                <p>In the returning stroke, which is the whole length of the box, the valves R, V,
                    and K, are shut, while L and S open. The air is forced through H to N, and then
                    through P.</p>
                <p>Two of these work at the same time by two cranks, which cause one to be in full
                    blast at the time the other is returning the stroke; so that, with due
                    management, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193198675" xml:id="kp-eb0704-8675-0720"
                    />the four puffs produced by two double strokes may be made to succeed each
                    other at equal intervals, which almost amounts to a steady blast. The inventor
                    recommends four of these boxes all to work together, which would produce eight
                    puffs in the time of one double stroke, which, if divided into equal intervals,
                    would produce a sufficiently uniform blast for any purpose.</p>
                <p>When the leathers of the piston are rubbed with black lead, the friction almost
                    amounts to nothing. The leather acts so easy to the surface, and is so flexible,
                    that it may be very easily raised with the fingers. This could not be the case
                    if it were applied in the same way in a cylinder; and this is a sufficient
                    reason for using the square box instead of the cylinder.</p>
                <p>This machine makes 70 strokes in one minute; the nosepipe, where the blast enters
                    the furnace, is 2∣ inches in diameter. When the length of stroke is the
                    greatest, at the above speed, it furnishes about 1200 cubic feet per minute.</p>
                <p>This machine steers clear of the objection of the water, and, from its small
                    friction, will have less tendency to heat the air. Its original cost is also
                    less than any other machine yet constructed. In the situations where it has been
                    adopted it gives the highest satisfaction. The first construction of Street’s
                    bellows, above described, was only fitted for some smiths’ fires, where a very
                    soft blast was required. In their improved state they may be employed for most
                    purposes.</p>
                <p>• All the calculations relative to bellows will be easily made, by the following
                    rules and formula:</p>
                <p>First, get the space or capacity formed by one stroke of the machine; call this
                    <hi rend="italic">c,</hi> cubic feet.</p>
                <p>Then get the number of strokes per minute, which call <hi rend="italic"
                    >n.</hi></p>
                <p>The area of the nose-pipe, in feet, call <hi rend="italic">a.</hi></p>
                <p>The pressure on the air to be discharged, whether by a column of water or by a
                    weight, call <hi rend="italic">p.</hi><hi rend="italic">v</hi> — the velocity
                    with which the air escapes.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">r =</hi> the resistance, in pounds, which the blast will
                    give.</p>
                <p>Then <hi rend="italic">en — q,</hi> the quantity discharged in one minute;</p>
                <p>CTí ∙ . CTb and <hi rend="italic">v</hi> =—-—in one minute, or = —— for one
                    second. <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 60 «</p>
                <p>Then, since the resistance is equal to a column of the fluid of the area <hi
                    rend="italic">a,</hi> and twice the height to give the velocity, <hi
                    rend="strikethrough">g g ×∖⅛</hi><hi rend="italic">~ P ’</hi> ’ hθ weight of 14
                    cubic feet of air being equal to one pound.</p>
                <p>The energy of air in blowing fires is as the quantity, and inversely as the space
                    it occupies. For if the same quantity of air be consumed in half the space, the
                    intensity of the heat, or the temperature of that particular place, will be
                    double. Hence it is found that the same quantity of air, by weight, in winter
                    will produce a greater effect on a blast-furnace than in summer, merely from the
                    difference of density. The great difference in produce of iron in the cold and
                    hot seasons of the year is a fact notorious to iron masters.</p>
