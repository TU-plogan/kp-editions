                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                <p><label type="entry">BAYEN, <hi rend="smallcaps">Peter</hi></label>, a celebrated
                    chemist, member of the nstitute of France, was born in 1725, at
                    Chalons-sur-aine. He showed a great inclination to study, and was sent by his
                    parents to school at Troyes, where he went <hi rend="superscript"> 11</hi> ough
                    a course of classical education with success.</p>
                <p>The bent of his disposition was to physical science. He <hi rend="superscript">
                    w</hi> ent to Paris in 1749, and became the pupil and friend of an eminent
                    druggist. In this situation he acquired a complete knowledge of the profession;
                    and, before the age of thirty, he was appointed chief apothecary to the French
                    army in Germany, in the Seven Years’ War, a situation which he filled with
                    industry, intelligence, and integrity.</p>
                <p>After the conclusion of peace, he returned to Paris. The French government had
                    employed Rouelle to name chemists for the purpose of analyzing the mineral
                    waters which are found in different parts of France, and had allotted funds for
                    this purpose. One of the chemists named was Bayen, and he employed himself
                    ardently in these analyses for several years. Eĭis analysis of the waters of
                    Barége and of Bagnĕres de Luchon are published; and besides the detail of
                    accurate and well-contrived chemical processes, they contain matter interesting
                    to the medical man, to the naturalist, and even to the general reader. He
                    resided at the above-named baths, in the Pyrenees, whilst he was employed in
                    analyzing the waters. The project of the French government was not carried
                    farther than the analysis of these waters, so that the public employment of
                    Bayen now ceased.</p>
                <p>He returned to Paris, and made the analysis of different minerals which he had
                    collected chiefly during his residence in the Alpine region of the Pyrenees.
                    Amongst these is the marble of Campan, of which there are two varieties, the red
                    and the green. They are brought from that country to Paris, where they make a
                    distinguished figure in ornamental architecture; as may be seen in the columns
                    of the palace of Great Trianon, in the interior of the church of St Sulpice, and
                    in other great buildings. These analyses are published in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mémoires présentes a l</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">Académie par divers
                    Savans,</hi> commonly called <hi rend="italic">Mémoires des Savans
                    Etrangers.</hi></p>
                <p>He made most accurate experiments on the oxides of mercury, to show that
                    oxidation arises from the absorption of a portion of the atmospheric air, and
                    that the existence of the phlogiston of Stahl could not be proved. Lavoisier was
                    present when the account of these experiments was read, and was employed at the
                    same time in examining the metallic oxides; and it was Lavoisier that brought
                    the subject into a clearer light, and demonstrated the nature of oxygen, and the
                    composition of the atmosphere.</p>
                <p>Bayen published an analysis of tin and pewter. In consequence of the writings of
                    some German chemists, fears had arisen amongst the public, that the use of these
                    metals in culinary vessels was pernicious. Bayen showed that these fears were
                    without any ground, if the pewter be of the legal standard, and be not
                    fraudulently mixed with too great a portion of lead.</p>
                <p>His mode of analyzing minerals required a long time; he exposed the mineral,
                    without being reduced to powder, to the action of sulphuric acid at the
                    temperature of the atmosphere; after this action had continued for a length of
                    time, he got by lixiviation the sulphates formed by the combination of the acid,
                    with the different component elements of the stone. He did not make use of the
                    trituration of the stone to an impalpable powder, nor its fusion with caustic
                    potash, which facilitate the subsequent action of acids, and which are used with
                    so much advantage in the processes of modern chemists. The account he has
                    published of his analysis will nevertheless be instructive to the chemical
                    student, although the excellent and expeditious methods of Klaproth and
                    Vauquelin are those that should be followed in practice.</p>
                <p>He enjoyed good health till sixty, and died at the age of seventy-six, in the
                    year 1801. He was a man of sound judgment, of strict integrity, and acquainted
                    with several other branches of knowledge besides that which he particularly
                    cultivated. There is a collection of his works, entitled <hi rend="italic"
