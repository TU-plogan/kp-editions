                    and great application, he made a considerable progress in literature. Upon the

                    alarmed on account of his reputation as a zealous Catholic; and being seized
                    with a palsy, he died in December, 1679, aged sixty-one. He wrote, 1. The

                    janissary at Venice, accompanied him into the Turkish dominions. Having been
                    abroad two years, he returned and published a relation of his travels in the
                    Levant, which went through several editions. He was knighted by Charles I. and
                    was at the battle of Edge-Hill, at which time he is supposed to have had the
                    charge of the young princes; but after the king’s death he was employed by the
                    parliament and by Cromwell. Nevertheless, on the restoration of the royal family
                    he was appointed high sheriff of the county of Hertford, and lived as a private

                    Holloway, in the county' of Middlesex, on the 12th of September 1649. He was
                    educated under the eye of his father, and always distinguished himself as a
                    lover of liberty, a sincere friend to his country, and a true patron of
                    learning. He was advanced to the degree of baronet by King Charles II. in whose
                    reign he was elected burgess for St Alban’s <pb break="no" facs="nls:193198571" xml:id="kp-eb0704-8571-0712"/>in two
                    parliaments, and was knight of the shire in three parliaments after the
                    Revolution. He wrote in Latin, 1. A Critique on the most celebrated Writers; 2.
                    Essays on several subjects; 3. A Natural History, extracted out of the best
                    modern writers; and, 4. Remarks upon Poetry, with characters and censures of the
                    most considerable poets, whether ancient or modern. He died on the 30th of June

                    of Sir Thomas Pope Blount, had also an excellent capacity, and was an eminent
                    writer. His “<hi rend="italic">Anima Mundi,</hi> or An Historical Narration of
                    the Opinions of the Ancients concerning Man’s Soul after this Life, according to
                    Unenlightened Nature,” gave great offence, and was complained of to the Bishop
                    of Lortdon. But the work which rendered him best known, was his translation of
                    Philostratus’s Life of Apollonius Tyanaeus, published in 1680; which was soon
                    suppressed, as an attack on revealed religion. Another work of a similar
                    complexion he published the same year, called “Great is Diana of the Ephesians;”
                    in which, under colour of exposing superstition, he struck at revelation. In
                    1684 he printed a kind of introduction to polite literature. In the warmth of
                    his zeal for the Revolution, he wrote a pamphlet to prove King William and Queen
                    Mary conquerors; but was condemned to be burnt by both houses of parliament. The
                    close of his life was singularly unhappy; for, after the death of his wife, he
                    became enamoured of her sister, who was only scrupulous about their union on
                    account of their prior connection by marriage. On this subject he wrote a
                    letter, as the case of a third person, with great learning and address. But the
                    archbishop of Canterbury and other divines deciding against him, and the lady on
                    this growing inflexible, these circumstances threw him into a frenzy, during
                    which he shot himself, in 1693. After his death his miscellaneous pieces were
                    collected and published.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
