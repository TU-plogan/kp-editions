                    produced some valuable works in this department, it will also appear that our
                    bibliographical labours have been greatly surpassed by the continental nations.
                    It is to France, in particular, that we are indebted for the most popular and
                    useful treatises in bibliography; but whilst we make this acknowledgement, in
                    which all who have had any experience of their utility will concur, we must add,
                    that some of her bibliographers have spoken in very extravagant terms of the
                    nature and rank of this branch of learning. They represent it as a universal
                    science, in whose ample range all other sciences, and all other kinds of
                    knowledge, are comprehended. “La bibliographie étant la plus étendue de toutes

                    Nothing surely can be more preposterous than to view it in this light, merely
                    because it is conversant about books, and because books are the vehicles of all
                    sorts of knowledge. Yet this is the only foundation that we can discover for
                    these extravagant representations; which tend, as in all other cases of
                    exaggerated pretension, to bring ridicule upon a subject which, were its nature
                    and objects simply and correctly defined, could not fail to appear both useful
                    and important. We have already stated generally what kind of knowledge it is to
                    which the appellation of bibliographical knowledge is applied; but, in order
                    more fully to illustrate its nature, and to point out its limits and utility, we
                    shall endeavour to detail somewhat more particularly the chief objects of
                    inquiry which it embraces.</p><p>It is the business of the bibliographer, then, to trace the history of books in
                    regard to their forms and all other constituents, and, consequently, to trace
                    the beginnings and progress of typography. It belongs to him, in a particular
                    manner, to mark the differences of editions, and to point out that edition of
                    every book which is esteemed the most correct and valuable. In the case of books
                    published anonymously, or under feigned names, it is his business to indicate
                    the names of their real authors, in as far as the discoveries of literary
                    history may furnish the means of doing so. All remarkable facts attaching to the
                    history of books, such as the number of their editions, their rareness, their
                    having been condemned to the flames, or suppressed, belong to the province of
                    bibliographical inquiry. Further, every one who engages in any particular line
                    of study must of course wish to know what books have been published in regard to
                    it, or in regard to any particular point that interests his curiosity; and it is
                    the Business of the bibliographer to furnish this most useful species of
                    information; in other words, the compilation of catalogues of those books which
                    have appeared in the various branches of knowledge constitutes another
                    department of bibliography. It is by means of such catalogues that “the student
                    comes to know what has been written on every part of learning; that he avoids
                    the hazards of encountering difficulties which have already been cleared; of
                    discussing questions which have already been decided; and of digging in mines of
                    literature which have already been exhausted.” (Dr Johnson’s Preface to the <hi rend="italic">Catalogus Bibliothecae ĩĩarleianoeC)</hi></p><p>Such are the principal objects and pursuits of the bibliographer; and while it
                    must appear abundantly evident that his science has no pretensions to those
                    lofty epithets upon which we have animadverted, it must, we think, be allowed by
                    every one that it comprises many curious as well as interesting subjects of
                    inquiry; and that it is calculated to afford very useful aid⅛ to every other
                    species of intellectual occupation. This view of it will be fully confirmed by
                    the details which we are to offer in the course of this article; in which we
                    propose to point out the progress and best sources of information, in all those
                    departments of knowledge to which we have alluded. In doing so, we shall divide
                    the subject into such heads as shall appear best suited to the purposes
                    intended.</p><p>I. <hi rend="italic">Of the Constituent Parts of Boohs, and the Differences of
                    Editions.</hi></p><p>The history of the materials employed in the formation of books, of the art of
                    writing and printing upon these materials, and of the forms and sizes in which
                    they have appeared, all belong to this head of inquiry. Almost the whole of
                    these particulars have furnished topics for much elaborate research, and some of
                    them for speculations and disputes not yet brought to any satisfactory
                    conclusion; but as our main object at present is to indicate the inquiries which
                    belong to the different departments of bibliography, together with the best
                    guides to information in each, our notices of the subjects in question must be
                    limited to what is necessary for that purpose. Most of them, indeed, necessarily
                    form the subjects of separate articles in an Encyclopaedia.</p><p>Much curious learning has been exercised in describing the various substances
                    used for writings, previously to the important discovery of the art of making
                    paper from linen rags. The precise era of this discovery is not known, nor are
                    authors agreed as to the country in which it was made; but it seems to be
                    ascertained that this kind of paper was in general use in Europe before the end
                    of the fourteenth century. Cotton paper had been in general use more than a
                    century before; and though of greatly inferior quality, its introduction was one
                    of the most fortunate circumstances in the history of the arts; for parchment
                    had become so scarce, that old writings were often erased, in order to apply the
                    parchment to modern purposes; and thus, by a metamorphosis of a singular and
                    fatal kind, a classic was sometimes transformed into a vapid homily or monkish
                    legend. In this way it is supposed that many valuable works of antiquity have
                    perished; and, indeed, there can be little doubt of this, when we consider the
                    number of manuscripts that have been discovered, evidently written upon erased
                    parchments. Parchments of this kind have been called <hi rend="italic">palimpsests,</hi> from a Greek word signifying twice rubbed; that is, prepared
                    for writing. <hi rend="italic">(Edinburgh Review,</hi> No xcvi. p. 367.) Dr
                    Barret of Trinity College, Dublin, discovered a palimpsest, while examining some
                    books in the library of that college. “When thus employed, he accidentally met
                    with a very ancient Greek manuscript, on certain leaves of which he observed a
                    twofold writing, one ancient, and the other, comparatively recent, transcribed
                    over the former. The original writing had been greatly defaced; but, on close
                    examination, he found that it consisted of the three following fragments :—The
                    Prophet Isaiah, the Evangelist St Matthew, and certain Orations of Gregory
                    Nazianzen. The fragment containing St Matthew’s Gospel Dr Barret carefully
                    transcribed, and it has been accurately engraved in fac-similé, and published by
                    the order and at the expense of the university. The original writing, or <hi rend="italic">Codex Vetus,</hi> Dr Barret, with great probability, assigns to
                    the sixth century; the <hi rend="italic">Codex Recens,</hi> or later writing, he
                    attributes to the thirteenth.” (Horne’s <hi rend="italic">Introduction to
                    Bib</hi><pb break="no" facs="nls:193197401" xml:id="kp-eb0704-7401-0622"/><hi rend="italic">liography,</hi> i. p. 115.) But
                    the most interesting discoveries in this line are those of Angelo Maio,
                    librarian of the Vatican library, to whom we are indebted for a considerable
                    fragment of Cicero <hi rend="italic">de Republica,</hi> and fragments of three
                    of his lost orations. The reader will find a curious account of these
                    discoveries, and of the history of <hi rend="italic">palimpsests.,</hi> in the
                    above-cited article of the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Review.</hi></p><p>That part of the history of books which regards the various substances upon which
                    they have been written, is compendiously but learnedly treated in the first
                    volume of that very valuable work, the <hi rend="italic">Nouveau Traite de
                    Diplomatique,</hi> compiled by two Benedictines of the celebrated society of St
                    Maur. This work was published at Paris in 1750, in six volumes quarto. Μ.
                    Peignot gives a complete list of separate works on this subject in the
                    introduction to his <hi rend="italic">Essai sur l’Histoire du Parchemin et du
                    Vélin,</hi> published at Paris in 1812.</p><p>The inquiry as to the origin of writing is a purely philosophical speculation;
                    but the knowledge of the different kinds of writing peculiar to different ages
                    is a branch of the history of books which belongs to the province of
                    bibliography, and upon which much information will be found in the
                    above-mentioned work of the Benedictines of St Maur. One of the best books on
                    this subject is Mr Astle’s <hi rend="italic">Origin and Progress of
                    Writing,</hi> the first edition of which was published in 1784, and the second,
                    with some additions, in 1803, each in one volume quarto. The chapters on
                    transcribers and illuminators, and the instruments, inks, and other matters
                    which they made use of in their operations, will be found peculiarly interesting
                    to the bibliographer.</p><p>We are now so familiar with the wonders and glorious results of printing, that it
                    is only when we look back into the history of the darker ages that we are made
                    fully sensible of all the various advantages which it has conferred upon
                    mankind. The mention of the <hi rend="italic">transcribers,</hi> that is, the
                    class employed to copy books before the discovery of printing, naturally gives
                    rise to reflections of this kind. Their ignorance and carelessness occasioned
                    much trouble and mortification to living authors, and irreparable errors in the
                    works of the dead. Petrarch, who flourished in the fourteenth century, has
                    expressed himself in very moving terms in regard to this evil. “How shall we
                    find out a remedy,” says he, “for those mischiefs which the ignorance and
                    inattention of the copyists inflict upon us? It is wholly owing to these causes
                    that many men of genius keep their most valuable pieces unpublished, so that
                    they never see the light. Were Cicero, Livy, or Pliny, to rise from the dead,
                    they would scarcely be able to recognise their own writings. In every page they
                    would have occasion to exclaim against the ignorance and the corruptions of
                    those barbarous transcribers.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Lambinet,</hi> Origine de l’Imprimerie,
                    <hi rend="italic">tome i. p. 38, 39.</hi></p></note> Upon the invention of
                    printing, the class of copyists immediately took alarm, and exerted every means
                    to extinguish an art which, whatever benefits it promised the rest of mankind,
                    held out nothing but prospects of loss to them. They endeavoured, and their
                    example is still steadily followed by other crafts, to set up their own petty
                    interests in opposition to the general good, and called loudly upon the
                    different governments to invest them with exclusive privileges, which all the
                    great interests of society required to be abolished. Thus, when printing was
                    introduced at Paris, the copyists complained of the innovation to the
                    parliament, and that body forthwith caused the books belonging to the printers
                    to be seized and confiscated; but Louis XI. had the good sense to restore their
                    property to these ingenious artists, and to authorize them to proceed in their
                    laudable vocation.</p><p>The question as to the origin of printing is of a complexion wholly different
                    from that regarding the origin of writing, as it turns entirely upon matters of
                    fact; but it is not the less true, that it is a subject upon which opinions
                    widely opposite are still entertained; for though this art, we mean the art of
                    printing with movable types, was spread all over Europe within twenty years of
                    the first discovery, it has unfortunately failed to record, in decisive terms,
                    the name of the individual to whom the honour of the invention is due. The place
                    where the discovery was made remains also a subject of doubt and contention. In
                    Mallinkrot’s work, <hi rend="italic">De Òrtu et Progressu Artis
                    Typographicae,</hi> published in 1640, he enumerates a hundred and nine
                    testimonies in favour of Mentz as the birthplace of the art, and since that time
                    the number has been greatly augmented; yet one of the latest of those who have
                    engaged in this controversy declares decidedly in favour of Haerlem, which, in
                    Mallinkrot’s day, ranked only thirteen advocates; and further, assigns the
                    wreath which the supporters of Mentz had variously placed on the brow of
                    Guttenberg, of Faust, and of Schoiffer, to Lawrence Coster, as its rightful
                    owner.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">See Ottley’s</hi> Inquiry into tlx Origin and early History of Engraving, <hi rend="italic">chap. iii.</hi></p></note> All that we can do in this place is to
                    point out some of the works which have been published upon the origin and
                    history of printing, and which it may be necessary for the bibliographer to
                    examine, in order to enable him to judge of early editions; recommending those
                    who wish to see a clear and compendious view of the various opinions which have
                    been advanced upon this subject, to peruse Μ. Daunou’s analysis of these
                    opinions, published in the fourth volume of the <hi rend="italic">Memoirs</hi>
                    of the Moral and Political Class of the French Institute.</p><p>The <hi rend="italic">Monumenta Typographica</hi> of Wolfius, published in two
                    octavo volumes, at Hamburg, in 1740, contains a valuable and curious collection
                    of treatises by various authors, and also of extracts illustrative of the origin
                    and early history of the art. Some of these pieces are in verse. Among several
                    other elaborate tables, it contains one of all the authors who, up to that time,
                    had either directly or indirectly treated of the history or of the mechanical
                    part of printing. Meerman’s <hi rend="italic">Origines Typographicae</hi> is one
                    of the most instructive works as to the progress of the art. It is illustrated
                    with various specimens of early printing, and fac-similés of the books called
                    <hi rend="italic">Block-Looks,</hi> printed by means of wooden blocks. Meerman,
                    who was a lawyer, and author of many elaborate treatises in the civil and canon
                    law, was born at Leyden in 1722, and died in 1771, six years after the
                    publication of his <hi rend="italic">Origines;</hi> in which he supports, with
                    great ardour and learning, the pretensions of Haerlem as the birthplace of the
                    art, and of Lawrence Coster as its inventor. Another work of curious research on
                    the origin and firs) progress of printing is that of Prosper Marchand,
                    originally a bookseller at Paris, but whom the repeal of the edict of Nantz
                    drove to Holland, where he employed himself till his death in 1756, in composing
                    various works m literary history and bibliography. He makes Guttenberg the
                    inventor of the art, and Mentz the place where he completed the invention; the
                    first idea of it, however, having been formed whilst he resided in Strasburg.
                    This work, entitled <hi rend="italic">Histoire de l’ Origine et des premiers
                    Progrès de l’imprimerie,</hi> was published in 1740. A valuable supplement, in
                    which some errors of Marchand are corrected, was published by Μ. Mercier, abbé
                    de Saint Leger, in <pb break="no" facs="nls:193197414" xml:id="kp-eb0704-7414-0623"/>1773, and republished in 1775. The author of the
                    original work was not at all pleased with this supplement, and he accordingly
                    criticised it with great severity in a long letter addressed to, and published
                    by the editors of the <hi rend="italic">Journal des Savans.</hi> The opinion
                    that Guttenberg conceived the first idea of the invention at Strasburg, and
                    afterwards completed it at Mentz, is also supported by Lambinet, in his <hi rend="italic">Becherches historiques, littéraires, et critiques sur ΐ Origine de
                    lPmprimerie,</hi> first published at Brussels in 1799, and republished in two
                    volumes octavo at Paris in 1810, with the addition of M. D. Daunou’s treatise
                    already mentioned. Besides the main subject of inquiry, Μ. Lambinet’s work
                    includes various other topics,—such as the history of the substances employed
                    for books, of inks, of engraving in relief, of block-printing, and of stereotype
                    printing. Upon the history of printing, we shall only mention further, Μ. de la
                    Serna Santander’s Essay prefixed to his <hi rend="italic">Dictionnaire
                    Bibliographique,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Initia Typographica</hi> of
                    Professor Lichtenberger, published at Strasburg in 1811; in both of which the
                    claims set up for Coster are treated as fabulous,—Guttenberg being represented
                    as the inventor of the art, and Mentz the place where it was perfected; and in
                    both of which, also, there are ample details as to its progress in other cities
                    and countries.</p><p>Besides the information afforded by these general histories as to the diffusion
                    of printing throughout Europe, there are various treatises on its establishment
                    in particular countries and places, which it will often be necessary for the
                    bibliographer to consult. One of the most valuable, particularly to the English
                    bibliographer, is Ames’s <hi rend="italic">Typographical Antiquities,</hi> which
                    contains memoirs of our early printers, and a register of their publications,
                    from 1471 to 1600. The first edition, published in 1749, consisted of one volume
                    quarto. Another edition, enlarged by Mr Herbert to three volumes quarto, was
                    completed in 1790; and a third, illustrated with many embellishments, and
                    containing some valuable additions, has been published by the Rev. Dr Dibdin.
                    The French, Germans, and Italians, particularly the latter, are rich in
                    typographical histories of this description; but for accounts of them we must
                    refer our readers to Peignot’s <hi rend="italic">Répertoire Bibliographique
                    Universel,</hi> where they are enumerated and described.</p><p>A knowledge of the different classes and forms of the letters used in printing is
                    necessary to the accurate description of books, and discrimination of editions.
                    The bibliographer must also be acquainted with the corresponding appellations
                    assigned to the different forms by foreign printers. Thus the form named <hi rend="italic">pica</hi> by English printers, is called <hi rend="italic">Cicero</hi> by those of France and Germany, because Cicero’s <hi rend="italic">Epistles</hi> were printed in that type. The form called <hi rend="italic">paragon</hi> is the only one which retains the same name among the printers of
                    all countries. Upon all these points, Stower’s <hi rend="italic">Printers
                    Grammar,</hi> and Four-mer s <hi rend="italic">Manuel Typographique,</hi> may be
                    consulted with advantage. The latter is rich in specimens very neatly
                    executed.</p><p>The books of the ancients were generally in the form of cylinders, made by
                    rolling the joined sheets upon a stick, to the ends of which nobs or balls were
                    affixed, often richly ornamented. In the infancy of printing the sizes were
                    generally folio and quarto; and some have supposed that no books were printed in
                    the smaller forms till after 1480; but Μ. Peignot instances many editions in the
                    smallest forms, of an earlier date; as may be seen in the article <hi rend="italic">Format</hi> of the Supplement to his <hi rend="italic">Dictionnaire de Bibliologie.</hi> An accurate knowledge of the different forms
                    of books is necessary to the bibliographer, as without it no book can be
                    correctly described; and however easy of acquisition this knowledge may appear,
                    it is yet certain that errors in this respect are sometimes committed even by
                    experienced bibliographers; and that doubts have been entertained as to the
                    existence of editions, owing to their forms having been inaccurately
                    described.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See <hi rend="italic">Boulard,</hi> Traité Elémentaire de Bibliographie, <hi rend="italic">p. 38, 39.</hi></p></note> These mistakes generally proceed from
                    this, that there are different sizes of paper comprehended under the same name.
                    But the water-lines in the sheets afford a test; as they are uniformly
                    perpendicular in the folio and octavo, and horizonτ tal in the quarto and
                    duodecimo sizes.</p><p>When books have gone through more than one edition, various minute inquiries must
                    often be made, in order to determine the respective merits of those editions. It
                    is a principal object of the bibliographical dictionaries, to be afterwards
                    mentioned, to point out those editions of important works which such inquiries
                    have ascertained to be the best. There are many particulars in which one edition
                    may differ from, or excel another. There may be differences and grounds of
                    preference in size, in paper, and in printing. The text of one edition may be
                    more correct than that either of a preceding or a subsequent one. An author
                    sometimes corrects errors, makes alterations, or introduces new matter when his
                    work comes to be reprinted, thereby giving the edition so altered a decided
                    superiority over its predecessor. One edition may differ from another by having
                    notes, an index, or table of contents, which that other wants; or these
                    accompaniments may themselves furnish grounds of preference by being superior in
                    their kind in particular editions. Plates make great differences in the value of
                    editions, and even in the value of copies of the same edition. In the
                    beautifully engraved edition of Horace by Pine, there is, in the copies first
                    thrown off, a small error, which serves as a test by which bibliographers
                    immediately judge whether any copy has the best impressions of those elegant
                    vignettes which illustrate that edition. The medal of Augustus, on page 108 of
                    the second volume, has, in the copies first thrown off, the incorrect reading
                    <hi rend="italic">Post Est</hi> for <hi rend="italic">Potest;</hi> this was
                    rectified in the after impressions; but as the plates had previously sustained
                    some injury, the copies which show the incorrect reading are, of course,
                    esteemed the best. Dr Dibdin, in his work on the <hi rend="italic">Bibliomania,</hi> points out this as an instance of preference founded on a <hi rend="italic">defect;</hi> whereas the ground of preference is the superiority
                    of the impressions, ascertained, without the necessity of any comparison, by the
                    presence of this trifling defect. There are sometimes differences between copies
                    of the same edition of a work,·<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Ihe</hi> Voyage to Cadiz <hi rend="italic">is sometimes wanting in Hakluyt’s</hi> Collection. <hi rend="italic">A reprint

                    stand to each other in the same relation as if there had been another edition
                    with some variations. Walton’s <hi rend="italic">Polyglot Bible</hi> is a
                    celebrated instance. The printing of that great work, for which Cromwell
                    liberally allowed paper to be imported free of duty, was begun in 1653, and
                    completed in 1657; and the preface to it, in some copies, contains a respectful
                    acknowledgement of this piece of patronage on the part of the protector; but in
                    other copies the compliment is expunged, and replaced by some invectives against
                    the republicans; Dr Walton having, on the restoration, printed another preface
                    to the <pb break="no" facs="nls:193197427" xml:id="kp-eb0704-7427-0624"/>copies which had not by that time been disposed

                    original preface are much rarer, and. of course more prized, than those with the
                    loyal one, which latter seems to have helped the author to the bishopric he
                    afterwards obtained.</p><p>II. <hi rend="italic">Of Early Printed Boohs·</hi></p><p>The productions of the press, in the different countries of Europe, during the
                    century in which printing was invented, have engaged much of the attention of
                    bibliographers, and have been described in various works compiled for that
                    purpose. The first of those productions to which the name of <hi rend="italic">Boohs</hi> has been applied, were printed, not with movable types, but with
                    solid wooden blocks; and consisted of a few leaves only, on which were impressed
                    images of saints, and other historical pictures, with appropriate texts or
                    descriptions. These leaves were printed only on one side, and the blank sides
                    were generally, though not always, pasted together, so as to look like single
                    leaves. The ink used was of a brownish hue, and glutinous quality, to prevent it
                    from spreading. These curious specimens of the infant art are called <hi rend="italic">Image Boohs</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Bloch Boohs.</hi> They have
                    often been largely described, every particular concerning them having been
                    fondly canvassed by bibliographers. Their number is fixed by some at seven, by
                    others carried to ten; but there have been numerous editions of most of them;
                    for they maintained their popularity long after the invention of the art of
                    printing properly so called. One of the most celebrated is the <hi rend="italic">Biblia Pauperum,</hi> consisting of forty leaves printed on one side, so as to
                    make twenty when pasted together; upon which, certain historical passages of the
                    Old and New Testament are represented by means of figures, with inscriptions. It
                    was originally intended, as its name imports, for the use of those poor persons
                    who could not afford to purchase complete copies of the Bible. There is a
                    copious account of all the <hi rend="italic">Bloch Boohs,</hi> in Baron
                    Heinecken’s learned work, <hi rend="italic">Idee generale dune Collection
                    complette d’Estampes,</hi> published in 1771, in one volume octavo. Dr Dibdin’s
                    <hi rend="italic">Bibliotheca Spenceriana</hi> contains fac-similés of the
                    figures in several of them, as does Mr Ottley’s <hi rend="italic">History of
                    Engraving.</hi></p><p>The first book of any considerable magnitude printed with movable metallic types
                    was the celebrated <hi rend="italic">editio princeps</hi> of the Bible, printed
                    at Mentz, between the years 1450. and 1455. It is printed in large but handsome
                    Gothic characters, to resemble manuscript, having two columns in the page, and
                    consisting in whole of 637 leaves, divided into two, three, or four volumes,
                    according to the taste of the binder. The advance from the rude <hi rend="italic">Bloch Boohs,</hi> of a few leaves, to this noble monument of early
                    typography, is great indeed; and it is impossible not to regret that there
                    should be still so much uncertainty as to the person whose ingenuity furnished
                    the means of at once raising almost to perfection an art destined ever after to
                    exercise so vast and so beneficial an influence on the affairs of the world. The
                    <hi rend="italic">Psalter,</hi> printed at Mentz by Faust and Schoiffer, in
                    1457, is the first book which bears the printer s name, with the date and place
                    of printing.</p><p>In general, in the very early printed books, the name or the printer, the

                    placed at the end of the book, with some quaint ejaculation or doxology. The
                    pages have no running title, or number, or catch-word, or signature
                    letters,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Signatures <hi rend="italic">are letters of the alphabet placed at the bottom of the page, to

                    Pans 1476; by Caxton, not before 1480.” (Middleton’s</hi> Works, <hi rend="italic">voh iii. p. 238.)</hi></p></note> to mark the order of the sheets.
                    The character is uniformly Gothic till 1467, when the Roman type was first
                    introduced. There were no capitals to begin sentences; the only points used were
                    the colon and full stop; and in almost every sentence there were abbreviations
                    or contractions. In regard to these and other peculiarities of early printed
                    books, the reader may consult the following works: <hi rend="italic">The General
                    History f Printing,</hi> by Palmer (supposed, however, to have been chiefly
                    written by the celebrated George Psalmanazar); Jungendres, <hi rend="italic">Be

                    Origine des Signatures, et des Chiffres de Page,</hi> par Marolles.</p><p>Many of the early printers had peculiar marks or vignettes, which they sometimes
                    placed on the title-page, sometimes at the end of the books printed by them; and
                    most of them also made use of monograms or ciphers, compounded of the initial or
                    other letters of their names. These furnish a clue to the discovery of the
                    printer, where they occur on books without any printer’s name. An acquaintance
                    with them, therefore, is necessary to the bibliographer, because questions occur
                    as to early editions which can only be decided by ascertaining the printer’s
                    name. For explanations of these marks, the following works may be consulted:
                    Orlandi’s <hi rend="italic">Origine e Progressi della Stampa,</hi> published at
                    Bologna in one volume 4to, in 1722; and Scholtzius’s <hi rend="italic">Thesaurus
                    Symbolorum ae Emblematum,</hi> in one volume folio, published at Nuremberg in
                    1730. The monograms of the early English printers are explained in Ames’s <hi rend="italic">Typographical Antiquities.</hi></p><p>The following works may be mentioned as among the best of those that have been
                    devoted to the description of early printed books: 1. <hi rend="italic">Index
                    Librorum ab inventa Τyρο∙ graphia ad annum</hi> 1500, <hi rend="italic">cum
                    notis; 2</hi> vols. 8vo, 1791. This work, by Laire, is one of the most useful of
                    its kind. The descriptions are clear, the notes brief and instructive; and there
                    are four indexes, which furnish the means of ready reference to all the names,
                    titles, places, and bibliographical notices contained in the work. 2. <hi rend="italic">Dictionnaire Bibliographique choisi du quinzième siècle;</hi> par
                    Μ. de la Serna Santander; 3 vols. 8vo, 1805. This is a very learned and exact
                    work; and, like the preceding one, embraces only the rarest and most interesting
                    publications of the fifteenth century. 3. <hi rend="italic">Bibliotheca

                    vols. 8vo, 1814. The abundance and beauty of the facsimiles and other
                    embellishments, as well as the fineness of the paper and printing, render this
                    one of the most splendid bibliographical works ever published in any country. It
                    contains some curious information, enveloped, however, in a much greater
                    proportion of tasteless and irrelevant matter. 4. <hi rend="italic">Annales

                    follows: In 1719, volume first, which embraces the period from the origin of
                    printing to 1500; volume second, published in 1722, extends the annals to 1536;
                    and volume third, published in 1726, brings them down, according to the
                    title-page, to 1557; but there is an appendix which affords a partial
                    continuation to 1664. In 1733 the ∏rst volume was republished, with corrections
                    and large additions, and is commonly called the fourth volume. 1 *∙ fifth and
                    last volume, containing indexes, was pubhshe in 1741. As four of the volumes
                    consist each of twe <pb break="no" facs="nls:193197440" xml:id="kp-eb0704-7440-0625"/>parts, the work is sometimes bound in five,
                    sometimes in nine volumes. Several supplements to this elaborate work have been
                    published; the most valuable of them, that by Denis, in two volumes 4to, was
                    published at Vienna in 1789, and contains 6311 articles omitted by Maittaire.
                    The latter has enriched his annals with many learned dissertations; and the work
                    is allowed to be the most important that has yet been compiled in England, in
                    any department of bibliography; but though written in this country, the last was
                    the only volume published in it, the others having been given to the world in
                    Holland. 5. <hi rend="italic">Annales Typographici ab artis inventée origine, ad

                    arrangement, is unquestionably the most complete of its kind that has yet
                    appeared. It comes down to the year 1536, though the title-page of the first
                    volume limits it to the fifteenth century.</p><p>The works just described are quite indispensable to every bibliographical
                    collection; but they have a value, we think, independent of the assistance which
                    they afford the bibliographer in his examination of the early productions of the
                    press: they are also calculated to interest the philosopher as curious registers
                    of the extent and objects of intellectual industry, during a period when the
                    human mind began to be acted upon by many new impulses, and to receive the seeds
                    of revolutions destined to change the whole aspect of the intellectual
                    world.</p><p>III. <hi rend="italic">Of Rare Books.</hi></p><p>Rareness is a circumstance which must, generally speaking, confer some degree of
                    value upon books; and it is therefore one of the objects of bibliography to
                    indicate those books which, in a greater or less degree, come under this
                    category. A passion for collecting books, merely because they are rare, without
                    inquiry as to any literary purpose they may be calculated to serve, is no doubt
                    a very foolish habitude; but it is just as foolish, on the other hand, to
                    ridicule all solicitude about books of this description; for this implies that
                    every valuable book is common,—a notion which no one can entertain who ever has
                    had occasion to follow out any particular line of literary research, to decide
                    upon any fact involved in doubt or controversy, or to speculate upon the
                    progress of knowledge either in the sciences or the arts. With regard to the
                    bibliographical compilations appropriated to the description of books of this
                    class, it may be observed of most, if not. all of them, that they have applied
                    the epithet <hi rend="italic">rare</hi> much too vaguely and lavishly. It must,
                    indeed, in a multitude of cases, be exceedingly difficult to speak with
                    precision on this point; so difficult as to render it impossible, we apprehend,
                    to compile a work of this kind which shall not frequently mislead those who
                    consult it.</p><p>David Clement, the author of a very learned work of this class, which we shall
                    immediately notice, assigns the following as the different degrees in which
                    books may be said to be rare. A book which it is difficult to find in the
                    country where it is sought, ought to be called, simply, <hi rend="italic">rare;</hi> a book which it is difficult to find in any country, <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi>] <hi rend="superscript"> la</hi> y be called <hi rend="italic">very rare;</hi> a book of which there are only fifty or sixty
                    copies existing, or which appears as seldom as if there never had been more at
                    any time than that number of copies, ranks as <hi rend="italic">extremely
                    rare;</hi> and when the whole number of copies does not exceed ten, this consti
                    tutes <hi rend="italic">excessive</hi> rarity, or rarity in the highest degree.
                    This classification of the degrees of rareness is copied from Clement by all
                    subsequent bibliographical writers in this department. It is abundantly obvious,
                    that the justness of the application of these terms to particular books must
                    entirely depend on the accuracy and precision of the knowledge with which they
                    are used.</p><p>We cannot in this department, anymore than in others, indicate any but the most
                    prominent and useful books belonging to it. The following, in this view, are
                    particularly worthy of attention :—1. Beyeri <hi rend="italic">Memoriae
                    historicocriticae Librorum rariorum,</hi> 1734,8vo. 2. Vogt, <hi rend="italic">Catalogus historicocriticus Librorum rariorum,</hi> 1732, 8vo. The last and
                    best edition was published in 1793. In this work the epithet <hi rend="italic">rare</hi> is applied with more judgment and knowledge than in most others of
                    the same class. 3. Gerdesii <hi rend="italic">Florilegium historicocriticum
                    Librorum rariorum;</hi> first published in 1740, and again in 1763, in 8vo. It
                    was partly intended as a supplement to the above work by Vogt, and therefore
                    notices only those books which are not included in his catalogue. 4. <hi rend="italic">Bibliothèque curieuse, ou Catalogue raisonné des Livres
                    rares,</hi> par D. Clement, 1750-60. This work, to which we have just alluded,
                    is compiled upon a more extensive plan than any of the preceding; for, though
                    consisting of nine volumes quarto, it comes down no farther than to the letter H
                    in the alphabetical arrangement of names; terminating here in consequence of the
                    death of the author. Clement is generally blamed, and with justice, for a very
                    profuse and inaccurate application of his own nomenclature; his notes, too, are
                    crammed with citations, and tediously minute; but, on the other hand, it must be
                    allowed that they contain many curious morsels of literary history; and it has,
                    upon the whole, been matter of regret to bibliographers, that the work,
                    voluminous as it must have proved, was not completed. 5. <hi rend="italic">Bibliotheca Librorum rariorum universalis.</hi> Auctore Jo. Jac. Bauer, 7 vols.
                    8vo, 1770-91. This is one of the latest publications of its class. It contains
                    only the titles of books, without any further notices; and it must, therefore,
                    be evident, that seven volumes could not be occupied with the titles only of
                    books justly called rare.</p><p>IV. <hi rend="italic">Of the Classics.</hi></p><p>It is remarked by Mr Roscoe, “that the coincidence of the discovery of the art of
                    printing with the spirit of the times in which it had birth was highly
                    fortunate. Had it been made known at a much earlier period, it would have been
                    disregarded or forgotten, from the mere want of materials on which to exercise
                    it; and had it been farther postponed, it is probable that many works would have
                    been totally lost which are now justly regarded as the noblest monuments of the

                    diffusion of the art, and the speedy appearance of the <hi rend="italic">Classics</hi> in an imperishable form, afford sufficient proofs of the bent of
                    the age, and the opportuneness of this great discovery. Gabriel Naudĕ observes,
                    that almost all the good as well as bad books then in Europe had passed through
                    the press before the year 1474;<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Addition à ľHistoire de Louis Jll. <hi rend="italic">Par G.

                    which the use of movable types can be carried. Within this period editions had
                    been printed of nearly all the Latin classics. The whole works of some of them,
                    of Cicero, for example, had not yet appeared in one uniform edition; but several
                    of his treatises, the whole of Pliny the elder, of Livy, Sallust, Caesar,
                    Tacitus, Suetonius, Justin, Lucan, Virgil, and Horace, had been published before
                    the end of 1470. Most of the early editions of the classics were <pb break="no" facs="nls:193197453" xml:id="kp-eb0704-7453-0626"/>published in
                    Italy. England remained greatly behind her continental neighbours in the
                    naturalization of these precious remains of ancient learning. Of all the
                    classics, only Terence, and Cicero’s <hi rend="italic">Offices,</hi> had, in
                    1540, been published in this country in their original tongue. Caxton and others
                    made use only of French translations in the early versions and abridgements
                    published in England. Gawin Douglas, bishop of Dunkeld, so well known for his
                    poetical version of Virgil, has, in his preface to that work, commemorated his
                    indignation at the injustice done to “the divine poet” by Caxton’s second-hand
                    translation, in the following curious and emphatic lines:</p><lg part="N"><l part="N"> Thoch Wylliame Caxtoun had no compatioun </l><l part="N"> Of Virgill in that buk he preyt in prois, </l><l part="N"> Clepand it Virgill in Eneados, </l><l part="N"> Quhilk that he sayis of Frensche he did translait, </l><l part="N"> It has nathing ado therwith, God wate, </l><l part="N"> Nor na mare like than the Deuil and sanct Austin. </l><l part="N"> Haue he na thank tharfore, bot lois his pyne; </l><l part="N"> So schamefully the storie did peruerte, </l><l part="N"> I reid his work with harmes at my hert, </l><l part="N"> That sic ane buk, but sentence or ingyne, </l><l part="N"> Suld be intituiit eftir the poete diuine. </l><l part="N"> His ornate goldin versis mare than gylt; </l><l part="N"> I spitte for disspite to se thame spylt </l><l part="N"> With sic ane wicht, quhilk treuly be myne entent </l><l part="N"> Knew nevir thre wordis at all quhat Virgill ment. </l></lg><p>Almost all the Latin classics had appeared in print before the art was employed
                    upon any Greek author. But the desire to possess printed editions of the latter
                    became general and urgent towards the end of the fifteenth century; and Aldus
                    had the glory of ministering to that desire, by publishing in rapid succession,
                    and with singular beauty and correctness, almost all the principal authors in
                    that tongue. Beginning in 1494 with Musaeus’s <hi rend="italic">Hero and
                    Leander,</hi> he printed before 1515, the year of his death, upwards of sixty
                    considerable works in Grecian literature, frequently superadding the learning
                    and cares of the editor to those of the printer. “Yet his glory,” to use the
                    words of Mr Gibbon, “must not tempt us to forget that .the first Greek book, the
                    <hi rend="italic">Grammar</hi> of Constantine Lascaris, was printed at Milan in
                    1476; and that the Florence Homer of 1488 displays all the luxury of the
                    typographical art.” <hi rend="italic">(History,</hi> chap. 66.) Besides these
                    works, there had been published before 1494, some Greek <hi rend="italic">Psalters,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Batrachomyomachia</hi> of Homer, and the
                    <hi rend="italic">Orations</hi> of Isocrates; during that year, the <hi rend="italic">Anthologia Graeca</hi> was published at Florence; and the works of
                    Callimachus, of Apollonius Rhodius, and of Lucian, were published at the same
                    place within two years after the first essays of Aldus in Greek printing. Thus,
                    though we have no sort of wish to detract from the just fame of this learned and
                    beautiful printer, we cannot admit the propriety of those eulogies of his
                    biographer Μ. Renouard, in which he is represented as having given an entirely
                    new direction to the art of printing, and indeed to the literary taste of
                    Europe.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Annales de

                    unphilosophical, to ascribe to Aldus the production of that taste for Grecian
                    literature which he himself imbibed from the spirit of his age. He saw that
                    there was a great and growing want of Greek books; and his peculiar praise lies
                    in this, that he applied himself to supply it, with much more constancy and
                    skill, and with much more learning, than any other printer of that period. All
                    that we have said on this point is fully corroborated by the account which he
                    has himself given, in his preface to Aristotle’s <hi rend="italic">Organon,</hi>
                    published in 1495, or the circumstances which induced him to undertake the
                    publication of the Greek classics. The passage is thus translated by Mr Roscoe
                    <hi rend="italic">(Life of Leo the Tenth,</hi> vol. i. p. 110): “The necessity
                    of Greek literature is now universally acknowledged; insomuch that not only our
                    youth endeavour to acquire it, but it is studied even by those advanced in
                    years. We read but of one Cato among the Romans who studied Greek in his old
                    age, but in our times we have many Catos; and the number of our youth who apply
                    themselves to the study of Greek is almost as great as of those who study the
                    Latin tongue; so that Greek books, of which there are but few in existence, are
                    now eagerly sought after. But by the assistance of Jesus Christ I hope ere long
                    to supply this deficiency, although it can only be accomplished by great labour,
                    inconvenience, and loss of time. Those who cultivate letters must be supplied
                    with books necessary for their purpose, and till this supply be obtained I shall
                    not be at rest.”</p><p>The <hi rend="italic">Editiones Principes</hi> of the classics have always formed
                    capital objects in bibliography, and are sometimes spoken of with a degree of
                    rapture in bibliographical works, which is apt to appear inappropriate and
                    unreasonable to those who value books solely as they are calculated to afford
                    delight or information. The lover of first editions has, however, some plausible
                    reasons to assign in justification of this expensive, and, as some think,
                    factitious passion. These editions are valuable, in the first place, as curious
                    monuments of early typography, and, in the next place, as more faithful
                    representatives of the best ancient manuscripts than any other editions. <hi rend="italic">Earum editionum authoritatem,</hi> says Maittaire, αZfi <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> s <hi rend="italic">omnibus essepraferendarn, quippe
                    quae sola MSS. fide nitatur.</hi> This ground of preference, however, has some
                    learned oppugners. Schelhorn, in his <hi rend="italic">Amaenitates
                    Literariae,</hi> speaks of those to whom we are indebted for the first editions
                    of the classics, as, in general, very ignorant men; quite incapable to collate
                    manuscripts themselves, and seldom taking assistance from those who were. The
                    first manuscript that could be procured, it has been said by others, and not
                    that which, after a careful collation, appeared entitled to a preference, was
                    hastily committed to the press, in order to take advantage of the recent
                    discovery. Thus Graevius, in the preface to his edition of Cicero <hi rend="italic">De Officiis,</hi> states, that the celebrated <hi rend="italic">editio princeps</hi> of that work, by Faust, was printed from a very inaccurate
                    manuscript.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">See a curious chapter on</hi> First Editions <hi rend="italic">in

                    On the other hand, there are many who view those editions in the same light with
                    Maittaire. Μ. La Grange assures us, in the preface to his French translation of
                    Seneca’s works, that he never, in any case of difficulty, consulted the <hi rend="italic">edih(&gt; princeps</hi> of 1475, without finding there a solution
                    of his doubts; adding generally, <hi rend="italic">que ceux qui stwdient les
                    auteurs anciens, soit pour en donner des éditions correctes, soit pour les
                    traduire dans une autre langue, doivent avoir sans cesse sous les yeux les
                    premiers éditions de ces auteurs·</hi> J° the same purpose, Μ. Santander
                    observes, that the <hi rend="italic">editf&gt; princeps</hi> of Pliny the elder,
                    printed at Venice by Spira in 1469, is in many places more accurate than the
                    celebrated edition of Father. Hardouin. The truth seems to be, that though many
                    first editions have a real literary value, for such purposes as are specified by
                    Μ. La Grange, there are others which have no value save what their extreme<pb break="no" facs="nls:193197466" xml:id="kp-eb0704-7466-0627"/>
                    rareness gives them; that, therefore, they who scoff at, and they who laud
                    indiscriminately, these literary rarities, are equally in the wrong: in a word,
                    that we must apply a different rule of estimation to the first editions of an
                    Aldus, and those of such printers as Sweynheim and Pannartz.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">When Dr

                    less estimable for beauty, correctness, commentaries, and so forth. Lists of all
                    these sets, with remarks on their relative extent and merits, will be found in
                    the bibliographical works to be immediately mentioned. As the origin of the <hi rend="italic">Delphin</hi> collection forms an interesting piece of literary
                    history, it may not be improper to notice it more particularly. This celebrated
                    body of Latin classics was originally destined for the use of the Dauphin, son
                    of Louis XIV.; and was projected by his governor the Duke of Montansier. This
                    nobleman, who, though a courtier and soldier, was both a philosopher and a
                    scholar, had been in the habit of carrying some of the classics along with him
                    in all his campaigns; and had often experienced impediments to their
                    satisfactory perusal, from the recurrence of difficulties and allusions which
                    could not be removed or explained without books of reference too bulky for
                    transport on such occasions. It was in these circumstances that the idea first
                    occurred to him of the great utility of a uniform edition of the principal
                    classics, in which the text of each should be accompanied with explanatory notes
                    and illustrative comments; and when he became governor to the dauphin, he
                    thought that a fit opportunity to set on foot an undertaking calculated to prove
                    so useful to the studies of the young prince. Huet, bishop of Avranches, then
                    one of the dauphin’s preceptors, was accordingly-commissioned to employ a
                    sufficient number of learned men for this purpose, and to direct and animate the
                    undertaking. Once every fortnight they came to him on a stated day, each with
                    the portion of his work which he had finished in the interval, to undergo his
                    inspection and judgment. The copious verbal indexes, which constitute so
                    valuable a portion of these editions, were added at his suggestion; but not
                    without considerable opposition on the part of his assistants, who were appalled
                    by the prospect of so much irksome labour as would be necessary to do justice to
                    this part of the plan. <hi rend="italic">{Memoirs of Huet’s Life,</hi> book v.)

                    regard to the classics and classical literature; but as they extend over a much
                    wider field of inquiry than is embraced by bibliography, it does not belong to
                    our present subject to give a more particular account of them.</p><p>V. <hi rend="italic">Of Anonymous and Pseudonymous Boohs.</hi></p><p>The great number of books published anonymously, as well as under false or
                    feigned names, early directed the attention of the learned to this branch of
                    bibliographical inquiry. In 1669 Frederic Geisler, professor of public law at
                    Leipsic, published a dissertation <hi rend="italic">De Nominum Mutatione,</hi>
                    which he reprinted in 1671, with a short catalogue of anonymous and pseudonymous
                    authors. About the same period a similar but more extensive work had been
                    undertaken by Vincent Placcius, professor of morals and eloquence at Hamburg,
                    and which was published in 4to in 1674, with this title, <hi rend="italic">De
                    Scriptis et Scriptoribus, anonymis atque pseujdonymis, Syntagma.</hi> Four years
                    thereafter, John Decker, a learned German lawyer, published <hi rend="italic">Conjectura de Scriptis adespotis, pseudepigraphis, et supposi-titiis,</hi>
                    which was republished in 1686, with the addition of two letters upon the same
                    subjects, one by Paul Vindingius, a professor at Copenhagen, and the other by
                    the celebrated Peter Bayle. In 1689 John Mayer, a clergyman of Hamburg,
                    published a letter to Placcius under this title, <hi rend="italic">Dissertatio
                    Epistolica ad Placcium, qua anony-morum et pseudonymorum farrago exhibitur.</hi>
                    Placcius, meanwhile, had continued his inquiries; and after his death the fruits
                    both of his first researches and additional discoveries were embodied in one
                    work, and published in a folio volume, at Hamburg, in 1708, by Mathew Dreyer, a
                    lawyer of that city. The work was now entitled <hi rend="italic">Theatrum

                    Life of Placcius by John Albert Fabricius, it contains, in an appendix, the
                    before-noticed treatises of Geisler and Decker, with the relative Letters of

                    names, had been undertaken in France by Adrian Baillet, nearly about the same
                    period <pb break="no" facs="nls:193197479" xml:id="kp-eb0704-7479-0628"/>that Placcius commenced his inquiries. In 1690
                    this author published his <hi rend="italic">Auteurs Oéguises;</hi> but this is
                    little more than the introduction to an intended catalogue of such authors,
                    which Baillet never completed; being deterred, as Niceron says, by the
                    apprehension that the exposing of concealed authors might some way or other
                    involve him in trouble. In this piece, which was reprinted in the sixth volume
                    of De la Monnoye’s edition of Baillet’s <hi rend="italic">Jugemens des
                    Savans,</hi> there are some curious literary anecdotes, particularly those
                    illustrative of the rage which prevailed after the revival of letters for the
                    assumption of classical names. In Italy these names were so generally introduced
                    into families, that the names of the saints, hitherto the common appellatives,
                    almost disappeared from that country.</p><p>The taste for this species of research, which the work of Placcius had diffused
                    in Germany, produced several supplements to it in that country. In one published
                    at Jena in 1711, under the name of Christopher Augustus Neumann, there is,
                    besides the list of authors, a dissertation upon the question, Whether it is
                    lawful for an author either to withhold or disguise his name? which question he
                    decides in the affirmative. This work is entitled <hi rend="italic">De Libris
                    anonymis et pseudonymis Sclιediasma, complectens observationes generales, et
                    Spicilegium ad PLACCIl Theatrum.</hi> But the most considerable of these
                    supplements was that published by John Christopher Mylius, at Hamburg, in 1740.
                    It contains a reprint of the <hi rend="italic">Schediasrna</hi> of Neumann, with
                    remarks, and a list of three thousand two hundred authors, in addition to those
                    noticed by Placcius. The notices of Mylius, however, are limited to books in the
                    Latin, German, and French languages.</p><p>About the middle of the last century the Abbé Bo-nardi, librarian to the
                    Sorbonne, undertook a dictionary of anonymous and pseudonymous works; but he
                    died without publishing it. The manuscript is said to have been carried to
                    Lyons, and, it is supposed, was destroyed there during the disorders that
                    followed the revolution. In the third volume of Caillcau’s <hi rend="italic">Dictionnaire bibliographique,</hi> published in 1790, there is a separate
                    alphabet for anonymous books, which occupies about half the volume. It comprises
                    books in all languages, but those only which the compiler thought rare or
                    curious. The last, and by far the best work in this department, is the <hi rend="italic">Dictionnaire des Ouvrages Anonymes et Pseudonymes,</hi> by M.
                    Barbier, librarian to the late emperor of France. A second edition, greatly
                    enlarged, was published in four vols. 8vo in 1822-27. It comprises a vast number
                    of articles; but the plan does not extend to any English, German, or Italian
                    works, except those which have been translated into the French language. Works
                    of this class are more particularly useful in regard to the literary productions
                    of periods and countries which have been greatly restricted in the liberty of
                    the press.</p><p>VI. <hi rend="italic">Of Condemned and Prohibited Books.</hi></p><p>Books supposed hurtful to the interests of government, religion, or morality,
                    have sometimes been condemned to the flames, sometimes censured by particular
                    tribunals, and sometimes suppressed. Such methods of destruction have been
                    followed in various countries, both with respect to their own productions and
                    those of their neighbours. In some countries, lists of the books prohibited
                    within them have from time to time been published; and in these lists are often
                    found the most highly-prized productions of the literature of other nations.
                    This constitutes, indeed, a melancholy portion of the history of books; for
                    though the facts which it collects sometimes amuse by their folly they oftener
                    excite indignation and pity at the oppressions of power, and the sufferings of
                    learning.</p><p>The practice of condemning obnoxious books to the flames is of very ancient date.
                    The works of Protagoras of Abdera, a disciple of Democritus, were prohibited at
                    Athens, and all the copies that could be collected were ordered to be burnt by
                    the public crier. Livy mentions, that the writings of Numa, found in his grave,
                    were condemned to the flames, as being contrary to the religion which he had
                    himself established. Augustus caused two thousand books of an astrological cast
                    to be burnt at one time; and he subjected to the same doom some satirical pieces
                    of Labienus. Tacitus mentions a work which the senate, under Tiberius, condemned
                    to the fire for having designated Cassius as the last of the Romans.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">-See the
                    chapter on</hi> Book Censors <hi rend="italic">in Professor Beckmann’s</hi>
                    History of Inventions.</p></note> This practice was early introduced in the
                    Christian world. “After the spreading of the Christian religion,” says Professor
                    Beckmann, “the clergy exercised against books that were either unfavourable or
                    disagreeable to them the same severity which they had censured in the heathens
                    as foolish and prejudicial to their own cause. Thus were the writings of Arius
                    condemned to the flames at the council of Nice; and Constantine threatened with
                    the punishment of death those who should conceal them. The clergy assembled at
                    the council of Ephesus requested Theodosius II. to cause the works of Nestorius
                    to be burnt, and this desire was complied with. The writings of Eutyches shared
                    the like fate at the council of Chalcedon; and it would not be difficult to
                    collect examples of the same kind from each of the following centuries.”</p><p>When the Popes prevailed upon the nations of Christendom to acknowledge their
                    infallibility in all matters appertaining to religion, they also took upon
                    themselves the care and the right of pointing out what books should or should
                    not be read; and hence originated those famous <hi rend="italic">Expuxgatory
                    Indexes</hi> which furnish such ample materials for the bibliography of
                    prohibited books. There is a copious list of these <hi rend="italic">Indexes</hi> in the work of Peignot, to be immediately noticed. The next step
                    in the progress of usurpation was the licensing of books. By the council of
                    Lateran, held at Rome in 1515, it was ordered that all books should, previously
                    to publication, be submitted to the judgment of clerical censors, “To fill up
                    the measure of encroachment,” says Milton, “their last invention was to ordain
                    that no book should be printed, as if St Peter had bequeathed them the keys of
                    the press also as well as of paradise, unless it were approved and licensed
                    under the hands of two or three gluttonous friars. Till then books were ever as
                    freely admitted into the world as any other birth; the issue of the brain was no
                    more stifled than the issue of the womb; no envious Juno sat cross-legged over
                    the nativity of any man’s intellectual offspring.” <hi rend="italic">(Liberty of

                    of the subject of condemned books in general; but it cannot be allowed that it
                    contains any thing approaching to a complete enumeration of the <hi rend="italic">principal</hi> works which conic within the scope of the
                    title-page. There are very few English books noticed, either those condemned in
                    this country or those prohibited in others; though in this latter class the most
                    valuable of our philosophical and literary works -would be found. One of the
                    most preposterous sentences of prohibition incurred by an English author is that
                    mentioned in a letter from Sir John Macpherson,while in Spain, to Mr Gibbon;
                    namely, that Smith’s <hi rend="italic">Wealth of Nations</hi> was prohibited
                    there, “on account of the lowness of its style and the looseness of its morals.”
                    (Gibbon’s <hi rend="italic">Posthumous Works,</hi> vol. iii.)</p><p>We should like to see an accurate account of works which have been condemned to
                    the flames, or suppressed, in Britain. In former times we should find some as
                    abominable instances of oppression in this particular as ever disgraced the
                    worst governments of continental Europe. The proceedings against Prynne, on
                    account of his <hi rend="italic">His-trwnιαstix</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Players Scourge,</hi> furnish a noted example. We wish we could add, that these
                    proceedings have always been mentioned by our historians in the terms which
                    their singular atrocity is calculated to call forth from every heart that has
                    one chord in unison with the rights of humanity. Prynnc, who was by profession a
                    lawyer, is characterized by Mr Hume as being “a great hero among the puritans.”
                    He was in truth a very fanatical person; but his learning was immense, his
                    courage unconquerable, and his honesty certainly as great as that of any of his
                    opponents or oppressors. His <hi rend="italic">Histriomastix,</hi> a quarto of
                    upwards of a thousand closely printed pages, with all its margins studded with
                    authorities, came out in 1633, and was intended to decry all dramatic amusements
                    and all jovial recreations, and to censure the lax discipline and the popish
                    ceremonies of prelacy. In the alphabetical table at the end of the volume there
                    is a reference in these words—“<hi rend="italic">Women actors, notorious
                    whores</hi> and as the queen sometimes took a part in the dramas played at
                    court, it was alleged that Prynne pointed at her majesty in this reference, and
                    that the book was in fact intended as a satire upon the government. He was
                    accordingly prosecuted in the star-chamber for a libel. The book (which the
                    judges described as a huge misshapen monster, in the begetting of which the
                    devil must have assisted) was condemned to be burned; and, after the example of
                    foreign countries, this was ordered to be done, for the first time in England,
                    by the hands of the hangman. It was ordered that Mr Prynne should be expelled
                    from Oxford, he being a graduate of that university; and also from the bar. He
                    was further sentenced to pay a fine of L.5000, and to endure perpetual
                    imprisonment: but this was not all; he was condemned to stand in the pillory on
                    two successive days, in Westminster and Cheapside, there, on each day, to have
                    an ear cut off. One of the judges, who represented the queen’s virtues as such
                    that neither oratory nor poetry could do any thing like justice to them, was for
                    making the fine L.10,000; stating that he knew it was much more than Mr Prynne
                    was worth, yet far less than he deserved to pay; and expressed a further wish,
                    that his <hi rend="superscript"> β</hi> ose should be slit, and his forehead
                    burned, in addition to the loss of his ears, because he might buy himself a
                    periwig, and so hide that loss.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">See Prynne’s Trial, in the Collection

                    unprecedented calamities, had actually been licensed, according to the
                    regulations which then obtained; but it was stated that the licenser had not
                    read the whole of it. Well might Sir Simonds D’Ewes speak of this as a
                    terrifying trial. “Most men,” says he, “were affrighted to see that neither Mr
                    Prynne’s academical nor barrister’s gown could free him from the infamous loss
                    of his ears; and all good men conceived this would have been remitted; many
                    asserted it was, till the sad execution of it. I went to see him a while after,”
                    continues Sir Simonds, “in the Fleet, to comfort him; and found in him the rare
                    effects of an upright heart, by his serenity of spirit and chearful
                    patience.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">See Extracts from a manuscript Journal of I)</hi><hi rend="italic                     superscript"> ,</hi><hi rend="italic">E wes’s Life, published in Nichols’s</hi>

                    The account which Mr Hume gives of this nefarious trial and sentence, dwelling
                    chiefly on the acrimonious and ridiculous parts of Prynne’s character and book,
                    wholly passing over the sycophancy of his judges, and but gently censuring their
                    appalling and ruthless cruelty, is characteristic enough of his general
                    principles and manners; and well calculated to show that, with all his
                    penetration and philosophic spirit, and charms of style, he was still deficient
                    in some qualities of an historian, without which, history cannot be rendered
                    profitable either to rulers or their subjects.</p><p>VII. <hi rend="italic">Of Eibliographical Dictionaries and Catalogues.</hi></p><p>The works which fall to be considered under this section, sometimes called <hi rend="italic">Dictionaries,</hi> sometimes <hi rend="italic">Catalogues,</hi>
                    and sometimes <hi rend="italic">Bibliothecae,</hi> constitute the most generally
                    useful and interesting class of bibliographical publications. By showing what
                    has been written in all the various branches of human knowledge in every age and
                    country, they act as useful guides to the inquiries of every class of the
                    learned; while, by pointing out the differences of editions, they constitute
                    manuals of ready information to the professed bibliographer.</p><p>Works of this class are called <hi rend="italic">general</hi> or <hi rend="italic">particular,</hi> according as their object is to indicate books in
                    all, or in one only, of the departments of science and literature. The former
                    only aspire to point out rare or remarkable books; for no attempt has yet been
                    made, or probably ever will be made, to compile a universal Bibliographical
                    Dictionary. On the other hand, it is the object of <hi rend="italic">particular</hi> dictionaries to notice all, or the greater part, of those books
                    which have been published on the subjects which they embrace; and hence their
                    superior utility to such as are engaged in the study of any particular science
                    or subject.</p><p>The works of the former class which chiefly demand our notice are the following
                    :—1. <hi rend="italic">Bibliographie Instructive, ou Traite de la Connoissance

                    octavo, published at Paris between 1763 and 1768. The books described in this
                    work are arranged, in appropriate subdivisions, under the five grand classes of
                    <hi rend="italic">Theology, Jurisprudence, Sciences</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Arts, Belles Lettres,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">History;</hi> and the
                    classification which it exemplifies is that generally followed by foreign
                    bibliographers. The names of the authors in all these classes are arranged
                    alphabetically in the last volume; but it has no index to anonymous works, a
                    want, however, which was afterwards supplied by another hand, in a thin octavo
                    volume published in 1782, entitled <hi rend="italic">Bibliographie Instructive,
                    tome dixième.</hi> This is called the tenth volume, because De Bure had himself

                    particulars excel it in accuracy. 2. <hi rend="italic">Dictionnaire

                    This work was first published in three volumes octavo in 1810. A third edition,
                    much enlarged, appeared in 1820, in 4 vols. 8vo. It contains a much greater
                    proportion, both of English and of German books, than any of the preceding
                    compilations; and its plan is such as to afford all the advantages both of a
                    dictionary and a classed catalogue; three of the volumes being employed to
                    indicate books under their names in alphabetical order, and the fourth to class
                    them, divested of all bibliographical details, according to the system generally
                    followed. The prices of the rarer editions are given from the principal sales
                    that have taken place in France and other countries; so that, upon the whole,
                    this work, though it bas less literary interest than that of De Bure, is
                    probably the best bibliographical dictionary extant for the purposes of the
                    professed bibliographer.</p><p>In the class of <hi rend="italic">general</hi> bibliographical dictionaries we
                    must also place the following work, though its limitation to books in the
                    learned and eastern languages renders it much less general in its plan than
                    those we have described. It is entitled <hi rend="italic">A Bibliographical

                    most curious and useful Boohs in all departments of Learning, published in
                    Latin, Greek, Hebrew, Arabic, and other eastern Languages.</hi> It was published
                    in 1803, by Dr Adam Clarke, in six volumes duodecimo. To the principal works
                    noticed in this dictionary, there are added biographical notices and criticisms;
                    but the author would have judged more wisely had he included books in the modern
                    languages, instead of deviating so largely, and with but small pretensions to
                    novelty, into the provinces of biography and general criticism. The supplement,
                    which he published in two duodecimo volumes in 1806, under the title of <hi rend="italic">The Bibliographical Miscellany,</hi> contains, among other
                    matters, an account of English translations of the classics, and theological
                    writers; a list of the cities and towns where printing was established in the
                    fifteenth century; and a list of authors on literary history and
                    bibliography.</p><p>Some writers have complained, particularly M. Camus, that these bibliographical
                    dictionaries have been too exclusively devoted to the indication of rare and
                    curious books; and that they notice but few comparatively of those whose value
                    consists only in their utility. “Je voudrois,” says he, “qu’on suppléât à ce

                    the idea of such a dictionary as was wished for by Μ. Camus.</p><p>It has sometimes also been alleged that these dictionaries, by pointing out so
                    many curious books and rare editions, have contributed greatly to the diffusion

                    helped to do so; but the truth is, that this disease has a much deeper root in
                    the vanities of human nature, and is of much more ancient date, than some
                    persons seem to imagine. It gave great offence to Socrates and to Lucian;<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Lucian’s

                    among his countrymen had called forth the animadversions of Bruyère, long before
                    the popular work of De Bure gave such an acknowledged zest and pungency to the
                    taste for amassing literary curiosities.</p><p>The number of dictionaries and catalogues applicable to <hi rend="italic">particular</hi> departments or provinces of learning, is much too great to
                    permit us to do any thing more than to point out a few of them. Lipenius, a
                    learned German divine and professor, born in 1630, and who died in 1692, worn
                    out, as Niceron says, by labour and chagrin, compiled a <hi rend="italic">Bibliotheca Theologica,</hi> a <hi rend="italic">Bibliotheca Juridica,</hi> a
                    <hi rend="italic">Bibliotheca Philosophica,</hi> and a <hi rend="italic">Bibliotheca Medica,</hi> making in all six volumes folio. The <hi rend="italic">Bibliotheca Juridica</hi> has been several times reprinted, and two supplements
                    have been added to it; one by Schott, published at Leipsic in 1775, and the
                    other by Senkenberg, also published there in 1789, making in all four volumes
                    folio. An immense number of books are indicated in each of these <hi rend="italic">Bibliotheca</hi> of Lipenius; of all of which the plan is to
                    arrange the books alphabetically according to their subjects; each <hi rend="italic">Bibliotheca</hi> having also an alphabetical table of the names of
                    the authors whose works are arranged under the alphabet of subjects. The <hi rend="italic">Bibliotheca Juridica,</hi> owing to the corrections and additions
                    which it has received, forms by much the most valuable part of this series. In
                    regard to jurisprudence, we may further mention Bridgman’s <hi rend="italic">Legal Bibliography;</hi> and the valuable work of M. Camus, entitled <hi rend="italic">Lettres sur la profession d</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">Avocat, et
                    Bibliothèque choisi des Livres de Droit.</hi> There are some truly excellent
                    catalogues of works in the sciences and in natural history. Such are Dr Young’s

                    Mechanical Arts,</hi> annexed to his <hi rend="italic">Lectures on Natural

                    promise only the catalogue of a private library, is allowed to furnish the most
                    complete and best-arranged view of books in natural history ever published in
                    any country. In the great departmentorhistory there have been published various
                    <hi rend="italic">Bibliotheca,</hi> some of them embracing the historical works
                    of all ages and nations; others, those only which relate to particular
                    countries. The <hi rend="italic">Bibliotheca Historica</hi> of Meusel, an
                    immense work, is of the former class. It includes voyages and travels; but of
                    books of this class there is an excellent separate catalogue in six volumes
                    octavo, by d∙ Boucher de la Richarderie, published at Paris in 1808. We must
                    observe, however, that this work would have <pb break="no" facs="nls:193197518" xml:id="kp-eb0704-7518-0631"/>been better
                    suited to the legitimate ends of such a compilation had the author confined
                    himself to bibliographical notices, and wholly refrained from those long
                    extracts by which his book has been so much enlarged. Of the class of <hi rend="italic">Bibiiothecce</hi> applicable to the history of particular
                    countries, the <hi rend="italic">Bibliothèque Historique de la France,</hi>
                    originally published in 1719, in one volume folio, but in the last edition,
                    published between 1768 and 1778, extended to five volumes, is by far the most
                    splendid and perfect example. It contains nearly fifty thousand articles, as
                    well manuscript as printed, methodically arranged under the different heads of
                    French history to which they relate, and accompanied with a complete set of
                    indexes to authors and subjects.</p><p>We must refer such of our readers as are desirous of seeing a fuller list of
                    catalogues of books in the different branches of knowledge, to the <hi rend="italic">Repertoire Bibliographique Universel</hi> of Μ. Peignot, a useful
                    but ill-arranged work.</p><p>VIII. <hi rend="italic">Of the Classification of Books.</hi></p><p>The classing of books in a catalogue, so as to furnish a systematic view of the
                    contents of an extensive library, is a task of much difficulty and importance.
                    In order to this, it is necessary to refer every book to its proper place in the
                    general system of human knowledge; and to do so with precision, it is necessary
                    to have clear and exact ideas of the scope and objects of all the departments
                    and branches of which that system consists. The utility of catalogues so classed
                    is very great, and consists obviously in this, that the books upon any subject
                    are found at once by referring to the proper head, whereas in alphabetical
                    catalogues the whole must be perused before we can ascertain what books they
                    contain upon the subject which immediately interests us. All who duly consider
                    the matter, therefore, must concur in Dr Middleton’s brief and emphatic
                    description of such an undertaking, as <hi rend="italic">res sane magni momenti,
                    multique sudoris.</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">See his very judicious tract, entitled</hi> Biblìothecae
                    Cαηtαbrig⅛nsis ordinandae Methodus, <hi rend="italic">in the fourth volume of
                    his works.</hi></p></note></p><p>Whether classed catalogues were in use among the ancients, is a piece of
                    information which has not descended to us. The first who is known to have
                    written upon the subject was a German, named Florian Treffer, who, in 1560,
                    published, at Augsburg, a method of classing books. Cardona in 1587, and Scholt
                    in 1608, published treatises upon this subject; and, in 1627, Gabriel Naudĕ, a
                    writer of no small celebrity in his day, published his <hi rend="italic">Avis
                    pour dresser one Bibliothèque,</hi> in which he treats of the principles of
                    classification. The catalogue which he compiled of the library of the Canon de
                    Cordes, afterwards purchased by Mazarin, was published in 1643, and is esteemed
                    a curiosity among bibliographers. In the early part of the eighteenth century,
                    Gabriel Martin, a learned Parisian bookseller, who seems to have been much
                    employed in compiling catalogues, chalked out a system of arrangement, which, in
                    a great degree, superseded all others, and, m its leading divisions, is still
                    generally followed on the Continent. Various other systems have, however, been
                    proposed by the bibliographers of France and Germany; but, before proceeding to
                    any particular notice, either of the system of Martin or of those which differ
                    from it, we must observe, that all who have written upon the subject seem to
                    have confounded two things, as we think, perfectly distinct,—-the arrangement to
                    be followed in the catalogue of a library, and that to be followed in placing
                    its books. They all suppose the same nicety and exactness of classification to
                    be equally necessary and equally practicable in both. Now, we must remark, that
                    where there is a classed catalogue, the grand objects of a systematic
                    arrangement are sufficiently provided for, independently of the location of the
                    books; and if there should not be a classed catalogue, it seems very clear that
                    the bulk of those who frequent a public library could derive little if any
                    benefit from an accurate classification of books on the shelves, even supposing
                    it practicable to effect and maintain it. The chief end of any arrangement to be
                    effected on the shelves ought to be to aid the memories and abridge the labour
                    of the librarians; and all that is useful in this respect may be accomplished by
                    means of a much ruder plan than could be tolerated in any catalogue pretending
                    to classification.</p><p>The system generally followed, as we have already mentioned, is that of Martin,
                    which divides books into the five great classes of <hi rend="italic">theology,
                    jurisprudence, sciences and arts, belles lettres,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">history.</hi> Each of these classes has divisions and subdivisions more or less
                    numerous, according to the number of the branches to be distinguished; and it is
                    in the distribution of these that the chief differences are found in foreign
                    catalogues; though the divisions and subdivisions of De Bure, as exemplified in
                    his <hi rend="italic">Bibliographie Instructive,</hi> are those commonly
                    followed. Some bibliographers, however, have proposed to alter the order, others
                    to diminish, and some to increase the number of the primitive classes; whilst a
                    few have proposed systems altogether different, and greatly more refined in
                    their principles of classification. Μ. Ameilhon, in a paper published in the <hi rend="italic">Memoirs</hi> of the French Institute, proposes the following
                    leading divisions: grammar, logic, morals, jurisprudence, metaphysics, physics,
                    arts, belles lettres, and history.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Aftwoim</hi> de l’ Institut National <hi rend="italic">,∙ Classe, Litt, et Beaux Arts, tom.,iι.</hi></p></note> In this
                    arrangement <hi rend="italic">theology,</hi> to which he has great objections as
                    a separate class, is transferred, with evident impropriety, to the class of <hi rend="italic">metaphysics.</hi> Μ. Camus has also investigated the principles
                    according to which books ought to be classed, in another paper in these <hi rend="italic">Memoirs,</hi> already quoted; but as he has not reduced his
                    method, which proceeds on views much too fanciful for the purpose, to specific
                    heads, we can only refer our readers to his paper. Equally remote from the
                    proper objects of a classed catalogue are the systems proposed by Μ. Peignot and
                    by Μ. Thiebaut.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">See</hi> Dictionnaire de Bibliologie, <hi rend="italic">par G.
                    Peignot, art. Système.</hi></p></note> The former takes the well-known
                    speculations of Bacon and D’Alembert, as to the genealogy of knowledge, for the
                    basis of his system, and thus fixes upon three principal heads or classes, under
                    the names of history, philosophy, and imagination, with the addition of
                    bibliography as an introductory class. In the system of the latter, there are,
                    in like manner, only three principal heads, founded upon a division of
                    knowledge, into instrumental, essential, and suitable.</p><p>Germany also has produced a variety of bibliographical systems, some of them as
                    absurdly refined as those just mentioned; whilst others, as, for example,that of
                    Leibnitz, are better adapted to practical purposes. The classes proposed by this
                    eminent philosopher are as follows: theology, jurisprudence, medicine,
                    intellectual philosophy, mathematics, natural philosophy, philology, history,
                    and miscellanies.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Idea

                    of this arrangement for a catalogue of the university library of Cambridge; and,
                    whatever may be its defects, it cannot be questioned that a printed catalogue of
                    an extensive collection, so classed, would have proved of eminent utility.</p><p>Naudé mentions a writer who proposed to class all sorts of books under the three

                    this arrangement, these words of the psaloust, <hi rend="italic">Disciplinam,
                    Bonitatem, et Scientiam doce me.</hi> All such systems as those of Μ. Peignot
                    and Μ. Thiebaut, when applied to the formation of catalogues, appear to us quite
                    as absurd as this system deduced from the psaloust. The remark which Naudé
                    applied to it, that it seemed intended “to crucify and torture the memory by its
                    subtilties,” is just as applicable to the former. That system, he adds, “is the
                    best which is most facile, the least intricate, and the most practised; and
                    which follows the faculties of theology, physic, jurisprudence, mathematics,
                    humanity, and others.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Evelyn’s Translation of Naudé’s <hi rend="italic">Α vis pour dresser one
                    Bibliothèque.</hi></p></note> Μ. Ameilhon also objects strongly to all
                    over-refined bibliographical systems, and particularly to those which aspire to
                    follow the genesis and remote affinities of the different branches of knowledge.
                    “L’exécutioń,” says he, “en seroit impossible; ou si elle ne ľétoit pas au moins
                    entrai-neroit-elle des difficultés, qui ne pourroient être surmontées que par
                    des hommes profondément réfléchés et exercés aux méditations
                    métaphysiques.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>; <hi rend="italic">Mémoires de l’Institut;</hi> Classe, Littérat. et Beaux Arts, tom.
                    i. p. 483.</p></note> The truth is, that when bibliographers speculate in this
                    field with a view to catalogue-making, they entirely forget their proper
                    province and objects. They have nothing whatever to do with genealogical trees
                    of knowledge, or with any mode of classing books which is founded upon remote
                    and subtile abstractions. The whole use and end of a classed catalogue is to
                    furnish a ready index to books, arranged according to their subjects; and that
                    arrangement is therefore to be preferred which is founded upon the most
                    obviously marked and generally recognised divisions of those subjects. We may
                    add, that to compile a good catalogue of an extensive library, even on this
                    humbler plan, would require more learning and more correctness of knowledge and
                    thinking, than arc likely to be often employed in such an undertaking.</p><p>Though we are not altogether satisfied with the division and order of the classes
                    in the system commonly followed, we have no doubt that, by means of an
                    additional class, and a correct arrangement of the subdivisions, a catalogue
                    might be formed perfectly adequate to every useful purpose. We allude to a
                    class, such as is partly indicated in the schemes both of Leibnitz and
                    Middleton, for the reception of works and collections which cannot with
                    propriety be limited to any one division of knowledge. Μ. Camus thinks that
                    works of this kind may be properly enough entered in the class· in which their
                    authors most excelled; those of Cicero, for example, among the Orators:<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Ibid.</hi>
                    tom. i.</p></note> but, not to mention the evident incongruity of placing a
                    collection so multifarious as Cicero’s works under <hi rend="italic">Oratory,</hi> there may sometimes be room for uncertainty as to the division
                    under which, according to this rule, an author’s works ought to be sought. These
                    incongruities and inconveniences, together with those which must arise from
                    placing Encyclopaedias and general collections under any of the common
                    divisions, can only be remedied by a <hi rend="italic">Miscellaneous Class;</hi>
                    and, while this class ought to indicate, in one of its divisions, the collective
                    editions of an author’s works, his separate treatises ought to be entered under
                    the subjects to which they belong; as without this, the classed catalogue will
                    not fully answer its purpose,—that of showing what has been written by the
                    authors specified in it, on the different branches of knowledge. Thus, a
                    catalogue compiled upon this plan would not only be rendered more consistent in
                    its arrangement, but much more complete as an index to the materials of
                    study.</p><p>IX. <hi rend="italic">Of Bibliography in general.</hi><hi rend="italic">It</hi>
                    was our object in this article to institute such a division of the subject as
                    should enable us to point out the best sources of information in regard to all
                    its branches; and in order to complete our view, we have still to notice some of
                    those works which treat generally of all matters appertaining to bibliography.
                    We do not know any book that presents a well-written, judicious, and
                    comprehensive digest of these matters; but there are several which contain much
                    curious and useful information in regard to them. I. <hi rend="italic">The
                    Introduction to the Knowledge of Books {Einleitung in Bucherhunde),</hi> by Μ.
                    Denis, whose supplement to Maittaire, and bibliographical system, we have
                    already mentioned, is of this description. The last edition, published at Vienna
                    in 1796, consists of two volumes quarto. It has never been translated from the
                    original German; and it is to be observed, that though it treats of the
                    substances, forms, and classification of books, it cannot be considered as a
                    merely bibliographical work, a large portion of it being devoted to the general
                    history of learning. The author, who was long principal librarian of the
                    Imperial Library at Vienna, died in 1808. 2. <hi rend="italic">Manuel

                    author. Bibliography is certainly indebted to this industrious compiler; but his
                    vague notions of its objects and rank have too often led him into confusion and
                    extravagance. 4. <hi rend="italic">Cours de Bibliographie, ou la science du

                    different systems which have been proposed for classifying books. We learn from
                    the introduction, that Μ. François de Neufchâteau, when minister of the
                    interior, orders the librarians of all the departments to deliver lectures on
                    bibliography; but that the plan, which indeed savours somewhat of <hi rend="italic">bibliomania,</hi> entirely failed, these librarians having been
                    found quite incapable of prelecting upon their vocation. 5. <hi rend="italic">Introduction to the Study of Bibliography; to which is prefixed a Memoir on the

                    French bibliographical works, and will be found useful to those who have not
                    access to them. It contains full lists of writers on bibliography and literary
                    history, and the fullest account we have seen of catalogues of libraries<pb break="no" facs="nls:193197544" xml:id="kp-eb0704-7544-0633"/>
                    both British and foreign. The specimens of early typography, and of the
                    vignettes and monograms of the early printers, are neatly executed.</p><p>Bibliography certainly presents a pretty wide field of inquiry, and in which
                    there is yet room for useful works; but it must appear evident, from the details
                    contained in the present article, that this field has in almost every part been
                    long cultivated; if not always with perfect taste and judgment, yet with great
                    industry, and so as to yield very profitable returns to the commonwealth of
                    learning.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
