                    English poet of considerable celebrity, appears to have been a native of
                    Scotland. The place of his nativity has indeed been disputed; but Bishop Bale,
                    in a work published during Barclay’s lifetime, mentions him as a Scotsman;<note

                    more recent publication, he mentions Barclay as a person, “quem alii Scotum,
                    alii Anglum fuisse contendunt.” (<hi rend="italic">Scriptorum illustrium Majoris

                    according to Dr Bulleyn, another contemporary writer, he “was born beyond the
                    cold river of Tweed.” Holinshed likewise describes him as a Scot. On the other
                    hand, Dr Pitts, who wrote at a more recent period, avers that he was an
                    Englishman, and that his native district was probably Devonshire; but this
                    averment is apparently founded on the mere circumstance of his having obtained
                    preferment in that county.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    however to be remarked that the poet’s name is altered to suit this hypothesis,
                    and that there is no such town or village in the county of Somerset. Berkeley is
                    the name of a place in the county of Gloucester, but Berkeley and Barclay are
                    not the same; and we adhere to the opinion of Ritson, that “both his name of
                    baptism and the orthography of his surname seem to prove that he was of Scotish
                    extraction.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Ilitson’s

                    it is that he spent most of his life in England. He is said to have been partly
                    educated in the university of Oxford, and is conjectured to have belonged to
                    Oriel College; but this account is apparently to be received with some degree of
                    caution, and may rest on no better foundation than the fact of his having
                    dedicated his <hi rend="italic">Ship of Pooles io</hi> Dr Cornish, provost of
                    that college, and suffragan bishop of Tyne in the diocese of Bath. He describes
                    himself as the bishop’s humble chaplain, but this may perhaps be considered as
                    merely a courteous form of speech; for in the poem itself, he represents himself
                    as the “chaplayne and bedeman” of “my master Kyrkham.” Barclay appears to have
                    taken the degree of doctor of divinity. On one occasion he makes an allusion to
                    what he had observed at Cambridge. It may be considered as highly probable that
                    he completed his studies in one of those universities, and that the connexions
                    which he thus had an opportunity of forming, induced him to fix his residence in
                    the south; and when we suppose him to have enjoyed the benefit of an English
                    education, it need not appear peculiarly “strange that in those days a Scot
                    should obtain so great reputation in England.”<note anchored="true"

                    of his earlier days at Croydon ill Surrey; and in the year 1508 we find him a
                    prebendary of the collegiate church of St Mary Ottery <pb break="no"

                    became a Benedictine monk of the monastery of Ely, and at length assumed the
                    habit of St Francis at Canterbury. Having survived the dissolution of the
                    monasteries, he became successively vicar of Much-Badew in Essex, and, in 1546,
                    of Wokey in Somersetshire; and was finally presented by the dean and chapter of
                    Canterbury to the rectory of All-Saints in Lombard-street. As he retained some
                    of his preferments in the reign of Edward VI., it is presumed that he must have
                    complied with the changes of the times. Having reached a very advanced age, he
                    died in the year 1552, and was interred at Croydon.</p>
                <p>Barclay wrote at a period when the standard of English poetry was extremely low;
                    and, as excellence is always comparative, this circumstance may partly enable us
                    to account for the high reputation which he enjoyed among his contemporaries. If
                    not entitled to the name of a poet, he is at least a copious versifier. His most
                    conspicuous performance is the <hi rend="italic">Ship of Pooles,</hi> first
                    printed by Pinson in the year 1509. The original design, and many of the
                    details, were derived from Sebastian Brandt,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    about the year 1458. He studied in the university of Basel; and after having
                    publicly taught there, as well as in his native city, he became syndic of
                    Strasburg, where he died in the year 1520. (Adami <hi rend="italic superscript">

                    adapted to the taste of the age that a Latin and a French version appeared in
                    1497, and another French version in 1498. Barclay professes to have translated
                    “oute of Laten, Frenche, and Doche but to the original cargo he has added many
                    fools of English growth. Under the representation of a ship freighted with fools
                    of various denominations, the poet exposes the prevalent vices and follies of
                    the age; and although, as Warton remarks, the poem is destitute of plot, and the

                    inferior in poetical merit. Among his prose works we find a version of Sallust’s
                    history of the war with Jugurtha: it was twice printed by Pinson, and is an
                    early specimen of an English translation from the classics, (x.)</p>

                    namesake mentioned in the next article. This latter fact is ascertained by the
                    hendecasyllables subjoined to his notes on Tacitus, and bearing the subsequent
                    inscription: “Nobili et clarissimo viro Guil. Barclayo cognato meo, pro
                    explicato Taciti Agricoa, Joannes Barclayus Guil. F. scripsi.” The writer of
                    these verses, we may remark, must then have been only seventeen years of age.
                    Barclay prosecuted his studies in the university of Louvain under Justus
                    Lipsius, a great master of Roman literature; and to him this distinguished

                    there taught humanity for several years, and acquired a considerable share of
                    reputation by his talents and learning. He afterwards visited his native
                    country, where he appears to have followed the medical profession; but it may be
                    inferred from Dempster’s brief notice, that, in consequence of his adherence to
                    popery, his situation was rendered uncomfortable by the clergy, and having
                    returned to France, he resumed his former occupation at Nantes in Bretagne.<note

                    insanity.</p>

                    distinguished civilian, was born in Aberdeenshire in the year 1541. He spent the
                    early part of his life, and much of his fortune, at the court of Mary queen of
                    Scots, from whose favour he had reason to expect preferment. In 1573 he went
                    over to France, and at Bourges commenced student of the civil law under the
                    famous Cujacius. He continued some years in that seminary, where he took his
                    doctor’s degree; and was soon after appointed professor of the civil law in the
                    university of Pontamousson, recently founded by the duke of Lorraine. That
                    prince afterwards made him counsellor of state and master of requests. In the
                    year 1581 Barclay married Anne de Malleville, a French lady, by whom he had a
                    son, who became a celebrated author, and of whom the reader will find an account
                    in the next article. This youth the Jesuits would gladly have received into
                    their society; but his father refused his consent, and for that reason these
                    disciples of Jcsus soon contrived to ruin him with the duke his patron. Barclay
                    now embarked for Britain, where King James offered him a considerable
                    preferment, provided he would become a member of the church of England; but not
                    chusing to comply with this condition, he returned to France in 1604, and, soon
                    after his arrival, was appointed first professor of the civil law in the
                    university of Angers, where he died the year following, and was buried in the
                    Franciscan church.</p>

                    eminent civilian mentioned in the last article, was born at Pontamousson on the
                    28th of January 1582. He was there educated in the College of the Jesuits, and
                    excited in his instructors so favourable an opinion of his capacity, that they
                    made an attempt to entice him into their order; an attempt which was indignantly
                    resisted by his father. At the age of nineteen, he evinced his literary ambition
                    by publishing annotations on the Thebais of Statius. In 1603, when his father
                    resigned his professorship in disgust, the young and aspiring scholar
                    accompanied him to London; and at the beginning of the following year he
                    presented his <hi rend="italic">Kalendae Januariae</hi> as a poetical offering
                    to King James, to whom he soon afterwards dedicated the first part of his work
                    entitled <hi rend="italic">Eτιphormionis Lusini Satyrico.</hi> Both the father
                    and the son were willing to accept of employment, and no doubt they both
                    expected preferment. But, as Lord Hailes has remarked, “William Barclay was
                    conscientiously attached to the church of Rome, and his son professed the
                    religion of his forefathers. In those days a pension bestowed upon a Scottish
                    Papist would have been numbered among the national grievances; and the vulgar
                    would not have distinguished between favour shown to genius or learning, and
                    partiality for the opinions of the person favoured.”<note anchored="true"

                    year 1604 they both returned to France, and Dr Barclay was again placed in a
                    situation suited to his talents and learning, having been appointed first
                    professor of the civil law in the university of Angers. His taste for external
                    magnificence appears to have been somewhat prominent: when he went to read his
                    lecture, he was dressed in a superb gown, with a massy chain of gold about his
                    neck, and was followed by his son and two valets.<note anchored="true"

                <p>• The younger Barclay, whose hopes of advancement had begun to revive, returned
                    to England in 1605; but after a further residence of twelve months, he still
                    found himself unsuccessful in his pursuit. His father died towards the close of
                    the same year; and he afterwards removed to Paris, where he married Louise, the
                    daughter of Michael Débonnaire, “Trésorier des Vieilles Bandes.” He speedily
                    fixed his abode in London, and there his wife bore him a son and two daughters,
                    William, Anne, and Louise. Μ. de Peiresc, who was himself a man of learning, and
                    was very extensively connected with the learned, found him in this metropolis in
                    the year 1606, and their acquaintance was succeeded by an intimate friendship.
                    During this year he published the second part of his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Satyrico,</hi> which he dedicated to the earl of Salisbury; and likewise a
                    brief narrative of the gunpowder plot, bearing the title of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Series patefacti divinitus Parris cidii, in ter maximum Regem Regnumque
                    Britanniae eagi∙ tati et instructi.</hi> In 1610 he published an apology for his
                    <hi rend="italic">Satyrico,</hi> which had excited so much resentment that he
                    found it necessary to attempt some palliatives and explanations. A tract was
                    published at Paris in 1620, under the title of <hi rend="italic">Censura

                    learned civilian, whom Tomasini enumerates among the eminent scholars of the
                    age. <hi rend="italic">{P</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> arnassns</hi><hi

                <p>During the same year, 1610, he published an able work ' of his father, <hi
                    rend="italic">De Potestate Papoe,</hi> to which he prefixed a preface of nine
                    pages, concluding with a clear intimation of his purpose to defend his father’s
                    memory against any unseemly attack. “Quod si aliquis hoc opus refellere
                    instituet, velim ne oratoria fraude tantum levia quaedam carpat, in quibus nec
                    ipse author multum subsidii posuerit; sed ipsam vim rationum excutiat, diluendi
                    aut asserendi vitia accuset. Si quis aliter faxit, sciat Guilielmi Barclaii
                    cincres loqui posse.” It was not the object of this treatise to controvert the
                    spiritual supremacy of the pope, which the author was ready to admit in its most
                    orthodox sense; but while he acknowledged his power and jurisdiction in things
                    spiritual, he strenuously contended against his usurped power over sovereign
                    princes in things temporal. Ţhe work, which is written with learning and
                    ability, excited no small degree of attention; and it was soon attacked by
                    Cardinal Bellarmin, one of the most formidable defenders of the doctrines of the
                    church, and of the pretensions of its visible head. The son was anxious to
                    evince that the ashes of his revered father were yet capable of speaking. .He
                    had not neglected to study the law under so excellent a preceptor; and as he was
                    by no means diffident of his own abilities, he did not shrink from a contest
                    with so redoubtable an antagonist. He accordingly published a large volume
                    bearing the title of <hi rend="italic">Jοαnnis Barclaii Pietas; sive publics pro
                    Regibus ac Principibus, ac privatoe pro Guilielmo Barclaio Parente Vindiciae,

                    cardinal did not himself reply, but an answer was speedily published under the
                    name of <hi rend="italic">Andrece Eudeemon-Johannis Epistola mοnitoria ad

                <p>In 1614 Barclay published at London his <hi rend="italic">Icon Animorum,</hi>
                    which forms the fourth part of his <hi rend="italic">Satyrico.</hi> This work is
                    written with talent and vivacity, and may still be perused with pleasure. It is,
                    as Lord Hailes has correctly stated, a delineation of the genius and manners of
                    the European nations, with remarks, moral and philosophical, on the various
                    tempers of men. For the land of his forefathers the author has not failed to
                    testify a sufficient degree of affection. He duly extols the antiquity of the
                    royal line, “inclyto sceptro supra fidem et actatem regnorum caeterorum.” Nor is
                    the literary character of the people left without its share of commendation.
                    “Animi illis in quaecunque studia inclinant, mirificosuccessu inclyti, ut nullis
                    major patientia castrorum, vel audacia pug-nae, et Musae nunquam delicatius

                    are happy and graphic.</p>
                <p>After a residence of ten years in England, Barclay found himself without any
                    sufficient inducement to prolong his stay. To some extent or other, he had
                    experienced the bounty of the earl of Salisbury; and although it does not appear
                    that he obtained any regular provision from the king, we may perhaps suppose
                    that he at least received occasional gratuities; but his resources continued to
                    be scanty, and his situation precarious. Towards the close of the year 1615 he
                    proceeded to Paris, where he had the pleasure of meeting his friend Μ. de
                    Peiresc, and the honour of being introduced by him to the keeper of the seals,
                    Guillaume du Vair. Having been invited to Rome by Pope Paul V., he there fixed
                    his residence in the beginning of the ensuing year, and by the publication of
                    his next work he endeavoured to prove himself a worthy denizen of this pious
                    city. The work to which we allude is entitled <hi rend="italic">Joannis Barclaii
                    Paraenesis ad Sectarios, libri ii.</hi> Romae, 1617, 8vo. “It is probable,” says
                    Lord Hailes, “that by this exhortation to the sectaries, he meant to give
                    evidence of his own orthodoxy, and to atone for the liberties, almost heretical,
                    which he had taken, as well with the papal court, as with its most faithful
                    adherents. But that court, which had Cardinal Bellarmin for its champion,
                    required not the feeble and suspicious aid of the author of Euphormion.—Although
                    Barclay found much civility at Rome, yet it does not appear that he obtained any
                    emolument. Incumbered with a wife and family, and having a spirit above his
                    fortune, he was left at full leisure to pursue his literary studies. It was at
                    that time that he composed his Latin romance called <hi rend="italic"
                    >Argenis.</hi> He employed his vacant hours in the cultivating of a
                    flower-garden. Rossi (or Erythraeus) relates, in the turgid Italian style, that
                    Barclay cared not for those bulbous roots which produce flowers of a sweet
                    scent; and that he cultivated such as produced flowers void of smell, but having
                    variety of colours. Hence we may conclude that he was amongst the first of those
                    who were infected with that strange disease, a passion for tulips, which soon
                    after overspread Europe, and is still remembered under the name of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Tulipo-mania.</hi> Barclay had it to that excess, that he placed
                    two mastiffs as centinels on his garden; and, rather than abandon his favourite
                    fliwers, chose to continue his residence in an ill-aired and unwholesome
                    habitation.” The preceding account of his success at Rome is not reconcilable
                    with that of Erythraeus, who avers that from Cardinal Barberini he obtained
                    riches as well as civility;<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    have been conferred after the cardinal’s elevation to the papal chair, the
                    narrative is liable to some degree of suspicion. The election of Urban VIII. did
                    not take place till the year 1623, and Barclay was then beyond the reach of
                    preferment. It is not however probable that a writer of high reputation, who had
                    been invited by the pope, and was caressed by cardinals, was left without some
                    substantial mark of favour. Bellarmin, whom he had formerly undertaken to
                    refute, was so far from cherishing any resentment, that he honoured him with
                    various marks of kindness.</p>
                <p>Barclay died at Rome on the twelfth of August 1621, in the fortieth year of his
                    age. The disease which proved fatal to him was the stone; a disease for which,
                    in his <hi rend="italic">Satyrico,</hi> he had pronounced the plant called
                    golden rod to be a specific remedy. His remains were interred in the church of
                    S. Onufrio; and at the church of S. Lorenzo, on the road to Tivoli, his widow
                    erected for him a monument, with his bust in marble; but on learning that
                    Cardinal Francesco Barberini had there erected a similar monument in honour of
                    his preceptor, she indignantly caused the bust to be removed. The inscription on
                    Barclay’s monument was soon erased; but by whom, or for what reason, is not very
                    clearly ascertained. There is however no improbability in the reason assigned by
                    Freherus, who imputes this act to the vindictive feelings of the Jesuits, an
                    order of men very frequently subjected to his satire.<note anchored="true"

                    8vo. Besides a son and two daughters born in England, Barclay had a son who was
                    born at Rome. His elder son is represented by Erythraeus as having obtained a
                    rich benefice from Urban VIII. With one of his sons Menage was acquainted at
                    Paris in the year 1652; and, in his opinion, “ce n’estoit pas un grand
                    personnage.” Like his father, he was a writer of Latin verses, and at this
                    period he there printed an elegy. We are not aware that the descendants of
                    Barclay are at present to be traced either in France or Italy. .</p>
                <p>This ingenious writer, who was thus arrested m the middle of his literary career,
                    left an unpublished history of the conquest of Jerusalem by the Franks, and some
                    fragments of a general history of Europe. Erythraeus informs us that he had
                    himself transcribed a manuscript tract of his, relating to the defection of Μ.
                    Ant. de Dominis, archbishop of Spalato; and that from his knowledge of the
                    national character, as well as of the disposition of the king, the author
                    foretold that he could not long remain in England.</p>
                <p>The ambition of Barclay was greater than his fortune; nor did his propensity to
                    satirize one class of individuals prevent him from offering abject flatteries to
                    another. But at that period few men of letters knew how to blend self-respect
                    with a proper deference to their superiors in the artificial scale of society.
                    His personal character, with an ample allowance for his vanity as an author,
                    appears to have been respectable. “Some very indecent descriptions in
                    Euphormion,” as Lord Hailes has remarked, “lead us to form an unfavourable
                    conjecture as to the manners of Barclay. There is however no proof that he was a
                    loose man; and indeed it is probable that he wrote loosely because Petronius,
                    whom he had chosen for his model in satire, affected that style. Barclay entered
                    into the married state at a very early period of life; and he appears to have
                    continued the fond husband of his <hi rend="italic">Aloysia....</hi> There is a
                    presumption, at least, that he who was a good son and a good husband, was also a
                    virtuous man in other respects; and if there had been any remarkable blemish in
                    the morals of Barclay, some of his numerous and virulent adversaries would have
                    pointed it out.” He appears to have been subjected to considerable annoyance in
                    consequence of the jealousy of his wife; but in many cases jealousy is a wayward
                    passion, and proceeds from the mere excess of affection, as well as from the
                    knowledge or suspicion of specific and painful facts.</p>
                <p>Barclay was evidently a man of genius, and with a vigorous imagination he united
                    a competent share of learning. His literary efforts were sufficiently
                    variegated; quitting the regions of poetry and romance, he ventured to discuss
                    subjects of jurisprudence and theology. His Latin poems exhibit marks of fancy
                    and ingenuity, nor is his skill as a versifier less conspicuous.<note

                    Petronius, and includes occasional verses interspersed with the prose. The
                    talent displayed in this work would alone have been sufficient to secure him a
                    high reputation among the writers of the age; but the fame of all his other
                    productions has in a great measure been eclipsed by that of his <hi
                    rend="italic">Argenis,</hi> which, after the lapse of two centuries, still finds
                    readers and admirers. <hi rend="italic">“Argenis,</hi>” says Lord Hailes, “is
                    generally supposed to be a history under feigned names, and not a romance.
                    Barclay himself contributed to establish this opinion, by introducing some real
                    characters into the work. But that was merely to compliment certain dignitaries
                    of the church, whose good offices he courted, or whose power he dreaded. The key
                    prefixed to <hi rend="italic">Argenis</hi> has perpetuated the error. There are
                    no doubt many incidents in it that allude to the state of France during the
                    civil wars in the seventeenth century; but it requires a strong imagination
                    indeed to discover Queen Elizabeth in Hvanisbe, or Henry III. of France in
                    Meleander. On the whole, <hi rend="italic">Argenis</hi> appears to be a poetical
                    fable, replete with moral and political reflections.” This is a sober and
                    correct account of the work; but Cowper has expressed his approbation in more
                    glowing terms. “The work I mean is Barclay’s <hi rend="italic">Argenis;</hi>
                    and, if ever you allow yourself to read for mere amusement, I can recommend it
                    to you (provided you have not already perused it) as the most amusing romance
                    that ever was written. It is the only one indeed of an old date that I ever had
                    the patience to go through with. It is interesting in a high degree, richer in
                    incident than can be imagined, full of surprizes, which the reader never
                    forestalls, and yet free from all entanglement and confusion. The stile too
                    appears to me to be such as would not dishonour Tacitus himself.” In another
                    letter he expresses himself thus :—“I have also read Barclay’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Argenis,</hi> a Latin romance, and the best romance that was ever
                    written.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Hayley’s <hi

                    This romance was a special favourite with Cardinal Richelieu, and also with
                    Leibnitz, a much greater man than the cardinal.</p>
                <p>Cowper appears to have been struck with the point and vivacity of his style,
                    which indeed are sufficiently distinguishable; but for the purity of his Latin
                    diction Barclay is not entitled to equal commendation. Being probably impelled
                    by the rapid current of his fancy, he adopts a variety of words and idioms which
                    well express his meaning, but which nevertheless do not belong to the best ages
                    of Latinity. The distich of Grotius, engraved under Barclay’s portrait, seems
                    therefore to contain a compliment which must not be too literally
                    interpreted:</p>

                <p>Joseph Scaliger, whose literary judgments were frequently severe, and not
                    unfrequently capricious, mentions Barclay’s <hi rend="italic">Satyrico</hi> in
                    terms of great disparagement; but whether. his censure is chiefly directed
                    against the Latinity or against the general strain of the work, is not

                    Englished by Tho. May, Esq.” Lond. 1633, 12mo. Of this translation there is

                    contains a mutilated title, and we therefore cannot discover the date. Two
                    French versions had appeared in the course of one year. “Le Pourtrait des
                    Esprits de Jean Bardai, mis en Francois.” Paris, 1625, 12mo. “Le Tableau des

                    Nantevil de Boham; and he has taken such liberties with the original, that his
                    work can scarcely claim the name of a translation. There is a German translation
                    of a very recent date: “Johann Barklai’s Gemalde der menschlichen Charaktere
                    nach Verschiedenheit der Alter, Zeiten, Lander, Individuen und Stande: aus dem
                    Lateinischen übersetzt, und mit Anmerkungen und geschichtlichen Nachweisungen
                    begleitet, von Anton Weddige, Pastor zu Lippborg.” Münster, 1821, 8vo. A
                    continuation of the <hi rend="italic">Satyrico</hi> had been published by Claude
                    Morisot, under the title of <hi rend="italic">Alitophili Veritatis
                    Lachrymoe;</hi> and Lord Hailes describes it as a masterpiece of absurdity.</p>
                <p>The editions and versions of the <hi rend="italic">Argenis</hi> are much more
                    numerous. An edition with notes appeared under the title of “Joannis Barclaii
                    Argenis, nunc primum illustrata.” Lugd. Bat. et Roter. 1664, 8vo. This was
                    followed in 1669 by a uniform edition of the continuation: “Archombrotus et
                    Theopompus, sive Argenidis secunda et tertia pars, ubi de Institutione
                    Principis.” The notes, which are not held in much estimation, were written by
                    Bugnot, a Benedictine who taught rhetoric in the abbey of Tiron. Lord Hailes
                    mentions a French translation published at Paris, 1622, 8vo; and another with
                    the subsequent title now lies before us: “L’Argenis de Jean Barclay: traduction
                    nouvelle, enrichie de figures.” Paris, 1625,8vo. There are other two French
                    versions of a more recent date, one by the Abbé Josse, a canon of Chartres,
                    1732, 3 tom. 12mo; and another by Μ. Savin, Paris, 1776, 2 tom. 8vo. Barclay’s
                    romance soon appeared in Spanish; and a copy of this rare version belongs to the
                    Astorga collection in the Advocates Library: “Argenis, por Don Joseph Pellicer
                    de Salas y Tobar. A Don Antonio de Negro, Noble de la Serenissima Republica de
                    Ge-noua.” Madrid, 1626, 4to. Don Joseph has somewhat unfairly excluded Barclay’s
                    name from the title-page. An English version was speedily published by Sir
                    Robert Le Grys and Thomas May, Esq. Lond. 1628,4 to. And another was executed by
                    Kingsmill Long, Esq. Lond. 1636, 4to. After a long interval appeared “The
                    Phoenix, or, the History of Polyarchus and Argenis. By a Lady.” London, 1772, 4
                    vols. 12mo. The preface of this publication states that “the editor has made use
                    of both the former translations occasionally, and, whenever a doubt arose, had
                    recourse to the original.” Lord Hailes has judiciously enough suggested that
                    “the lady would have done as well had she made use of the original, and only
                    consulted the translations when any doubt arose.” The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Argenis</hi> was at an early period translated into German: “Joan. Barclai
                    Argenis, verdeutscht durch Martin Opitzen.” Amsterdam, 1644, 12mo. In this
                    country, the version of Opitz is extremely rare; and the only copy that has
                    fallen under our inspection belongs to the writer of the present notice. Another
                    German translation was published by J. Ch. L. Haken. Berlin, 1794, 2 Bde. 8vo.
                    An Italian version was executed by Francesco Pona; and this celebrated romance
                    has even been translated into the Polish, Swedish, and Islandic languages. Among
                    the northern manuscripts in the Advocates Library there is a <hi rend="italic"

                    used all their efforts to draw him over to their religion. But he joined the

                    II., is very remarkable for the uncommon frankness and simplicity with which it
                    is written. Amongst many other extraordinary passages, we meet with the
                    following: “There is no king in the world who can so experimentally testify of
                    God’s providence and goodness; neither is there any who rules so many free
                    people, so many true Christians; which thing renders thy government more
                    honourable, thyself more considerable, than the accession of many nations filled
                    with slavish and superstitious souls. Thou hast tasted of prosperity and
                    adversity; thou knowest what it is to be banished thy native country, to be
                    over-ruled as well as to rule and sit upon the throne; and being oppressed, thou
                    hast reason to know how hateful the oppressor is both to God and man; if, after
                    all those warnings and advertisements, thou dost not turn unto the Lord with all
                    thy heart, but forget him who remembered thee in thy distress, and give thyself
                    up to follow lust and vanity, surely great will be thy condemna-tion.” He
                    travelled with the famous William Penn through the greater part of England,
                    Holland, and Germany, and was everywhere received with the highest respect; for
                    though both his conversation and behaviour were suitable to his principles, yet
                    there was such liveliness and spirit in his discourse, and such serenity and
                    cheerfulness in his deportment, as rendered him extremely agreeable to all sorts
                    of people. When he returned to his native country, he spent the remainder of his
                    life in a quiet and retired manner. He died at his own house at Ury, on the 3d
                    of October 1690, in the 42d year of his age.</p>
