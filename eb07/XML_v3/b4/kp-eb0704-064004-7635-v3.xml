                    significant corrections to the OCR text, predominantly in cases of confusing "c"
                    and "e." Isolates 90 entries that were mistakenly included at the end of prior
                    entries in v1 and v2. Normalizes ordinal numbers. Separates metadata in
                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                    instrument made of iron, edged in the form of a crescent, and adapted to a
                    handle. It is used by plumbers to perform several parts of their work, by
                    basket-makers to cut the largest pieces of chestnuttrees and other wood, and by
                    gardeners to prune trees. When short, it is called a <hi rend="italic"

                    rend="smallcaps">Bill,</hi> in <hi rend="italic">English Law,</hi> a declaration
                    in writing, expressing either some wrong the complainant has suffered from the
                    defendant, or a fault committed by the person complained of against some law or
                    statute. In Scottish law, every summary application, by way of petition to the
                    Court of Session, is called a <hi rend="italic">bill.</hi><hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Bill</hi> signifies also a paper, either written or printed, in very large
                    characters, which is posted up in some public place, to give notice of the sale
                    of any merchandise or commodity, or of any event, as the sailing of a vessel to
                    foreign parts.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Bill,</hi> in trade, both wholesale and retail, as also
                    among workmen, signifies an account of merchandise or goods delivered to a
                    person, or of work done for any one.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Bill,</hi> in commerce, has been usually defined a writing
                    in which one man is bound to another to pay a sum of money, on a day that is
                    future, or presently on demand, according to the agreement of the parties at the
                    time when it is drawn; and on which, in the event of failure, execution may be
                    summarily done to enforce payment.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Bill</hi><hi rend="italic">of Entry,</hi> an account
                    of the goods entered at the custom-house, both inwards and outwards. In this
                    bill must be expressed the name of the merchant exporting or importing, the
                    quantity and species of merchandise, and whither transported, or from
                    whence.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Bill of Exchange</hi> is an open letter of request from one man
                    to another, desiring him to pay a sum named therein to a third person on his
                    account; by which means a person in the most distant part of the world may have
                    money remitted to him from any trading country. For instance, if A lives in
                    Jamaica, and owes B, who lives in England L,1000, and if C be going from England
                    to Jamaica, he may pay B this L.I000, and take a bill of exchange drawn by B in
                    England upon A in Jamaica, and receive it when he arrives there. B therefore
                    receives his debt by transferring it to C, who carries over his money in paper
                    credit, without danger of loss or robbery. The person, however, who writes this
                    letter, is called, in law, the <hi rend="italic">drawer;</hi> he to whom it is
                    written, the <hi rend="italic">drawee;</hi> and the third person or negociator
                    to whom it is payable, whether specially named or described generally as the
                    bearer, is called the <hi rend="italic">payee.</hi></p>
                <p>These bills are either foreign or inland; foreign, when drawn by a merchant
                    residing abroad upon his correspondent in England, or <hi rend="italic">vice
                    versa;</hi> and inland, when both the drawer and the drawee reside within the
                    kingdom. Formerly foreign bills of exchange were much more regarded in the eye
                    of the law than inland ones, as being thought of more public concern in the
                    advancement of trade and commerce; but now, by several statutes, inland bills of
                    exchange are put upon the same footing as foreign ones, so that in law there is
                    no manner of difference between them. In drawing foreign bills of exchange, it
                    is customary to frame two or three of the same tenor and date, to be sent by
                    different conveyances, that in case of accident the person to whom they are
                    transmitted may not be disappointed; in which case it is mentioned in the body
                    of the bill, that it is the first, second, or third bill of exchange, and when
                    one is paid it discharges all the rest.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Bill</hi><hi rend="italic">of Lading</hi> is an
                    acknowledgement signed by the master of a ship, and given to a merchant or other
                    person, containing an account of the goods which the master has received on
                    board from that individual, with a promise to deliver them at an intended place

                    subject before passing to modifications in the way and manner to be afterwards
                    described, or to rejection <hi rend="italic">ex toto.</hi></p>
                <p>To bring a bill into the house, if the relief sought by it be of a private
                    nature, it is first necessary to present a petition setting forth the grievance
                    desired to be remedied. This petition, when founded on facts that may be or
                    actually are disputed, is referred to a committee of members, who examine the
                    matter alleged, and report thereon to the house; and then (or otherwise upon the
                    mere petition) leave is given to bring in the bill. In public matters, the bill
                    is brought in upon motion made to the house, without any petition at all.
                    Formerly all bills were drawn in the form of petitions, which were entered upon
                    the rolls of parliament, with the king’s answer subjoined,not in any settled
                    form of words, but as the circumstances of the case required; and at the end of
                    each parliament the judges drew them in the form of a statute, which was entered
                    on the statute-books. To prevent mistakes and abuses, the statutes were in the
                    reign of Henry V. drawn up by the judges before the end of the parliament; and
                    in the reign of Henry VI. bills in the form of acts according to the modern
                    custom were first introduced.</p>
                <p>The persons directed to bring in the bill present it ι∏ a competent time to the
                    house, drawn out on paper, with a multitude of blanks, or void spaces, where any
                    thing occurs that is dubious, or necessary to be settled by the parliament<pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193197648" xml:id="kp-eb0704-7648-0641"/> itself, such
                    especially as the precise dates, the nature and quantity of penalties, or the
                    sums of money to be raised. In the house of lords, if the bill originates there,
                    and is of a private nature, it is referred to two of the judges, who examine and
                    report on the state of the facts alleged, and settle all points of technical
                    propriety. This is read a first time, and at a convenient distance a second
                    time; and after each reading, the speaker opens to the house the substance of
                    the bill, and puts the question, whether it shall proceed any further. The
                    introduction of the bill may be originally opposed, as the bill itself may also
                    be at any of the readings; and, if the opposition succeed, either at the
                    commencement or at any of the subsequent stages, the bill must be dropped for
                    that session.</p>
                <p>After the second reading, it is committed, or, in other words, referred to a
                    committee; and This is either selected by the house, as happens in matters of
                    minor importance, or else, upon a bill of consequence, the house resolves itself
                    into a committee of the whole. A committee of the whole house is composed of
                    every member; and, to form it, the speaker quits the chair, another member being
                    appointed chairman, and may sit and debate as a private member. In these
                    committees the bill is debated clause by clause, amendments are made, the blanks
                    are filled up, and sometimes the bill is entirely new-modelled. After it has
                    gone through the committee, the chairman reports it to the house, with such
                    amendments as the committee may have made; and then the house considers the
                    whole bill again, and the question is repeatedly put upon every clause and
                    amendment. When the house has agreed to the amendments of the committee, and
                    sometimes added new amendments of its own, the bill is then ordered to be
                    engrossed, or written in a strong gross hand on one or more rolls of parchment
                    fastened together; after which it is read a third time, when amendments are
                    sometimes made on it; and if a new clause be added, it is done by tacking a
                    separate piece of parchment to the bill, which is called a <hi rend="italic"
                    >rider.</hi> The speaker then states the contents generally; and, in holding it
                    up in his hands, puts the question, whether the bill shall pass. If the decision
                    be in the affirmative, the title is then settled; and this used to be a general
                    one for all the acts passed in the session, till the fifth year of Henry VIII.,
                    when distinct titles were introduced for each chapter. One of the members is
                    then directed to carry it to the lords and desire their concurrence; and he,
                    attended by several more, carries it accordingly to the bar of the house of
                    peers, and there delivers it to their speaker, who comes down from his woolsack
                    to receive it.</p>
                <p>In the house of peers, it passes through the same forms as in the other house,
                    except engrossing, which is already done; and if it be rejected, no more notice
                    is taken of it, and it is allowed to drop <hi rend="italic">sub silentio,</hi>
                    to prevent unbecoming altercations. But if it be agreed to, the lords send a
                    message by two masters in chancery, or sometimes by two of the judges, that they
                    have agreed to the same; and the bill remains with them if they have made no
                    amendments on it. But if any amendments be made, such amendments are sent down
                    with the bill to receive the concurrence of the commons; and if the commons
                    disapprove of the amendments, a conference usually follows between members
                    deputed from each house, who for the most part settle and adjust the difference;
                    but if both houses remain inflexible, the bill is dropped. If the commons agree
                    to amendments, the bill is sent back to the lords by one of the members, "With a
                    message to inform them of this concurrence. The same forms are observed, <hi
                    rend="italic">mutatis mutandis,</hi> when the bill originates in the house of
                    lords. But when an act of grace or pardon is passed, it is first signed by his
                    majesty, and then read once only in each of the houses, without any new
                    engrossing or amendment. And when a bill has passed through its various stages
                    in both houses, it is deposited in the house of peers, to await the royal
                    assent; except in the case of a bill of supply, which, after receiving the
                    concurrence of the lords, is sent back to the house of commons.</p>
                <p>The royal assent may be given two ways :—First, in person, when the king comes to
                    the house of peers, in his crown and royal robes, and, summoning the commons to
                    the bar, the titles of all the bills that have passed both houses are read; and
                    the king’s answer is declared by the clerk of the parliament in Norman-French.
                    If the king consents to a public bill, the clerk usually declares, <hi
                    rend="italic">Le roy le veut, “</hi> the king wills it so to be if to a private
                    bill, <hi rend="italic">Soit fait comme il est désiré,</hi> “be it as it is
                    desired.” If the king refuses his assent, it is in the qualified terms of <hi
                    rend="italic">Le roy s'avisera, “</hi> the king will advise upon it.” When a
                    bill of supply is passed, it is carried up and presented to the king by the
                    speaker of the house of commons, and the royal assent is thus expressed: <hi
                    rend="italic">Le roy remercie ses loyal subjects, accepte leur benevolence, et
                    aussi le veut;</hi> “the king thanks his loyal subjects, accepts their
                    benevolence, and wills it so to be.” In case of an act of grace, which
                    originally proceeds from the crown and has the royal assent in the first stage
                    of it, the clerk of the parliament thus pronounces the gratitude of the subject:
                    <hi rend="italic">Les prélats, seigneurs, et commons, en ce present parliament
                    assembles, au nom de touts vos autres subjects, remercient tres humblement votre
                    majesté, et prient a Pieu vous donner en santé bonne vie et longue;</hi> “the
                    prelates, lords, and commons in this present parliament assembled, in the name
                    of all your other subjects, most humbly thank your majesty, and pray to God to
                    grant you in health and wealth long to live.”</p>
                <p>Secondly, the king may give his assent by letters patent under his great seal,
                    signed with his hand, and notified in his absence to both houses assembled
                    together in the high house; or he may appoint a commission under the great seal,
                    consisting of peers of parliament, and including the lord high chancellor for
                    the time being, who are empowered and authorized to adhibit the royal assent to
                    such bills as are then in a state to receive the sanction of the third estate of
                    the realm. And when the bill has received the royal assent in either of these
                    ways, it is then, and not before, a statute or aċt of parliament.</p>
                <p>The new statute or act is then placed among the records of the kingdom, no formal
                    promulgation being requisite to give it the force of a law, as was the case by
                    the civil law with regard to the imperial constitutions, because every man in
                    Britain is, in the presumption of law, a party to the making of a statute or act
                    of parliament, being held to be present thereat by his representatives. The act,
                    however, is usually printed at the king’s press for the information of the
                    lieges: and formerly, before the invention of printing, it used to be published
                    by the sheriff of every county; the king’s writ being sent to him at the end of
                    every session, together with a transcript of all the acts made at that session,
                    commanding him, <hi rend="italic">ut statuta illa, et omnes articulos in eisdem
                    contentos, in singulis locis ubi expedire viderit, publice proclamari, et
                    firmiter teneri et observari faciat.</hi> The usage then was to proclaim them at
                    the county court, and there to keep them, that whosoever chose might read or
                    take copies of them; which custom continued till the reign of Henry VII.</p>
                <p>An act of parliament thus made is the exercise of the highest authority which
                    this kingdom acknowledges upon earth. It has power to bind every subject in the
                    united kingdom, and the dominions thereunto belonging,—nay, even the king
                    himself, if particularly named therein; and it cannot be altered, amended,
                    dispensed with, suspended, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193197661"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0704-7661-0642"/>or repealed, but in the same forms and by the same
                    authority of parliament; for it is an inviolable maxim in law, that it requires
                    the same strength to dissolve as to create an obligation.</p>
