                    Bejapore, and capital of the peshwa, the chief of the Mahratta state. Situated
                    about thirty miles to the east of the Ghauts, it is an open and defenceless
                    town, covering little more than two square miles, and indifferently built, so
                    that it has rather the appearance of a large village than that of a town. It has
                    long and narrow streets, and the houses are indifferently built; the better sort
                    are raised with large blocks of granite to the height of about fourteen feet,
                    after which the superstructure is composed of timber frames, with slight
                    brick-walls. The ordinary houses are only one story high, with tiled roofs. The
                    lime which cements the bricks and tiles is so bad, that the rain washes away any
                    building that does not depend on timber for its support. There is an ancient
                    palace or castle, in which the peshwa’s brother and other members of the family
                    reside; it is surrounded by high and thick brick walls, with round towers at the
                    angles, and has only one entrance through a pointed arch. Here the peshwa
                    assembles the Brahmins, to whom he gives alms at the great feast when the rainy
                    season terminates, and who are accustomed on this occasion to beg their way to
                    Poonah from all parts of India. The family of the peshwa have, besides the
                    castle, a modern house for their own residence in another part of the town. In
                    1809 the peshwa made arrangements for the erection, of a palace, to be built by
                    British architects. Poonah was, in the flourishing period of the Mahratta power,
                    a great place of rendezvous for the different independent chiefs, with their
                    numerous followers, in order to consult on the general interests of the
                    confederacy, and, when at war, to settle the plan of operations. These meetings
                    were held about the middle of October, at the end of the rainy season, and were
                    sometimes attended by 400,000 or 500,000 people, who were encamped in the
                    surrounding plain, and were well supplied with every necessary, such as wood,
                    grain, and fodder, which were brought down the rivers. The inhabitants are well
                    provided from extensive markets; and in one long street a great variety of
                    articles are displayed, such as mirrors, globes, lamps, &amp;c. The slaughter of
                    kine is prohibited; and poultry is never reared or eaten except by the very
                    lowest castes. The streets are named after mythological personages, with the
                    addition of <hi rend="italic">warry,</hi> which is equivalent to street. Poonah
                    is situated at the confluence of the Moota with the Moola River, their union
                    forming the Mootamoola, which runs into the Beemah; the latter river forms a
                    junction with the Krishna, and, during the rainy season, a journey by water may
                    be effected from within seventy-five miles’ distance of the western coast of
                    India to the Bay of Bengal. The Moòla washes the city on the north side, where
                    it is two hundred yards in breadth, and in the dry season very shallow. In one
                    of the suburbs, called the Sungum, situated on the opposite side of the Moota
                    River, about two miles from the city, the British ambassador with his suite
                    resides, and other British subjects. The cantonments for the subsidiary force
                    are also in this vicinity. Mythological excavations are found to the eastward of
                    the city, but greatly inferior to those of Elora and Elephanta. The practice of
                    sacrificing the widow along with the deceased husband was common at Poonah, and
                    this cruel and barbarous rite was performed at the confluence of the Moota and
                    Moola Rivers, held sacred by the Hindus, and close to the British residency. The
                    burning of widows is now declared a crime by the British government, and is
                    prevented by the interference of the civil power; so that these enormities under
                    the name of religion can no longer be practised under the eye of the British
                    authorities. The population of Poonah is estimated at 100,000, on the most
                    moderate computation.</p><p>The first notice of Poonah occurs in the early part of the seventeenth century,
                    when it was included in the jaghire or estate of Thahjee, father of the famous
                    Sevajee, who built the palace there for his own residence. In 1740 the office
                    and the power of the peshwa was usurped by Bajeerow, who having confined his
                    master Ram Rajah to the fortress of Sattara, fixed his residence at Poonah, and
                    died there in 1759. The dignity was transmitted to his grandson Madhoorow, who
                    died in 1772, and was succeeded by his son Narrain Row, who was murdered by his
                    uncle Ragoba; and shortly afterwards a posthumous child of the deceased was
                    placed on the throne. He died in 1795, and the elder of the two sons of Ragoba,
                    named Bageerow, succeeded. During these disputes Scindia and Holkar interfered,
                    and seized the sovereignty. A treaty was in consequence concluded between the
                    peshwa and the British, who re-established his authority; and this good
                    understanding continued for nearly fifteen years. But in 1817, the peshwa,
                    anxious to emancipate himself from the bondage of the British yoke, entered into
                    the hostile combination which was then formed amongst the native powers for the
                    assertion of their independence. As the contest ended in the triumph of the
                    British armies, the peshwa was compelled to fly, and, after a contest of nearly
                    two years, he at last consented to resign his office, and to retire on a pension
                    to Benares. A descendant of Ram Rajah was raised to the nominal dignity of the
                    peshwa, now become a mere pageant, and a pensioner on the British, on condition
                    of his residing at Sattara; and a British resident, denominated a <pb break="no" facs="nls:193537055" xml:id="kp-eb0718-7055-0364"/>commissioner,
                    is now stationed at Poonah. The travelling distance from Bombay is 98 miles,
                    from Hyderabad 387, from Oojain 442, from Nagpoor 486, from Delhi 913, and from
                    Calcutta by Nagpoor 1208 miles. Long. 74. E. Lat. 18. 30. N.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
