                    he has from all eternity unchangeably appointed whatsoever comesto pass; and has
                    more especially fore-ordained certain individuals of the human race to
                    everlasting happiness, and passed by the rest, fore-ordaining them to
                    everlasting misery. The former of these are called the elect, and the latter are
                    called the reprobate.</p><p>This doctrine is the subject of one of the most perplexing controversies that has
                    occurred amongst mankind. But it is not altogether peculiar to the Christian
                    faith. The opinion, that whatever occurs in the world at large, or in the lot of
                    private individuals, is the result of a previous and unalterable arrangement by
                    that Supreme Power which presides over nature, has always been a favourite
                    opinion amongst the vulgar, and has also been believed by many speculative men.
                    Thus, in that beautiful scene in the sixth book of the Iliad, Hector, taking
                    leave of his wife and child, speaks thus:</p><p>Andromache, my soul’s far better part, Why with untimely sorrows heaves thy
                    heart? No hostile hand can antedate my doom, Till fate condemns me to the silent
                    tomb.</p><p>Fix’d is the term to all the race of earth, And such the hard condition of our
                    birth. No force can then resist, no flight can save; All sink alike, the fearful
                    and the brave.</p><p>The ancient Stoics, Zeno and Chrysippus, whom the Jewish Essenes seem to have
                    followed, asserted the existence of a Deity, who, acting wisely, but
                    necessarily, contrived the general system of the universe; from which, by a
                    series of causes, whatever is now done in it unavoidably results. This series,
                    or concatenation of causes, they held to be necessary in every part; and thought
                    God himself as so much the servant of necessity, and of his own decrees, that he
                    could not have made the smallest object in the world otherwise than it now is,
                    much less was he able to alter any thing.</p><p>According to the words of Seneca, <hi rend="italic">Eadem necessitas</hi><hi rend="italic">et</hi><hi rend="italic">Dcos</hi><hi rend="italic">alligat.
                    Irrevocabilis divina pariter atque humana cursus vehit. Ille ipse omnium
                    conditor ac rector scripsit quidem fata sed sequitur.</hi><hi rend="italic">Semper</hi><hi rend="italic">paret, semel jussit.</hi> “The same chain of
                    necessity constrains both gods and men. Its unalterable course regulates divine
                    as well as human things. Even he who wrote the Fates, the Maker and Governor of
                    all things, submits to them. He did but once command, but he always obeys.” The
                    stoical fate, however, differs from the Christian predestination in several
                    points. They regarded the divine nature and will as a necessary part of a
                    necessary chain of causes; whereas the Christians consider the Deity as the lord
                    and ruler of the Universe, omnipotent and free, appointing all things according
                    to his pleasure. Being doubtful of the immortality of the soul, the Stoics could
                    have no idea of the doctrine of election and reprobation; nor did they ever
                    doubt their own freedom of will, or power of doing good as well as evil, as we
                    shall presently see the Christian predestinarians have done.</p><p>Mahommed introduced into his Koran the doctrine of an absolute predestination.of
                    the course of human affairs. He represented life and death, prosperity and
                    adversity, with <pb break="no" facs="nls:193539070" xml:id="kp-eb0718-9070-0515"/>every event that befalls a man in this world, as
                    the result of a previous determination of the one God who rules over all; and he
                    found this opinion the best engine for inspiring his followers with that
                    contempt of danger, which, united to fanatical zeal, has extended the empire of
                    their faith over the fairest portion of the habitable globe.</p><p>The controversy concerning predestination first made its appearance in the
                    Christian church about the beginning of the fifth century. Pelagius a British,
                    and Coelestius an Irish monk, both lived at Rome during that period, and
                    possessed great celebrity on acconnt of their piety and learning. They taught
                    that the opinion is false, which asserts, that human nature is necessarily
                    corrupted by a depravity derived from our first parents. They contended, that
                    men are born at present in a state as pure as that in which Adam was originally
                    created; and that they are not less qualified than he was for fulfiling all
                    righteousness, and for reaching the most sublime eminence of piety and virtue.
                    They maintained that the external grace of God, which is given unto all, and
                    attends the preaching of the gospel, is necessary to call forth the attention
                    and the exertions of men; but that we do not want the assistance of any internal
                    grace to purify the heart, and to give it the first impulse towards what is
                    good. Having fled into Africa on account of the Goths, who at that time (A. D.
                    410,) invaded Italy, Coelestius remained at Carthage as a presbyter; but
                    Pelagius went into the East, where he settled, and prospered under the patronage
                    of John bishop of Jerusalem, to whom his sentiments were agreeable. On the
                    contrary, the celebrated Augustin, bishop of Hippo, strenuously asserted the
                    depravity of human nature since the fall of the first man; the necessity of a
                    special interposition of divine grace to enable us to do any one good action;
                    and consequently, that none could obtain salvation excepting those whom God has
                    thought fit to elect, and upon whom he bestows this grace. The dispute was
                    carried on with great zeal. Zozimus, bishop of Rome, decided at first in favour
                    of Pelagius and Coelestius, whose followers were called <hi rend="italic">Pelagians</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> but he afterwards altered his opinion,
                    and by the activity of Augustin, the council of Ephesus was called, at which the
                    opinion of his antagonists Avas formally condemned.</p><p>In the course of the same century, these opinions assumed a variety of forms and
                    modifications. One party, called <hi rend="italic">Predestinarians,</hi> carried
                    Augustin’s doctrine fully farther than he himself had ventured to do in express
                    Avords; and asserted, that God had not only predestinated the Avicked to
                    punishment, but that he had also decreed that they should commit those very sins
                    on account of Avhich they are hereafter to be punished. Another party moderated
                    the doctrine of Pelagius, and Avere called <hi rend="italic">Semipelagians.</hi>
                    Their peculiar opinion is expressed in a different manner by different Avriters;
                    but all the accounts sufficiently agree. Thus, some represent them as
                    maintaining that inAvard grace is not necessary to the first beginning of
                    repentance, but only to our progress in virtue. Others say, that they
                    acknoAvledged the power of grace, but said that faith depends upon ourselves,
                    and good Avorks upon God; and it is agreed upon all hands, that these
                    Semipelagians held that predestination is made upon the foresight of good
                    Avorks. The assistance of St. Augustin, though then far advanced in life, was
                    called in to combat these tenets, and he Avrote several treatises upon the
                    subject. In all these he strenuously maintained, that the predestination of the
                    elect Avas independent of any foresight of their good works, but Avas according
                    to the good pleasure of God only; and that perseverance comes from God, and not
                    from man. Thereafter the doctrine of St. Augustin, as he is often called, became
                    general. He Avas the oracle of the schoolmen. They never ventured to dif for
                    from him in sentiment; they only pretended to dispute about the true sense of
                    his writings.</p><p>Almost the Avhole of the earliest refermers maintained these opinions of St.
                    Augustin. They assumed, under Luther, a more regular and systematic form than
                    they had ever formerly exhibited. But as the Lutherans afterwards abandoned
                    them, they are now known by the name of <hi rend="italic">Calvinis-tic
                    Doctrines,</hi> from John Calvin of Geneva. This reformer asserted, that the
                    everlasting condition of mankind in a future world Avas determined from all
                    eternity by the unchangeable decree of the Deity, arising from his sole good
                    pleasure or free will. Being a man of great ability, industry, and eloquence,
                    Geneva, Avhere he taught, and which Avas a free state, soon became the resort of
                    all the men of letters belonging to the reformed churches, and Avas a kind of
                    seminary from which missionaries issued to propagate the Protestant doctrine
                    throughout Europe. Their success Avas such, that, excepting a small part of
                    Germany, the principles of all the reformed churches are professedly Calvinistic
                    or Predestinarian.</p><p>The opponents of the doctrine of predestination amongst the Protestants usually
                    receive the appellation of <hi rend="italic">Arminians</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Remonstrants.</hi> They derive the first of these ap-pelations from James
                    Arminius, who, in 1602, Avas appointed<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Relatio Historica</hi><hi rend="italic">de Origine et</hi><hi rend="italic">Progressu Controversiarum</hi><hi rend="italic">de Proedestinatione</hi> Philippi à Limborch.</p></note> professor
                    of theology at Leyden. He Avas violently opposed by Gomer his colleague, and
                    died in 1609. After his death, the controversy Avas conducted Avith great
                    eagerness on both sides. The Calvinists, hoAvever, gradually prevailed. A synod
                    Avas called at Dort, in 1618, to which the most celebrated divines of different
                    countries Avere invited. There, in a great measure, by the authority and
                    influence of Maurice prince of Orange, the Arminians Avere condemned as
                    heretics; for by this time ambitious and poAverful men found themselves
                    politically interested in this religious contest. The Arminians presented to
                    this synod a remonstrance, containing a statement of their faith upon the
                    subjects in dispute; and from this they derived the appellation of <hi rend="italic">Remonstrants.</hi> This statement contained the five folloAving
                    articles. 1. That God from all eternity predestinated those to everlasting
                    salvation Avhom he foresaAv Avould believe in Christ unto the end of their
                    lives, and predestinated obstinate unbelievers to everlasting punishment. 2.
                    Jesus Christ died for the Avhole human race, and for every individual of it, but
                    believers alone reap the benefit of his death. 3. No man can produce faith in
                    his mind by his <hi rend="smallcaps">oavn</hi> free-will, but it is necessary
                    that man, who is by nature Avicked and unfit for acting or thinking aright,
                    should be regenerated by the grace of the Holy Spirit, imparted by God for
                    Christ’s sake. 4. This divine grace constitutes the source, the progress, and
                    the fulfilment, of all that is good in man, but it is not irresistible in its
                    operation. 5. Believers, by the assistance of the Holy Spirit, are abundantly
                    fitted for every good Avork; but Avhether it is possible for those <hi rend="smallcaps">av!io</hi> have once been truly such to fall aAvay, and to
                    perish finally, is not clear, and must be better inquired into by searching the
                    Scriptures.</p><p>In opposition to these, a counter remonstrance was presented, containing the
                    opinions of the Calvinists, Avhich was approved of by the synod. The substance
                    of it was after-Avards adopted, and in nearly the same expressions, into the
                    Confession of Faith compiled by the assembly of divines Avhich met at
                    Westminster, in 1643, and which every clergyman and probationer for the ministry
                    in Scotland is at present required to subscribe previous to his admission. To
                    give as clear and fair an idea as possible to the Calvinistic doctrine upon this
                    head, we transcribe the folloAving passage from that Confession: “God from all
                    eternity did, by the most wise and holy counsel of his own will, freely and
                    unchangeably ordain Avhatsoever comes to pass; yet so, as thereby neither is God
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:193539083" xml:id="kp-eb0718-9083-0516"/>the author of sin, nor is violence offered to the will of the creatures, nor
                    is the liberty or contingencies of second causes taken away, but rather
                    established. Although God knows whatsoever may or can come to pass upon all
                    supposed conditions; yet hath he not decreed any thing because he foresaw it as
                    future, or that which would come to pass upon such conditions. By the decree of
                    God, for the manifestation of his glory, some men and angels are predestinated
                    unto everlasting life, and others are fore-ordained to everlasting death. These
                    angels and men, thus predestinated and fore-ordained, are particularly and
                    unchangeably designed; and their number is so certain and definite, that it
                    cannot be either increased or diminished. Those of mankind that are
                    predestinated unto life, God, before the foundation of the world was laid,
                    according to his eternal and immutable purpose, and the secret counsel and good
                    pleasure of his will, hath chosen, in Christ, unto everlasting glory, out of his
                    mere free grace and love, without any foresight of faith, or good works, or
                    perseverance in either of them, or any other thing in the creature, as
                    conditions or causes moving him thereunto; and all to the praise of his glorious
                    grace. As God hath appointed the elect unto glory, so hath he, by the eternal
                    and most free purpose of his will, fore-ordained, all the means thereunto.
                    Wherefore, they who are elected, being fallen in Adam, are redeemed by Christ,
                    are effectually called unto faith in Christ, by his spirit working in due
                    season; are justified, adopted, sanctified, and kept, by his power through faith
                    unto salvation. Neither are any other redeemed by Christ effectually called,
                    justified, adopted, sanctified, and saved, but the elect only. The rest of
                    mankind, God was pleased, according to the unsearchable counsel of his own will,
                    whereby he extendeth or withholdeth mercy as he pleaseth for the glory of his
                    sovereign power over his creatures, to pass by, and to ordain them to dishonour
                    and wrath for their sin, to the praise of his glorious justice.”</p><p>There are two kinds of Calvinists or Predestinarians, viz. the <hi rend="italic">Supralapsarians,</hi> who maintained that God did originally and expressly
                    decree the fall of Adam, as a foundation for the display of his justice and
                    mercy; whilst they who maintain that God <hi rend="italic">oτΛy permitted</hi>
                    the fall of Adam, are called <hi rend="italic">Sublapsarians,</hi> their system
                    of decrees concerning election and reprobation, being as it were, subsequent to
                    that event. But, as Dr. Priestley justly remarks, if we admit the divine
                    prescience, there is not, in fact, any difference between the two schemes; and
                    accordingly that distinction is now seldom mentioned.</p><p>Nor was the church of Rome less agitated by the contest about predestination than
                    were the first Protestants. The council of Trent was much perplexed how to
                    settle the matter without giving offence to the Dominicans, who were much
                    attached to the doctrine of St. Augustin, and possessed great influence in the
                    council. After much dispute, the main object came to be, how to contrive such a
                    decree as might give offence to nobody, although it should decide nothing. Upon
                    the whole, however, they seem to have favoured the Semipelagian scheme. Amongst
                    other things, it was determined, that good works are of themselves meritorious
                    to eternal life; but it is added, by way of softening, that it is through the
                    goodness of God, that he makes his own gifts to be merits in us. Catarin revived
                    at that council an opinion of some of the schoolmen, that God chose a small
                    number of persons, such as the blessed virgin, the apostles, and others, whom he
                    was determined to save without any foresight of their good works; and that he
                    also wills that all the rest should be saved, providing for them all necessary
                    means, but they are at liberty to use them or not. This is called the <hi rend="italic">Baxterian</hi> scheme in England, from one of its promoters there.
                    But at all events, the council of Trent seems to have been extremely anxious
                    that any opinions entertained amongst them concerning predestination might have
                    as little influence as possible upon practical morality. “Let no man,” say they,
                    “whilst he remains in this mortal state presume that he is among the number of
                    the elect, and that therefore he cannot sin, or sin without repentance; for it
                    cannot be known who are elected without a special revelation from God.” (Sect.
                    6. c. 13.)</p><p>The Jesuits at first followed the opinion of St. Augustin; but they afterwards
                    forsook it. Molina, one of their order, was the author of what is called the <hi rend="italic">middle scheme,</hi> or the doctrine of <hi rend="italic">agrace
                    sufficient for all men,</hi> but subject to the freedom of the human will.
                    Jansenius, a doctor of Louvain, opposed the Jesuits with great vigour, and
                    supported the doctrine of St. Augustin. He wrote in a very artful manner,
                    declaring that he did not presume to state his own sentiments upon the subject.
                    He pretended only to explain and publish the sentiments of that great father of
                    the church St. Augustin. But the Jesuits, in consequence of that inviolable
                    submission to the authority of the pope, which they always maintained, had
                    sufficient interest at Rome to procure the opinion of Jansenius to be condemned
                    there; with this addition subjoined, however, that nothing was thereby intended
                    to be done in prejudice of the doctrine of St. Augustin. This produced an absurd
                    dispute about the pope’s infallibility in matters of fact. The Jansenists
                    affirmed, that the pope had made a mistake in condemning the opinions of
                    Jansenius as different from those of St. Augustin; whereas in truth they are the
                    same, and the one cannot be condemned without the other. But the Jesuits
                    affirmed, that the pope is no less infallible in points of fact than he is in
                    questions of faith; and he having decided, that the opinions of Jansenius are
                    different from those of St. Augustin, every good Catholic is bound to believe
                    accordingly that they are different. Some of the very ablest supporters of
                    predestination have appeared amongst the Jansenists, and particularly amongst
                    the gentlemen of Port-Royal.</p><p>With regard to Great Britain, the earliest English reformers were in general
                    Sublapsarians, although some of them were Supralapsarians. But the rigid
                    Predestinarians have been gradually declining in number in that church, although
                    they still subscribe the thirty-nine articles of their faith, which are
                    unquestionably Calvinistic. The celebrated Scotch reformer John Knox having been
                    educated at Geneva, established in this country the doctrine of predestination
                    in its strictest form; and it has probably been adhered to with more strictness
                    in Scotland than in any other country of Europe.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
