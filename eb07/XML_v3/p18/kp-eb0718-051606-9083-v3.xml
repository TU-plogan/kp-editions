                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">PRE-EXISTENCE</label>, a priority of being, or the being of
                    one thing before another. Thus a cause, if not in time, is yet in nature
                    pre-existent to its effect. Thus God is preexistent to the universe, and a human
                    father is pre-existent to his son. The Peripatetics, though they maintained <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193539096" xml:id="kp-eb0718-9096-0517"/> the eternity of
                    the world, were likewise dogmatical in their opinion, that the universe was
                    formed, actuated, and governed, by a sovereign intelligence.</p>
                <p>The pre-existence of the human soifl to its corporeal vehicle had been from time
                    immemorial a prevailing opinion amongst the Asiatic sages, and from them was
                    perhaps transferred by Pythagoras to the philosophy of the Greeks; but his
                    metempsychosis, or transmigration of souls, is too trivial either to be
                    seriously proposed or refuted. Nevertheless, from the sentiments of Socrates
                    concerning the immortality of the soul, delivered in his last interview with his
                    friends, it is obvious that the tenet of pre-existence was a doctrine of the
                    Platonic school. If at any period of life, say these philosophers, you should
                    examine a boy, of how many ideas, of what a number of principles, <hi
                    rend="italic">of</hi> what an extent of knowledge will you find him possessed?
                    These without doubt could neither be self-derived nor recently acquired. With
                    what avidity and promptitude does he attain the knowledge of arts and of
                    sciences, which appear entirely new to him? These rapid and successful advances
                    in knowledge can only be the effects of reminiscence, or of a fainter and more
                    indistinct species of recollection. But in all the other operations of memory,
                    we find retrospective impressions attending almost every object or idea which
                    emerges to her view; nor does she ever suggest any thought, or word, or action,
                    without informing us, in a manner equally clear and evident, that those
                    impressions had been made upon our senses, mind, or intellect, on some former
                    occasion. Whoever contemplates her progress, will easily discover, that
                    association is her most faithful and most efficacious auxiliary; and that by
                    joining impression with impression, idea with idea, circumstance with
                    circumstance, in the order of time, of place, of similarity or dissimilarity,
                    she is enabled to accumulate her treasures and enlarge her province even to an
                    indefinite extent. But when intuitive principles, or simple conclusions, are
                    elicited from the puerile understanding by a train of easy questions properly
                    arranged, where is the retrospective act of the memory, by which the boy
                    recognises those truths as having formerly been perceived in his mind? Where are
                    the crowds of the concomitant, antecedent, or subsequent ideas, with which those
                    recollections ought naturally to have been attended? In a word, where is the
                    sense of personal identity, which seems to be absolutely inseparable from every
                    act of memory? This hypothesis, therefore, will not support the notion of
                    pre-existence. After the Christian religion had been considerably diffused, and
                    warmly combated by its philosophical antagonists, the same doctrine was resumed
                    and taught at Alexandria, by Platonic proselytes, not only as a constituent
                    topic of their master’s philosophy, but as an answer to those formidable
                    objections which had been deduced from the doctrine of original sin, and from
                    the vices which stain, as well as from the calamities which disturb, human life.
                    Hence they strenuously asserted, that all the human race were either introduced
                    to being prior to Adam, or pre-existent in his person; that they were not,
                    therefore, represented by our first parents, but actually concurred in their
                    crime, and participated in their ruin.</p>
                <p>The followers of Origen, and such as entertained the notion of pre-adamites,
                    might argue from the doctrine of preexistence with some degree of plausibility.
                    For the human beings introduced by them to the theatre of probation had already
                    attained the capacity or dignity of moral agents; as their crime therefore was
                    voluntary, their punishment might be just. But those who believe the whole human
                    race created in Adam to be only pre-existent in their germs or stamina, were
                    even deprived of this miserable subterfuge; for in these “homunculi” we can
                    neither suppose the moral nor rational constitution unfolded. Since, therefore,
                    their degeneracy was not spontaneous, neither could their sufferings be
                    equitable. Should it be said that the evil of original sin was penal, as it
                    extended to our first parents alone, and merely consequential as felt by their
                    posterity, it will be admitted that the distinction between penal and
                    consequential evil may be intelligible in human affairs, where other laws,
                    assortments, and combinations than those which are simply, and purely moral,
                    take place. But that a moral government, at one of the most cardinal periods of
                    its administration, should admit gratuitous or consequential evil, seems to us
                    irreconcilable with the attributes and conduct of a wise and just legislator.
                    Consequential evil, taken as such, is misery sustained without demerit, and
                    cannot result from the procedure of wisdom, benignity, and justice, but must
                    flow from necessity, from ignorance, from cruelty, or from caprice, as its only
                    possible sources. But even upon the supposition of those who pretend that man
                    was mature in all his faculties before the commission of original sin, the
                    objections against it will still remain in full force; for it is admitted by all
                    except the Samian sage, that the consciousness of personal identity which was
                    felt in pre-existence, is ob- ∙literated in a subsequent state of being.</p>
                <p>Now it may be demanded, whether agents thus resuscitated for punishment have not
                    the same right to murmur and complain as if they had been perfectly innocent,
                    and only created for that dreadful catastrophe? It is upon this principle alone
                    that the effects of punishment can be either exemplary or disciplinary; for how
                    is it possible, that the punishment of beings unconscious of a crime should ever
                    be reconciled either to the justice or beneficence of that intention with which
                    their sufferings are inflicted? Or how can others be supposed to become wise and
                    virtuous by the example of those who are neither acquainted with the origin nor
                    the tendency of their miseries, but have every reason to think themselves
                    afflicted merely for the sake of afflicting? To us it seems clear, that the
                    nature and <hi rend="italic">rationale</hi> of original sin lie inscrutably
                    veiled and hidden in the bosom of Providence; nor can we, without unpardonable
                    presumption and arrogance, form the most simple conclusion, or attempt the
                    minutest discovery, either different from or extraneous to the clear and obvious
                    sense of revelation. This sense indeed may with propriety be extracted from the
                    whole, or from one passage collated with another; but independently of it, as
                    reason has no premises, she can form no deductions. The boldness and temerity of
                    philosophy, not satisfied with contemplating pre-existence as merely relative to
                    human nature, has dared to try how far it was compatible with the three Persons
                    of the sacred Trinity. The Arians, who allowed the subordinate divinity of our
                    Saviour, believed him pre-existent to all time, and before all worlds; but the
                    Socinians, who esteemed his nature as well as his person merely human, insisted,
                    that before his incarnation he was only pre-existent in the divine idea, not in
                    nature or person. But when it is considered, that children do not begin to
                    deduce instructions from nature and experience, at a period so late as we are
                    apt to imagine; when it is admitted, that their progress, though insensible, may
                    be much more rapid than we apprehend; when the opportunities of sense, the
                    ardour of curiosity, the avidity of memory, and the activity of understanding,
                    are remarked; we need not have recourse to a pre-existent state for our account
                    of the knowledge which young minds discover. It may likewise be added, that
                    moral agents can only be improved and cultivated by moral discipline. Such
                    effects therefore of any state, whether happy or miserable, as are merely
                    mechanical, may be noxious or salutary to the patient, but can never enter into
                    any moral economy as parts of its own administration. Preexistence, therefore,
                    whether rewarded or punished, without the continued impression of personal
                    identity, affords no solution of original sin.</p>
