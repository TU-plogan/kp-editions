                    significant corrections to the OCR text, predominantly in cases of confusing "c"
                    and "e." Isolates 90 entries that were mistakenly included at the end of prior
                    entries in v1 and v2. Normalizes ordinal numbers. Separates metadata in
                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,
                    the end fragment is now joined to the start fragment, making a machine-readable
                    word.</change>

                <p><label type="entry">PLUTARCH</label>, one of the most celebrated writers of
                    antiquity, was a native of Chaeroneia, in Boeotia. The exact date of his birth
                    and death is unknown; but as he tells us that he studied philosophy under
                    Ammonius at Delphi, when Nero made a tour through Greece, and as we know this
                    circumstance to have taken place <hi rend="smallcaps">a. d.</hi> 66, we may
                    place the birth of Plutarch towards the latter years of the reign of Claudius
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">(a. d.</hi> 48—53). He was sprung from an honourable
                    family, which had often been invested with the highest offices of the
                    magistracy. He speaks of having seen his great-grandfather Nicarchus, from whom
                    he learned, as from an eyewitness, the miseries which his country had suffered
                    from the oppressions of Antony. His grandfather Lamprias was distinguished for
                    his eloquence and imagination; and his father is praised for his modesty, his
                    acquaintance with the . theology of his time, and his knowledge of the works of
                    the poets. Plutarch had two brothers, Timon and Lamprias; of the former of whom
                    he says, that he has no obligations to fortune so great as the enjoyment of his
                    brother Timon’s invariable friendship and kindness. Under Ammonius, of whom we
                    know little more than what his pupil has told us, he acquired the doctrines of
                    that humane and rational philosophy for which he was afterwards so
                    distinguished. Upon what occasion he visited Italy is uncertain, but it is
                    supposed to have been on some public business of the Chaeroneians. Whilst he
                    remained at Rome, he found his house resorted to by all the principal citizens,
                    and his lectures on philosophy attended by the most illustrious of the Romans.
                    Sos-sius Senecio, who was four times consul, once under Nerva and thrice under
                    Trajan, was his most intimate friend. To him he addresses his Lives, except that
                    of Aratus, which is inscribed to Polycrates of Sicyon, the grandson of Aratus.
                    Whether he remained in Italy till all philosophers were banished from that
                    country by a decree of Domitian, is a pointof which wehave no means of
                    determining; butwe know that he spent the greater part of his time in his native
                    city. Here he devoted himself to the discharge of such humble duties as the
                    magistrates of Chaeroneia were required to perform; and we find that he also
                    joined to his magisterial character the office of priest of Apollo. Suidas
                    states that he was preceptor to Trajan; but he was so nearly contemporary with
                    that emperor, that little credit is due to this assertion. Plutarch was married
                    to a lady of his native city, called Timoxena, and in his matrimonial connection
                    he seems to have been particularly fortunate. By her he had five children, four
                    sons, and a daughter, who died young; and on this occasion he addressed a
                    beautiful letter of consolation to his wife, which is highly honourable to both
                    parties. Two only of his sons survived, Plutarch and Lamprias, the latter of
                    whom appears to have been a philosopher; and it is to him that we are indebted
                    for a catalogue of his father’s writings. His nephew Sextus was of considerable
                    eminence, and taught the Greek language to Marcus Antoninus. We have no
                    particular account either as to the manner or the time of his death, only it is
                    evident that he lived to a good old age. The most probable conjecture <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193533155" xml:id="kp-eb0718-3155-0064"/> is that of
                    Fabricius, who says he died in the fifth year of Hadrian, at the age of
                    seventy.</p>
                <p>His works have been divided, and they admit of a pretty equal division, into
                    Lives and Morals; the former of which, in his own est <hi rend="underline"
                    >ima</hi> tion, were to be preferred, as more noble than the latter. His style
                    has been excepted to with some reason. He has also been criticised for some
                    mistakes in Roman antiquities, and for a partiality to the Greeks. On the other
                    hand, he has been justly praised for the copiousness of his fine sense and
                    learning, for his integrity, and for a certain air of goodness which appears in
                    all he wrote. His business was not to please the ear, but to instruct and charm
                    the mind; and in this none ever excelled him. Of his moral writings it is to be
                    regretted that we have no good English translation. An English version of his
                    Lives, executed with fidelity and spirit, was presented to the public by the
                    Langhorne’s in 1770. The best edition of his works is that of Reiske, in twelve
                    volumes Svo, 1774-82.</p>
