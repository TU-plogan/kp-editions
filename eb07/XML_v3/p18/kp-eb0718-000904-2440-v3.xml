                    thin plate of silver, either for use or for ornament. It is said to have been
                    invented by a spur-maker, not for show, but for real utility. Till then the more
                    elegant spurs in common use were made of solid silver, and, from the flexibility
                    of that metal, they were liable to be bent into inconvenient forms by the
                    slightest accident. To remedy this defect, a workman at Birmingham contrived to
                    make the branches of a pair of spurs hollow, and to fill that hollow with a
                    slender rod of steel or iron. Finding this a great improvement, and being
                    desirous to add cheapness to utility, he continued to make the hollow larger,
                    and of course the iron thicker and thicker, till at last he discovered the means
                    of coating an iron spur with silver in such a manner as to make it equally
                    elegant with those which were made wholly of that metal. The invention was
                    quickly applied to other purposes; and to numberless utensils which were
                    formerly made of brass or iron are now given the strength of these metals, and
                    the elegance of silver, for a small additional expense.</p><p>The silver plate is generally made to adhere to the baser metal by means of
                    solder, which is of two kinds; the soft and the hard, or the tin and silver
                    solders. The former of these consists of tin alone, the latter generally of
                    three parts of silver and one of brass. When a buckle, for instance, is to be
                    plated by means of the soft solder, the ring, before it is bent, is first
                    tinned, and then the silver-plate is <pb break="no" facs="nls:193532453" xml:id="kp-eb0718-2453-0010"/>gently hammered
                    upon it, the hammer employed being always covered with a piece of cloth. The
                    silver now forms, as it were, a mould to the ring, and whatever of it is not
                    intended to be used is cut off. This mould is fastened to the ring of the buckle
                    by two or three cramps of small iron wire; after which the buckle, with the
                    plated side undermost, is laid upon a plate of iron sufficiently hot to melt the
                    tin, but not the silver. The buckle is then covered with powdered resin, or
                    anointed with turpentine; and, lest there should be a deficiency of tin, a small
                    portion of rolled tin is likewise melted on it. The buckle is now taken off with
                    a tongs, and commonly laid on a bed of sand, where the plate and the ring,
                    whilst the solder is yet in a state of fusion, are more closely compressed by a
                    smart stroke with a block of wood. The buckle is afterwards bent and finished.
                    Sometimes the melted tin is poured into the silver mould, which has been
                    previously rubbed over with some flux. The buckle ring is then put amongst the
                    melted tin, and the plating finished. This is called by the workmen <hi rend="italic">filling up.</hi></p><p>But when the hard solder is employed, the process is in many respects different.
                    Before, the plate is fitted to the iron or other metal, it is rubbed over with a
                    solution of borax. Stripes of silver are placed along the joinings of the plate,
                    and instead of two or three cramps, as in the former case, the whole is wrapped
                    round with small wire; the solder and joinings are again rubbed with the borax,
                    and the whole is put into a charcoal fire till the solder be in fusion. When
                    taken out, the wire is instantly removed, the plate is cleaned by the
                    application of some acid, and afterwards made smooth by the strokes of a
                    hammer.</p><p>Metal plating is when a bar of silver and another of copper are taken of at least
                    one equal side. The equal sides are made smooth, and the two bars fastened
                    together by wire wrapped round them. These bars are then sweated in a charcoal
                    fire, and after sweating, they adhere as closely together as if they were
                    soldered. After this they are flattened into a plate between two rollers, when
                    the copper appears on one side and the silver on the other. This sort of plate
                    is named <hi rend="italic">plated metal.</hi></p><p>French plating is when silver-leaf is burnished on a piece of metal in a certain
                    degree of heat. When silver is dissolved in aquafortis, and precipitated upon
                    another metal, the process is called <hi rend="italic">silvering.</hi></p></div></body></text></TEI>
