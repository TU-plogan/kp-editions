                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> word <hi rend="italic">Police</hi> has two
                    meanings. According to the first, it is the science of regulating whatever
                    belongs to the internal economy of a state; according to the second, or limited
                    meaning, it is merely a system of preventive justice.</p>
                <p>The first definition may appear so extensive, as to make it possible to confound
                    the idea of the science of police with that of politics, or government, as
                    defined by Aristotle to consist of the ordering of all things in the state
                    towards the ultimate end, namely, the common happiness. But the distinction may
                    be understood, by comparing the operation of police regulations in society, to
                    that of a system of domestic order in a family. The members of a commonwealth,
                    like those of a family, must conform their conduct to certain conventional
                    rules, which the chief authority enforces amongst them, for their mutual
                    advantage, in addition to the moral duties which belong to them in common with
                    all men. A breach of an economical law of this description, is an offence
                    against police. Thus, whilst an assault, or a theft, is an offence against the
                    person, or property, of a citizen; treason, one against the sovereign power; or
                    perjury, one against the administration of justice; vagrancy, gaming, bigamy,
                    and the like, are understood to be offences against the public police, upon the
                    ground that the tendency of such acts, without reference to the question of
                    their immorality, is injurious to the economy of society.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See an enumeration of offences treated by the
                    English law as “against the public police or economy,” in Blackstone’s <hi

                    rend="italic">Summary of the Criminal Law,</hi> chap. 11.</p></note></p>
                <p>But it is the office of police, taken in a large sense, to go farther than
                    forbidding certain injurious acts. It may employ indirect means to prevent the
                    commission of crimes. It may seek to avert the will of the citizen from a breach
                    of the law, by turning his inclinations into a direction conformable to the
                    public interests. Thus, it may avoid the use of any punishment containing
                    ingredients which might make it an object of desire; it may take all possible
                    care that punishment shall be certain; it may cultivate religious sentiments in
                    thepeople; it may instruct them in their moral and social duties, and provide
                    them with the means of agreeable recreation.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    The object of such precautions is the same with that of punishment, namely, the
                    prevention of crime; inasmuch as they tend to impress the citizens with a sense
                    of right, acting educationally upon them, like the virtuous principles which a
                    good father instils into the minds of his children. Hence the science of police
                    has been described by a contemporary authority, as “the moral education of a
                    people towards self-government.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>It is pretty clear, that police, in this extended sense of internal polity,
                    comprehends the protection of society against not only physical, but also moral
                    evils. The regulation of the highways, and internal navigation; the care of the
                    public health; poor laws or corn laws, may be classed under it with no less
                    propriety than public instruction, or religious establishments. The true ground
                    on which an established church is defensible, is, its value as an instrument of
                    police in this elevated sense; and the same test is applicable to national
                    education, and other institutions, affecting the moral welfare of society.</p>
                <p>The present state of moral and political science is not such as to enable us to
                    define police with anything like precision. But if what has been said, does not
                    convey an accurate notion of that which it is, it may point more plainly at that
                    which it is not. No one, for instance, will expect to hear of police in relation
                    to the external defence, or foreign policy, of a state. Few will confound its
                    objects with those of the dispensations of justice which are directed to the
                    maintenance of private rights, or to the security of the state itself, as a
                    social existence.</p>
                <p>The second, or limited definition, of police, considers it as that branch of the
                    administration of justice, which operates directly for the prevention and
                    detection of crime. It is the judicial function to hear and determine between
                    right and wrong, and to sentence the offender to the punishment which the law
                    has awarded him. But the judge cannot be brought into action, without an
                    auxiliary power for securing the persons of offenders for justice; for checking
                    crimes in the act of commission; and for watching the observance, or breach, of
                    the laws. This is the <hi rend="italic">preventive</hi> branch of justice; and
                    the system of operations destined for the performance of these services, goes,
                    in ordinary language, under the name of police. The object of such operations is
                    of course included within those of the term police, in a larger sense, and
                    preventive justice is therefore their more appropriate name. Under a good system
                    of law, the powérs, means, and ends, of preventive justice, would be carefully
                    defined; so that they should, in no case, be confounded with those of penal or
                    executive justice, nor the same individuals be employed in the performance of
                    duties essentially different. But this important distinction has rarely been
                    attended to as it ought, and the efficiency of police establishments has been
                    thereby not unfrequently impaired. At the present time there is, we believe, no
                    instance of the police of a large city which, as a whole, can be said to be
                    merely a preventive system; but a variety of functions are associated under the
                    name of police, contributing to the preservation of the public peace, health,
                    and convenience, but the classification of which is, for the most part,
                    defective. There are, therefore, few perfect systems of police, either in the
                    wide or the limited sense which, it has been seen, properly belongs to that
                    word.</p>
                <p>Before we proceed to point out the essential requisites of a good police system,
                    it will be useful to take a review of some existing institutions of this
                    nature.</p>
                <p>From the earliest times, all nations which have established regular laws, have
                    had amongst them police regulations. They form a prominent part of the
                    institutions of the ancient Egyptians and Greeks, and also of the Mosaic law. A
                    special branch of the Roman law was applied to police. The Emperor Augustus, as
                    is well known, introduced important changes into the police of the city of Rome,
                    by withdrawing the powers previously exercised by the Praetors and Ediles, and
                    constituting a magistrate under the title of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Praefectus</hi><hi rend="italic">urbis,</hi> under whom were the <hi
                    rend="italic">magistratus</hi><hi rend="italic">minores,</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">curatores urbis,</hi> assigned for the protection of the several
                    quarters into which the city was divided. In the reigns of Constantine,
                    Theodosius, and Justinian, very severe laws were enacted against female
                    prostitution. The capitularies of Charlemagne are remarkable for the heavy
                    penalties they inflict upon the same offence, which seems also to have been a
                    favourite subject of regulation with Saint Louis, and <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193535560" xml:id="kp-eb0718-5560-0249"/>Charles VI. of France. In
                    1502, we find police regulations established at Nuremburg, relating principally
                    to the censorship of books; and there are extant,, ordinances of police of the
                    German empire, of the dates of 1548 and 1577, containing distinct ordinances for
                    the empire, the circles, the counties, and the towns. Towards the end of the
                    seventeenth century, the science of police acquired a new development, by the
                    introduction into France of the system of secret police, to which we shall
                    presently refer. There does not appear any particular advantage in detailing at
                    length the police legislation of antiquity, or of the middle ages. It will, we
                    think, be more instructive to confine our statements to modem times.</p>
                <p>The provision made for preventive justice by the old law of England, consisted in
                    the powers which it vested in justices of the peace and constables, as also in
                    individuals, when present at the commission of crime, or summoned by the hue and
                    cry. The office of constable existed in the time of the Saxons, and the statute
                    of Winchester (!3th Edward I.) expressly directed that two constables should be
                    chosen in every hundred; that suspicious night-walkers should be arrested and
                    detained by the watch; and that in walled towns the gates should be closed from
                    sun-setting to sun-rising. These are called high constables; in addition to whom
                    petty constables were instituted for every town and parish in the reign of
                    Edward III. and especially empowered by the statute 5th Edward III. cap. 44, “to
                    arrest persons suspected of manslaughter, felonies, and robberies, and to
                    deliver them to the sheriff, to be kept in prison till the coming of the
                    justices.” The hue and cry is the raising an alarm, and making continuous
                    pursuit through the country, upon the commission of a felony, and was used as
                    far back as the reign of Edward I., when it was comparatively easy by such means
                    to discover a criminal flying from the law. At the present day, when the hue and
                    cry is raised, every person, by command of the constable, is legally obliged, on
                    pain of fine and imprisonment, to join in pursuit of the felon from county to
                    county, or until they come to the sea; but it is now so rarely put in practice,
                    that it may be considered as having almost fallen into desuetude. It is further
                    an old rule of law, that every person present when a felony is committed, is
                    authorized and required to arrest the offender. In early times, it seems to have
                    been the custom for the freeholders of each county to elect “<hi rend="italic"
                    >de</hi><hi rend="italic">probioribus</hi><hi rend="italic">et</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">po-tentioribus</hi><hi rend="italic">comitatus,”</hi> to be
                    keepers of the peace; but the statute 1st Edward IIL, cap. 16, gave such
                    appointments to the crown, by whom they still continue to be made. When the
                    keepers of the peace became authorized by the statute 34th Edward III. to try
                    felonies and misdemeanours, they acquired the title of justices; and their
                    judicial functions have been so vastly extended by modern statutes, that the
                    mere conservation of the peace is now by no means the most important part of
                    their duties. Such were the ordinary courses available, under the law of
                    England, for the prevention of crime, and for bringing offenders to justice.</p>
                <p>As population and property increased, it was found that the ordinary magisterial
                    and constabulary force became more and more inadequate for the public
                    protection. It is not necessary to refer to the Newgate Calendar, or the life of
                    Jonathan Wild, to prove the total absence of any effectual security to
                    individuals, in the last century, against outrage and depredation. It is within
                    the remembrance of persons now living, that a journey could not be undertaken
                    from one part of England to another without risk of highwayrobbery. The extent
                    of crime in the metropolis at the close of the last century would be incredible,
                    if it were not recorded upon respectable authority. Colqunoun, writing in the
                    year 1800,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">Treatise on the Police of the Metropolis,</hi> by P. Colquhoun,

                    the value of the property purloined and pilfered in various ways, in and about
                    the metropolis, at two millions sterling in one year. Some of the instances
                    given would now appear very curious.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>The following is one :—“The wife of a well-known sharper,
                    lately upon the town, is said to have appeared at court, dressed in a style of
                    peculiar elegance; while the sharper himself is supposed to have gone in the
                    dress of a clergyman. According to the information of a noted receiver, they
                    pilfered to the value of L.1700 on the king’s birthday (1795), without discovery
                    or suspicion."</p></note> The same writer furnishes a statement of the number of
                    prisoners discharged from the metropolitan gaols and hulks in the eight years,
                    1792 to 1799, the total of which is 21,893, being, on an average, 2734 yearly; a
                    very considerable number in proportion to the then population. The almost
                    innumerable ramifications of crime in London, as detailed by Colquhoun, may
                    excite surprise at the little effort that was made in any quarter before he
                    wrote to repress it.</p>
                <p>The public office in Bow Street was for some time the only place in the
                    metropolis where a police magistrate sat regularly, without the jurisdiction of
                    the city of London. Seven additional police offices were established in 1792, by
                    the act 32d Geo. III. cap. 53, and the Thames police-office in 1798. Previously
                    to their establishment, the magistrates of the county of Middlesex, and city of
                    Westminster, acted as occasion required, in the same way as the magistrates
                    ordinarily act in other parts of the country.</p>
                <p>The constabulary force of the metropolis, comprising that of the cities of London
                    and Westminster, the borough of Southwark, and parts adjacent, is stated by
                    Colquhoun at 883; that consisting of the constables attached to the police
                    offices and the Thames establishment, at 157; and, adding to these 2044 beadles,
                    watchmen, and patroles, employed by the city, and by the numerous parishes and
                    trusts, the civil force of the metropolis, available for purposes of police,
                    amounted, in the aggregate, to 3084 men.</p>
                <p>The Parliamentary Finance Committee of 1798, in their Twenty-eighth Report, took
                    a general view of the Police Establishment, in reference principally to its
                    expense; but although that committee recommended several important reforms, and,
                    in the same year, the Government had under its consideration a proposition of
                    Mr. Colquhoun for the establishment of a central police board, and other
                    remedial measures, no result followed. The progress of crime and demoralization,
                    however, began gradually to attract the attention of the Legislature, and
                    Parliamentary Committees inquired into the subject of police in the years 1812,
                    1816, 1817, 1822, and 1828. At the latter date the necessity for a new system
                    had become very urgent. The metropolis was subdivided into a number of petty
                    jurisdictions, each acting independently, and frustrating the efforts of the
                    other; the local functionaries were miserably inefficient; the absence of union
                    in the constabulary power offered facilities to crime and disorder; and in the
                    event of any real or anticipated tumult, it was necessary to preserve the peace
                    of the town by a military force. In 1829, the act 10th Geo. IV. cap. 44, was
                    passed, “for improving the police in and near the metropolis ;” and pursuant to
                    that act, a central office was established in London, and two commissioners
                    appointed for the administration of a system of centralization, in lieu of the
                    local functionaries. The metropolitan police district, according to that act,
                    consists of about ninety parishes, and ultra-parochial places, in and
                    surrounding the metropolis, comprising a population at present amounting to
                    1,515,592, but exclusive of the city of London and the river Thames. The active
                    force employed under the commissioners at the close of the year 1837, was as
                    follows :—</p>
                <p>17 Superintendents at L.200 per annum each.</p>
                <p>70 Inspectors at L.l, 10s. 6d. per week each.</p>
                <p>342 Sergeants at L.l, 2s. 6d. per week each.</p>
                <p>2992 Constables at 19s∙ per week each.</p>

                    men, mounted and armed.</p>
                <p>There are at present in London nine police-offices, to each of which three
                    magistrates are attached. These are, Bow Street, Queen Square, Marlborough
                    Street, Marylebone, Hatton Garden, Worship Street, Whitechapel, Union Hall, and
                    the Thames Police. Constables are specially attached to each office, sixty-three
                    altogether, besides twenty-two surveyors, and seventy river constables,

                <p>The expenses of the metropolitan force are defrayed principally by a rate levied
                    with the poor rate, upon the inhabitants. A certain proportion, however, is paid
                    out of the consolidated fund; but the advances by the treasury are limited to
                    L.60,000 per annum. The expenses of the nine offices, including the Thames
                    service, and also the commissioners’ salaries, are wholly defrayed out of the
                    consolidated fund.</p>
                <p>The city of London is not included within the metropolitan district, but retains
                    its separate police, acting under the municipal authorities. Upwards of 1000
                    persons are employed as marshalmen, watchmen, and constables, and the total
                    annual cost is returned at L.43,862, of which L.34,924 was levied by rates upon
                    the inhabitants, and the residue paid out of the city revenue.<note

                <p>The functions of the metropolitan police force are exercised under the control
                    partly of the commissioners, and partly of the magistrates. They are distributed
                    throughout the district in seventeen divisions, distinguished by the letters A
                    to V. In each division there are one or more station houses, in which prisoners
                    are lodged in the first instance, on their being given in charge, or taken into
                    custody, until they can be brought before the magistrates at the police offices.
                    Prisoners consequently remain in the station-houses during the night, and also
                    during Sundays. When the case comes on before the magistrate, he deals with it
                    as the law requires, either by discharging the offender, committing him for
                    trial or further examination, convicting him summarily, or holding him to
                    bail.</p>
                <p>λVhen a complaint is made to a police magistrate, he issues his warrant as he
                    sees occasion, either to a constable attached to his office, or to one of the
                    metropolitan force. The commissioners of police, although as magistrates they
                    have the legal power to do so, are not in the habit of granting warrants; and
                    the policemen cannot arrest without warrant, unless a charge is made, or an
                    offence is committed in their presence. They have in fact little power beyond
                    that of an ordinary constable, except that the police acts contain more express
                    authority for the apprehension of suspected persons, than the laws which apply
                    to the kingdom in general.</p>
                <p>The means of detecting crime have been greatly augmented by the action of the
                    central police establishment, but it may be doubted whether its operation is as
                    efficient as it might be made towards the hindrance of crime, or the preventing
                    its commission. Numerous receivers of stolen goods continue to carry on their
                    business with impunity, and flashhouses still exist in the metropolis, where
                    thieves are known to congregate to concert their plans. There are no authorised
                    informers belonging to the police force.</p>
                <p>The subjoined table, compiled from official returns, will shew the extent to
                    which the central police force is brought into action in the course of the
                    year.</p>

                <p>The circumstance of more than half of the persons taken into custody, having been
                    discharged without punishment, cannot fail to be remarked as indicating
                    unnecessary detention to a serious extent. The remedy for this lies in an
                    improved system of bail and recognizances.</p>
                <p>Of the 64,416 persons apprehended in the year 1837, it appears that 5643 were
                    charged with offences against the person, 180 with violent offences against
                    property, 15,289 with larcenies and other offences against property co⅛mit- ted
                    without violence, 1727 with malicious offences against property, 884 with
                    forgery and offences against the currency, and 40,684 with offences of a
                    miscellaneous character. Of this latter class, it is worthy of remark, that
                    21,426 were charged with drunkenness, 3103 as disorderly prostitutes, and 6842
                    as reputed thieves, suspicious characters, and vagrants. It should be borne in
                    mind that these offenders are exclusive of those apprehended by the city police,
                    and the constables attached to the offices.</p>
                <p>The police magistrates are occupied not only in the disposal of the offenders
                    brought before them, but in some matters not of a criminal character, such as
                    the administration of the poor-laws, and other duties conferred by particular
                    statutes. A reference to Burn’s Justice will shew the wide range of a
                    magistrate’s duty. They have some few, but very limited, powers, in civil cases.
                    They act, in some measure, ministerially, in planning the detection of
                    offenders, and shaping the evidence towards their conviction. There are,
                    however, good reasons for desiring that the magistrates should be entirely
                    confined to their judicial functions.</p>
                <p>The law of England has never· entrusted the constabulary, nor has it armed the
                    central police, with any general power of personal <hi rend="italic"
                    >surveillance</hi> over the people. The law which is the most stringent against
                    disorderly or suspicious persons, is the vagrant act,<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>5th Geo. IV. cap. 83.</p></note> which in
                    fact authorises the magistrate to punish, without any direct proof of the
                    commission of a crime; and the metropolitan police acts<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Geo. IV. cap. 44, and 3d Will. IV. cap.
                    19.</p></note> have somewhat extended the description of persons who may be
                    apprehended and dealt with as rogues and vagabonds, according to the first
                    mentioned act. In so populous and wealthy a city as London, it is indispensable
                    that summary powers should be vested in the magistracy for the protection of the
                    public against those who live by depredation, and who have neither “a local
                    habitation nor a name,” as securities for their good behaviour. It is officially
                    recorded that in the year 1837, the number of depredators, offenders, and
                    suspected persons, within the <hi rend="italic">cognizance</hi> of the central
                    police, was 19,919, being in the ratio of 1 to each 83 of the population<pb

                    average length of the career of each offender is estimated at about four years,
                    the danger to property from the existence of such a floating mass of crime is
                    sufficiently apparent. Far from the apprehension of peril to the liberty of the
                    subject, from a further extension of the summary powers of the magistrates, the
                    better opinion seems at present to be, that they might be extended with
                    advantage even to all cases of larceny.</p>
                <p>There are in London at present about thirty common gambling-houses known to the
                    police,and the average number of persons daily resorting to each is about
                    twenty. The police has not, however, any summary control over them, but they are
                    subject to indictment by any common informer. Colquhoun reckoned forty-three
                    gambling-houses, including seven subscription-houses of the first class, and
                    supposed the yearly aggregate of money won and lost in them to be L.7,225,000.
                    There are no means of knowing what may be the amount of play in the club-houses
                    of the present day, but we entertain no doubt whatever that Colquhoun’s estimate
                    was altogether an exaggeration. The number of persons charged with gambling in
                    London in the year 1837 was 366.</p>
                <p>There exists no medical police in this country of the kind which we find
                    specially established in some parts of the continent. The exercise of the
                    medical profession is subject to conditions imposed by law. We have quarantine
                    laws, under the superintendence of the officers of the customs revenue; and the
                    laws which prohibit the sale of unwholesome food are rather enforced by the
                    officers of markets, than by any branch of the police service. A Board of Health
                    was appointed for a special purpose, during the late visitation of the cholera,
                    but there has never been any permanent establishment of this nature. The
                    inquiry, how far such an establishment would be expedient, suggests itself
                    chiefly as regards female prostitution. The existing law only subjects
                    prostitutes to punishment as in case of disorderly conduct, and houses of
                    ill-fame are only liable to indictment, not to summary visitation. The
                    consideration of protecting the public against the spread of diseases, has not
                    hitherto entered into the policy of our legislation, so as to subject
                    prostitutes to any medical visitation; nor are they restricted from walking the
                    streets, or frequenting places of public amusement. We shall presently notice
                    the very different way in which this matter is treated in France. In the mean
                    time, it is satisfactory to mention, that the extent of prostitution in London
                    is, in truth, nothing like that which the notions of some writers have formed of
                    it. Instead of there being 50,000 prostitutes in the metropolis, as estimated by
                    Colquhoun, the actual number known to the police in 1837 was as follows :—</p>
                <p>Prostitutes, well-dressed, living in brothels, 895</p>
                <p>Ditto, well-dressed, walking the streets, 1612</p>
                <p>Ditto, low, infesting low neighbourhoods,...3864</p>
                <p>Total, ....6371</p>
                <p>The number of brothels, in which prostitutes are kept, was 933, having an average
                    number of four in each; the number of houses of ill-fame to which they resort,
                    848; and that of houses in which they lodge, 1554. Such appears from the best
                    authority to be the real state of the case.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>The statistics throughout this paper are quoted on the
                    authority of official documents.</p></note></p>
                <p>A daily police report of the proceedings, and of the informations received at the
                    several police-offices, is printed for the use of the magistrates and officers;
                    and an official newspaper, called the <hi rend="italic">Hue and Cry</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">Police Gazette,</hi> is also circulated amongst the authorities,
                    throughout the kingdom.</p>
                <p>During the sessions of 1837 and 1838, a select committee of the House of Commons,
                    appointed on the motion of Mr. Hawes, inquired into the state of the metropolis
                    police, and recommended various important improvements in its management.
                    Amongst these arc the consolidation of the several constabulary forces of the
                    metropolis and the river Thames, including those of the city of London, under
                    one authority; the confinement of the magistrates to judicial duties; the
                    extension of their summary jurisdiction to all cases of larceny, and also to
                    many civil cases; the augmentation of the officer’s power to arrest; the
                    improvement of the bail system; and the better regulation of the police-offices,
                    with a view to the public accommodation. Our limits do not permit us to discuss
                    the advantages of these reforms. Suffice it to say, that they are of the utmost
                    importance to the efficiency of the police service; and that until they are
                    effected, the metropolis will not be adequately protected against crime and
                    disorder.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See the
                    valuable Report of this Committee (Session 1838); also the <hi rend="italic"

                <p>The English rural police is of two kinds; that established in the principal
                    cities and towns, and that of the rural districts properly so called. In the
                    former case, it is exercised by the municipal magistracies, and the
                    constabularies acting under them; in the latter, it is vested in the justices of
                    the peace, and constables acting under the old law to which we have
                    adverted.</p>
                <p>The cities and towns in which a police has been established upon the same system
                    as that of the metropolis, are, Liverpool, Bristol, Bath, Hull, and
                    Newcastle-upon-Tyne. Other towns have their police, more or less efficient, but
                    regulated upon plans of their own, either prescribed by the municipalities, or
                    by local Acts of Parliament.</p>
                <p>The only instance that we are aware of, in which a special rural police has been
                    established in England, is in Cheshire, by an act passed in 1829,<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Geo. IV. cap. 97.</p></note>
                    entitled “An Act to enable the magistrates of the county palatine of Chester to
                    appoint special high constables for the several hundreds or divisions, and
                    assistant petty constables for the several townships of that county.” This act
                    has provided the county with a comparatively efficient constabulary, whose
                    duties and conduct are prescribed and superintended with more accuracy and
                    vigilance than in any other part of the country.</p>
                <p>But, however efficient, within an isolated district, may be this or that police
                    establishment, it will have little effect towards the prevention or hindrance of
                    crime in the aggregate, unless a regular chain of communication be maintained
                    throughout the country; unless vigilance be made to circulate; unless, in short,
                    there be centralization. This consideration induced the Government to issue a
                    commission, dated the 20th of October 1836, the commissioners under which were
                    directed to inquire into the best means of establishing a constabulary force in
                    the English counties, with an especial view to the prevention of offences, and
                    with regard to any proceedings before trial by which the detention and
                    apprehension of offenders might be rendered more certain; also to inquire into
                    the public services which might be obtained from such a force, either in the
                    preservation of peace, and due protection of property, or enforcing the more
                    regular observance of law; and into the maimer in which such force should be
                    appointed and paid. At the time we write, the commissioners have not made their
                    report, but there is reason to believe that a very valuable one will soon be
                    produced.</p>
                <p>That it is perfectly practicable to organize a constabulary force for the whole
                    kingdom, acting under a central authority in the metropolis, and governed by a
                    gradation of superior and responsible officers, cannot be doubted. Nor is it
                    much less clear, that the public morality, and the interests of property would
                    be greatly promoted by such a measure. It especially deserves notice, that, in
                    the rural districts, the <pb break="no" facs="nls:193535599"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0718-5599-0252"/>delinquents are almost entirely of the vagrant
                    class, being either habitual depredators, or vagrants asking alms. Now, the only
                    law for the constant control of these habitual delinquents, is the vagrant act
                    before cited, which experience has shewn to be by no means sufficient. Few
                    offences are committed within the view of a constable; therefore the
                    constabulary seldom acts but upon information, and as there is no special
                    obligation upon any one to communicate information, the enforcement of the law
                    is so far dependent upon chance. Then, the ancient practice of pursuit by hue
                    and cry having fallen into disuse, the vagrant depredators referred to, go from
                    county to county, taking up their temporary abode in common lodging-houses, the
                    number of which has much increased of late years, and so pursue their career
                    with impunity. Of the habitual depredators within the cognizance of the
                    metropolitan police in 1837, 2712 were known to be vagrant; in Bristol 605 were
                    so known; in Hull 303; and in Newcastle 454. From 18,000 to 20,000 vagrants are
                    annually committed to prison throughout the country. They assume different names
                    as occasion requires, and to identify them, or ascertain their real history, is
                    usually a matter of great difficulty.</p>
                <p>One of the indirect means enumerated by Bentham for the prevention of crime, was
                    a system of proper names, by which an appellation should be assigned to each
                    individual, indicative of his family and birth-place, and distinguishing him
                    from all other persons whatsoever. Bentham also recommended, in certain cases,
                    the affixing marks on the skin, such as are imprinted by sailors on their
                    bodies, with gunpowder, at the present day. The old law of England branded all
                    laymen who had once been admitted to the benefit of clergy, by burning them with
                    a hot iron in the brawn of the left thumb, in order to distinguish their persons
                    for the future. Now, it is worthy of consideration, whether the rationale of
                    branding is not still applicable to the cases of all offenders once convicted of
                    crime? It is very desirable that all persons of suspicious character should, for
                    a limited period after their liberation, be so distinguished from others, as to
                    enable the police to have a knowledge of their movements. It is also desirable,
                    for their own sake, as well as that of the public, that such individuals should,
                    as far as possible, be kept away from immediate incentives to crime. To whatever
                    perfection prison-discipline may eventually be brought, it is vain to expect
                    that its reformatory influence can invariably be such as to subdue the frailty
                    of human nature, and the seductions of present opportunities. The law of France
                    has, therefore, as we shall presently show, placed the criminal, for a limited
                    period after his discharge, under <hi rend="italic">a</hi> certain <hi
                    rend="italic">surveillance</hi> of the <hi rend="italic">Haute police,</hi> as a
                    part of his punishment. The expediency of introducing such a system into the
                    English law to any, and to what extent, is a point deserving of serious
                    reflection.</p>
                <p>Such a proposal must of course be understood as applicable only to persons
                    actually convicted of offences. Any thing resembling a passport system for the
                    whole population, innocent as well as guilty, would not only be incompatible
                    with free institutions, but invincibly repugnant to the spirit and feelings of
                    the British people. The question therefore resolves itself into one of
                    punishment, the problem being to find that punishment, which having regard to
                    the habits of the criminal, shall contain within it the maximum of prevention,
                    combining the direct with the indirect method of hindering crime. Now, assuming,
                    as the fact is, that imprisonment, according to the present system of secondary
                    punishments, has not the qualities required, but is often neither deterring, nor
                    reformatory, might not policesupervision be substituted, in some cases
                    partially, in others entirely, for such imprisonment? Would not such police
                    supervision be a peculiarly appropriate punishment for vagrants and other petty
                    offenders, the terms of whose imprisonment are very short? and might it not be
                    advantageous, even in the cases of graver offenders, to permit the commutation,
                    under certain regulations, of a portion of the imprisonment, into
                    police-supervision? We think that the principle of such alterations might be
                    demonstrated to be beneficial, but then it would remain to be considered of what
                    the proposed supervision ought to consist.</p>
                <p>The liberated convict, who might be thus placed under police control, might
                    properly be required to inform the police from time to time of his place of
                    residence; to present himself to an officer periodically; to avoid all
                    disorderly or tumultuous assemblies, and all places of public resort of a
                    vicious character, to be specified to him by the police; not to enter any towns
                    or districts, specially prohibited by the police, such as in many cases the
                    metropolis, or other populous towns, or the localities of large fairs, or races,
                    would be; and, above all, not to associate with other liberated convicts. Any
                    breach of these conditions should subject the offender to summary
                    imprisonment.</p>
                <p>Such regulations might be objected to upon the one hand as too irksome, and, on
                    the other, as not sufficiently stringent. It might be suggested to add to their
                    severity, by prescribing absolutely the place of residence of the delinquent, by
                    prohibiting him from all places whatever of public amusement, and the like.
                    Care, however, must be taken not to draw the restraining cord so tight as to
                    debar the convict from that which is harmless in itself, and may by possibility
                    have a beneficial influence upon his character. But we acknowledge the
                    difficulty of fixing the limits of restriction, a difficulty which occurs in
                    every branch of police, and, until our knowledge of the science shall be
                    advanced by experience, will continue to meet us at every step in
                    legislation.</p>
                <p>Whilst the formation of a general rural police in England is under consideration,
                    it will answer little purpose to describe the nature of the constabulary, which
                    now serves as a substitute for it. Its inefficiency is notorious. The fatal riot
                    which took place at Canterbury<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>We refer to the proceedings of Courtenay, otherwise Thom, in
                    May 183θ.</p></note> is a flagrant instance of the mischiefs which a single
                    individual may bring upon society, when society has not taken measures of
                    ordinary prudence for its own protection.</p>
                <p>The constabulary of Scotland is under the control of the magistrates of the
                    municipalities and counties, in the same way as in those parts of England where
                    the principle of the central police has not been introduced. It is consequently
                    wanting in almost all the requisites of an efficient system.</p>
                <p>A regular police force was first established throughout Ireland under an act
                    passed in 1814,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Geo.
                    III. c. 131.</p></note> “to provide for the better regulation of the laws in
                    Ireland, by appointing superintending magistrates and additional constables in
                    certain cases.” Several other acts followed, which were consolidated by the act
                    of 1836,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Will. 1V∙ c.
                    13.</p></note> and by this latter the constabulary is at present regulated. The
                    lord-lieutenant appoints stipendiary magistrates and constables in the several
                    towns, counties, and baronies in the proportions prescribed by the act, with an
                    inspector-general and sub-inspectors for their superintendence. The following
                    qualification for the constables is illustrative of the state of society in
                    Ireland. They are required to be “of a sound constitution, able-bodied, and
                    under the age of forty years, able to read and write, of a good character for
                    honesty, fidelity, and activity, not a gamekeeper, wood-ranger, <hi
                    rend="italic">tithe-proctor, viewer of tithes, bailiff, or parish clerk,</hi> or

                <p>It will be observed that the above force contains a variety of gradations of
                    officers; and this is a principle of great importance in the organization of
                    police establishments. It both regulates responsibility, and holds out the
                    prospect of promotion as the reward of merit.</p>
                <p>The lord-lieutenant is empowered to establish an additional special police force
                    in any county or district declared to be in a state of disturbance. The peculiar
                    condition of Ireland has rendered this provision requisite; but it is well known
                    that it has not hitherto superseded the necessity of the large military force
                    which, as an instrument of mere police, continues to be stationed in that
                    country.</p>
                <p>The City of Dublin has a special police force, with an office and two
                    magistrates, acting for that metropolis and a certain surrounding district. Its
                    powers and duties are analogous to those of the London central police; and it
                    acts under the immediate authority of the chief secretary to the
                    Lord-Lieutenant. It was established by act of Parliament in the year 1836.<note

                <p>There are, in various parts of the United Kingdom, officers possessing limited

                <p>The nation, in whose history the operations of the police have been the most
                    conspicuous, is modern France. A knowledge of the extent and effects of the

                    understanding ofFrench history, and there are ample materials for an elaborate

                <p>From the commencement of the feudal <hi rend="italic">regime,</hi> the provost of
                    Paris was the highest municipal authority. He not only carried the sword at the
                    head of a military force, but presided in the robe of a judge at the Châtelet,
                    that ancient and venerable building to which the administration of justice was
                    so long wholly confined. One of the ten chambers, or courts, of the Châtelet,
                    was that of police, to which reports were made of all infractions of the police
                    regulations of the city. The provost had under him two officers of the second
                    rank, called the <hi rend="italic">lieutenant-civil,</hi> and the <hi
                    rend="italic">lieutenant-criminel,</hi> besides the judicial and ministerial
                    staff* of the Châtelet. There was also an independent police authority, called
                    the <hi rend="italic">bureau</hi><hi rend="italic">de ville,</hi> which took
                    cognizance of all that related to the water, the quays, the ramparts, and the
                    public festivals of Paris, and whose principal officer was styled the provost of
                    merchants. For along period, the parliamentof Paris moderated these conflicting
                    jurisdictions, and in 1667, their recommendations gave rise to the edict made by
                    Louis XIV. in that year, whereby the functions of police were withdrawn from the
                    civil and criminal lieutenants, and conferred on a new magistrate, who, under
                    the name of <hi rend="italic">lieutenant de police,</hi> became the
                    representative of that jurisdiction which had previously been exercised by the
                    authorities of the Châtelet. The <hi rend="italic">bureau</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >de ville,</hi> however, continued its functions as before. In 1674, the title
                    of the new magistrate was declared by the king to be that of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lieutenant-General de Police,</hi> which continued to the Revolution.</p>
                <p>The first of these officers was De la Reynie, famous for being charged with the
                    execution of the edict which revoked that of Nantes in 1685. To him succeeded
                    the Marquis D’Argenson in 1697, the creator of the system of secret police,
                    which has ever since been more or less acted upon in France. D’Argenson employed
                    <hi rend="italic">espionage</hi> largely. He is described by Fontenelle, as
                    having unparalleled powers of divination, and was undoubtedly a man of unusual
                    sagacity. He had the merit of refusing to execute in Paris, the measures of
                    persecution against the Protestants, which were being carried on in the
                    provinces. The succeeding lieutenants-general were, Machault d’Arnouville
                    (1718), Count d’Argenson (1720), Taschereau de Baudry (1720), Ravot d’Ombreval
                    (1724), René Hérault (1725), De Manille (1739), Berryer (1747), Bertin (1754),
                    De Sartine (1759). The activity of the last mentioned officer was very
                    remarkable. He chose his inferior agents with judgment, and some curious proofs
                    are on record, how accurately he knew all that was passing in Paris.<note

                    reports of a licentious character, describing the most scandalous indecencies
                    committed in the capital, and a collection of them was found in the Bastille at
                    the capture of that fortress-prison, in July 1789∙ The secret police was brought
                    to great perfection by De Sartine, and he had his emissaries in every European
                    state. He seems to have been both feared and hated by the people. The French
                    police about this time excited the attention of other governments; and both the
                    Empress Catherine II. of Russia, and Maria Theresa of Austria, having applied to
                    the French government for information on the subject, De Sartine made for their
                    use a collection of the ordinances and regulations then subsisting, which is
                    still extant. An unfortunate event is recorded to have happened during De
                    Sartine’s administration, which is illustrative of the evils of conflicting
                    jurisdictions in matters of police. A fete, with fire-works and illuminations,
                    was held in the Place Louis XV. on 30th ofMay 1770, in celebration of the
                    marriage of the Dauphin with Marie Antoinette. The responsibility of the
                    arrangements was divided between De Sartine and the provost of Merchants, and
                    the consequence was, that a scene of confusion ensued, in which 132 persons were
                    killed, and as many wounded. The parliament reprimanded both functionaries, and
                    additional powers were soon afterwards conferrred on the lieutenant-general. To
                    De Sartine, succeeded Le Noir (1774), D’ Albert (1775), Le Noir, (second
                    administration 1776), and De Crosne (1785), who closed with the Revolution the
                    list of lieutenants of police. Their office, and that of the provost of
                    Merchants, merged in the <hi rend="italic">comite permanent,</hi> who
                    re-organized the municipality of Paris, and laid the foundation of the existing

                    the revolutionary period. The secret or <hi rend="italic">haute police,</hi> was
                    acted on, as is well known, by the General Directory, and afterwards, with
                    terrible effect, under the Emperor Napoleon. The unfortunate Due d’Enghien was
                    one of its victims. The life of the celebrated Fouche, is full of interest and
                    instruction under this head. Nottheleast remarkable circumstance in Fouche’s
                    career; is the fact of Napoleon having been in the habit of employing several
                    branches of <hi rend="italic">contre-police,</hi> to watch the proceedings of
                    his own police-minister.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    considered by Napoleon as a sort of rival of the Imperial power.</p>
                <p>The law of France declares the police to be instituted “to maintain order and

                    public order everywhere, and in every part of the general administration. Its
                    tendency is to the prevention of crime, and it causes to be executed all public
                    laws, ordinances and regulations. It is exercised throughout France by the
                    minister of the interior, in cases of general measures. In the departments, and
                    in the communes, it is under the direction of the <hi rend="italic"

                    are not contrary to the existing law, and make such orders, in respect of local
                    police, as circumstances may require, any infraction of which is punishable
                    according to the penal code.</p>

                    vagrancy, prisons and public institutions, the press, religious worship,
                    seditious language, public provocation to crimes, defamation of authorities,

                <p>A special police service is established in the French ports, under the name of
                    <hi rend="italic">police maritime.</hi> All offences com mitted in ports or
                    naval arsenals, whether committed by persons in the naval service or otherwise,
                    are cognizable by the maritime tribunals established for the purpose. The crews
                    of all ships of war in port, are amenable to these tribunals for all offences
                    against naval discipline. Offences against maritime police are described to be;
                    first, all such as are committed against public order, and the service of the
                    arsenals, or in the contravention of the special rules made for the port; and,
                    second, simple thefts below the value of six francs, committed in the arsenals.
                    The penalties which the tribunals of police are empowered to inflict, are,
                    imprisonment not exceeding three months, compensation under 100 francs, loss of
                    wages, and expulsion from the service of the arsenal.<note anchored="true"

                    reparer, féconder, voilà sa tache.” He watches especially over the property of
                    the state, and the public security; the roads, rivers, and other objects of
                    common use; and is the agent of all the operations of government in his

                    aid of the officers of the judicial police, for all purposes relating to the
                    prevention of crime. The rural police punishes thefts or injuries to natural
                    productions, regulates gleaning, the fixing of boundaries between lands, the
                    interment of dead animals, and a variety of matters affecting the cultivation of
                    land, and likely to give rise to disputes amongst a population of small
                    proprietors. Offenders against rural police are punishable by imprisonment, and
                    by the enforcement of compensation, as amends for injuries done.</p>
                <p>The principle of centralization, it will be perceived, exists in the rural police
                    of France to a considerable degree. The mayors and local magistrates, being
                    under the immediate supervision of the prefects, who are controlled directly by
                    the Minister of the Interior, there are the means of obtaining a certain unity
                    of action in its proceedings. But the chain of communication throughout France,
                    for purposes of police, would probably be improved if the machinery were less
                    complicated, and the number of subordinate functionaries were smaller.
                    Complaints are frequent, in cases where local improvements or changes are
                    required, or where individuals have to petition for the redress of a grievance,
                    or for permission from Government to do some act, of the great number of hands
                    through which such applications must pass, in order to their being consulted,
                    before the requisite authority can be obtained. The public thus suffers
                    inconvenience and delay, from the want of simplicity in the arrangement of the
                    system. It is not in the administration of rural police, properly so called,
                    that the French system suggests much worthy of consideration, but rather in
                    respect of the Haute Police, whereby convicted offenders are brought immediately
                    under official surveillance in all parts of the country. In Paris, the “préfet
                    de police” is charged with the whole administration of his department.<note

                    <hi rend="subscript"> φ</hi> 8, art 16.</p></note> As regards the municipality,
                    he exercises all the functions of the mayors in the communes, but is subject to
                    no other control than that of the Minister of the Interior. The expenses of the
                    prefecture are charged upon the city of Paris, but its jurisdiction extends
                    throughout the Department of the Seine. The prefect is empowered to <pb

                    regulations as he deems expedient, consistently with the existing laws. A
                    summary of his functions will perhaps, be the best mode of conveying a notion of
                    the extent of police interference in the French metropolis.</p>
                <p>In respect of the general police, it is at the prefecture that passports are
                    issued to travellers, and are <hi rend="italic">visa'd</hi> on their arrival at
                    Paris. Travellers remaining in Paris more than three days require permission for
                    that purpose. All public establishments for the relief of the poor, or
                    charitable purposes, are subject to police inspection. The prefecture may arrest
                    all vagrants and mendicants. It superintends the police arrangements of the
                    metropolitan prisons, and appoints certain of their officers. It carries into
                    effect the regulations in force relating to hotels, lodging-houses,
                    gaming-houses, and brothels. It prevents tumultuous assemblies, and coalitions
                    of workmen. It puts in force the laws affecting the press, and restraining
                    indecency and obscenity; superintends the construction of theatres, and keeps
                    order within them; attends places of worship to prevent disorders there; takes
                    cognisance of the distribution of gunpowder, and the use of arms; arrests
                    deserters, and makes the arrangements at public <hi rend="italic"

                    construction of scaffoldings, and the demolition of ruinous buildings; are
                    committed wholly to the prefecture of police. Thus the police causes the streets
                    and gutters to be cleaned; seizes dangerous animals; regulates the speed of
                    carriages; and prevents their stopping the way. It preserves health, as far as
                    possible, by removing all filthy or noxious accumulations; takes measures to
                    prevent fire; and secures the requisite supply of water to the city. It verifies
                    weights and measures; enforces the regulations of the markets, baths, hackney
                    coaches, pawnbrokers, and the numerous other places and things in Paris which
                    are subject to special rules; guards from injury the public buildings,
                    monuments, fountains, &amp;c., and requires their repair, when needful, by the
                    proper authorities. In short, there is scarcely any part of the <hi
                    rend="italic">materiel</hi> of society, which isnot subjected to the supervision
                    of the prefecture of police.</p>
                <p>The establishment of the prefect consists of a numerous body of <hi rend="italic"
                    >commissaires,</hi> inspectors, and peace-officers, in due gradation; and the
                    gendarmerie are at his absolute disposal, who answer the best to the description
                    of the constables of the London central police. It will be observed that the
                    functions of the prefect of Paris and his officers are principally
                    administrative; but they also act judicially, as the French law terms it, to a
                    certain extent, in securing and collecting evidence against such offenders as
                    are amenable to the jurisdiction of the tribunals of correctional police.</p>
                <p>The French executive government has long exercised, and still seems to possess
                    the right of exercising what is called the <hi rend="italic">haute police
                    administrative,</hi> in all cases where an individual has done an act considered
                    by the executive as dangerous to the public safety, although not contrary to the
                    existing law. This is the undefined power that has instituted the odious system
                    of secret police, and has been made the instrument of so much tyranny and
                    injustice. It is, in truth, no part of the established police system, but ra-.-
                    ther an arbitrary power of <hi rend="italic">ex post facto</hi> legislation
                    committed to the Government, for supposed cases of danger which the law may not
                    have foreseen. The “haute police administrative” is usually exercised by the
                    Minister of the Interior, through the préfet de police, and occasionally by the
                    Council of State.</p>
                <p>The law has, however, clearly defined that department of the Haute Police, which
                    takes under its control offenders ' discharged from prison, and watches over
                    their conduct for a specified time. This constitutes a part of the punishment to
                    which certain offenders may be sentenced, pursuant to the penal code.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Code Penal, art.
                    11.</p></note> It extends to both the higher and lower classes of delinquents.
                    The effect of it is to give to the Government the right to determine certain
                    places in which the offender is forbidden to appear after his discharge from
                    prison. He is, besides, required to declare, before he is set at liberty, in
                    what place he intends to reside; and thereupon he receives an order regulating
                    his route to such place. On his arrival he must present himself within
                    twenty-four hours, before the mayor of the commune, and cannot change his
                    residence without informing the mayor three days beforehand, of the place to
                    which he desires to remove, and receiving from him a new order prescribing his
                    route thither. In case of breach of these regulations, the offender is liable to
                    imprisonment not exceeding five years. The terms of surveillance vary according
                    to the crime; but vagrants and mendicants are specially subjected to a
                    surveillance of not less than five, nor more than ten years.</p>
                <p>The provisions of the penal code of France have lately been modified, by
                    dispensing with those enactments which required prisoners, on their discharge,
                    to find security for their good behaviour, and in default assigned them a fixed
                    place of residence. It was found, in practice, that very few indeed were able to
                    find the security, and the restriction of the convict to a particular locality
                    rendered him so notorious as to make it impracticable for him to obtain a
                    livelihood. Some were actually reduced to such destitution as to be under the
                    necessity of begging a temporary admission into prison. We have seen that, at
                    present, the government only reserves the right of prohibiting certain places;
                    and the list of such places comprises, Paris and its suburbs, Lyons, Marseilles,
                    Bordeaux, Lisle, Strasbourg, Nantes, Brest, Toulon, Rochfort, LOricnt, and
                    Cherbourg. Even to these places the convict is allowed access for any special
                    reasons approved by the police. The number of discharged convicts thus under the
                    surveillance of the Haute Police throughout France, was in 1833, about
                    40,000.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                <p>It has has been already suggested, whether a system of police-supervision might
                    not be introduced into the English criminal law with good effect, and, in
                    particular, as a valuable instrument of rural police. The working of the French
                    Haute Police would afford, without doubt, some useful lessons towards fixing the
                    proper limit of restriction. It demonstrates, especially, the wisdom of
                    interfering as little as possible with the market for the labour of the
                    discharged convict; and this is of the more importance in England in proportion
                    to the greater density of population. In the United States, where the demand for
                    labour is boundless, the emancipated convict transports himself to a distance
                    from the seat of his crime, and obtains immediate employment without a stigma on
                    his character. But in England and France the difficulty of earning a livelihood
                    is comparatively so great, that caution is requisite, lest the tendency of any
                    system of police surveillance to be established, should be to abridge the means
                    of subsistence of the criminal population. The difficulty, however, is by no
                    means one against which it seems impracticable to guard successfully.</p>
                <p>The French medical police consists of the restrictions imposed by law upon the
                    exercise of the medical profession, and the vending of secret remedies, which
                    are liable to examination before they can be sold. The subject of prostitution
                    belongs also principally to this head.</p>
                <p>The law of France visits with punishment “every person<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193535651" xml:id="kp-eb0718-5651-0256"/> who shall have committed a
                    public outrage on modesty.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Code Pénal, art. 330.</p></note> But the law being silent in all such cases
                    of prostitution as do not thus constitute a <hi rend="italic">public</hi>
                    violation of decency, the administration is placed in the delicate position of
                    having to determine what may amount to such a violation. The police, therefore,
                    whilst it prohibits the open scandal of prostitution; not allowing immodest
                    women to appear in the street, or in public places, or any indecency to be
                    openly committed; acts upon the principle oftolerat-ing houses of debauchery,
                    and preventing by its <hi rend="italic">surveillance,</hi> as much as possible
                    of the injury arising to the public from such establishments. These houses are
                    therefore licensed, and the number of them in Paris is about 220. Every female
                    living in habitual prostitution is required to be registered by the police. Such
                    as reside at their own houses are obliged to present themselves regularly, at
                    stated periods, at the public dispensary for medical examination; and those
                    inhabiting the <hi rend="italic">maisons de tolerance,</hi> arc also regularly
                    visited by the medical authorities. Every female carries with her a ticket, upon
                    which the medical inspections are noted from time to time. All females known to
                    the police as prostitutes, but unregistered <hi rend="italic">(insoumises),</hi>
                    are liable to arrest, and arc brought to the dispensary for examination.</p>
                <p>The number of <hi rend="italic">registered</hi> prostitutes in Paris appears to
                    have gradually increased, from a monthly average of 1293, in the year 1812, to
                    an average of 2902 in the year 1822, and of 3558 in 1832.<note anchored="true"

                    not of course follow, that the actual number of prostitutes has increased
                    commensurately with the numbers registered; on the contrary, there is reason to
                    believe it has diminished. But to determine this point accurately, we should
                    have before us the comparative numbers, both registered and unregistered, for a
                    series of years back; which, it would seem, there are no means of
                    ascertaining.</p>
                <p>There can be no doubt that the effect of these regulations has operated very
                    beneficially upon the health of the registered prostitutes. It appears that the
                    monthly average of disease amongst the registered women, wherever resident, upon
                    a series of years, from 1812 to 1832, has varied from one in seventeen to one in

                    existence of disease in a great degree to the class of prostitutes who receive
                    their visitors privately, without any official cognizance. There are no means of
                    knowing the actual extent of licentiousness amongst the female population of
                    Paris; but the police is, of course, not responsible for the disease resulting
                    from it; and although it might be objected that the removal of disease, as a
                    result of prostitution, is a sort of encouragement to immorality, still it must
                    be remembered, that prostitution is, in large towns, an inevitable evil; that it
                    is, to a large class of persons, an industry, and a resource against want; and
                    that, it being wholly out of the power of police regulations to prevent it, the
                    more it can be divested of its power of injuring society physically and morally,
                    the lighter will be the evil of its existence.</p>
                <p>In Belgium there is no centralized police, but it is subject to the local
                    authorities. A recent law has placed discharged convicts under the temporary
                    supervision of the police, in the same way as in France.<note anchored="true"

                <p>The police of Prussia is also a matter belonging to separate jurisdictions
                    throughout the kingdom. The <hi rend="italic">landraths</hi> in the rural
                    districts exercise powers resembling those of our justices of the peace. In the

                    ofbuild-ings, sewers, and supplies of water and of food are placed.<note

                    of medical practitioners; the insurance offices; and the fire-engines. It
                    exercises the usual functions for the prevention of crimes, and keepsa certain
                    degreeof surveillance over vagrants and mendicants. Brothels are subject to
                    visitation, and prostitutes to medical examination. There is no secret system of
                    police in Prussia, analogous to that of France which we have described; nor does
                    it, we believe, now exist, in any part of Germany.</p>
                <p>The length at which we have described the police institutions of England and
                    France, will render the less necessary a particular reference to those of the
                    other European states, because little is to be learned from them; and in all
                    countries, the institutions of which are marrear of civilization, the
                    distinction between police, and other branches ofadminis-tration, is marked less
                    and less strongly, until we descend to the point of barbarism, at which there is
                    a confusion of all the functions of government, internal and external, civil and
                    military, legislative, judicial, and ministerial, in one absolute sway; with
                    comparatively inadequate security against foreign aggression, and none whatever
                    for domestic peace. A good police system is, on the contrary, a distinguishing
                    mark of the supremacy of organized law in the country where it is in force.</p>
                <p>Having thus endeavoured to present such a sketch of existing institutions as our
                    space will admit, it only remains to point out what we consider as the
                    indispensable requisites of a good police system. These are,—</p>
                <p>1st, Centralization, under one superintending authority, which may keep up a
                    regular and certain channel of communication, throughout every part of the
                    country, may secure uniformity of administration, and enforce vigilance and
                    activity in the officers employed.</p>
                <p>2d, The powers and duties of the police force should be so correctly defined, as
                    to leave no room for doubt, when action is required. The whole charge, both of
                    preventing the perpetration of crime, and securing offenders for justice, should
                    be committed to it, with such miscellaneous functions as the legislature may
                    properly entrust to it in addition. No person ought ever to act both
                    ministerially in aid of police, and also judicially as a magistrate.</p>
                <p>3d, The utmost care and caution are needful in fixing the extent of police
                    interference, so that the amount of public advantage derivable from it, shall
                    exceed that of the inconvenience sustained. This task is a delicate and
                    difficult one; for police interference has, in some instances, been so wrongly
                    applied as to defeat its own end.</p>
                <p>4th, A good system of secondary punishments is essential to the efficiency of a
                    police establishment. If the tendency of imprisonment is such as to excite to
                    crime, it counteracts the most important object of police, namely, its
                    prevention.</p>
                <p>Other matters will probably have suggested themselves to the reader; but our
                    limits do not permit us to discuss them at length. The requisites above stated
                    may be considered as cardinal points, which cannot be disregarded without
                    impairing the efficiency of any system of police to which they are wanting. (u.
