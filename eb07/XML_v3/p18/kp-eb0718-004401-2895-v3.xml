                    mathematician and philosopher of great eminence and celebrity; and so peculiarly
                    a benefactor to this publication, as would have made it fit that some memorial
                    of him should be preserved in these pages, even if it could have been surmised
                    that it might not have been found in any other place. There are few names,
                    however, in the recent history of British science that arc more extensively or
                    advantageously known, or of which the few particulars that remain to be recorded
                    will be more generally interesting. His life, like most others that have been
                    dedicated to the silent pursuits of learning and science, does not abound in
                    incidents or adventures; but it is full of honour, both for the individual and
                    the studies to which he was devoted, and may be read with more profit than many
                    more ambitious histories.</p>
                <p>He was the eldest son of the Reverend James Playfair, minister of Benvie, in
                    Forfarshire; in which place he was born on the 10th of March 1748. He resided at
                    home, under the domestic tuition of his father, until the age of fourteen, when
                    he entered at the University of St Andrews; and was almost immediately
                    distinguished, not merely for his singular proficiency in mathematical learning,
                    but for the extent of his general knowledge, the clearness of his judgment, and
                    the dignity and propriety of his conduct. A remarkable testimony to this effect
                    has been made public in an early letter of Principal George Hill, who was at
                    this time one of his fellow-students, and was himself so remarkable for early
                    talent, that we find it recorded of him, that he had privately composed an
                    excellent sermon in the tenth year of his age. A youth of this description
                    cannot be supposed to have been very indulgent in his estimate of the merits of
                    his competitors; and it could therefore have been no ordinary measure of ability
                    that called forth the following ingenuous avowal, in a confidential letter to
                    his mother: “Playfair has very great merit, and more knowledge and a better
                    judgment than any of his class-fellows. I make <hi rend="italic">no</hi>
                    exceptions; my parts might be more showy, and the kind <hi rend="italic">of</hi>
                    reading to which my inclination led me was calculated to enable me to make a
                    better figure at St Andrews; but in judgment and understanding I was greatly
                    inferior to him.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Dr
                    Cook’s Life of Principal HilL</p></note> It isscarcely a stronger, though
                    undoubtedly a very different proof of his rare attainments, that when the
                    professor of natural philosophy, Wilkie, the once celebrated author of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Epigoniad,</hi> was prevented by indisposition from delivering the
                    regular lectures, he used generally to delegate the task of instruction to his
                    youthful pupil. Wilkie, besides being a scholar and philosopher of no mean note,
                    was a man of primitive benevolence and integrity, and of great vivacity in
                    conversation; and the friendship which, in spite of the disparity of their
                    years, was speedily formed between him and young Playfair, speaks as much for
                    the social and moral character of the latter, as his substitution of him in the
                    class-room does for his early proficiency in science. On this last subject we
                    shall mention but one fact more. In 1766, when only eighteen years of age, he
                    offered himself, with the approbation of his instructors at St Andrews, as
                    candidate for the professorship of mathematics in Mareschal College, Aberdeen,
                    and sustained, with the most distinguished credit, an examination or comparative
                    trial, which lasted eleven days, and embraced nearly the whole range of the
                    exact sciences. Out of the six competitors who entered the lists against him,
                    two only were judged to have excelled him, the Reverend Dr Trail, who was
                    appointed to the office, and Dr Hamilton, who afterwards succeeded to and long
                    filled it with much reputation.</p>
                <p>„ In 1769, he removed to Edinburgh, where his merit and modesty very soon
                    introduced him to the friendship of Dr Robertson, Adam Smith, Dr Matthew
                    Stewart, Dr Black, and Dr Hutton; with all of whom he continued on terms of the
                    utmost cordiality during the whole period of their lives. In 1772, he was a
                    candidate for the professorship of natural philosophy at St Andrews, vacant by
                    the death of his friend Dr Wilkie. There was no comparative trial on this
                    occasion; and he was again unsuccessful, under circumstances which have led one
                    of the most dutiful sons of that university (Dr Cook, in his Life of Principal
                    HilD to remark, “how much it suffered in thus losing a man by whose talents its
                    reputation would have been so highly promoted.” In the course of the same year,
                    the death of his father suddenly devolved upon him the burden of supporting the
                    family, and admonished him no longer to delay the final election of a
                    profession. He had been educated with a view to the church, and was every way
                    qualified to accept a living on the establishment; but his decided predilection
                    for science had hitherto made him hesitate about engaging in a vocation, the
                    duties of which, he felt, if conscientiously discharged, would necessarily
                    interfere, to a great extent, with the studies he was loth to abandon. In this
                    emergency, however, he thought himself no longer entitled to indulge in those
                    predilections, and accordingly made application to Lord Gray, the patron, for a
                    presentation to the livings <hi rend="italic">of</hi> Liff and Benvie, which had
                    been filled by his father. His lordship was too well aware of his merits to
                    hesitate about conferring so great a benefit on the parishioners; and
                    immediately issued a presentation in his favour, although, from some challenge
                    of his right to the patronage, induction was not obtained until late in the year
                    1773.</p>
                <p>From this period until 1782 Mr Playfair was constantly resident at Liff, and
                    occupied almost exclusively with the pastoral duties of his office. In this
                    retreat his leisure hours were dedicated to the education of his younger
                    brothers, and to a very close and intimate correspondence with Mr Robertson
                    (afterwards Lord Robertson), the son of the illustrious historian, to whom he
                    seems to have confined the remarks that occurred to him upon the different
                    authors he perused, and the subjects of speculation which they suggested. We
                    cannot help hoping, that some selection from this correspondence may one day be
                    given to the public. In the year 1779, he contributed to the Transactions of the
                    Royal Society of London a paper on the Arithmetic of Impossible Quantities,
                    which exhibits, within a very small compass, a striking example of the rare and
                    admirable talent of detaching the sound spirit of science from what may be
                    termed its mysticism, and circumscribing, by the most precise and luminous
                    boundaries, the vague and unlimited inquiries into which many mathematicians had
                    been seduced by the nature of the instruments they employed.</p>
                <p>In the year 1782 he was induced, by very advantageous offers, to resign his
                    charge, and to superintend the education of Mr Ferguson of Raith, and his
                    brother Sir Ronald; an arrangement which restored him, in a great measure, to
                    the literary and scientific society of Edinburgh, and enabled him to gratify
                    himself by a personal introduction to several of the most eminent cultivators of
                    science in London. He had repeatedly visited Dr Maskelyne, astronomer royal,
                    whilst that ingenious mathematician was busied, in 1774, in making a series of
                    observations in Perthshire, on the attraction of mountains; and,
                    whilstsharingthe shelter of his tent on the side of Schehallien, contracted with
                    him a cordial friendship, which continued unbroken for the remainder of their
                    lives. Under these honourable auspices he made his first appearance in London in
                    1782, and was speedily introduced to all those in whom he was likely to take
                    most interest. He seems to have kept a pretty full and correct journal of all
                    that he observed during this journey to the metropolis; and a portion of it, <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193532908" xml:id="kp-eb0718-2908-0045"/> which is prefixed
                    to the late collection of his works, is, in our judgment, one of the most
                    interesting parts of that publication. It is not only written with great
                    elegance •and accuracy, but affords, in the free, candid, and pointed
                    observations which it contains on the different individuals with whom he comes
                    in contact, a very remarkable proof of his quick and sagacious perception of
                    character, and his power of selecting and turning to account, even in the fever
                    and distraction of a first visit to such a scene, all that was really worthy of
                    careful observation or permanent remembrance.</p>
                <p>In 1785 he was received into the University of Edinburgh, in consequence of an
                    arrangement between his two illustrious associates, Dr Adam Ferguson and Mr
                    Dugald Stewart. Mr Stewart exchanged the chair of mathematics, in which he had
                    succeeded to his father, for that of moral philosophy, which had been long
                    filled by Dr Ferguson; who, finding that the delicate state of his health would
                    prevent him from discharging the active duties of the mathematical professor,
                    immediately devolved them upon Mr Playfair, for whom he procured the appointment
                    of joint professor in that department.</p>
                <p>In 1788 he published, in the Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, a
                    Biographical Account of Dr Matthew Stewart, which is remarkable, not only for
                    the ease and purity of the style, but also as containing a singularly clear and
                    interesting account of the labours of Dr Simson in the restoration of the
                    ancient geometry, and of the success both of him and Dr Stewart in adapting the
                    elegant simplicity of the Greek methods of investigation to problems which had
                    previously been regarded as insoluble except by the aid of the modern analysis.
                    He also published, in the same year, a paper on the Causes which affect the
                    Accuracy of Barometrical Measurements, which is written with all the
                    perspicuity, caution, and sagacity that constitute the great excellence and the
                    great difficulty of such disquisitions, where scientific principles are employed
                    to give precision to physical observations.</p>
                <p>In 1790 he published in the same Transactions a paper of still greater interest
                    and delicacy, on the Astronomy of the Brahmins; a subject which had been
                    recently recommended to the notice of the European scientific world by the
                    curious and learned observations of Μ. Bailly, in his General History of
                    Astronomy, but had never met with so minute and scrupulous an investigation as
                    it now received at the hands of Mr Playfair. The whole treatise is written with
                    a beautiful perspicuity, in an admirable spirit of candour and ingenuity, and in
                    a style more elegant and spirited than had yet lent its attraction to subjects
                    so recondite and abstruse. The publication accordingly attracted very general
                    notice, both in Europe and in Asia; and gave rise to much discussion and
                    research, the final value and result of which does not seem yet to be
                    ascertained. This was followed in 1794 by a learned and very beautiful treatise
                    on the Origin and Investigation of Porisms, in which the obscure nature of the
                    very comprehensive and indefinite theorems to which this name was applied by the
                    ancient geometers, is explained with the most lucid simplicity; and the
                    extraordinary merits of Dr Simson, in deducing their true theory from the very
                    vague and scanty notices of them which had come down to his time, are
                    commemorated with a noble spirit of emulation.</p>
                <p>In 1795 he published his Elements of Geometry, for the use of the pupils
                    attending his class; a work which has since been held in such estimation by the
                    public, as to have gone through five editions of a thousand copies each, four of
                    which were called for since the work ceased to be used as a class-book in the
                    University of Edinburgh. In 1797 he composed a sequel to his first paper on the
                    Indian Astronomy, in the shape of Observations on the Trigonometrical Tables of
                    the Brahmins; and also a masterly collection, of</p>
                <p>Theorms on the Figure of the Earth. It is also understood that he occupied
                    himself a good deal at this time in the preparation of an Essay on the
                    Accidental Discoveries made by Men of Science while in Pursuit of some other
                    Object; although we find no portion of this curious discussion in the collection
                    of his works.</p>
                <p>His excellent and ingenious friend Dr Hutton died in the year last mentioned; and
                    Mr Playfair, having undertaken to draw up a biographical account of him for the
                    Royal Society, was first led to study his ingenious but somewhat crude
                    speculations on the Theory of the Earth, and afterwards to lend them the
                    assistance of his own powerful pen in his Illustrations of the Huttonian Theory.
                    This work, upon which he bestowed more time and labour than on any of his other
                    productions, did not appear till 1802; and it was not till 1803 that he
                    presented to their associates his admirable memoir of their departed friend.</p>
                <p>Whatever opinion may be formed, now or hereafter, of the truth or soundness of
                    the suppositions by which Dr Hutton endeavoured to explain the actual state and
                    condition of our globe, it is impossible to doubt that Mr Playfair’s
                    illustration of that theory must always be ranked amongst the most brilliant and
                    powerful productions of philosophical genius. The beautiful clearness and
                    captivating eloquence with which the system itself is unfolded and explained,
                    the spirit and force of reasoning with which all the objections to it are
                    combated, the skill with which the infinite variety of facts which it brought
                    into view are combined into one grand and legitimate introduction, and the
                    judgment and extent of learning by which so many large and profound views of
                    nature are brought to bear upon the points in discussion, and blended into one
                    large and discursive argument, uniting the utmost logical precision with the
                    richest variety of topics, and the highest graces of composition—are merits
                    which have been universally acknowledged in this performance, even by those who
                    have not been convinced by its reasonings, and have extorted, even from the
                    fastidious critics of France, the acknowledgment that “Mr Playfair writes as
                    well as Buffon, and reasons incomparably better.”</p>
                <p>The biographical account of Dr Hutton is by far the best of Mr Playfair’s
                    productions in this line, and contains not only an eloquent and luminous account
                    of the speculations in which he was engaged, but, what is too often forgotten in
                    this species of biography, a charming portrait of the individual, drawn, no
                    doubt, by a favourable hand, but gaining far more in grace and effect than it
                    can possibly have lost in correctness, from the softening colours of
                    affection.</p>
                <p>In 1805 he quitted the chair of mathematics to succeed Professor Robison in that
                    of natural philosophy. The appointment of Mr Leslie as his successor in the
                    chair of mathematics was opposed at the time by a majority of the presbytery of
                    Edinburgh, and made the subject of very angry discussion, as well in various
                    publications as in the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland. From both
                    these fields of contention the opponents of Mr Leslie retired discomfited, and,
                    in the opinion, we believe, of many of the lookers on, disgraced. Amongst the
                    heaviest blows they had to sustain were those that parted from the hand of Mr
                    Playfair. He first addressed a Letter to the Lord Provost, in which, after
                    asserting, with infinite spirit and freedom, the dignity of the science in
                    question, he openly im-pu tes the new-sprung zeal for orthodoxy, which had
                    prompted the attack on Mr Leslie, to a wish or design on the part of some of the
                    clergymen of Edinburgh to obtain for themselves a number of the chairs in that
                    university, which had hitherto afforded sufficient occupation to the
                    undistracted industry of laymen: And when this denunciation brought upon him a
                    series of acrimonious and unhandsome attacks, he replied to them all in a
                    pamphlet of greater bulk, written in a style of which the high polish and

                    indeed, where to find a more perfect model of polemical or controversial
                    writing; and, much as it was to be regretted that an occasion should have arisen
                    for employing such a pen and such a mind as Mr Playfair’s on any temporary or
                    personal theme, it is impossible not toadmire the extraordinary talent and
                    vigour with which, when the occasion did arrive, he could turn talents,
                    exercised in far other studies, to the purposes suggested by the emergency.</p>
                <p>In 1807 he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of London, and soon
                    afterwards presented to that learned body his Lithological Survey of
                    Schehallien. In 1809 he contributed to the Edinburgh Transactions an excellent
                    paper on Solids of the greatest Attraction, and in 1812 another on the Progress
                    of Heat in Spherical Bodies. .</p>
                <p>In 1814 he published, in two volumes 8vo, for the use of his class, an elementary
                    work of great value, under the title of Outlines of Natural Philosophy. For some
                    years before this, he had been much occupied in digesting the plan and
                    collecting the materials for a greatly enlarged edition of his Illustrations of
                    the Huttonian Theory; with a view to which, he had not only carefully perused
                    and extracted a vast body of voyages and travels, but had made various journeys,
                    and very minutely examined almost all the places in the British dominions the
                    structure of which promised to throw any light on the subject of his researches.
                    No part of the work, however, was actually written, when the preparation for it
                    was suspended by his being induced to draw up for this publication an
                    introductory Dissertation on the Progress of Mathematical and Physical Science;
                    a treatise which, though its author had written nothing else, would itself
                    suffice to carry down his name with distinction to the latest posterity. The
                    soundness of judgment, the beauty of the writing, the extent of knowledge, the
                    candour and precision of the estimates of character, and the noble spirit of
                    liberality and generous admiration for genius which breathes throughout the
                    whole performance, give it an attraction which is rarely to be found in works of
                    the same erudition, and render it not only one of the most instructive, but one
                    of the most interesting publications that philosophy has ever bestowed on the
                    world.</p>
                <p>In 1815 he drew up for the Royal Society of Edinburgh a very interesting Memoir
                    of his distinguished predecessor Dr John Robison, a philosopher in whose early
                    life there was more adventure, and in his later days more political prejudice,
                    than we usually find to diversify the history of men of science. Nothing can be
                    more spirited and interesting than Mr Playfair’s account of the former; nothing
                    more manly and tender than his reluctant but decided protestation against the
                    excesses of the latter.</p>
                <p>After the general peace in 1815 had at last opened the Continent to British
                    inquirers, Mr Playfair, at the age of sixty-eight, undertook a long journey
                    through France and Switzerland into Italy, and did not return for a period of
                    nearly eighteen months. His principal attention was directed to the
                    mineralogical and geological phenomena of the different regions which he
                    visited; and he made many notes with a view to the great object which he was not
                    destined to accomplish, namely, the extension and new-modelling of his
                    Illustrations of the Huttonian Theory. Every object of liberal curiosity,
                    however, had for him an attraction as fresh as in his earliest youth; and the
                    social simplicity and benevolence of his character and manners insured him a
                    favourable reception in every new society to which he was introduced.</p>
                <p>On his return from this expedition, he employed himself chiefly in preparing the
                    Second Part of the Dissertation to which we have alluded; and he also drew up a
                    Memoir on the Naval Tactics of Mr Clerk of Eldin, which was published after his
                    death in the Philosophical Transactions, though only a fragment of a projected
                    life of Mr Clerk, which he did not live to complete. His health had been
                    occasionally broken for several years by the recurrence of a painful affection
                    of the bladder, which appeared with increased severity in the early part of
                    1819, but was so far got under as to enable him to complete his course of
                    lectures in the spring. It returned, however, in a still more distressing form
                    in the summer, and at last put a period to his life on the 19th of July. Though
                    suffering great pain during the last part of his confinement, he retained not
                    only his intellectual faculties quite unimpaired, but also the serenity and
                    mildness of his spirit, and occupied himself till within a few days of his death
                    in correcting the proofsheets of the Dissertation, the printing of the Second
                    Part of which had commenced some time before his last illness.<note

                <p>Before concluding these notices of Mr Playfair’s scientific and literary labours,
                    we have still to mention, that, from the year 1804, he was a frequent
                    contributor to the Edinburgh Review; and that though most of his articles were
                    of a scientific description, he occasionally diverged into the field of general
                    literature, or indulged in the refinements of metaphysical speculation. Many of
                    his scientific articles attracted great attention on the Continent as well as at
                    home; and several of them are written with a force and beauty that might well
                    entitle them to a higher place than the pages of a periodical publication. There
                    is no general account of the great facts and principles of astronomy so clear,
                    and comprehensive, and exact, nor half so beautiful or majestic in the writing,
                    as his account of Laplace’s <hi rend="italic">Mécanique</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Celeste,</hi> in the eleventh volume of the publication just mentioned.</p>
                <p>In this brief sketch of the events of Mr Playfair’s life, we have purposely
                    omitted any general account, either of his personal character, or of the
                    distinguishing features of his intellectual powers and habits; thinking it
                    better to give those by themselves, in the words in which they were recorded, to
                    the satisfaction, we believe, of most of those who knew him intimately, in a
                    periodical journal whereirt they appeared a short time after his death. The
                    portrait there given has been pronounced by one of the earliest and most
                    illustrious of his surviving friends, “a faithful and perfect resemblance
                    ;”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Letter from Mr Dugald
                    Stewart to Dr Playfair, in the Appendix to the Biographical Account of Professor
                    Playfair, prefixed to the collection of his works, published at Edinburgh in
                    1822, in 4 vols. 8vo.</p></note> and has accordingly' been allowed a place in
                    the prefatory memoir which his nephew has prefixed to the collection of his
                    works.</p>
                <p>“It has struck many people, we believe, as very extraordinary, that so eminent a
                    person as Mr Playfair should have been allowed to sink into his grave in the
                    midst of us, without calling forth almost so much as an attempt to commemorate
                    his merit, even in a common newspaper; and that the death of a man so celebrated
                    and so beloved, and, at the same time, so closely connected with many who could
                    well appreciate and suitably describe his excellencies, should be left to the
                    brief and ordinary notice of the daily obituary. No event of the kind certainly
                    ever excited more general sympathy; and no individual, we are persuaded, will be
                    longer or more affectionately remembered by all the classes of his
                    fellow-citizens; and yet it is to these very circumstances<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193532934" xml:id="kp-eb0718-2934-0047"/> that we must look for an
                    explanation of the apparent neglect by which his memory has been followed. His
                    humbler admirers have been deterred from expressing their sentiments by a
                    natural feeling of unwillingness to encroach on the privilege of those whom a
                    nearer approach to his person and talents rendered it more worthy to speak of
                    them; whilst the learned and eloquent amongst his friends have trusted to each
                    other for the performance of a task which they could not but feel to be painful
                    in itself, and not a little difficult to perform as it ought to be; or perhaps
                    have reserved for some more solemn occasion that tribute for which the public
                    impatience is already at its height.</p>
                <p>“We beg leave to assure our readers, that it is merely from anxiety to do <hi
                    rend="italic">something</hi> to gratify this natural impatience that we presume
                    to enter at all upon a subject to which we are perfectly aware that we are
                    incapable of doing justice; for of Mr Playfair’s scientific attainments, of his
                    proficiency in those studies to which he was peculiarly devoted, we are but
                    slenderly qualified to judge. Rut we believe we hazard nothing in saying that he
                    was one of the most learned mathematicians of his age, and among the first, if
                    not the very first, who introduced the beautiful discoveries of the later
                    continental geometers to the knowledge of his countrymen; and gave their just
                    value and true place, in the scheme of European knowledge, to those important
                    improvements by which the whole aspect of the abstract sciences has been
                    renovated since the days of our illustrious Newton. If he did not signalize
                    himself by any brilliant or original invention, he must, at least, be allowed to
                    have been a most generous and intelligent judge of the achievements of others;
                    as well as the most eloquent expounder of that great and magnificent system of
                    knowledge which has been gradually evolved by the successive labours of so many
                    gifted individuals. He possessed, indeed, in the highest degree, all the
                    characteristics both of a fine and a powerful understanding; at once penetrating
                    and vigilant, but more distinguished, perhaps, for the caution and sureness of
                    its march, than for the brilliancy or rapidity of its movements; and guided and
                    adorned through all its progress by the most genuine enthusiasm for all that is
                    grand, and the justest taste for all that is beautiful, in the truth or the
                    intellectual energy with which he was habitually conversant.</p>
                <p>“Towhat account these rare qualities might have been turned, and what more
                    brilliant or lasting fruits they might have produced, if his whole life had been
                    dedicated to the solitary cultivation of science, it is not for us to
                    conjecture; but it cannot be doubted that they added incalculably to his
                    eminence and utility as a teacher, both by enabling him to direct his pupils to
                    the most simple and luminous methods of inquiry, and to imbue their minds, from
                    the very commencement of the study, with that fine relish for the truths it
                    disclosed, and that high sense of the majesty with which they were invested,
                    that predominated in his own bosom. Whilst he left nothing unexplained or
                    unreduced to its proper place in the system, he took care that they should never
                    be perplexed by petty difficulties, or bewildered in useless details, and formed
                    them betimes to that clear, masculine, and direct method of investigation by
                    which, with the least labour, the greatest advances might be accomplished.</p>
                <p>“Mr Playfair, however, was not merely a teacher; and has fortunately left behind
                    him a variety of works, from which other generations may be enabled to judge of
                    some of those qualifications which so powerfully recommended and endeared him to
                    his contemporaries. It is, perhaps, to be regretted that so much of his time,
                    and so large a proportion of his publications, should have been devoted to the
                    subjects of the Indian Astronomy, and the Huttonian Theory of the Earth. For
                    though nothing can be more beautifulor instructive
                    thanhisspeculationsonthosecurious topics, it cannot be dissembled that their
                    results are less conclusive and satisfactory than might have been desired; and
                    that his doctrines, from the very nature of the subjects, are more questionable
                    than we believe they could possibly have been on any other topic in the whole
                    circle of the sciences. To the first, indeed, he came under the great
                    disadvantage of being unacquainted with the eastern tongues, and without the
                    means of judging of the authenticity of the documents which he was obliged to
                    assume as the elements of his reasonings; and as to the other, though he ended,
                    we believe, with being a very able and skilful mineralogist, we think it is now
                    generally admitted that that science does not yet afford sufficient materials
                    for any positive conclusion, and that all attempts to establish a theory of the
                    earth must, for many years to come, be regarded as premature. Though it is
                    impossible, therefore, to think too highly of the ingenuity, the vigour, and the
                    eloquence of those publications, we are of opinion that a juster estimate of Mr
                    Playfair’s talent, and a truer picture of his genius and understanding, is to be
                    found in his other writings; in the papers, both biographical and scientific,
                    with which he has enriched the Transactions of our Royal Society; his account of
                    Laplace, and other articles which he is understood to have contributed to the
                    Edinburgh Review; the Outlines of his Lectures on Natural Philosophy; and, above
                    all, his Introductory Discourse to the Supplement to the Encyclopaedia
                    Britannica, with the final correction of which he was occupied up to the last
                    moments that the progress of his disease allowed him to dedicate to any
                    intellectual exertion.</p>
                <p>“With reference to these works, we do not think we are influenced by any
                    national, or other partiality, when we say that he was certainly one <hi
                    rend="italic">of</hi> the best writers of his age; and even that we do not now
                    recollect any one of his contemporaries who was so great a master of
                    composition. There is a certain mellowness and richness about his style, which
                    adorns without disguising the weight and nervousness, which is itsother great
                    characteristic; a sedate gracefulness and manly simplicity in the more level
                    passages, and a mild majesty and considerate enthusiasm where he rises above
                    them, of which we scarcely know where to find any other example. There is great
                    equability, too, and sustained force, in every part of his writings. He never
                    exhausts himself in flashes and epigrams, nor languishes into tameness and
                    insipidity; at first sight you would say that plainness and good sense were the
                    predominating qualities, but by and by this simplicity is enriched with the
                    delicate and vivid colours of a fine imagination, the free and forcible touches
                    of a most powerful intellect, and the lights and shaeds of an unerring and
                    harmonizing taste. In comparing it with the styles of his most celebrated
                    contemporaries, we would say that it was more purely and peculiarly a <hi
                    rend="italic">written</hi> style, and, therefore, rejected those ornaments that
                    more properly belong to oratory. It had no impetuosity, hurry, or vehemence,—no
                    bursts or sudden turns or abruptions, like that of Burke; and though eminently
                    smooth and melodious, it was not modulated to an uniform system of solemn
                    declamation like that of Johnson; nor spread out in the richer and more
                    voluminous elocution of Stewart; nor still less broken into that patchwork of
                    scholastic pedantry and conversational smartness which has found its admirers in
                    Gibbon. It is a style, in short, of great freedom, force, and beauty; but the
                    deliberate style of a man of thought and of learning, and neither that of a wit
                    throwing out his extempores with an affectation of careless grace, nor of a
                    rhetorician thinking more of his manner than his matter, and determined to be
                    admired for his expression, whatever may be the fate of his sentiments.</p>
                <p>“His habits of composition, as we have understood, were <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193532947" xml:id="kp-eb0718-2947-0048"/>not perhaps exactly what
                    might have been expected from their results. He wrote rather slowly, and his
                    first sketches were often very slight and imperfect, like the rude chalking for
                    a masterly picture. His chief effort and greatest pleasure was in their revisal
                    and correction; and there were no limits to the improvement which resulted from
                    this application. It was not the style merely, or indeed chiefly, that gained by
                    it; the whole reasoning, and sentiment, and illustration, were enlarged and
                    new-modelled in the course of it, and a naked outline became gradually informed
                    with life, colour, and expression, It was not at all like the common finishing
                    and polishing to which careful authors generally subject the first draught of
                    their compositions, nor even like the fastidious and tentative alterations with
                    which some more anxious writers assay their choicer passages. It was, in fact,
                    the great filling in of the picture, the working up of the figured <hi
                    rend="italic">weft</hi> on the naked and meagre <hi rend="italic">woof</hi> that
                    had been stretched to receive it; and the singular thing in his case was, not
                    only that he left this most material part of his work to be performed after the
                    whole outline had been finished, but that he could proceed with it to an
                    indefinite extent, and enrich and improve as long as he thought fit, without any
                    risk either of destroying the proportions of that outline, or injuring the
                    harmony and unity of the design. He was perfectly aware, too, of the possession
                    of this extraordinary power; and it was partly, we presume, in consequence of
                    this consciousness that he was not only at all times ready to go on with any
                    work in which he was engaged, without waiting for favourable moments or hours of
                    greater alacrity, but that he never felt any of those doubts and misgivings as
                    to his being able to get creditably through with his undertaking, to which we
                    believe most authors are occasionally liable. As he never wrote upon any subject
                    of which he was not perfectly master, he was secure against all blunders in the
                    substance of what he had to say; and felt quite assured, that if he was only
                    allowed time enough, he should finally come to say it in the very best way of
                    which he was capable. He had no anxiety, therefore, either in undertaking or
                    proceeding with his tasks; and intermitted and resumed them at his convenience,
                    with the comfortable certainty, that all the time he bestowed on them was turned
                    to good account, and that what was left imperfect at one sitting might be
                    finished with equal ease and advantage at another. Being thus perfectly sure
                    both of his end and his means, he experienced, in the course of his
                    compositions, none of that little fever of the spirits with which that operation
                    is so apt to be accompanied. He had no capricious visitings of fancy, which it
                    was necessary to fix upon the spot or to lose for ever; no casual inspiration to
                    invoke and to wait for; no transitory and evanescent lights to catch before they
                    faded. All that was in his mind was subject to his control, and amenable to his
                    call, though it might not obey at the moment; and whilst his taste was so sure,
                    that he was in no danger of overworking anything that he had designed, all his
                    thoughts and sentiments had that unity and congruity, that they fell almost
                    spontaneously into harmony and order; and the last added, incorporated, and
                    assimilated with the first, as if they had sprung simultaneously from the same
                    happy conception.</p>
                <p>“But we need dwell no longer on qualities that maybe gathered hereafter from the
                    works he has left behind him. They who lived with him mourn the most for those
                    which will be traced in no such memorial; and prize far above those talents
                    which gained him his high name in philosophy, that personal character which
                    endeared him to his friends, and shed a grace and a dignity over all the society
                    in which he moved. The same admirable taste which is conspicuous in his
                    writings, or rather the higher principles from which that taste was but an
                    emanation, spread a similar charm over his whole life and conversation, and gave
                    to the most learned philosopher of his day the manners and deportment of the
                    most perfect gentleman. Nor was this in him the result merely of good sense and
                    good temper, assisted by an early familiarity with good company,' and a
                    consequent knowledge of his own place and that of all around him. His good
                    breeding was of a higher descent; and his powers of pleasing rested on something
                    better than mere companionable qualities. With ⅛c greatest kindness and
                    generosity of nature, he united the most manly firmness, and the highest
                    principles of honour; and the most cheerful and social dispositions, with the
                    gentlest and steadiest affections. Towards women he had always the most
                    chivalrous feelings of regard and attention, and was, beyond almost all men,
                    acceptable and agreeable in their society, though without the least levity or
                    pretension unbecoming his age or condition; and such, indeed, was the
                    fascination of the perfect simplicity and mildness of his manners, that the same
                    tone and deportment seemed <hi rend="superscript"> i</hi> equally appropriate in
                    all societies, and enabled him to de- <hi rend="superscript">;</hi> light the
                    young and the gay with the same sort of conversation which instructed the
                    learned and the grave. There never, indeed, was a man of learning and talent who
                    appeared in society so perfectly free from all sorts of pretension or notion of
                    his own importance, or so little solicitous to distinguish himself, or so
                    sincerely willing to give place to every one else. Even upon subjects which he
                    had thoroughly studied, he was never in the least impatient to speak, and spoke
                    at all times without any tone of authority; whilst, so far from wishing to set
                    off what he had to say by any brilliancy or emphasis of expression, it seemed
                    generally as if he had studied to disguise the weight and originality of his
                    thoughts under the plainest form of speech and the most quiet and indifferent
                    manner; so that the profoundest remarks and subtlest observations were often
                    dropped, not only without any solicitude that their value should be observed,
                    but without any apparent consciousness that they possessed any. Though the most
                    social of human beings, and the most disposed to encourage and sympathise with
                    the gaiety and joviality of others, his own spirits were in general rather
                    cheerful than gay, or at least never rose to any turbulence or tumult of
                    merriment; and whilst he would listen with the kindest indulgence to the more
                    extravagant sallies of his younger friends, and prompt them by the heartiest
                    approbation, his own satisfaction might generally be traced in a slow and
                    temperate smile, gradually mantling over his benevolent and intelligent
                    features, and lighting up the countenance of the sage with the expression of the
                    mildest and most genuine philanthropy. It was wonderful, indeed, considering the
                    measure of his own intellect, and the rigid and undeviating propriety of his own
                    conduct, how tolerant he was of the defects and errors of other men. He was too
                    indulgent, in truth, and favourable to his friends, and made a kind and liberal
                    allowance for the faults of all mankind; except only faults of baseness or of
                    cruelty, against which he never failed to manifest the most open scorn and
                    detestation. Independently, in short, of his high attainments, Mr Playfair was
                    one of the most amiable and estimable of men; delightful in his manners,
                    inflexible in his principles, and generous in his affections, he had all that
                    could charm in society or attach in private; and whilst his friends enjoyed the
                    free and unstudied conversation of an easy and intelligent associate, they had
                    at all times the proud and inward assurance that he was a being upon whose
                    perfect honour and generosity they might rely with the-most implicit confidence,
                    in life and in death, <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> —and of whom it was equally
                    impossible that, under any circumstances, he should ever perform a mean, a
                    selfish, or a <hi rend="italic">questionable</hi> action, as that his body
                    should cease to gravitate or his soul to live.</p>
                <p>“If we do not greatly deceive ourselves, there is nothing here of exaggeration or
                    partial feeling, and nothing with <pb break="no" facs="nls:193532960"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0718-2960-0049"/>which an indifferent and honest chronicler would
                    not concur. Nor is it altogether idle to have dwelt so long on the personal
                    character of this distinguished individual. For we are ourselves persuaded, that
                    this personal character has done almost as much for the cause of science and
                    philosophy amongst us as the great talents and attainments with which it was
                    combined; and has contributed in a very eminent degree to give to the better
                    society of Edinburgh that tone of intelligence and liberality by which it is so
                    honourably distinguished. It is not a little advantageous to philosophy that it
                    is in fashion; and it is still more advantageous, perhaps, to the society which
                    is led to confer on it this apparently trivial distinction. It is a great thing
                    for the country at large,—for its happiness, its prosperity, and its
                    renown,—that the upper and influencing part of its population should be made
                    familiar, even in its untasked and social hours, with sound and liberal
                    information, and be taught to know and respect those who have distinguished
                    themselves for great intellectual attainments. Nor is it, after all, a slight or
                    despicable reward for a man of genius to be received with honour in the highest
                    and most elegant society around him, and to receive in his living person that
                    homage and applause which is too often reserved for his memory. Now, those
                    desirable ends can never be effectually accomplished, unless the manners of our
                    leading philosophers are agreeable, and their personal habits and dispositions
                    engaging and amiable. From the time of Hume and Robertson, we have been
                    fortunate in Edinburgh in possessing a succession of distinguished men, who have
                    kept up this salutary connection between the learned and the fashionable world;
                    but there never, perhaps, was any one who contributed so powerfully to confirm
                    and extend it, and that in times when it was peculiarly difficult, as the
                    lamented individual of whom we are now speaking; and they who have had the best
                    opportunity to observe how superior the society of Edinburgh is to that of most
                    other places of the same size, and how much of that superiority is owing to the
                    cordial combination of the two aristocracies of rank and of letters (of both of
                    which it happens to be the chief provincial seat), will be best able to judge of
                    the importance of the service he has thus rendered to its inhabitants, and
                    through them, and by their example, to all the rest of the country.” (p. <hi
