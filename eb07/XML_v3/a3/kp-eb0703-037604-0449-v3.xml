                    significant corrections to the OCR text, predominantly in cases of confusing "c"
                    and "e." Isolates 90 entries that were mistakenly included at the end of prior
                    entries in v1 and v2. Normalizes ordinal numbers. Separates metadata in
                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                    principal of the university of 'Aberdeen in the reign of James VI. of Scotland,
                    was born in the year 1538. He studied first at Aberdeen, and was afterwards sent
                    over to France, where, under the famous Cujacius, he applied himself to the
                    study of the civil law. In the year 1563 he returned to Scotland and took
                    orders. Whether he was ordained by a bishop or by presbyters is a matter of
                    uncertainty. In 1568 he was appointed minister of Arbuthnot and Logie Buchan;
                    and in the following year Mr Alexander Anderson being deprived, our author was
                    made principal of the King’s College at Aberdeen in his room. In the general
                    assembly which met at Edinburgh in the years 1573 and 1577 he was chosen
                    moderator, and to the end of his life was an active supporter of the reformed
                    religion. He died in 1583, in the 45th year of his age, and was buried in the
                    College church of Aberdeen. It was by him that Buchanan’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >History of Scotland,</hi> published in 1582, was edited. The only production of
                    his own is his <hi rend="italic">Orationcs de</hi><hi rend="italic">Origine et
                    Dignitate</hi><hi rend="italic">Juris,</hi> printed at Edinburgh in 1572, 4to.
                    His contemporary Thomas Maitland wrote a copy of Latin verses on the publication
                    of this book: they are printed in the <hi rend="italic">Delit. Poet. Scot.</hi>
                    The same collection contains an elegant epitaph on him, written by Andrew
                    Melvil.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Arbuthnot,</hi><hi rend="italic">John,</hi> Μ. D. the son of
                    an episcopal clergyman in Scotland, was born soon after the Restoration, at
                    Arbuthnot near Montrose. After acquiring a competent knowledge of the elementary
                    parts of education, he was sent to the college of Aberdeen, where the buddings
                    of those great qualities and those sallies of wit, which contributed so much to
                    his future greatness, soon made their appearance. Having there gone through a
                    course of academical studies, and obtained the degree of doctor of physic, he
                    went to London in order to reap the fruits both of his natural and acquired
                    abilities. He then began to display his talents in teaching mathematics, in
                    which he was very expert. <hi rend="italic">An Examination of Dr Woodward’s
                    Account of the Deluge,</hi> &amp;c. in 1697, first made him known to the learned
                    world. This performance was received with great applause; and in 1700 a treatise
                    <hi rend="italic">On the Usefulness of Mathematical Learning</hi> still
                    increased his reputation. A very interesting paper <hi rend="italic">On the
                    Regularity of the Births of both Sexes,</hi> demonstrating from authentic proofs
                    the universal similarity which is observed by nature in this circumstance, and
                    drawing from these Several political and moral inferences, which he presented to
                    the Royal Society, procured his election in 1704 into that body. Meanwhile, in
                    his own proper profession, he Was acquiring considerable eminence, and was
                    appointed, on account of his great medical knowledge, physician extraordinary to
                    Prince George of Denmark, and shortly afterwards one of the physicians in
                    ordinary to Queen Anne. He was admitted in 1710 a fellow of the college. He
                    formed about this period a very intimate acquaintance, Which lasted with
                    unabating tenderness and affection during the rest of his life, with these great
                    literary men, Pope, Gay, and Swift. In 1714 he engaged in an extensive design of
                    making a satire upon all the abuses of science in every branch, in co-operation
                    with Pope and’ Swift, which was to be written under the form of the history of a
                    fictitious character, and in the grave ironical style. The plan was never
                    finished, but the <hi rend="italic">Memoirs</hi><hi rend="italic subscript">
                    0</hi><hi rend="italic">f Martinus Scriblerus,</hi> published in Pope’s works,
                    form a part, of which much is the performance of Dr Arbuthnot. It is very
                    probable that the whole of the first book is of his composition, in which the
                    great profoundness of knowledge that is discerned, and the good-natured
                    pleasantry with which the satire is directed, has gained it the character of one
                    of the most original, learned, and interesting pieces in the English language.
                    Those parts which relate to anatomy, the manners and customs of antiquity, and
                    logic, are particularly his performance. On the death of Queen Anne he made a
                    visit to Paris, in order to drive away the melancholy which attended him on
                    account of that circumstance, which was a severe stroke to him, and destructive
                    not only to his personal, but also to his political views. Returning from
                    thence, as his medical services were no longer required at St James’s, he
                    retired from it, and followed at large the practice of his profession; yet he
                    did not thence give up his literary pursuits, but pursued them with great
                    ardour, although long intervals took place between the times of his
                    publications. A work entitled <hi rend="italic">Tables of Ancient Coins,
                    Weights, and Measures,</hi> explained and exemplified in several dissertations,
                    appeared in 1727, in a 4to volume, which is the chief of his serious
                    performances. Although there are several inaccuracies in it which could hardly
                    be avoided in so intricate a subject, it is a work of great merit, and has ever
                    since been considered as the standard authority. A treatise <hi rend="italic">On
                    the Nature and Choice of Aliments,</hi> which was published in 1732, and another
                    published in 1733, <hi rend="italic">On the Effects of Air on Human Bodies,</hi>
                    finish the list of his sterling works. Both these were well received by the
                    faculty, and continue to be still esteemed, and are occasionally read and
                    quoted. Respecting his humorous works, which were the productions of his leisure
                    hours, they are so confounded with those of his contemporaries, that it is not
                    easy to distinguish them. But a piece which, independent of any other, would
                    raise him to the character of the first humorous writer in the English language,
                    entitled the <hi rend="italic">History of John Bull,</hi> is confidently
                    ascribed to him. This is conducted with great wit and humour, and all the
                    circumstances and characters are most admirably adapted. Among his several
                    avowed ironical pieces are, <hi rend="italic">A Treatise concerning the
                    Altercation or Scolding of the Ancients,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Art of
                    Political Lying.</hi></p>
                <p>In the year 1751 there were published two small volumes, entitled <hi
                    rend="italic">The Miscellaneous Worhsof Dr Arbuthnot',</hi> but the greater part
                    of what they contain is denied by his son to be of his composition. As it was
                    customary for him, when any comical occurrence took place, which struck his
                    fancy, to write concerning it in a large folio which lay in his parlour, it is
                    very probable that many slight and imperfect essays, which had gone out of his
                    remembrance, might get abroad into the world. Through all his pieces of this
                    kind there runs a vein of good-natured pleasantry; and this tends to confirm the
                    character given of him by Swift, to a lady who desired to know his opinion
                    concerning Dr Arbuthnot, “He has more wit than we all have, and his humanity is
                    equal to his wit. Although his writings are free from that gall and rancour too
                    common among party writers, yet they cannot be said to be altogether free from a
                    party spirit; and in one ι∏∙ stance he cannot be excused for allowing his
                    personal disíike to overrule his humanity, viz. in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Memorandums of the six days preceding the death of a late T</hi><hi
                    rend="italic superscript"> i</hi><hi rend="italic">9</hi><pb break="no"

                    >Reverend</hi> (meaning Bishop Burnet). The indignation of a virtuous man
                    towards an infamous character is sufficient to justify his severity in his
                    bitter <hi rend="italic">Epitaph on Colonel Chartres,</hi> and this severity was
                    probably aggravated by party spirit. Although he had no proper poetical talent,
                    yet he made an effort to try his genius in that kind of composition. A piece
                    published in Dodsley’s collection is valuable for its philosophical sentiment.
                    It is entitled l’N∩ΘI ΣEA^fTON, <hi rend="italic">Know thyself.</hi> He was also
                    skilled in musie; and Sir J. Hawkins mentions an anthem and a burlesque song
                    which are ascribed to him.</p>
                <p>In these occupations he passed his days, amid all the pleasures that can render
                    domestic life happy, in the affection and estimation of his friends, beloved and
                    esteemed by all his literary associates, who have each taken great pains to
                    celebrate their mutual friendship. Swift, in one of his poems, sincerely laments
                    that he is</p>
                <lg part="N">
                    <l part="N"> Far from his kind Arbuthnot’s aid, </l>
                    <l part="N"> Who knows his art, but not his trade. </l>
                </lg>
                <p>Pope has dedicated to him an epistle called a <hi rend="italic">Prologue to the
                    Satires.</hi> He was full of humility and resignation in all the dispensations
                    of Providence. Of his two sons, he witnessed the’death of one; and the other,
                    with some daughters, survived him. At length, from an inveterate asthma, he fell
                    into a dropsical disorder; and, in order to try the effect of a change of air,
                    he repaired to Hampstead, but without the least gleam of hope respecting a
                    recovery, as he assured his friends Pope and Swift. Returning to his house in
                    London, he died February 27, 1734-5.</p>
