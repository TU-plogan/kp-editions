                    Philip liking of Macedonia, whom he had newly restored. He was about 62 when he
                    died, the second year of the 141st Olympiad. He was interred at Sicyon, and
                    received the greatest honours from his countrymen.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Aratus,</hi> a Greek poet, born at Soli, or Solae, a town in
                    Cilicia, which afterwards changed its name, and was called Pompeiopolis in
                    honour of Pompey the Great. He flourished about the 124th, or, according to
                    some, the 126th Olympiad, in the reign of Ptolemy Philadelphus, king of Egypt.
                    He discovered in his youth a remarkable poignancy of wit, and capacity for
                    improvement; and having received his education under Dionysius Hera-clcotes, a
                    Stoic philosopher, he espoused the principles of that sect. Aratus was physician
                    to Antigonus Gonatus, the son of Demetrius Poliorcetes, king of Macedon. His <pb break="no" facs="nls:193100436" xml:id="kp-eb0703-0436-0375"/>
                    poem entitled <hi rend="italic">Phaenomena</hi> describes the nature and motion
                    of the fixed stars, and shows the particular influences of the heavenly bodies,
                    with their various dispositions and relations. He wrote this poem in Greek
                    verse. It was translated into Latin by Cicero, who tells us, in his first book
                    <hi rend="italic">De Oratore,</hi> that the verses of Aratus are very noble.
                    This piece was translated by others as well as Cicero, there being a translation
                    by Germanicus Caesar, and another into elegant verse by Festus Avienus. An
                    edition of the <hi rend="italic">Phoenomena</hi> was published by Grotius, at
                    Leyden, in quarto, in 1600, in Greek and Latin, with the fragments of Cicero’s
                    version, and the translations of Germanicus and Avienus; all which the editor
                    has illustrated with curious notes. A valuable edition of the <hi rend="italic">Phoeno-menαwas</hi> published at Oxford, by Fell, in 1672, in 8vo; but the most
                    complete is that of Buhle, published at Leipsic in 1801, in 2 vols. 8vo. There
                    are several other works ascribed to Aratus. Suidas mentions the following
                    ;—Hymns to Pan; Astrology and Astrothesy; a composition of Antidotes; an <hi rend="italic">Έitiόντιχον</hi> on Theopropus; an Hdûffwoe on Antigonus; an
                    Epigram on Phila, the daughter of Antipater and wife of Antigonus; an Epicedium
                    of Cleombrotus; a Correction of the Odyssey; and some Epistles in prose. Virgil,
                    in his Georgies, has imitated or translated many passages from this author; and
                    St Paul has quoted a passage of Aratus. It is in his speech to the Athenians
                    (Acts xvii. 28), wherein he tells them that some of their own po*ets have said,
