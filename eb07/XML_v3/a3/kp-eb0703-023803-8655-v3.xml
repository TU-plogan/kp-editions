                    whose merit and good fortune as a naval commander exalted him to the rank of
                    nobility. He was the son of William Anson, Esq. of Huckborough, in
                    Staffordshire; and, showing an early inclination for the sea, received a
                    suitable education. The first command he enjoyed was that of the Weasel sloop in
                    1722; but the most memorable action of his life, and the foundation of his
                    future good fortune, took place on his receiving the command of five ships, a
                    sloop, and two victuallers, equipped to annoy the Spaniards in the South Seas,
                    and to co-operate with Admiral Vernon across the Isthmus of Darien; an
                    expedition the principal object of which failed by the unaccountable delay in
                    fitting him out. He sailed, however, in September 1740; doubled Cape Horn in a
                    dangerous season; lost most of his men by the scurvy; and with only one
                    remaining ship, the Centurion, crossed the great Pacific Ocean. If no
                    considerable national advantage resulted from this voyage, Commodore Anson made
                    his own fortune, and enriched his surviving companions, by the capture of a rich
                    galleon on her passage from Acapulco to Manilla, with which he returned home
                    round the Cape of Good Hope. If he was lucky in meeting this galleon, he was no
                    less fortunate in escaping a French fleet then cruising in the Channel, by
                    sailing through it during a fog. He arrived at Spithead in June 1744. In a short
                    time after his return he was appointed rear-admiral of the blue, and one of the
                    lords of the admiralty. In April 1745 he was made rear-admiral of the white, and
                    the following year vice-admiral of the blue, at which time he was chosen to
                    represent the borough of Heydon in parliament. In 1747, being on board the
                    Prince George of 90 guns, in company with Admiral Warren and 12 other ships, he
                    intercepted, off Cape Finisterre, a powerful fleet, bound from France to the
                    East and West Indies; when, by his valour and conduct, he again enriched himself
                    and his officers, and at the same time strengthened the British navy, by taking
                    six men of war and four East Indiamen, not one of them escaping. The French
                    admiral, Μ. Jon quiere, on presenting his sword to the conqueror, said, <hi rend="italic">Monsieur,</hi><hi rend="italic">vous avez vaincu</hi><hi rend="italic">l’</hi><hi rend="italic">Invincible, et la Gloire vous suit</hi>
                    —“Sir, you have conquered the Invincible, and Glory follows you ;” pointing to
                    the ships named the <hi rend="italic">Invincible</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Glory,</hi> which he had taken. For his signal services he was created baron of
                    Soberton in Hants. The same year he was appointed vice-admiral of the red; and,
                    on the death of Sir John Norris, was made vice-admiral of England. In 1748 he
                    was made admiral of the blue: he was afterwards appointed first lord of the
                    admiralty, and was at length made admiral and commander-in-chief of his
                    majesty’s fleet, in which rank he continued, with a very short interval, until
                    his death; and the last service he performed was to convey Queen Charlotte to
                    England. He died in June 1762. No performance ever met with a more favourable
                    reception than the account of Anson’s voyage round the world. Though it is
                    printed under the name of his chaplain, it was composed under his lordship’s own
                    inspection, and from the materials he himself furnished, by Mr Benjamin
                    Robins.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
