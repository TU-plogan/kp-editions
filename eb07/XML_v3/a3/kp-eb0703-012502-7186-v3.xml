                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                    emperor of the East, was the son of Isaac, and grandson of Alexius Comnenus.
                    Naturally active, martial, and eloquent, he shines as one of the most
                    conspicuous characters of his age. Following the bent of his inclination, he
                    attended the Roman army in their retreat; but in their march through Asia Minor,
                    wandering into the mountains, he fell into the hands of some Turkish huntsmen,
                    was carried to the sultan, and remained his prisoner; but regaining his liberty,
                    both his virtues and vices soon recommended him to the favour of his cousin
                    Manuel, the reigning emperor. The vicious heart of Andronicus manifested itself
                    clearly in maintaining a licentious correspondence with Eudocia, the emperor’s
                    niece, while the emperor himself lived in public incest with her sister
                    Theodora. His martial spirit gained him a considerable command in Cilicia, where
                    he laid siege to Mopsuestia; but by a successful sally of the enemy he was
                    obliged to raise the siege, and retire in considerable disorder. Inflamed with a
                    desire of revenging the infamy of their sister in his blood, the brothers of
                    Eudocia made an unsuccessful attempt to assassinate Andronicus at midnight in
                    his tent; but being awakened, he defended himself with surprising bravery,
                    forced his way through his enemies, and escaped in safety. Afterwards engaging
                    in a treasonable correspondence with the emperor of Germany and the king of
                    Hungary, he was arrested and thrown into confinement. He remained in this state
                    about twelve years, and after several repeated attempts to escape, he at last
                    effected his purpose, and fled for refuge to the court of the great duke of
                    Russia. The cunning of Andronicus soon found means to regain his favour with the
                    emperor Manuel; for having exerted all his influence, he succeeded in obtaining
                    the Russian prince to engage to join his troops with those of Manuel, in the
                    invasion of Hungary. Accordingly, on account of his important service, he
                    obtained a free pardon from the emperor, and after an expedition to the Danube
                    returned with him to Constantinople. He again fell under the displeasure of the
                    emperor, by refusing to take an oath of allegiance to the prince of Hungary, his
                    intended son-in-law, and consequently presumptive heir to the crown, and was
                    thereupon returned to his former command in Cilicia. While residing here, his
                    powerful address captivated the heart of Philippa, daughter of the Latin prince
                    of Antioch, and sister to the empress Maria; and in her company he spent his
                    time in all the amusements that country could afford, till the emperor’s
                    resentment put a stop to their correspondence. Thus circumstanced, he collected
                    a band of adventurers, and undertook a pilgrimage to the Holy Land, where, by
                    his insinuating turn of mind, he so far succeeded in gaining the favour of the
                    king and clergy, as to be invested with the lordship of Berytus, on the coast of
                    Phoenicia. In this neighbourhood Theodora, the beautiful widow of Baldwin, king
                    of Jerusalem, and nearly allied in blood to him, resided. The personal
                    accomplishments and address of Andronicus captivated her heart, and she became
                    the third victim to his artful seduction, and lived publicly as his concubine.
                    Still pursued by the emperor with unabating resentment, he was forced to take
                    refuge in Damascus, and then in several other places in the east, till at length
                    he settled in Asia Minor. While residing here he made frequent incursions into
                    the province of Trebizond, and seldom returned without success. After several
                    occurrences Theodora was made captive by the governor of Trebizond, along with
                    her two children, and sent to Constantinople; upon which Andronicus implored and
                    obtained pardon. He acted the affected penitent in such a manner, that he again
                    ingratiated himself into the favour both of the church and state; but was sent
                    to dwell at Oenoe, a town situated on the Euxine coast.</p>
                <p>In the year 1177 Manuel died, and was succeeded by his son Alexius IL, a youth
                    about twelve or fourteen years of age, without wisdom or experience, by which
                    the ambition of Andronicus was again called into action. A civil war having been
                    occasioned by the misconduct of the empress in Constantinople, the public mind
                    was directed towards Andronicus, as the only person whose rank and
                    accomplishments could restore the public tranquillity. Incited by the patriarchs
                    and patricians, he marched towards Constantinople, which he entered, took
                    possession of the palace, confined the empress, consigned her minister to death,
                    assumed the office of protector, put to death many persons of distinction, tried
                    and executed the queen on a charge of corresponding with the king of Hungary,
                    and vowed fidelity to the young emperor upon his coronation, at the same time
                    teaching the necessity of an experienced ruler, to assuage the evils that
                    threatened the empire; upon which his adherents called out, “Long live Alexius
                    and Andronicus, Roman emperors.” While he affected reluctance, he was elevated
                    to a partnership in the empire. This conjunction of the royal power was soon
                    dissolved by the murder of the unfortunate Alexius. The body of the deceased
                    being brought into his presence, striking it with his foot, he said, “Thy father
                    was a knave, thy mother a whore, and thyself a fool.” Having arrived at the
                    dignity of sole emperor, A. <hi rend="smallcaps">d.</hi> 1183, he continued to
                    sway the sceptre with a mixture of justice and bounty towards his subjects at
                    large; but those whom he feared or hated he governed with the most cruel
                    tyranny. The noble families that were either cut off or exiled by him were all
                    allied to the Comneni. Some of these were engaged in revolt; and the public
                    calamity was heightened by an invasion of the Sicilians, in which they took and
                    sacked Thessalonica. A rival without merit, and a people without arms, at last
                    overturned his throne. A descendant from the first Alexius in the female line,
                    named Isaac Angelus, being singled out by Andronicus as a victim to his cruelty,
                    he with courage and resolution defended his life and liberty, slew his
                    executioner, fled to the church of St Sophia, and there took refuge with several
                    of his friends. Isaac was instantly raised by the populace from a sanctuary to a
                    throne. When this event took place Andronicus was absent from Constantinople;
                    but he no sooner heard of it than he with the utmost speed returned. Upon his
                    arrival there he found himself deserted by all, and was seized and dragged in
                    chains before the new emperor. All the eloquence he displayed was of no avail;
                    for Isaac delivered him into the hands of those whom he had injured, and for the
                    space of three days he endured with uncommon patience all the insults and
                    torments that were inflicted upon him. At last two friendly or furious Italians,
                    plunging their swords into his body, put a period to his life. His death, in the
                    73d year of his age, terminated the dynasty of the Comneni.</p>
