                    and arrow.</p><p>In most nations the bow was anciently the principal implement of war, and by the
                    expertness of the archers alone was often decided the fate of battles and of
                    empires. In this island archery was greatly encouraged in former times, and many
                    statutes were made for its advancement ∙ whence it was that the English archers
                    in particular became the best in Europe, and procured many signal victories.</p><p>The <hi rend="italic">Artillery Company</hi> of London, though they have long
                    disused the weapon, are the remains of the ancient fraternity of bowmen or
                    archers. Artillery <hi rend="italic">(artillerie)</hi><hi rend="italic">⅛</hi>
                    a French term signifying <hi rend="italic">archery,</hi> as the <hi rend="italic">hing'</hi><hi rend="italic">s bowyer</hi> i⅛ in that language
                    styled <hi rend="italic">artillier du roy</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and from
                    that nation the English seem to have learnt at least the crossbow archery. We
                    therefore find that William the Conqueror had a considerable number of bowmen in
                    his army at the battle of Hastings, when no mention is made of such troops on
                    the side of Harold; and it is supposed that these Norman archers shot with the
                    arbalest or crossbow, in which formerly the arrow was placed in a groove, being
                    termed in French a <hi rend="italic">quadrel,</hi> and in English a <hi rend="italic">bolt.</hi></p><p>Of the time when shooting with the long-bow first began among the English, at
                    which exercise they afterwards became so expert, there appear no certain
                    accounts. Their chronicles do not mention the use of archery as expressly
                    applied to the cross-bow or the long-bow till the death of Richard I., who was
                    killed by an arrow at the siege of Limoges in Guienne, which Hemmingford
                    mentions to have issued from a cross-bow. After this, which happened in 1199,
                    there appear not upon record any notices of archery for nearly 150 years, when
                    an order was issued by Edward III., in the 15th year of his reign, to the
                    sheriffs of most of the English counties, for providing 500 white bows and 500
                    bundles of arrows, for the then intended war against France. Similar orders arc
                    repeated in the following years; with this difference only, that the sheriff of
                    Gloucestershire is directed to furnish 500 painted bows, as well as the same
                    number of white. The famous battle of Cressy was fought four years afterwards,
                    in which our chroniclers state that we had 2800 archers, who were opposed to
                    about the same number of the French; which, together with a circumstance to be
                    immediately mentioned, seems to prove that by this time we used the long-bow,
                    while the French archers shot with the arbalest. The circumstance alluded to is
                    as follows :—Previously to the engagement there fell a very heavy rain, which is
                    said to have much damaged the bows of the French, or perhaps rather the strings
                    of them. Now the long-bow, when unstrung, may be most conveniently covered, so
                    as to prevent the rain’s injuring it; nor is there scarcely any addition to the
                    weight from a case; whereas the arbalest is of a most'inconvenient form to be
                    sheltered from the weather. As, therefore, in the year 1342, orders were issued
                    to the sheriffs of each county to provide 500 bows, with a proper proportion of
                    arrows, it seems probable that these were longbows, and not the arbalest.</p><p>At the above-mentioned battle the English ascribed their victory chiefly to the
                    archers. The battle of Poictiers was fought in 1356, and gained by the same
                    means.</p><p>Sometimes the archers gained great victories without even the least assistance
                    from the men at arms; as particularly the decisive victory over the Scots at
                    Homildon in 1402. In that bloody battle the men at arms did not strike a stroke,
                    but were mere spectators of the valour and victory of the archers. The earl of
                    Douglas, who com<pb break="no" facs="nls:193100748" xml:id="kp-eb0703-0748-0399"/>manded the Scotish army in that action, enraged to
                    see his men falling thick around him by showers of arrows, and trusting to the
                    goodness of his armour, which had been three years in making, accompanied by
                    about 80 lords, knights, and gentlemen, in complete armour, rushed forward and
                    attacked the English archers sword in hand. But he soon had reason to repent his
                    rashness. The English arrows were so sharp and strong, and discharged with so
                    much force, that no armour could repel them. The carl of Douglas, after
                    receiving five wounds, was made prisoner; and all his brave companions were
                    either killed or taken. Philip de Confines acknowledges, what our own writers
                    assert, that the English archers excelled those of every other nation; and Sir
                    John Fortescue says again and again, “that the might of the realme of England
                    standyth upon archers.” The superior dexterity of their archers, gave the
                    English a great advantage over their capital enemies the French and Scots. The
                    French depended chiefly on their men at arms, and the Scots on their pikemen;
                    but the ranks of both were often thinned and thrown into disorder by flights of
                    arrows before they could reach their enemies.</p><p>James I. of Scotland, who had seen and admired the dexterity of the English
                    archers, and who was himself an excellent archer, endeavoured to revive the
                    exercise of archery among his own subjects, by whom it had been too much
                    neglected. With this view he procured the following law to be made in his first
                    parliament, in 1424, immediately after his return to Scotland: “That all men
                    might busk thame to be archares fra the be 12 years of age; and that at ilk ten
                    punds worth of land thair be made bow markes, and speciallie near paroche kirks,
                    quhairn upon halie dayis men may cum, and at the leist schute thryse about, and
                    have usage of archarie; and whasa usis not archarie, the laird of the land sal
                    rais of him a wed-dcr; and gift' the laird raisis not the said pane, the king’s
                    shiref, or his ministers, sal rais it to the king.” But his death prevented the
                    effectual execution of this law.</p><p>There is not found any act of parliament of Henry V. in relation to archery, and
                    all the orders of Rymer till the battle of Agincourt relate to great guns, from
                    which he seems at finst to have expected more considerable advantage than from
                    the training of bowmen. It should seem, however, that this sort of artillery,
                    from its unwieldiness, bad and narrow roads, together with other defects, was as
                    yet but of little use in military operations. In the year 1417 this king
                    therefore ascribes his victory at Agincourt to the archers, and directs the
                    sheriffs of many counties to pluck from every goose six wing-fcathers for the
                    purpose of improving arrows, which are to be paid for by the king.</p><p>In 1421, though the French had been defeated both at Cressy, Poictiers, and
                    Agincourt, by the English archers, yet they still continued the use of the
                    cross-bow; for which reason Henry V., as duke of Normandy, confirms the charters
                    and privileges of the balistarii, who had been long established as a fraternity
                    in his city of Rouen.</p><p>In the fifth of Edward IV. an act passed, that every Englishman, and Irishman
                    dwelling with Englishmen, shall have an English bow of his own height, which is
                    directed to be made of yew, wych, hazel, ash, or awburne, or any other
                    reasonable tree, according to their power. The next chapter also directs that
                    butts shall be made in every township, which the inhabitants are obliged to
                    shoot up and down every feast day, under the penalty of a halfpenny when they
                    shall omit this exercise.</p><p>In the 14th year, however, of this same king, it appears by Rymers <hi rend="italic">Foedera,</hi> that 1000 archers were to be sent to the duke of
                    Burgundy, whose pay is settled at sixpence a day, which was a considerable sum
                    in those times, when the value of money was so much higher than it is at
                    present. This circumstance seems to prove very strongly the great estimation in
                    which archers were still held. In the same year Edward, preparing for a war with
                    France, directs the sheriffs to procure bows and arrows, “as most specially
                    requisite and necessary.”</p><p>On the war taking place with Scotland, eight years after this, Edward provides
                    both ordnance and archers; so that though the use of <hi rend="italic">artillery,</hi> as we now term it, was then gaining ground, yet that of the bow
                    and arrow was not neglected.</p><p>Richard HL, by his attention to archery, was able to send 1000 bowmen to the duke
                    of Bretagne; and he availed himself of the same troops at the battle of
                    Bosworth.</p><p>During the reign of Henry VII., however, there appears no order relative to
                    gunpowder or artillery; while, on the other hand, in 1488, he directs a large
                    levy of archers to be sent to Brittany, and 'that they shall be reviewed before
                    they embark. In the 19th year of his reign, the same king forbids the use of the
                    cross-bow, because “the long-bow had been much used in this realm, whereby
                    honour and victory had been gotten against outward enemies, the realm greatly
                    defended, and much more the dread of all Christian princes, by reason of the
                    same.”</p><p>During the rcign of Henry VIII. several statutes were made for the promotion of
                    archery. The 8th Eliz. c. 10, regulates the price of bows; and the 13th Eliz. c.
                    14, enacts that bow-staves shall be brought into the realm from the Hans Towns
                    and the eastward; so that archery still continued to be an object of attention
                    in the legislature.</p><p>In Rymer’s <hi rend="italic">Fcedera</hi> there is neither statute nor
                    proclamation of James I. on this head; but it appears, by Dr Birch’s life of his
                    son (Prince Henry), that at eight years of age he learned to shoot both with the
                    bow and gun, while at the same time this prince had in his establishment an
                    officer who was styled <hi rend="italic">bow-bearer.</hi> The king granted a
                    second charter to the Artillery Company, by which the powers they had received
                    from Henry VIII. were considerably extended.</p><p>Charles I. appears, from the dedication of a treatise entitled <hi rend="italic">The Bowmans Glory,</hi> to have been himself an archer; and in the eighth year
                    of his reign he issued a commission to the chancellor, lord mayor, and several
                    of the privy council, to prevent the fields near London being so inclosed as to
                    “interrupt the necessary and profitable exercise of shooting ;” as also to lower
                    the mounds where they prevented the view from one mark to another.</p><p>Catharine of Portugal, queen to Charles IL, seems to have been much pleased with
                    the sight at least of this exercise; for in 1676, by the contributions of Sir
                    Edward Hungerford and others, a silver badge for the marshal of the fraternity
                    was made, weighing 25 ounces, and representing an archer drawing the long-bow
                    (in the proper manner) to his ear, with the following inscription: <hi rend="italic">íłe-gince Catharince Sagittarii.</hi> The supporters are two
                    bowmen, with the arms of England and Portugal. In 1682 there was a most
                    magnificent cavalcade and entertainment given by the Finsbury archers, when they
                    bestowed the titles of“Duke of Shoreditch,” “Marquis of Islington,” &amp;c. upon
                    the most deserving. Charles II. was present upon this occasion.</p><p>So late as the year 1753 targets were erected in the Finsbury fields during the
                    Easter and Whitsun holydays, when the best shooter was styled captain for the
                    ensuing year, and the second lieutenant.</p><p>Before the introduction of fire-arms the enemy could only be struck at a distance
                    by slings, the bow used by the ancients, or the cross-bow; to all which the
                    English long-bow was infinitely superior. As for slings, they never have been
                    used in the more northern parts of Europe<pb break="no" facs="nls:193100761" xml:id="kp-eb0703-0761-0400"/> by armies in
                    the field; nor does their use indeed seem to have been at all convenient or
                    extensively practicable, for two principal reasons: in the first place, slingers
                    cannot advance in a compact body, on account of the space to be occupied by this
                    weapon in its rotatory motion; in the next place, the weight of the stones to be
                    carried must necessarily impede the slingers greatly in their movements. The bow
                    of the ancients, again, as represented in all their reliefs, was a mere toy
                    compared with that of our ancestors; it was therefore chiefly used by the
                    Parthians, whose attacks, like those of the present Arabs, were desultory. As
                    for the cross-bow, it is of a most inconvenient form for carriage, even with the
                    modern improvements; and, in case of rain, could not easily be secured from the
                    weather. After the first shot, moreover, it could not be recharged under a
                    considerable time, whilst the bolts were also heavy and cumbersome. The English
                    long-bow, on the other hand, together with the quiver of arrows, was easily
                    carried by the archer, as easily secured from the rain, and recharged almost
                    instantaneously. It is not therefore extraordinary, that troops who solely used
                    this most effectual weapon should generally obtain the victory, even when
                    opposed to much more numerous armies.</p><p>It may be urged, that these losses having been experienced by our enemies, must
                    have induced them to practise the same mode of warfare. But it is thought that
                    the long-bow was not commonly used even in England till the time of Edward HL,
                    when the victory at Cressy sufficiently proclaimed the superiority of that
                    weapon. It required, however, so much training before the archer could be
                    expert, that we must not be surprised if, soon afterwards, this military
                    exercise was much neglected, as appears by the preambles of several ancient
                    statutes. While the military tenures subsisted, the sovereign could only call
                    upon his tenants during war, who therefore attended with the weapons they had
                    been used to, and which required no previous practice. On the other hand, the
                    English archers were obliged by acts of parliament, even in time of peace, to
                    erect butts in every parish, and to shoot on every Sunday and holyday, after
                    repairing perhaps to these butts from a considerable distance; while the expense
                    of at least a yew bow is represented as being a charge to which they were
                    scarcely equal. The kings and parliaments of this country having thus compelled
                    the inhabitants to such training, the English armies had, it should seem, the
                    same advantage over their enemies as the exclusive use of fire-arms would give
                    us at present.</p><p>It appears, also, by what has been already stated, that the long-bow continued to
                    be in estimation for more than two centuries after gunpowder was introduced,
                    which probably arose from muskets being very cumbersome and unwieldy. It is well
                    known that rapid movements are generally decisive of the campaign; and for such
                    the archers were particularly adapted, because, as they could not be annoyed at
                    the same distance by the weapons of the enemy, they had scarcely any occasion
                    for armour. The flower of ancient armies likewise was the cavalry, against which
                    the long-bow never failed to prevail; and hence the great number of French
                    nobility who were prisoners at Cressy, Poictiers, and Agincourt; for being
                    dismount- ed, if not wounded, whilst they were also clad in heavy armour, they
                    could not make their escape. The same reason accounts for the English obtaining
                    these signal victories with so inferior numbers; for the nobility and gentry
                    thus becoming prisoners, the other parts of the French army made little or no
                    resistance. No wonder, therefore, that in England the greatest anxiety was shown
                    to promote the exercise of this most important weapon, and that so many statutes
                    were made for that purpose.</p><p>In Scotland, also, little less attention, though apparently not with equal
                    success, was shown to the encouragement of the art. In both kingdoms it was
                    provided that the importers of merchandise should be obliged, alono∙ with their
                    articles of commerce, to import a certain proportion of bows, bow-staves, and
                    shafts for arrows. J <hi rend="subscript"> n</hi> both every person was enjoined
                    to hold himself provided in bows and arrows, and was prescribed the frequent ∏
                    <hi rend="subscript"> se</hi> of archery. In both a restraint was imposed upon
                    the exercise of other games and sports, lest they should interfere with the use
                    of the bow; for it was intended that people should be made expert in the use of
                    it as a military weapon, by habituating them to the familiar exercise of it as
                    an instrument of amusement. As there was no material difference between the
                    activity and bodily strength of the two people, it might be supposed that the
                    English and Scots wielded the bow with no unequal vigour and dexterity; but,
                    from undoubted historical monuments, it appears that the former had the
                    superiority, of which one instance has been already narrated. By the regulations
                    prescribed in their statute-book for the practice of archery, we find that the
                    English shot a very long bow, those who were arrived at their full growth and
                    maturity being prohibited from shooting at any∙mark that was not distant upwards
                    of 220 yards.</p><p>In the use of the bow, great dexterity as well as strength seems to have been
                    requisite. Though we hear of arrows at Chevy Chase which were a yard long, yet
                    it is by no means to be supposed that the whole band made use of such, or could
                    draw them to the head. The regulation of the Irish statute of Edward IV., viz.
                    that the bow should not exceed the height of the man, is allowed by archers to
                    have been well considered; and as the arrow’ should be half the length of the
                    bow, this would give an arrow of a yard in length to those only who were six
                    feet high. A strong man of this size in the present times cannot easily draw
                    above 27 inches, if the bow is of a proper strength to do execution at a
                    considerable distance. At the same time it must be admitted, that as our
                    ancestors were obliged by some of the old statutes to begin shooting with the
                    long-bow at the age of seven, they might have acquired a greater sleight in this
                    exercise than their descendants, though the latter should be allowed to be of
                    equal strength.</p><p>, As the shooting with the long-bow was first introduced in England, and
                    practised almost exclusively for nearly two centuries, so it has occasioned a
                    peculiar method of drawing the arrow to the ear and not to the breast. That this
                    is contrary to the usage of the ancients is very clear from their reliefs, and
                    from the tradition of the Amazons cutting off one of their paps, as it
                    occasioned an impediment to their shooting. The Finsbury archer is therefore
                    represented in this attitude of drawing to the ear, both in the <hi rend="italic">Bowman’s Glory</hi> and in the silver badge given by Catharine to
                    the Artillery Company.</p><p>As to the distance to which an arrow can be shot from a long-bow with the best
                    elevation of 45 degrees, that must necessarily depend much both upon the
                    strength and sleight of the archer; but in general the distance was reckoned
                    from eleven to twelve score yards. The butts for exercise, as above noticed,
                    were directed to be distant upwards of 220 yards. There is indeed a tradition,
                    that an attorney of Wigan in Lancashire, named Leigh, shot a mile in three
                    flights; but the same tradition states that he placed himself in a very
                    particular attitude, which cannot be used commonly in this exercise. According
                    to Neade, an archer might shoot six arrows in the time of charging and
                    discharging one musket.</p><p>The archers consider an arrow of from 20 to 24 drop weight to be the best for
                    flight or hitting a mark at a considerable<pb break="no" facs="nls:193100774" xml:id="kp-eb0703-0774-0401"/> distance, and
                    that yew is the best material of which they can be made. As to the feathers,
                    that of a goose is preferred: it is also wished that the bird should be two or
                    three years old, and that the feather may drop of itself. Two out of three
                    feathers in an arrow are commonly white, being plucked from the gander; but the
                    bird is generally brown or gray, being taken from the goose, and, from this
                    difference in point of colour, informs the archer when the arrow is properly
                    placed. From this most distinguished part, therefore, the whole arrow sometimes
                    receives its name: and this, by the by, affords an explanation of the gray-goose
                    wing in the ballad of Chevy Chase. Arrows were armed anciently with flint or
                    metal heads, latterly with heads of iron: of these there were various forms and
                    denominations. By an act of parliament made the 7th of Henry IV. it was enacted,
                    That for the future all the heads for arrows and quarrels should be well boiled
                    or brased, and hardened at the points with steel; and that every arrow-head or
                    quarrel should have the mark of the maker: workmen disobeying this order were to
                    be fined and imprisoned at the king’s will, and the arrow-heads or quarrels to
                    be forfeited to the crown.</p><p>Arrows were reckoned by sheaves, a sheaf consisting of 24 arrows. They were
                    carried in a quiver, called also an <hi rend="italic">arrow-case,</hi> which
                    served for the magazine; arrows for immediate use were worn in the girdle. In
                    ancient times phials of quicklime, or rather combustible matter, for burning
                    houses or ships, were fixed on the heads of arrows, and shot from long-bows.
                    This has been also practised since the use of gunpowder. Neade says he has known
                    by experience that an archer may shoot an ounce of fireworks upon an arrow
                    twelve score yards. Arrows with wildfire, and arrows for fireworks, are
                    mentioned among the stores at Newhaven and Berwick in the 1st of Edward VI.</p><p>The force with which an arrow strikes an object at a moderate distance may be
                    conceived from the account given by King Edward VI. in his journal; wherein he
                    says, that 100 archers of his guard shot before him two arrows each, and
                    afterwards altogether; and that they shot at an inch board, which some pierced
                    quite through and struck into the other board; divers pierced it quite through
                    with the heads of their arrows, the board being well-seasoned timber: their
                    distance from the mark is not mentioned.</p><p>To protect our archers from the attacks of the enemy’s horse, they carried long
                    stakes pointed at both ends: these they planted in the earth, sloping before
                    them. In the first of Edward VI., 350 of these were in the stores of the town of
                    Berwick, under the article of archers’ stakes: there were also at the same time
                    eight bundles of archers’ stakes in Pontefract castle.</p><p>To prevent the bowstring from striking the left arm, the arm is covered with a
                    piece of smooth leather, fastened on the outside of the arm—this is called a <hi rend="italic">bracer</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and to guard the fingers from
                    being cut by the bowstring, archers wore shooting gloves. Chaucer, in his
                    prologue to the Canterbury Tales, thus describes an archer of his day:</p><lg part="N"><l part="N"> And he was cladde in cote and hode of grene. </l><l part="N"> A shefe of peacock arwes bright and kene </l><l part="N"> Under hie belt he bare ful thriftily. </l><l part="N"> Wel coude he dresse his takel yemanly: </l><l part="N"> His arwes drouped not with fetheres lowe. </l><l part="N"> And in his hond he bare a mighty bowe. </l><l part="N"> A not-hed hadde he, with a broune visage. </l><l part="N"> Of wood-craft coude he wel alle the usage. </l><l part="N"> Upon his arme he bare a gaie bracer, </l><l part="N"> And by his side a swerd and a bokeler, </l><l part="N"> And on that other side a gaie daggere, </l><l part="N"> Hameised wel, and sharpe as point of spere: </l><l part="N"> A Cristofre on his brest of silver shene. </l><l part="N"> An borne he bare, the baudrik was of grene. </l><l part="N"> A forster was he sothely as I gesse. </l></lg><p>Though archery continued to be encouraged by the king and legislature for more
                    than two centuries after the first knowledge of the effects of gunpowder, yet by
                    the latter end of the reign of Henry VIII. it seems to have been partly
                    considered as a pastime. Arthur, the elder brother of Henry, is said to have
                    been fond of this exercise, insomuch that a good shooter was styled Prince
                    Arthur. We are also informed that he pitched his tent at Mile-End in order to be
                    present at this recreation, and that Henry his brother also attended. When the
                    latter afterwards became king, he gave a prize at Windsor to those who should
                    excel in this exercise; and a capital shot having been made, Henry said to
                    Barlow (one of his guards), “If you still win, you shall be duke over all
                    archers.” Barlow therefore having succeeded, and living in Shoreditch, was
                    created duke thereof. Upon another occasion Henry and the queen were met by 200
                    archers on Shooter’s hill, which probably took its name from their assembling
                    near it to shoot at marks. This king likewise gave the first charter to the
                    Artillery Company, in the 29th year of his reign, by which they are permitted to
                    wear dresses of any colour except purple and scarlet—to shoot not only at marks,
                    but birds, if not pheasants or herons, and within two miles of the royal
                    palaces. They are also enjoined by the same charter not to wear furs of a
                    greater price than those of the marten. The most material privilege, however, is
                    that of indemnification for murder, if any person passing between the shooter
                    and the mark is killed, provided the archers have first called out <hi rend="italic">fast.</hi></p><p>The following description of an archer, his bow, and accoutrements, is given in a
                    MS. written in the time of Queen Elizabeth. “Captains and officers should be
                    skilful of that most noble weapon, and to see that their soldiers according to
                    their draught and strength have good bowes, well nocked, well strynged, every
                    strynge whippe in their nocke, and in the myddes rubbed with wax, braser and
                    shuting glove, some spare strynges trymed as aforesaid, every man one shefe of
                    arrows, with a case of leather defensible against the rayne, and in the same
                    fower and twentic arrowes, whereof eight of them should be lighter than the
                    residue, to gall or astoyne the enemye with the hailshot of light arrows, before
                    they shall come within the danger of the harquebuss shot. Let every man have a
                    brigandine, or a little cote of plate, a skull or hufkyn, a mawle of leade of
                    five foote in lengthe, and a pike, and the same hanging by his girdle, with a
                    hook and a dagger; being thus furnished, teach them by musters to marche,
                    shoote, and retire, keepinge their faces upon the enemy’s. Sumtyme put them into
                    great nowmbers, as to battell ap-parteyneth, and thus use them often times
                    practised, till they be perfecte; ffor those men in battel ne skirmish can not
                    be spared. None other weapon maye compare with the same noble weapon.”</p><p>The long-bow, as already observed, maintained its place in our armies long after
                    the invention of fire-arms; nor have there been wanting experienced soldiers who
                    were advocates for its continuance, and who in many cases even preferred it to
                    the harquebuss or musket. King Charles I. twice granted special commissions
                    under the great seal for enforcing the use of the long-bow. The first was in the
                    4th year of his reign; but this was revoked by proclamation four years
                    afterwards, on account of divers extortions and abuses committed under sanction
                    thereof. The second, anno 1633, in the ninth year of his reign, to William Neade
                    and his son, also named William, wherein the former is styled an ancient archer,
                    who had presented to the king a warlike invention for uniting the use of the
                    pike and bow, seen and approved by him and his council of war; whereof his
                    majesty had granted them <pb break="no" facs="nls:193100787" xml:id="kp-eb0703-0787-0402"/>a commission to teach and exercise his loving
                    subjects in the said invention, which he particularly recommended the chief
                    officers of his trained bands to learn and practise; and the justices and other
                    chief magistrates throughout England are therein enjoined to use every means in
                    their power to assist Neade, his son, and all persons authorized by them, in the
                    furtherance, propagation, and practice of this useful invention. Both the
                    commissions and proclamation are printed at large in Rymer. At the breaking out
                    of the civil war, the earl of Essex issued a precept, dated in November 1643,
                    for stirring up all well-affected people towards the raising of a company of
                    archers for the service of the king and parliament.</p><p>There are several societies of archers in England; but the most noted society of
                    this kind now existing is <hi rend="italic">The Royal Company of Archers, the
                    Kings Body Guard for Scotland.</hi> The ancient records of this company having
                    been destroyed by fire about the end of the 16th century, no authentic traces of
                    its institution now remain; but, from entries found in some of the old national
                    records, this company must be of great antiquity. It is believed that the Royal
                    Company owes its origin to the commissioners appointed in the reign of James I.
                    of Scotland for enforcing and overseeing the exercise of archery in different
                    counties. These commissioners, who were men of rank and power, picked out from
                    among the better classes under their cognizance, the most expert bowmen, formed
                    them into a company, and upon perilous occasions they attended the king as his
                    chief body guard; and in that situation they always distinguished themselves for
                    their loyalty, courage, and skill in archery. The rank of King’s Body Guard for
                    Scotland was from tradition understood to be vested in the Royal Company, and
                    they accordingly claimed the honour of acting as body guard to his majesty King
                    George IV. on the occasion of his visit to Scotland in 1822. His majesty was
                    graciously pleased to recognise their claim, and the Royal Company were thus
                    established as the King’s Body Guard for Scotland. They attended his majesty at
                    court and on all state occasions during his residence in Scotland, and
                    accompanied him on his visit to Hopetoun House, from whence he embarked for
                    London. The captaingeneral has since been appointed gold stick for Scotland, and
                    the Royal Company now forms part of the household.</p><p>It appears from the minutes of the Royal Company now extant, that an act of the
                    privy council of Scotland was passed in 1677, conferring on thcm the name and
                    title of “His Majesty’s Company of Archers,” and granting a sum of money for a
                    piece of plate to be shot for in that year as a prize; but no <hi rend="italic">permanent</hi> king’s prize was established until 1788, when his majesty George
                    HL, as a mark of his royal patronage and favour, was pleased to grant a sum of
                    money to be shot for annually, to be named the king’s prize, and to become the
                    property of the winner. The gainer is bound to purchase a piece of plate, on
                    which must be inscribed the king’s arms, and the date when the prize was
                    gained.</p><p>During the revolution in 1688 the Royal Company were opposed to the principles
                    then espoused; and for many years they had to forego their public parades, and
                    the company in consequence had nearly been annihilated. On the accession of
                    Queen Anne, however, their former splendour was revived; and in the year 1703 a
                    royal charter was granted, confirming all their former rights and privileges,
                    and conferring others upon them.</p><p>Thus the Royal Company continued to flourish for a number of years; but their
                    attachment to the family of Stuart was the cause at various times of a temporary
                    prosperity and decline. These unhappy differences having long since terminated,
                    the Royal Company, which consists of the principal nobility and gentry of
                    Scotland, are now more prosperous, and perhaps more dexterous in the art of
                    archery, than at any former period in their history</p><p>The prizes belonging to this Royal Company, and which are annually shot for, are,
                    Isŕ, A silver arrow, given by the town of Musselburgh, which appears to have
                    been shot for as early as the year 1603. The victor in this, as in the other
                    prizes, except the king’s prize, has the custody of it for a year, then returns
                    it with a medal appended, on which are engraved any motto and device which the
                    gainer’s fancy dictates. 2&lt;∕, A silver arrow, given by the town of Peebles
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">a. d.</hi> 1626. 3&lt;√, A silver arrow, given by the city
                    of Edinburgh <hi rend="smallcaps">a. d.</hi> 1709. 4<hi rend="italic">th,</hi> A
                    silver arrow given by the town of Selkirk, which was shot for in 1819 after an
                    interval of 144 years, 5<hi rend="italic">th,</hi> A silver punch bowl made of
                    Scotish silver, at the expense of the company, <hi rend="smallcaps">a. d.</hi>
                    1720, to which a gold medal has annually been attached. This prize can only be
                    gained by three consecutive ends; and if not won during the summer, it is shot
                    for as an ordinary prize at the end of the season, 6<hi rend="italic">th,</hi> A
                    gold medal, made of pagodas, being part of the money paid by Tippoo Sultan at
                    the treaty of Seringapatam, and presented to the Royal Company by Major James
                    Spens. 7t’/í, An elegant silver vase and gold medal, presented by General John
                    Earl of Hopetoun, in commemoration of the visit of George IV. to Scotland in
                    1822, called the royal commemoration prize, and which is shot for on the king’s
                    birth-day annually. These prizes are all shot for at the distance of 180 yards.
                    There is another prize, which was given by Sir George Mackenzie of Coul, Bart.,
                    to the Royal Company, to be shot for at the distance of 200 yards, and is called
                    the “Saint Andrew prize.” These prizes are shot for at rovers, and, with the
                    exception of the silver bowl, are gained by the person who counts the greatest
                    number of points in a given number of ends.</p><p>Besides the above, there is another prize shot for, at the distance of 100 yards,
                    being an elegant silver bugle-horn, presented to the Royal Company by one of the
                    general officers, Sir Henry Jardine, Knt., and was shot for on 9th April 1830
                    for the first time.</p><p>There are also two prizes contended for at butts, or point blank distance, being
                    100 feet. The first is called the goose. The ancient manner of shooting for this
                    prize was, by building a living goose in a turf-butt, having the head only
                    exposed to view; and the archer who first hit the head was entitled to have the
                    goose as his reward, and bore the title of Captain Goose for the season. This
                    barbarous custom has long since been laid aside; and in place of the goose’s
                    head a small glass globe is put into the butt, of about an inch in diameter, and
                    the archer who breaks this is declared victor, and is entertained by the company
                    at dinner. He wears a medal which was presented by Major Spens, also made of
                    Tippoo Sultan s pagodas. The other butt prize is a gold medal, which is shot for
                    on the last Saturday of January, February, and March, annually, and is gained by
                    him who counts the greatest number of points in the three days shooting.</p><p>The affairs of the Royal Company are managed by a council, consisting of seven,
                    who are chosen annually at a general meeting of the members. The council are
                    vested with the power of receiving or rejecting candidates for admission, and of
                    appointing the officers of the company» civil and military.</p><p>The Royal Company consists of about 500 members. There are weekly meetings of
                    members at Edinburgh, in the Meadow⅛ when they exercise themselves in shooting
                    at butts and rovers; and in the adjoining ground they have a handsome building
                    called Archer’s Hall, erected within these 50 years, where they dine, and hold
                    their elections and other meetings relative to the business of the company.</p><pb break="no" facs="nls:193100800" xml:id="kp-eb0703-0800-0403"/><p>The field uniform of the Royal Company is of dark-green cloth, faced with black
                    braiding, with a narrow stripe of crimson velvet in the centre. The hat is of
                    the same colour, with a handsome medallion in front, and a plume of black
                    feathers.</p><p>The Royal Company have two standards, which are very old. The first of these
                    bears on one side Mars and Venus, encircled in a wreath of thistles, with this
                    motto, “In peace and war.” On the other side a yew-tree, with two men dressed
                    and equipped as archers, encircled as the former; motto, “Dat gloria vires.” The
                    other standard displays on one side a lion rampant, gules on a field or,
                    encircled with a wreath; on the top a thistle and crown; motto, “Nemo me impuno
                    lacessit.” On the reverse side St Andrew on the Cross, on a field argent; at the
                    top a crown; motto, “Dulce pro patria periculum.”</p><p>His present majesty King William IV. has presented the Royal Company of Archers,
                    his Body Guard for Scotland, with new colours. The one combines bnth the old
                    ones, with die words, “the Royal Company of Archers ;” and the other bears the
                    Royal Arms of Scotland, with the words, “King’s Body Guard for Scotland.” His
                    majesty has also expressly confirmed the appointment of the Royal Company to be
                    “the King’s Body Guard for Scotland.”</p></div></body></text></TEI>
