                    significant corrections to the OCR text, predominantly in cases of confusing "c"
                    and "e." Isolates 90 entries that were mistakenly included at the end of prior
                    entries in v1 and v2. Normalizes ordinal numbers. Separates metadata in
                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">All</hi> the plants which collectively form the vegetable
                    kingdom have been arranged under two great divisions. Those which possess
                    visible organs of reproduction, as stamens and pistils, have been termed <hi
                    rend="italic">phoenogamous,</hi> and constitute the first 23 classes in the
                    sexual system of Linnaeus; while those in which the reproductive organs are
                    either obscure or have not yet been discovered, have been termed <hi
                    rend="italic">cryptogamous,</hi> and form the 24th class of that system.
                    Humboldt estimates the total number of known species at 44,000; of which 38,000
                    belong to the former division, and 6000 to the latter. Μ. Brogniart, jun.
                    supposes the present known Flora to embrace 50,350 species, of which 10,200 may
                    be considered as cryptogamous, and 40,150 species as belonging to the
                    phaenogamous division. On the present occasion we propose to describe the
                    structure of those plants only which are included in the division of
                    phaenogamous plants.</p>
                <p>Of the vast number of plants which cover the surface of our globe, it belongs to
                    the botanist to describe the external forms in such manner as may serve to
                    discriminate species, and assign to each its place in a methodical system of
                    arrangement: it is the province of the anatomist to demonstrate, by dissection,
                    their internal structure, so as to prepare the way for a rational explanation of
                    their functions. In pursuing this object we may examine successively each of the
                    parts as they severally present themselves to view; or we may, in the first
                    place, study the elementary organs common to all plants, and then consider how
                    their combinations form the different parts of vegetables. The former method is
                    the <hi rend="italic">analytic,</hi> and was necessarily that of the first
                    observers; but, now that all the different parts are recognised as being formed
                    out of the same elementary organs, we gain, both in conciseness and clearness,
                    by adopting the latter or <hi rend="italic">synthetic</hi> mode.</p>
                <p>We shall accordingly describe, first, the elementary organs, and the primary
                    textures which they form; and proceed afterwards to the consideration of the
                    individual members and more complex organs of the plant. These elementary organs
                    have been denominated vessels and cells; and they form, either singly or
                    conjointly, what are called the vascular system and cellular tissue of plants.
                    Their combination gives rise to certain textures, which appear in the well-known
                    forms of skin, of bark, and of wood. On these we shall bestow the appellation of
                    common textures, and exhibit a general view of their structure and disposition
                    in the several parts of the vegetable body. A brief description of some minuter
                    parts, as of hairs and glands, will terminate this division of the subject.</p>
                <p>In the second part we shall begin with a description of the general structure of
                    <hi rend="italic">seeds,</hi> and afterwards treat more particularly of those
                    bodies under the two great divisions of <hi rend="italic">monocotyledonous</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">dicoyledonous</hi> seeds, tracing also the changes of form
                    and of structure which they exhibit in their evolution and progress to the state
                    of the mature plant. The structure of the <hi rend="italic">mature plant</hi>
                    itself will next claim our attention; and we shall accordingly exhibit the
                    anatomy of its several members, as of the <hi rend="italic">trunk,</hi> the <hi
                    rend="italic">branch,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">root,</hi> in their more
                    remarkable varieties and forms. After this, the structure of the organs that
                    spring from these several members, as <hi rend="italic">buds</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">bulbs, leaves, flowers,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">fruits,</hi>
                    will be separately and distinctly examined; and having thus followed the
                    progressive changes of form and of structure exhibited in the-several stages of
                    vegetable existence, we shall terminate our descriptions by anatomical
                    representations of the organs in which the seed was produced, and the series of
                    appearances successively displayed in its formation.</p>
                <p>Through the whole of the descriptive detail we shall adhere as closely as we can
                    to the language of demonstration; supporting and illustrating our
                    representations of structure by continual reference to figures, selected in
                    great part from authors of repute, and in some instances from dissections made
                    by ourselves. We are aware, that of many reputed anatomical facts very different
                    representations have been given, all equally professing to rest on microscopical
                    observation. In such circumstances, we can do no more than report concisely the
                    statements of different observers; but shall dwell chiefly on those descriptions
                    and representations which seem best entitled to credit, and appear most
                    conformable to the analogies of other organized structures.</p>
                <p>When we consider the immense number of species that compose the vegetable
                    kingdom, and call to mind that in form, in size, and in structure, each species
                    differs from every other through every period of its existence, it must appear
                    altogether impracticable to describe and delineate any considerable number.
                    Fortunately, however, these diversities arise not from differences in the
                    elementary organs, but chiefly from their varied proportion, disposition, and
                    texture. In numerous species the disposition of the internal organs is very
                    similar, where the external form and texture widely differ. In other instances
                    the arrangement and composition of the internal parts vary not less than that of
                    the external figure. Of these varieties we shall exhibit different examples.</p>
                <p>In describing individual parts or organs, we might have brought many concurring
                    examples, and exhibited many similar representations, to confirm the views of
                    structure under consideration; but, in general, we have dwelt only on one or two
                    examples, and these we have selected from plants which are either important in
                    themselves, or whose structure has been most satisfactorily displayed, or which
                    seemed to afford the best illustration of the peculiarities we were engaged in
                    describing. From one example clearly given, the reader will readily apprehend
                    the nature of analogous structures, and escape the perplexity and fatigue which
                    unnecessary repetitions might occasion.</p>
                <p>Instead, also, of describing the vegetable at one or two stationary points of its
                    existence, in some of which its size is so minute as to be scarcely capable of
                    demonstration, we have followed it through the several stages of its growth. In
                    this way we really study it as a living body, continually exerting its
                    vegetative powers, and daily exhibiting the most striking variations in external
                    form, and frequently in internal structure. We hope thus to have conferred an
                    interest on the descriptive part, which may in some measure relieve the
                    unavoidable dryness of anatomical details; to have exhibited, in some instances,
                    clearer views of vegetable organization; and to have given a continuity to the
                    subject which isolated dissections, at a few stated periods, could not alone
                    have bestowed.</p>
                <p>It remains only to add a few remarks on the nomenclature employed in the present
                    article.</p>
                <p>In the description of external parts we have adhered chiefly to the Linnaean
                    nomenclature; but some of the terms employed by Linnaeus, in relation to
                    anatomical structure, are exceedingly vague and inappropriate; others <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193096107" xml:id="kp-eb0703-6107-0042"/> are manifestly
                    erroneous, and, however well suited to the purposes of botany, are not at all to
                    be tolerated in any thing that aspires to correct anatomical description.</p>
                <p>In the anatomy of seeds we have adopted many of the terms employed by Gaertner,
                    in his excellent work <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Fructibus et
                    Seminibus</hi><hi rend="italic">Plantarum,</hi> most of which had previously
                    been used by Malpighi and Grew.</p>
                <p>Thus, in every instance, we have exercised our own judgment in the selection of
                    terms, and, where it seemed necessary, have subjoined the synonyms of different
                    writers. Though we presume not to say that we have uniformly chosen the best, we
                    trust they will always clearly express the idea we designed to convey; and that,
                    in general, they have been used in one and the same sense, and in no other.
                    Except in one or two trivial instances, we have not ventured to introduce new
                    terms, but have studiously sought to avoid it, retaining even an inappropriate
                    expression, sanctioned by use, if it did not, at the same time, lead to
                    ambiguity, or convey an idea evidently false; and we have in general resisted
                    that torrent of new and barbarous terms, founded often on fancied refinements
                    and pretended discoveries, with which several continental writers have of late
                    attempted to deluge this branch of science.</p>
                <p>PART I.</p>
                <p>OF THE ANATOMY IN GENERAL OF THE ELEMENTARY ORGANS AND COMMON TEXTURES OF
                    VEGETABLES.</p>
                <p>CHAP. I.</p>
                <p>OF THE ELEMENTARY ORGANS.</p>
                <p>Before we proceed to describe the structure of the individual parts of
                    vegetables, it may be useful to exhibit a general view of the elementary organs
                    of which they seem to be composed. Such a view will prepare the reader for
                    understanding more clearly the descriptive language hereafter to be employed,
                    and will even much abridge the extent to which that description must otherwise
                    be carried.</p>
                <p>Every one is familiar with the natural division of plants into herbs and trees,
                    and is aware that, how different soever they may appear in form and texture,
                    they all possess, in common, certain parts or members which we name the root,
                    the trunk, and the branches, from which proceed the leaves, the flowers, the
                    fruits, and seeds. Infinitely varied as these several parts are, in figure,
                    size, and texture, they all originate from a few constituent or elementary
                    organs, whose situation, proportions, and combination, give rise to all the
                    diversity that we see. “Upon the anatomical analysis of all the parts of a
                    plant,” says Grew, “I have certainly found, that in all plants there are two,
                    and only two, organical parts essentially distinct, viz. the pithy part and the
                    ligneous part.” <hi rend="italic">(Anatomy of Plants,</hi> p. 19.) “And as every
                    part hath two, so the whole vegetable, taken together,” he adds, “is a
                    composition of two only, and no more. All properly woody parts, strings, and
                    fibres, are one body; all simple barks, piths, parenchymas, and pulps, and, as
                    to their substantial nature, peels and skins, are all likewise but one body; the
                    several parts of a vegetable differing from each other only by the various
                    proportions and mixtures, and variated pores and structure, of these two
                    bodies.” <hi rend="italic">(Ibid.</hi> p. 47.) In the anatomical descriptions of
                    Malpighi, the Compound structure is resolved, in like manner, into two
                    constituent parts, called by him the ligneous and utricular portions. To these
                    parts may be assigned the general appellations of the <hi rend="italic">Vascular
                    System</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Cellular Tissue</hi> of plants, the
                    description of which shall form the first subjects of consideration.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Section</hi> I.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Of the Vascular System.</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Art.</hi> I.—
                    <hi rend="italic">General Characters of the Vessels.</hi></p>
                <p>By the vascular system may be understood, in a general sense, all those parts of
                    a plant which .do not exhibit the form either of membrane or of cells. It
                    constitutes almost the entire bulk of the more solid parts of trees, and by Grew
                    and Malpighi was denominated the ligneous body, in contradistinction to the
                    cellular tissue which accompanies it, and which forms by far the largest portion
                    of many herbaceous plants. To common observation, a piece of dry wood appears to
                    be a mass of solid fibres, that is, a series of particles arranged in a filiform
                    figure, and destitute of any continuous canal. Thus Tournefort and others
                    considered the ligneous parts of a plant to be a mass of minute solid filaments,
                    placed parallel to each other, like the threads in a skein of silk, between the
                    interstices of which the sap ascended; but the anatomical researches of Grew
                    conducted him to a different conclusion. “If it be asked,” says he, “what all
                    that part of a plant, whether herb or tree, which is properly called the woody
                    part—what all that is? I suppose that it is nothing else but a cluster of
                    innumerable and most extraordinary small vessels or concave fibres.” <hi
                    rend="italic">(Anat. of Plants,</hi> p. 20.) Malpighi held similar opinions
                    concerning the vascularity of plants, which was farther attested by the
                    microscopical observations of Hooke and Lecuwenhoeck. Du Hamel, though he admits
                    that, under maceration, the parts of plants seem capable of indefinite
                    subdivision, yet, from many circumstances, avows his conviction of their
                    vascularity; and Hedwig maintains that the oldest and most compact plant is but
                    a congeries of vessels and cells, which have nothing of the character of a
                    fibrous solid, except in the thin membranous coats by which they are formed. <hi
                    rend="italic">(De Fibroe Vegetab. Ortu,</hi> p.17.)</p>
                <p>Few circumstances have contributed more to perplex and retard our knowledge of
                    the structure of plants, than the vague and erroneous nomenclature that has been
                    employed to designate their constituent organs, more particularly in relation to
                    the vascular system. Thus the several terms filaments, fibres, strings, threads,
                    and nerves, which, in their ordinary acceptation, are understood to express a
                    solid substance, have been constantly made use of in describing the tubes or
                    vessels of plants. The same organs, however, even by the same writers, are
                    frequently called tubular bodies, ligneous tubes, concave fibres, ducts, canals,
                    arteries, veins, and vessels. In our future descriptions we shall employ the
                    term vessel in a generic sense, to express all the diversity of names just
                    enumerated; and the different kinds or species of vessels we shall hereafter
                    attempt to discriminate by appropriate appellations.</p>
                <p>Vessels, as we have said, exist in almost every part of a plant. In the higher
                    orders of animals the fluids contained in the vessels are conveyed to a central
                    reservoir called the heart, from which they are again sent out to all parts of
                    the body. Near to this reservoir the ves- <pb break="no" facs="nls:193096120"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0703-6120-0043"/>'sels are few in number and large in size; and
                    they gradually lessen in size and increase in number as they recede from it. In
                    plants there is no such reservoir, but the fluids which enter by innumerable
                    mouths at the root are at once distributed equally through all parts of the
                    vegetable that are fitted to receive them. Hence in plants there is little
                    variation in the diameter of the vessels; and their general figure is therefore
                    cylindrical.</p>
                <p>From the extreme minuteness of the vessels, it is scarcely possible to compute
                    their number with accuracy. By driving off their fluids without destroying their
                    figure, as is done in the preparation of charcoal, Hooke numbered in a line,
                    ∙⅛th part of an inch long, not fewer than 150 vessels; therefore, in a line an
                    inch long, there must be 2700, and in a surface of a square inch, 7,290,000
                    vessels; “which would seem incredible,” says he, “were not every one left to
                    believe his own eyes.” These facts he verified by other observations on decayed
                    wood, in which the vessels were empty; and also on petrifactions of ligneous
                    bodies, in which the places of the vessels were very conspicuous. In very close
                    and dense wood, as that of guaiacum, the vessels were still more minute than in
                    the examples just quoted. <hi rend="italic">(JWicrographia,</hi> p. 101, 108.)
                    In a piece of oak of the size of about ⅛th part of a square inch, Lecuwenhoeck
                    reckoned 20,000 vessels; so that in an oak-tree of no more than one foot in
                    circumference, or about four inches in diameter, there will be found, according
                    to his computation, 200,000,000 of such vessels. <hi rend="italic">(Select

                    Hedwig <hi rend="italic">(De Vegetab. Ortu,</hi> p. 26) in the stem of the gourd
                    appeared through his microscope about Ath of an inch in diameter; and as his
                    instrument magnified 290 times, the true diameter must be reckoned the 3480th
                    part of an inch, which would give for the square inch 12,110,400 vessels. In
                    certain plants, however, the vessels are large enough to be discerned by the
                    naked eye, and in some cases they acquire a large size.</p>
                <p>The vessels of plants do not, like those of animais, exist single, but are
                    collected into fasciculi or bundles, which, however, have often the appearance
                    of single vessels. In the stems of herbs, and in roots, Grew discovered each
                    small fasciculus to be composed of from 30 to 100, or sometimes many hundred
                    vessels. <hi rend="italic">(Anatomy of Plants,</hi> p. 20.) The direction of
                    these fasciculi in the trunk is generally perpendicular, but in other parts
                    their course is often oblique, and in their smaller ramifications they produce
                    all sorts of figures. In herbs the fasciculi are more or less numerous, and
                    placed often at considerable distances from each other, exhibiting the
                    appearance of small columns dispersed through the cellular tissue: in other
                    instances they are much more numerous, but destitute of any symmetrical
                    arrangement; while, in trees, they are disposed regularly around the axis,
                    presenting in their transverse section the well-known appearance of concentric
                    circles in the wood.</p>
                <p>In some parts, where the fasciculi stand at a distance from each other, some
                    vessels often quit one parcel to unite with another, and return afterwards to
                    that which they had previously left. In this manner they are said to ramify, and
                    frequently, by their ramification, a reticulated appearance is produced, as
                    occurs especially in the bark and leaves. In the wood of the trunk, where they
                    stand collaterally in a perpendicular direction, they very seldom, if ever, run
                    into one another, but keep, says Grew, like so many several vessels, all along
                    distinct; as, by cutting, and so following any one fasciculus, may be observed.
                    <hi rend="italic">(Anatomy of Plants,</hi> p. 20.) In branches and roots, though
                    the direction of the fasciculi be changed, they seem only to break into smaller
                    parcels, and run side by side, never inosculating with each other, nor being
                    ramified, so as to be successively propagated one from another, as in the
                    vessels of animals. Neither, adds he, are they wound together like threads in a
                    rope, but are only contiguous or simply tangent, like the several cords in the
                    braces of a drum. <hi rend="italic">(Anatomy of Plants,</hi> p. 66.) Even in the
                    leaf, where the vessels seem to ramify out of greater into less, as in the
                    arteries of animals, yet, if the skin and pulp of the leaf be removed, and the
                    vessels laid bare, it will appear that they are all of the same size everywhere
                    in the leaf, and all continued through it, as distinct tubes, like the several
                    threads in a skein of silk. The distribution of the vessels is not effected,
                    therefore, by their ramifying out of greater into less, but by the division of a
                    greater fasciculus into several smaller fasciculi, till at last they come to be
                    single. <hi rend="italic">(Anatomy of Plants,</hi> p. 155.)</p>
                <p>It may be doubted whether, when the vessels of different fasciculi come into
                    contact, they ever actually unite and are lost in each other, forming that kind
                    of connection which is called inosculation or anastomosis. Grew strenuously
                    contends against any such connection of the vessels in any part of the plant.
                    “On a superficial view, indeed, the vessels of the leaf,” says he, “seem to be
                    inosculated, not only side to side, but the ends of some into the sides of
                    others: but neither is this ever really done, the lesser fasciculi being only so
                    far diducted as to stand at right angles with the greater; but they are never
                    inosculated, except end to end, or mouth to mouth, after they are come at last
                    to their final distribution.” <hi rend="italic">(Anatomy of Plants,</hi> p.
                    155.) Malpighi, however, from the fact of the alternate separation and
                    conjunction of the vessels, and from analogy with what occurs in the animal
                    system, speaks always of the anastomosis of the vessels, but he nowhere gives us
                    any thing like proof of the fact; and Du Hamel, from actual dissection of
                    several fasciculi, regards them in their union as resembling more the nerves
                    than the blood-vessels of animals. When, indeed, we consider the extraordinary
                    minuteness of the vessels, and the circumstance of their possessing nearly the
                    same size in every part, there is no room for that continual ramification out of
                    one into another, and consequent diminution of diameter, that occur in the
                    vessels of animals; and the immensity of their number, together with the endless
                    separations and re-unions which their fasciculi make, seems calculated to fulfil
                    the purposes of less general distribution in the plant, which successive
                    division and perpetual anastomosis effect in the animal system.</p>
                <p>Another general circumstance in the vessels of plants is, that we do not discover
                    in them any structure which has the true nature and use of valves, similar to
                    what is met with in the veins and absorbent vessels of animals. Dr Hooke could
                    never observe in their canal any thing that had the appearance of valves. <hi
                    rend="italic">(AIicrographia,</hi> p. 116.) Did such a structure exist, the
                    absorption of nutrient matter from the lobes of the seed, and its conveyance, in
                    a backward course, to the embryo, could not, says Grew, have place; neither
                    could the root, as it often does, grow upward and downward both at once. <hi
                    rend="italic">(Anatomy of Plants.)</hi> If the piece of a root of elm-tree be
                    cut in autumn, the juices, says Du Hamel, are found to escape indifferently at
                    either end, as the one or the other is alternately held downward; a
                    circumstance, he observes, inconsistent with the opinion of Mariotte, who
                    maintained the existence of valves. <hi rend="italic">(Phys,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">des Arbres,</hi> tom. i. p. 56.) It is well known, also, that many
                    plants may be made to grow in an inverted position, so as to put forth leaves
                    and flowers from their roots; and large trees have been <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193096133" xml:id="kp-eb0703-6133-0044"/>nourished by juices received
                    through the extremities of their ingrafted branches, after all connection
                    between the earth and the roots had been cut off. In general, indeed, the
                    extreme minuteness of the vessels seems almost to preclude the possible
                    existence of valves in their canal; but in some instances, where the vessels in
                    aged trees have become enlarged, membranous productions have been found to
                    occupy their cavities, which some have alleged to perform the office of valves.
                    They occur, however, only at an advanced period of growth, and form no necessary
                    part of the structure of the vessel, and, instead of promoting, contribute only
                    to obstruct the course of the fluids.</p>
                <p>Thus far with regard to the general nature of the vessels of plants: let us next
                    discriminate their several species or kinds.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Art.</hi> II.— <hi rend="italic">Of the Common
                    Sap-Vessels.</hi></p>
                <p>To ascertain the kinds and situation of the vessels of plants, various means have
                    been employed. The plant has been dissected both in its dry and recent state;
                    the natural qualities and movements of its fluids have been observed; and its
                    vessels have been filled with coloured liquors, by causing it to vegetate in
                    them. By the combined use of these several means, many important particulars
                    have been ascertained; but it must be acknowledged that the question is still
                    beset with doubts and difficulties, and that, with relation to it, great
                    diversity of opinion continues to prevail. A concise statement of the facts
                    ascertained with respect to the movements of the vegetable fluids may perhaps
                    contribute to define the situation and kinds of the vessels that convey
                    them.</p>
                <p>It has been proved that, early in spring, before the leaves appear, a watery
                    fluid rises abundantly in the woody part of the trunk of trees, and continues
                    visibly to ascend to the very extremity of the branches, until the leaves are
                    developed, when, to appearance, it ceases to flow, and can no longer be
                    collected by perforating or tapping the tree. This fluid has been shown to
                    ascend through the wood, and to rise, in general, most abundantly through its
                    youngest or outmost circle; but in trees whose vessels have not been obstructed
                    from age or other causes, it rises through every circle to the very pith, and,
                    as far as can be judged, in all the vessels that compose those circles. At this
                    early period of vegetation no fluid is found in the bark, nor between it and the
                    wood, nor in the pith; but the vessels of the bark are perfectly dry. These
                    facts are deducible from observations on the natural flow of the fluids by Grew,
                    Du Hamel, Walker, and others; and are supported by various experiments of Μ. de
                    la Baisse, Bonnet, Reichel, and others, made by causing plants and parts of
                    plants to grow in coloured liquors, in which the vessels of the wood alone
                    became filled; but no tinge of colour was communicated to those of the bark. To
                    these vessels the several names of lymph-ducts, sap-vessels, ligneous tubes,
                    ascending and adducent vessels, have been applied: we shall in future denominate
                    them <hi rend="italic">sap-vessels.</hi></p>
                <p>The vessels which thus form the mass of wood have by some writers been
                    distributed into different kinds, and supposed to exercise very different
                    functions. At certain periods of vegetation they appear empty; and hence
                    Malpighi supposed two species of vessels to exist in the wood, one destined to
                    carry sap, and the other to convey air: to these latter, from their supposed
                    office, he gave the name of <hi rend="italic">tracheae,</hi> and from their
                    structure called them spiral vessels. (<hi rend="italic">Anatom. Plantar.
                    Idea,</hi> p. 3.) Grew also believed these empty tubes to be air-vessels, but
                    admitted that at certain seasons they carried sap. At an early period, however,
                    Ray maintained that the vessels thus supposed to convey air were truly
                    sap-vessels; and Du Hamel, in common with Grew, admitted that they carried sap
                    in spring. Hill considered them altogether as sap-vessels; and Reichel, Hedwig,
                    and others, by filling them with coloured fluids, proved that such was their
                    true office. On the other hand, no experiments, says Ludwig, have yet shown that
                    there exist in vegetables vessels destined to convey only air; and in this
                    opinion subsequent writers, with few exceptions, have acquiesced. It will,
                    however, be convenient to treat of their general nature and form under the
                    distinct appellations of <hi rend="italic">sapvessels</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >spiral vessels,</hi> by which they are commonly known.</p>
                <p>By Grew and Malpighi the common sap-vessels were regarded as entire tubes, having
                    no apertures but in&lt; the direction of their length. Grew represents a single
                    vessel as having the appearance exhibited in fig. 1, Plate XXXy∏L, the aperture
                    or canal of which is not visible unless highly magnified, as in fig. 2.
                    According to Malpighi&lt; these vessels send off numerous capillary filaments to
                    the] cellular tissue, so that the cells are surrounded by a plexus of vessels,
                    as is particularly seen in the pith of elder and some others; and these
                    ramifications, he adds, spring probably from the perpendicular vessels both in
                    the bark and wood. <hi rend="italic">(Anatom. Plantar,</hi> p. 29. Lugd. Bat.
                    1688.) These lateral ramifications were observed also by Lecuwenhoeck in a piece
                    of fir-wood newly felled. Of ∣ this wood he procured a longitudinal section, so
                    extremely thin that he could see distinctly the particles of fluid moving in the
                    vessels, as represented in the upper portion of fig. 3, Plate XXXVIII.; while
                    lower down, on many parts of these vessels, small points or dots were visible,
                    which he at length discovered to be round apertures; and as he did not see these
                    apertures in any other parts than those in which he had separated the horizontal
                    cellular tissue from the perpendicular vessels, he concluded that, at these
                    points, these two organs were connected. He farther separated two of the vessels
                    from the remainder, and through the microscope they appeared as in fig. 4; but
                    the “engraver,” he adds, “said that he could not possibly draw all the jagged
                    parts that he saw; and we both of us perceived, in the broken membrane or coat
                    of the tube, many excessively minute vessels, which, by reason of their
                    smallness, he was unable to express in the drawing.” <hi rend="italic">(Select
                    Works of Lceuwenhoeck,</hi> by Hoole, vol. i. p∙ <hi rend="superscript"> 12</hi>

                <p>It may however be said, that this communication between the vessels and cells is
                    maintained not by ramifications from the vessels, but through apertures or pores
                    in their sides; and, accordingly, many appearances have been remarked as
                    existing on the sides of the vessels, of which different authors have given very
                    different representations, and which some have regarded as pores. Thus, on the
                    vessels of the fir Malpighi observed certain dotted appearances, which he
                    describes as roundish tubercles, and which were so numerous that they appeared
                    to cover the vessels. On the vessels of the elm, the beech, and the willow,
                    Lecuwenhoeck saw similar particles, which resembled small globules. <hi
                    rend="italic">(SelectWorks,vo</hi> ∖ <hi rend="italic">.</hi> ii. p.I.) Dr Hill
                    describes the vessels of the alburnum, or newly formed wood of the willow, as
                    connected with each other by a flocculent interstitial matter. When, by long
                    maceration, this matter is detached, the vessels then exhibit a dotted
                    appearance; and, if examined by a highly magnifying power, these dots, according
                    to him, are so many oval swellings, and each has, as it were, a mouth. Through
                    these mouths, which he represents as innumerable, and <pb break="no"

                    vessels, he conceives the fluids to be discharged into the cellular tissue. <hi

                    XXXVΠI., is a representation of these vessels connected by flocculent matter,
                    with their extremities collapsed from the escape of their juices, and their
                    sides sprinkled with the little mouths which he mentions. These mouths, if they
                    exist at all, are probably not pores in the sides of the vessels, but the little
                    apertures seen by Lecuwenhoeck, and produced by the separation of the cellular
                    tissue while the parts are still young and tender. The same author, speaking of
                    the vessels of the mature wood of the pear, states them to be close canals, as
                    in fig. 6, with no lateral apertures in them.</p>

                    12, Plate XXXVIII. The first species, or porous tubes, according to this writer,
                    exist in every part of the plant where the sap moves with freedom. Their sides
                    are covered with small eminences or projections, in the centre of which is to be
                    found a small pore. <hi rend="italic">(Exposition</hi><hi rend="italic">de la

                    not as promiscuously placed, but as ranged in transverse lines (fig. 7); and
                    through them he conceives the fluids of the plant to percolate, not, however,
                    into the cells only, but out of one layer of tubes into another, in a lateral
                    direction. In this manner he conducts the fluids from the centre to the
                    circumference of the wood, and at length, by a route not so easily followed,
                    contrives to get them into the vessels of the bark, the sides of which he
                    declares to be perfectly entire, and alike destitute of pores and clefts. <hi
                    rend="italic">(Ibid.</hi> p. 297.)</p>
                <p>Several writers have sought to discover these alleged pores in the sides of the
                    vessels. With Malpighi, some regard the appearances observed not as pores, but
                    as elevations on the surface of the vessels; others, as particles contained
                    within them. Under a very highly magnifying power, Kieser thinks he has, in some
                    vessels, detected the existence of pores; while Μ. Dutrochet pronounces the same
                    objects to be corpuscles, filled with nervous matter; and De Candolle suggests
                    the probability of their being small glands, destined in some way to contribute
                    to the nutrition of the plant. These different opinions, formed on viewing the
                    same objects, sufficiently manifest the difficulty and uncertainty of
                    microscopical observations made with highly magnifying powers, as was long since
                    pointed out by Hooke, who first applied the microscope to the examination of the
                    structure of plants. “Of such minute objects,” says he, “there is much more
                    difficulty to discover the true shape by an instrument than by the naked eye;
                    the same object quite differing in one position to the light, from what it
                    really is and may be shown to be in another. In some objects,” he adds, “it is
                    exceedingly difficult to distinguish between a prominency and a depression,
                    between a shadow and a black stain, or a reflection and a whiteness in the
                    colour; and the transparency of most objects renders them yet more difficultthan
                    if they were opaque.” <hi rend="italic">(Micrographia,</hi> Preface.)</p>

                <p>Various as have been the opinions of writers respecting the <hi rend="italic"
                    >common</hi> sap-vessels of plants, they have differed yet more in their views
                    concerning the position, number, size, structure, and uses of those which have
                    been denominated <hi rend="italic">spiral.</hi> The common fathers of Vegetable
                    Anatomy, Grew and Malpighi, who at the same time, but in different countries,
                    prosecuted their inquiries without any knowledge of or communication with each
                    other, are nearly of one opinion on all the more important points in relation to
                    these vessels. Later writers have differed alike from them, and from each other,
                    on almost every point. As the subjectis of fundamental importance in the economy
                    of vegetables, we shall endeavour to set before the reader the leading facts and
                    opinions concerning it; to canvass their relative merits; and deduce from the
                    whole such conclusions as seem most nearly to approach the truth.</p>
                <p>Malpighi describes spiral vessels as existing in the ligneous parts of all
                    plants. He called them <hi rend="italic">spiral tubes,</hi> because, when
                    extended, they were resolved, not into separate rings, but into a single zone,
                    which might be drawn out to a great length. In general they form continuous
                    tubes, but are sometimes contracted at regular distances, so as to resemble
                    somewhat a series of oblong cells. One of these contracted spiral vessels, as
                    delineated by Malpighi, is represented in fig. 17, Plate XXXVΠI., at the
                    extremity of which the spiral filament is in part drawn out; and similar
                    appearances of the spiral structure are exhibited in figures 9 and 10, by
                    Mirbel. In herbs, according to Malpighi, these spiral vessels constantly
                    accompany the common sap-vessels, and are ensheathed by them; in shrubs, they
                    occur in every part of the wood, single or in clusters; and in trees, an
                    intermixture of spiral vessels with the common sap-vessels is observed in every
                    part of the wood. In the fir, they are found immediately beneath the bark, and
                    are so numerous as to constitute the chief bulk of the wood. They exist with the
                    sap-vessels in the petioles and ribs of the leaf, and likewise in the petals of
                    the flower. In the roots they are also met with, and in some roots are so
                    abundant, as to exceed in bulk all the other parts. They exist, he adds, in
                    every part of the plant except the bark; and are annually formed with the
                    alburnous vessels of trees. <hi rend="italic">(Anatom. Plantar,
                    passim.)</hi></p>
                <p>From the writings of Grew we collect also that spiral vessels exist in every part
                    of a plant except the bark. In the root they are numerous, of very various size,
                    and their bore is generally larger than that of the common sap-vessels. In the
                    trunks both of herbs and trees they are equally visible, and in position, size,
                    and number, subject to great variation. Sometimes they are collected into
                    fasciculi, at other times they are disposed in rays, and in other instances they
                    are arranged in a circular form: they stand sometimes next to the pith, in other
                    instances next to the bark, and in other cases again they alternate with the
                    common sap-vessels in every part of the wood. They have a more ample bore than
                    the common vessels, and vary in size to at least twenty different degrees. In
                    the leaf they always accompany the sap-vessels, and both in its petiole and ribs
                    are constantly surrounded or ensheathed by them. They have a similar position in
                    the petals of the flower, and in the vascular parts of the fruit. <hi
                    rend="italic">(Anatomy of Plants, passim.)</hi> Hence, then, it appears, from
                    the dissections of Malpighi and Grew, that, in every plant in which vessels are
                    to be seen, and almost in every part of it, spiral vessels abound; they exist,
                    however, only in the <hi rend="italic">ligneous portion,</hi> or that part in
                    which the sap <hi rend="italic">ascends,</hi> and are never to be found in the
                    bark.</p>
                <p>By Du Hamel, the spiral vessels, supposed to con-&lt; vey air, are described as
                    existing in the leaves and the <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> flowers, the
                    petals of which are almost wholly composed of them. In the herbaceous portion of
                    young branches <pb break="no" facs="nls:193096159" xml:id="kp-eb0703-6159-0046"
                    />they are also well seen; which portion afterwards becomes ligneous; so that it
                    cannot be doubted that they exist in the wood, though he could never discover
                    them but in young branches. <hi rend="italic">(Phys,</hi><hi rend="italic">des
                    Arbres,</hi> tom. i. p. 42.) If, however, all the empty vessels seen in a
                    transverse section of the wood be deemed air-vessels, and all air-vessels have a
                    spiral structure, then, says this author, they would, in many plants, form a
                    great part of the ligneous body. From these large vessels, however, he has seen,
                    in autumn, fluids to escape; so that they are not properly air-vessels, or, as
                    Grew observed, they sometimes carry sap. They are not to be found in the
                    bark.</p>
                <p>Under the common name of sap-vessels, Hill delineates all the varieties of
                    vessels that constitute the wood; they are largest in the outer circles, smaller
                    in the others; they contain, says he, in spring and at midsummer, a limpid
                    liquor; but at all other seasons they appear empty, and have therefore been
                    erroneously deemed air-vessels. He says nothing of their spiral construction;
                    but describes the vessels which form the chief mass of the wood as possessing
                    solid and firm coats, forming an arrangement of plain and simple tubes, as in
                    fig. 6, Plate XXXVIII., resembling those of the alburnum, except that they have
                    no mouths in their sides. <hi rend="italic">( On the Construction of
                    Timber,</hi> p. 8 and 19.)</p>
                <p>Μ. Reichel maintains the existence of spiral vessels in almost all parts of the
                    plant. By causing plants to vegetate in coloured fluids, he traced them from the
                    roots, through the trunk and branches, to the extremity of the leaves, and into
                    all parts of the flower,—as the calyx, the petals, the style, the stamens, and
                    the anthers. In fruits and in seeds, and in the radicle and plume of the latter,
                    they were equally apparent. The coloured liquors, as they rose, communicated a
                    tinge to the cellular tissue of the wood, as was previously observed by De la
                    Baisse; but no trace of colour was ever observed either in the bark or pith,
                    which therefore contain no spiral vesśels. He considered the spiral vessels as
                    the organs everywhere conveying nutrient matter to the plant, and as having no
                    title to the appellation of air-vessels. <hi rend="italic">(En-cyclop.</hi><hi

                    288.) Similar experiments of Hedwig and others confirm these facts as to the
                    general distribution of the spiral vessels, and their bearing to every part the
                    fluids absorbed by the roots.</p>
                <p>We have already enumerated the five different species of vessels which Mirbel
                    regards as constituting the woody part of plants. According to him, true spiral
                    Vessels (which he continues to denominate <hi rend="italic">tracheae)</hi> are
                    not to be found in the root, but only in the trunk and the parts which are
                    produced from it. Even in the trunk they are to be found only around the pith,
                    and never in the exterior ligneous layers. He admits that they exist in all soft
                    and succulent parts, and that coloured fluids rise in them as well as in the
                    other varieties of vessels; but they never are to be found either in the bark or
                    pith. <hi rend="italic">(Exposition</hi><hi rend="italic">de la Théorie</hi><hi

                <p>According to Μ. Kieser, spiral vessels are found in all the more perfect plants,
                    from the earliest period of their existence; and in all parts of them, except
                    the bark and pith. They vary much in size, and in aged plants are frequently
                    obstructed by a species of vesicle, which originates from the interior sides of
                    the vessels. According to him, nothing but air is found in their cavity, though,
                    in the wood of guaiacum, he has seen all the spiral vessels, in common with the
                    cellular tissue, completely filled with resinous matter. He does not know the
                    anatomical relation subsisting between the spiral vessels and the other organs;
                    but thinks it proved that no direct communication exists between them and the
                    cells. <hi rend="italic">(Mém. sur</hi><hi rend="italic">l’ Organisation des
                    Plantes,</hi> 1814, p. 116, 117.) Lastly, Μ. de Candolle admits the existence of
                    spiral vessels in the wood of the trunk, but not of the roots; and, with Kieser,
                    regards them as conveying only air. <hi rend="italic">( Organographie</hi><hi

                <p>From the combined observations of all the preceding writers, with the exception
                    of MM. Mirbel and de Candolle, we learn that spiral vessels exist not only in
                    every part of the trunk, but in the root, and in every other part of the plant
                    except the bark and the pith. From the actual presence of sap in these vessels
                    early in spring, and again in autumn, and from the entrance of coloured fluids
                    at all seasons, we also learn, that their true office is not to convey air, as
                    Malpighi and others formerly, and Kieser and others more recently, maintain; but
                    to carry sap. Are we therefore to regard them as a species distinct from the
                    common sap-vessels, or are both to be held merely as varieties of one common
                    kind? This question may receive some illustration from a little farther inquiry
                    into the formation and structure of the sap and spiral vessels.</p>

                    and Spiral Vessels.</hi></p>
                <p>Malpighi seems to have regarded the common sapvessels as being formed of a series
                    of small vesicles or cells, mutually opening into each other. <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Anat. Plantar.</hi> p. 28.) In this instance he appears either to have
                    mistaken a series of elongated cells for vessels, or to have conceived that the
                    contractions, occasionally formed in the vessels themselves, afforded evidence
                    of their having been constructed originally by cells. Grew, on the other hand,
                    considered these vessels to be composed of straight fibres, placed parallel to
                    each other, so as to form a cylindrical tube. <hi rend="italic">(Anat. of
                    Plants,</hi> p. 112.) Lecuwenhoeck held them to be composed of two fine
                    transparent coats, formed of other vessels excessively minute. <hi rend="italic"
                    >( Select Worhs,</hi> vol. i. p. 11.) And Du Hamel, by submitting thin layers of
                    wood to long maceration, obtained bundles of longitudinal fibres of extreme
                    minuteness, by which he considered the lymphatic vessels of the wood to be
                    formed. <hi rend="italic">(Phys,</hi><hi rend="italic">des Arbres,</hi> tome i.
                    p. 32.) Hill describes the alburnous vessels as being formed of the same
                    material as the cells, and to collapse when emptied of their fluids. In one
                    instance, where a strong light was made to penetrate the vessel, it appeared as
                    if composed of numerous cells; but on farther examination, these seeming
                    divisions altered their places, and were found to proceed from portions of
                    watery sap still retained in the vessel. This appearance, as he properly
                    observes, may be a very necessary lesson against hasty judgments. <hi

                <p>According to Μ. Mirbel, “the entire mass of the plant is nothing but cellular
                    tissue, the cells of which differ only in form and dimensions.” The cells and
                    vessels are thus considered to be formed out of one and the same membranous
                    tissue. In forming cells, this membrane is supposed to dilate in every
                    direction: in producing vessels, it increases only in length. <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Exposition</hi><hi rend="italic">de la Théorie</hi><hi rend="italic">de l’
                    Organisation</hi><hi rend="italic">Végétale?)</hi> The manner in which he
                    supposes the vessels to be formed out of the primitive membrane is very
                    fanciful; and he is probably right in thinking that “no one before himself had
                    formed a similar conception of vegetable organization.”</p>
                <p>Concerning the structure of the <hi rend="italic">spiral</hi> vessels, opinions
                    have varied still more than in relation to those just considered. Malpighi
                    describes them as composed of <pb break="no" facs="nls:193096172"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0703-6172-0047"/>-a thin pellucid plate, of a silvery colour,
                    somewhat broad, and which, being placed spirally, and united at its edges, '
                    constructs a tube. When this tube is drawn out, it does not ^separate into
                    distinct rings, but is resolved into a continuous spiral zone. At particular
                    places these vessels are sometimes contracted, so as to exhibit the appearance
                    of oblong cells opening into each other, as in fig. 17, Plate XXXVIII. In size
                    they greatly surpass the ordinary sapvessels; and their canal is then frequently
                    occupied by membranous vesicles, which nearly fill their cavity. <hi
                    rend="italic">(Anal. Plantar,</hi> p. 3-26.) These vesicles were also observed
                    by Lecuwenhoeck, and their appearance, in the transverse section of an enlarged
                    vessel, is represented in fig. 25.</p>
                <p>According to Grew, the thin plate that forms the spiral vessel is not flat, and,
                    instead of being single, consists of two or more round filaments or threads,
                    placed collaterally, but perfectly distinct. These component filaments he
                    regards as united by other smaller transverse filaments, and the thin plates
                    which they form by their connection constitute the spiral vessel,—“as if we
                    should imagine,” he adds, “a piece of fine narrow riband to be wound spirally,
                    and edge to edge, round a stick, and the stick being drawn out, the riband to be
                    left in the figure of a tube, answerable to a spiral vessel.” As, however, the
                    riband is composed of numerous threads, placed parallel to each other, so is the
                    plate that forms the spiral vessel; and it is according to the greater or less
                    delicacy of the vessel examined, and the manner of its dissection, that it
                    appears to be constituted either of a flat plate or a round filament. The
                    spiration of the filaments he considered to be made in the root from right to
                    left, and in the trunk from left to right. <hi rend="italic">(Anat. of
                    Plants,</hi> p. 73 and 117.)</p>
                <p>- The opinion of Du Hamel with respect to the construction of these vessels was
                    very similar to that of Grew, and he employed the same analogy of a riband ,
                    twisted round a stick to illustrate it. Hedwig gave a very different account of
                    them. He considered the spiral vessel to be composed of two distinct parts; one
                    a membranous canal conveying air, and the other a spiral tube rolled round it,
                    by which the fluids were conveyed. The spires of the tube, in some instances,
                    are represented as close; in others they are separated, and the intervening
                    portions of the membranous canal exhibit a dotted appearance. He considered all
                    the sap-vessels, from their first formation, to possess this compound structure,
                    and, by a series of changes, which he professes to describe, to be ultimately
                    transformed into the solid fibre of the wood. <hi rend="italic">(De. Fibrae
                    VegetaD. Ortu,</hi> p. 25.) Others, also, have believed the spiral vessel to be
                    formed of a membranous tube, but have denied that it conveyed air; and the
                    spiral tube of Hedwig they have regarded as a solid filament. From the different
                    appearances which they exhibit, MM. Treviranus and Bernhardi distinguish several
                    varieties of spiral vessels; as does also Μ. Kieser, whose account of these
                    vessels is not only the most elaborate, but that probably which approaches
                    nearest to truth. We shall therefore subjoin a brief abstract of his
                    observations on the structure of these vessels, and more particularly on the
                    series of <hi rend="italic">transformations</hi> which they seem to undergo.</p>
                <p>The construction of these vessels Μ. Kieser professes to have studied with the
                    greatest care, and to have established incontestably the following points.
                    Sometimes, says he, only one fibre, sometimes many, go to form the spire of a
                    vessel. These fibres are commonly round, sometimes a little flattened, and are
                    twisted spirally about an empty space, so as to form a tube. The spiral fibres
                    in young plants, and sometimes in mature ones, are in close contact; in other
                    instances they are separated, and the interstices are then occupied by a dotted
                    or punctuated membrane, as is very frequent in trees; or sometimes they are
                    connected by ramifications which proceed from the spiral fibres themselves. From
                    the minuteness of the spiral fibre, it is difficult to decide whether it is a
                    solid or tubular body, and often, from the same cause, to pronounce whether it
                    is round or flattened.. It is transparent, has considerable consistence and
                    tenacity, and in some plants appears to possess elasticity.</p>
                <p>The number of fibres that form the spire of a vessel is very various; sometimes,
                    as before remarked, there is only one, but more often several, which are twisted
                    in the same plane and the same direction. He has seen nine fibres thus united;
                    and when unrolled, the spires of the vessels then seem to form a kind of riband.
                    When many fibres are employed to form a spire, they always run parallel, and do
                    not cross; so that the side of the vessel has never more than the thickness of a
                    single fibre. At their first formation the fibres are not united; it is only in
                    more advanced age that they become united, either by ramifications from their
                    edges, or by a peculiar membrane. The direction of the fibre in twisting is
                    sometimes from right to left, and sometimes the contrary. The size also is very
                    various. In young plants it is very small, so that a millimetre comprises the
                    diameter of 2600 of these fibres; and in some instances they have little more
                    than half that size. In older vessels they have a larger size. Between the knots
                    of the trunk they are simple, and do not ramify; but in the knots they undergo
                    great changes of form, and are variously ramified and combined.</p>

                    the Spiral Vessels.</hi></p>
                <p>It was the opinion of Grew, that the “common sapvessels begin to be formed in
                    spring, but the spiral vessels not till the end of summer, at least not till
                    about that time do they appear.” <hi rend="italic">(Anat. of Plants,</hi> p.
                    131.) Malpighi also describes these vessels as gradually appearing in the
                    alburnum, and augmenting in size in every successive ring of wood; an
                    observation made also by Grew, who describes the “spiral vessels as being
                    amplified in each annual ring, so as to form a vessel of a wider bore.” These
                    facts indicate that the spiral vessels, after their formation, undergo
                    considerable changes in the progress of vegetation, or, to use the language of
                    Grew, that <hi rend="superscript"> ¢</hi> ‘ they are postnate, and seem produced
                    by some alteration in the quality, position, and texture of their fibres.”</p>
                <p>In treating of the transformations or metamorphoses of the spiral vessels, Μ.
                    Kieser illustrates his ideas by a series of dissections of the stem and root of
                    the gourd <hi rend="italic">(cucurbita</hi><hi rend="italic">pepo),</hi> made
                    apparently with great care. These designs occupy several plates of his work; and
                    being taken from different parts of the same plant, at different stages of its
                    growth, and viewed with the same magnifying power, they show the progressive
                    changes in form and appearance of these vessels as the plant increases in age.
                    Μ. Kieser exhibits corresponding vertical and horizontal sections of the same
                    parts; but our object will be answered by copying only certain portions of the
                    vertical sections.</p>
                <p>The ligneous portion of the stem of the gourd possesses ten bundles of vessels,
                    symmetrically disposed around the pith, and standing at unequal distances
                    between it and the bark. In fig. 13, Plate XXXVIIL, we have copied the
                    representation of a vertical section of the vessels in one of these bundles,
                    taken from a portion of the plant near the summit of its stem, and made with the
                    aid of a microscope magnifying 130 times. The number of vessels in each bundle
                    at this period is said to vary from three to five. They are constructed of one
                    or more fibres, placed, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193096185"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0703-6185-0048"/> contiguous to each other, and twisted into a
                    spiral form, producing a round cavity within. These are called <hi rend="italic"
                    >simple</hi> spirals. They are found in every young plant, and in the newly
                    formed parts of old ones. Their size is smaller than that of the other varieties
                    to which they give origin. The number of fibres in each spire varies from one to
                    nine; and they are the only variety met with in some of the inferior
                    vegetables.</p>
                <p>The nextfigure(fig. 14, Plate XXXVIII.) exhibits a similar section of the vessels
                    of the same plant at the internodial space below. Of the four vessels contained
                    in this bundle, the outer one, α, is larger than the rest, but its spires are
                    contiguous, as in those of the former figure: the inner one, <hi rend="italic"
                    >i,</hi> is formed of a series of rings, disposed in a perpendicular line. These
                    rings are very like the spires of the preceding variety, and often combined with
                    them in the same vessel. They are sometimes separated from each other only by a
                    space equal to their own diameter; in other instances to eight or ten times that
                    distance, forming then the substratum of the next variety. In their present form
                    they constitute the <hi rend="italic">annular</hi> spiral; and in herbaceous
                    plants occupy frequently the same position as the simple spiral, that is, next
                    to the pith.</p>
                <p>From the two simple varieties of form just described, other more complex forms
                    are produced, as the plant advances in age. In the next section, made still
                    lower down on the same plant, the vessels exhibit the forms represented in fig.
                    15 of the same plate, which brings the third variety of spiral vessel into view.
                    The exterior vessel, <hi rend="italic">b</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> i</hi>
                    of this fasciculus, or that nearest to the bark, is of much larger size: its
                    spires, represented by the white lines in the figure, are separated to nearly
                    equal distances from each other, and the intervening spaces are filled up with a
                    membrane, sprinkled over with small obscure points or dots, constituting the <hi
                    rend="italic">punctuated</hi> spiral vessel. In this variety the rings are never
                    contiguous. Such vessels occur only in the more advanced age of herbaceous
                    plants, but are said to be original formations in the alburnum of trees: they
                    acquire a much greater size than the two former varieties, especially in the
                    stem; but do not become so large in the root. In herbs they occupy a position
                    exterior to that of the two preceding varieties; but in trees the largest
                    vessels of the annual layers are nearer to the pith. The three other vessels in
                    this figure are simple spirals, in part unrolled.</p>
                <p>The spiral fibre in these vessels is of various size, being largest in the
                    greatest vessels: it is sometimes so small as to be scarcely visible. It is
                    often difficult to determine whether its form is spiral or annular: for the most
                    part it is spiral in herbs, and annular in trees. The membrane which connects
                    the spires or rings in this variety is not visible in young vessels, but appears
                    in more mature age. It is at first transparent, but becomes opaque from age. In
                    this punctuated variety of vessel the spires cannot be unrolled without tearing
                    the connecting membrane. As to the points· or dots observed on this membrane,
                    they have been taken by some for pores on its surface; by others for clefts
                    produced by the joining of the spires. They are clearly not clefts, says Μ.
                    Kieser, and it is against the supposition of their being pores that their
                    position has a relation always to the spires, and not to the adjoining cells. In
                    the vessels of some plants, as in those of the French bean, when magnified 400
                    times, these points, fig. 21, α, seem as if pierced by a hole exceedingly small;
                    but in other instances they are quite dark, and similar to those found on the
                    membranous productions that fill the cavity of aged vessels, where there is not
                    the smallest reason for considering them as pores. There seems a great analogy
                    between these connecting membranes and those which thus fill the cavity of aged
                    vessels. In some instances the size of the dots is large, and they appear
                    transparent at the centre; in others the dots are extremely small. Their form is
                    oblong, and they are ranged generally in determined lines, parallel to the
                    direction of the spires.</p>
                <p>In the next vertical section of a fasciculus of vessels, taken from about the
                    middle of the stem of the same plant, all the peculiarities of size and form are
                    still more distinctly seen. Of the twenty-three vessels which appeared in the
                    horizontal section of a fasciculus at this period of growth, six only were
                    apparent in the vertical section, and are exhibited together in fig. 16, Plate
                    XXXVIII. Of these, the first two, or outer ones, are by much the largest, and
                    belong to the punctuated variety. A portion of the anterior wall of these two
                    vessels has been removed by the sections at <hi rend="italic">I, I,</hi> so that
                    the inner surface of the posterior wall is brought into view; and in the former
                    vessel, <hi rend="italic">d,</hi> a portion of the posterior wall itself has
                    also been carried away. In both vessels the spiral fibre, indicated by the white
                    line, is prominent in the section; and in the second, <hi rend="italic">e,</hi>
                    it is unrolled at <hi rend="italic">m, n,</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> where, at
                    <hi rend="italic">m,</hi> it is seen single, transparent, and round, while at
                    <hi rend="italic">n</hi> it is united with the punctuated membrane that connects
                    the spires, and has a flat or riband-like form. The third vessel, <hi
                    rend="italic">f,</hi> of this fasciculus is also of the punctuated class, and
                    the three last, <hi rend="italic">g,</hi> A, «, are simple spirals; the last of
                    all, <hi rend="italic">i,</hi> being in the progress of formation, and its
                    spires not yet brought into a state of contiguity.</p>
                <p>There is a fourth variety of vessel that is said to have the same origin as the
                    last, being formed in part by spires or rings, but the separations between which
                    are filled up, not by membrane, but by small productions or ramifications from
                    the spires or rings themselves; and these ramifications are often so implicated
                    as to form a net-work; whence the names of <hi rend="italic">ramified scad
                    reticulated</hi> spiral vessels. Like the former variety, they do not exist in
                    the young plant, but are formed gradually in a more mature age, and by the same
                    series of actions; that is, the spires or rings, which were at first contiguous,
                    separate at a later period, and the intervals are filled up by ramifications
                    from the spires themselves. At first these ramifications are few, as in the
                    vessel, α, fig. 21, when they are termed <hi rend="italic">ramified</hi>
                    spirals; and as these ramifications increase, the vessel becomes reticulated, as
                    exhibited at the letter c, fig. 20. They are found but in few plants, and ap-∙
                    pear to differ from the punctuated variety chiefly in the position of the rings,
                    which are more or less obliquely placed, and at different points send off one or
                    more branches.</p>
                <p>In his ninth plate, Μ. Kieser has given similar representations of the vessels of
                    the same plant, as they appear from sections made near the root. The fasciculus
                    at this part of the stem contained twenty-nine vessels, as seen in the
                    horizontal section, of which only eight were visible in the vertical section.
                    These retained nearly the characters of those given in the preceding section,
                    fig. 16; but exceeded them in number and size. The large ones, situated next the
                    bark, were of the punctuated class, while the smaller ones, next the pith, were
                    simple spirals. In fig. 18 we have copied the three smaller vessels. In one of
                    these, <hi rend="italic">o,</hi> which belongs to the punctuated variety, the
                    interior of the vessel is nearly filled up with small portions of punctuated
                    membrane, produced from the inner wall of the vessel itself, as is still more
                    clearly seen in horizontal sections of similar vessels in fig. 25. The two
                    vessels <hi rend="italic">p, q,</hi> of fig. 18, are the youngest, and consist
                    only of the simple spiral fibre; the last, it is said, being composed of two
                    such fibres, which, in consequence of the transpa <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193096198" xml:id="kp-eb0703-6198-0049"/>rency of the posterior wall
                    of the vessel, appear to cross each other.</p>
                <p>But Μ. Kieser has not confined his examination to the stem of this plant. In his
                    tenth plate he has given similar sections of a portion of the root. The piece of
                    root he examined presented, in the horizontal section, four fasciculi, each of
                    which contained about thirty-seven vessels, varying in size; the larger ones
                    being placed exteriorly, and the smaller ones towards the centre of the root.
                    The cells of this part were small, and nearly of the same size and form
                    throughout, differing much from the varying size and form of the cells in the
                    stem. Of the thirty-seven vessels before mentioned, only ten were retained in
                    the vertical section, all of which belonged to the punctuated variety. Of these,
                    two had united so as to form but one cavity; and two others were filled up with
                    membrane. In fig. 19 we have copied the appearance of three of these vessels.
                    One of these, indicated by the letter <hi rend="italic">r,</hi> is from the
                    middle of the figure, and its size is intermediate between those on each side of
                    it. A portion of its anterior wall has been carried away in three places, which
                    brings the inner side of the posterior wall into view. The vessels <hi
                    rend="italic">s t</hi> of the same figure are the smallest, and situated at the
                    centre of the root: all the three belong to the punctuated variety, no simple or
                    annular spirals being found at this period in the root.</p>
                <p>In the knots of plants the vessels undergo great changes of form, the larger
                    vessels being contracted in different parts, and giving off productions or
                    ramifications which form new vessels, and give to the whole a very irregular
                    appearance, as may be seen in the upper part of fig. 20, taken from the
                    appearance of the vessels in the knot of the balsam <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Impatiens</hi><hi rend="italic">Balsamina</hi><hi rend="italic">L.).</hi> In
                    this figure Μ. Kieser has also given an ideal representation of the various
                    metamorphoses already described, viz. of the annular vessel intĢ the simple
                    spiral, and of that into the other varieties: thus the letter <hi rend="italic"
                    >a</hi> represents the rings of the annular vessel, which at <hi rend="italic"
                    >b</hi> begin to form the spiral: at <hi rend="italic">c</hi> the simple spiral
                    passes into the ramified variety, and this again, at <hi rend="italic">d,</hi>
                    into the reticulated vessel: at e the vessel becomes contracted at different
                    parts, as previously observed by Malpighi, fig. 17, and by Mir-bel, fig. 11 and
                    12. This latter author called this the vessel <hi rend="italic">en
                    chapelet,</hi> from its resemblance to a string of beads. From these vessels go
                    off the bran che <hi rend="italic">sfff,</hi> to form the ramified spirals of
                    the knot. In fig. 12 of the same plate Μ. Mirbel has given a similar ideal
                    representation of the five <hi rend="italic">species</hi> delineated by him in
                    figs. 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11; but they do not carry with them the same evidence of
                    accurate observation as the several <hi rend="italic">varieties</hi> indicated
                    in the alleged transformations of Kieser.</p>
                <p>Such is the account given by Μ. Kieser, of the development and appearances of the
                    vessels in herbaceous plants, and of the successive changes in character which,
                    m the progress of growth, they undergo. All the figures except the last are
                    taken from dissections of the same plant, beginning with that part of the stem
                    which was of latest growth, and proceeding in succession to the parts of earlier
                    growth, or older formation. At first the vessels are comparatively few in
                    number, of nearly uniform size, and belong to the varieties of annular and
                    simple spiral: at a later period those first formed become augmented in size,
                    and assume the characters of punctuated and rami? fied vessels; they are now
                    also removed farther from the centre, and their place is supplied by new vessels
                    of simpler forms. With the age of the plant, they all continue to increase in
                    size and number, and to acquire the new characters which distinguish the Several
                    varieties in the manner already described.</p>
                <p>In the early growth of trees, the formation and development of vessels go on at
                    the centre, adjacent to the pith, in the same manner as in herbs; but at a later
                    period, when the additional growth is made at the circumference of the tree, the
                    first formation of vessels must occur in the alburnum, and the subsequent
                    changes of character be effected in the several layers of wood; which
                    accordswith the fact that spiral vessels are rarely to be detected in the
                    alburnum, but are found with all their different characters, and of all sizes,
                    in the several layers of wood, as may be seen in all the transverse sections of
                    wood delineated by Grew, Malpighi, and others. In truth, the descriptions of
                    Kieser with respect to the structure and transformations of the spiral vessels
                    accord, in most respects, with the opinions of Grew, as briefly stated, page 47
                    of this article, and as may be farther seen by referring to pages 73 and 177 of
                    Grew’s <hi rend="italic">Anatomy of Plants.</hi></p>
                <p>It is further to be remarked that, in these representations of Kieser, which
                    exhibit all the vessels visible in all parts of the stem and root of this plant,
                    only <hi rend="italic">one kind</hi> of vessel is described, which at different
                    periods of growth assumes different forms; that no vessel answering to the
                    common or lymphatic vessel of authors is mentioned; and consequently, that all
                    the vessels described, however differing in size and external character, are in
                    truth but varieties of one common kind. Calling to mind also that, in the
                    earliest production of leaves and of flowers, and even of stamens and pistils,
                    vessels either possessing the <hi rend="italic">spiral</hi> character, or
                    capable of assuming it, are everywhere met with,—that they occur also in the
                    stem adjacent to the pith in succulent plants, and in the alburnum of trees, and
                    every successive ring of wood produced from it—in short, in every part and
                    portion of the plant, except the bark and pith,—and believing, as we do, in
                    those changes of form suggested by Grew, and subsequently demonstrated by
                    Kieser,—we are led to the general conclusion that only <hi rend="italic">one
                    kind</hi> of vessel exists in the ligneous portion of other plants, as well as
                    in that of the gourd; and that in different plants, and in different
                    circumstances and conditions of vegetation, this vessel is capable of assuming
                    the different forms, sizes, and characters, which have led many writers to
                    describe these organs as constituting different species, and serving different
                    uses.</p>
                <p>Μ. de Candolle, in his late work on the Organography of Plants, seems also to
                    reject the separate existence of the ordinary sap-vessels or lymph-ducts of
                    authors, and to consider, with Kieser, all the vessels collectively to possess a
                    spiral character, which appears under five different forms in the vessels
                    severally named <hi rend="italic">tracheae</hi> or <hi rend="italic">simple</hi>
                    spirals, <hi rend="italic">annular</hi> spirals, <hi rend="italic"
                    >punctuated</hi> and <hi rend="italic">reticulated</hi> spirals, and the vessels
                    <hi rend="italic">en chapelet.</hi><hi rend="italic">(Organographie</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Végétale,</hi> tome i. p. 32.) Without deciding positively in
                    favour of Kieser’s views, he admits that the different orders of vessels have
                    among them very intimate relations; and in favour of the opinion that they are
                    really modifications of each other, he alleges that al mb st all these orders
                    exist together in certain classes of plants, and are wanting altogether in
                    others. Still, though he has no theoretical objection to make to these alleged
                    transitions of form, he has never been able to verify them by actual
                    observation, and thinks the facts require further investigation. <hi
                    rend="italic">(Ibid.</hi> p. 48, 51.) With respect to the existence of pores in
                    the spiral vessels, as alleged generally by Mirbel, and even occasionally by
                    Kieser, but denied by a great number of observers, Μ. de Candolle has been led
                    by his own observation to entertain doubts, and to believe that what has been
                    regarded as a pore is a luminous point, such as is exhibited by bubbles of air
                    in water, when placed under the microscope. <hi rend="italic">(Ibid.</hi> p.
                    55.) <pb break="no" facs="nls:193096211" xml:id="kp-eb0703-6211-0050"/>The late
                    opinions of Μ. Dutrochet on the structure of plants seem to us to have drawn
                    attention more from their novelty than their value. He criticises the opinions
                    of Mirbel in relation to the structure of the vessels, and says that those
                    denominated by that author <hi rend="italic">porous</hi> tubes, are altogether
                    destitute of pores, but have corpuscles adhering to, or rather implanted in
                    their sides, on which account he calls them eorpusculiferous tubes. <hi
                    rend="italic">(Recherches</hi><hi rend="italic">Anatom,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >sur la</hi><hi rend="italic">Structure</hi><hi rend="italic">des Végétaux,</hi>
                    &lt;⅛e∙ p. 23.) In like manner the tracheae are said to have similar corpuscles
                    attached to their sides, but which adhere only weakly, and form no necessary
                    part of the organization. <hi rend="italic">(Ibid.)</hi> With respect to the
                    uses of these two kinds of vessels in the wood, he considers the
                    corpusculiſerous tubes to be the canals by which the sap <hi rend="italic"
                    >ascends</hi> from the roots; while the spiral vessels, or tracheae, convey not
                    air, but a diaphanous liquid, prepared in the leaves, and which descends, by the
                    spiral vessels, to impart its vivifying influence to all parts of the plant.
                    (7Z&gt;iW.p. 29-31.) No direct communication, it is said, exists between the
                    cells and vessels which compose the vegetable texture; they are only contiguous.
                    Fluids, nevertheless, are transmitted from one to the other; not however through
                    holes or passages expressly designed for that purpose, as Mirbel contends, but
                    through intermole-cular spaces, left between the integrant globular molecules,
                    of which the organic solids are composed. <hi rend="italic">(Ibid.</hi> p. 47,
                    48.)</p>
                <p>Such is an outline of the different opinions that have been held regarding the
                    <hi rend="italic">structure</hi> of the sap-vessels. Differences not less great
                    still continue to exist with regard to their <hi rend="italic">uses.</hi> Our
                    reasons have been already given for coinciding in opinion with those who hold
                    the vessels to be the proper channels in which the sap is conveyed. Μ. Kieser,
                    however, contends that the spiral vessels of the wood are always empty, or
                    contain only air, and considers them, with Malpighi, to be organs by which air
                    is conveyed. To this opinion Μ. de Candolle also inclines, though he admits that
                    in some cases they may convey lymph. <hi rend="italic">(Organog. Végét.</hi>
                    tome i. p. 61.)</p>
                <p>Those physiologists who thus oppose the opinion that the vessels carry fluids,
                    suppose the sap to be conveyed by certain minute channels, said to exist between
                    the cells. The place of these alleged channels is marked out in a section of
                    cellular tissue (fig. 29, Plate XXXVΠL) taken from Μ. Kieser, in which the black
                    points at the angular junctions of the cells are said to denote them: from their
                    position they have obtained the name of <hi rend="italic">intercellular
                    canals.</hi> By many, however, the existence of such spaces at the angles of the
                    cells is denied; and, indeed, when we contemplate the various size and form of
                    the cells, the different degrees in which they are filled with fluid or solid
                    matters, and consequently the greater or less degree of compression which these
                    alleged intercellular spaces must undergo, we can hardly admit the sufficiency
                    of such minute, tortuous, and precarious channels to convey the ascending sap
                    with that force and velocity which the experiments of Hales and others have
                    proved it to possess. On the other hand, no direct communication between the
                    spiral vessels of plants and the external atmosphere, similar to that which
                    occurs between the tracheae of insects and the air, has been shown to exist; and
                    the total absence of spiral vessels in the bark, where they would be near to the
                    atmosphere, and their presence in the root, where they are almost beyond its
                    influence, are alike repugnant to the notion that they exercise a respiratory
                    function. Lastly, the absence of sap in these vessels at certain seasons, on
                    which alone the notion of their being <hi rend="italic">tracheae</hi> or
                    air-vessels was founded, depends, as we have seen, on the period at which the
                    examination is made; for at certain periods they have been found filled with
                    sap; and at all periods, when in active vegetation, they will absorb and convey
                    coloured fluids. It should also be borne in mind that the respiratory function
                    in vegetables is performed, not by the trunk, but by the leaves.of the
                    plant.</p>
                <p>Dismissing then these notions concerning the uses of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >spiral</hi> vessels, and adhering to the opinion, that in all their variety
                    they serve the office of conveying sap through the plant, we shall conclude this
                    branch of the subject with a brief notice of their modes of <hi rend="italic"
                    >termination.</hi></p>
                <p>If we begin at the root, we may consider these vessels as terminating at that
                    part, by continuation of canal, in the capillary <hi rend="italic">absorbents of
                    the rootlet.</hi> As, further, the vessels of plants, like those of animals, are
                    the only organs which convey the materials out of which not only the fluid, but
                    the solid parts of the plant are formed, it may, in a general sense, be said
                    that their modes of termination are as numerous as the kinds of distinct parts
                    or organs which the vegetable system contains. Hence, therefore, as the cellular
                    tissue of plants contains various matters often precisely similar to those which
                    exist in the vessels, it may be inferred that the vessels have a termination in
                    those organs; and this inference may perhaps carry more weight with many than
                    the attempts before related of Malpighi and Lecuwenhoeck to demonstrate it
                    anatomically. Another termination of these vessels must be in certain minute and
                    ill-defined organs called <hi rend="italic">glands,</hi> which separate from the
                    mass of fluids peculiar secretions; and a fourth mode may, in the leaves, be in
                    other vessels which carry back the juices from those organs. The last and fifth
                    mode of termination is into transpiring or exhalent organs, by which a certain
                    portion of the contents of the vessels is discharged: so that in plants the
                    sap-vessels terminate externally at one extremity in absorbents, by which fluids
                    are received; and at the other in exhalents, by which these fluids are in part
                    discharged.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Art.</hi> VI.— <hi rend="italic">Of the Proper
                    Vessels.</hi></p>
                <p>By observation of the natural flow of the sap, combined with the results of
                    experiments made with coloured liquors, we have endeavoured to determine the
                    situation and kinds of vessels by which it is conveyed in the wood. The same
                    method will best assist us in ascertaining the nature and place of the vessels
                    met with in the bark.</p>
                <p>It was before stated, that, early in spring, the sap of plants rises through the
                    wood alone, and that no fluid whatever is then to be found in the bark. At a
                    later period, however, the case is completely reversed; for the vessels of the
                    wood no longer appear to carry sap, and those of the bark then become abundantly
                    supplied with it. This difference is very dearly and concisely stated by Grew.
                    “The sap,” says he, “in many plants, as the vine, ascends visibly through the
                    wood for a month, in March and April, and rises through every ring of wood to
                    the very centre, yet at the same time there ariseth no sap at all out of the
                    bark, nor between it and the wood.” “But late in spring,” he continues, “and in
                    summer, the sap is no longer visible in the wood, but is abundant in the bark,
                    in the inner margin adjacent to the wood.” Du Hamel, too, remarks, that when the
                    lymph rises abundantly through the wood in spring, the bark is dry, and adheres
                    to the wood, and no sap then issues from it, nor from between it and the wood;
                    but, later in the season, he adds, the bark yields abundance of sap. These
                    statements have been verified by the multiplied observations of various
                    subsequent authors.</p>
                <p>But why is the sap thus present only in the wood at its first rising in spring
                    Why at a later period does <pb break="no" facs="nls:193096224"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0703-6224-0051"/>it cease to be visible in that part? And how and
                    why does it afterwards find a passage into the bark? Some observations of Du
                    Hamel, Hales, and Walker, point, we think, to the true cause. In spring, says Du
                    Hamel, when the sap rises vigorously, the buds have not appeared; when they
                    begin to open, the sap then flows less freely; and when the leaves are fully
                    developed, then the flow of sap entirely ceases. Dr Hales also remarks, that,
                    towards the end of April, when the young shoots come forth, and the surface of
                    the vine is greatly increased by the expansion of the leaves, the sap then
                    ceases to flow in a visible manner till the return of the next spring. All
                    bleeding trees, he adds, cease to bleed as soon as the young leaves begin to
                    expand enough to perspire plentifully, and draw off the redundant sap. The bark
                    of oak, too, separates easily when lubricated with sap; but before the leaves
                    appear and perspire, the bark will no longer run (as they term it), but adheres
                    most firmly to the wood. <hi rend="italic">( Vegetable Statics,</hi> 3d edit. p.
                    126.) In like manner, in an experiment of Dr Walker, a birch-tree bled from
                    every perforation in its trunk, and from every cut extremity of its branches,
                    until vernation or budding began; then thcbleeding was almost immediately
                    checked; and when the young leaves had pushed beyond the <hi rend="italic"
                    >hy-bernaculmn,</hi> the bleeding entirely ceased. <hi rend="italic">(Edin.
                    Phil. Trans,</hi> vol. i. p. 31.)</p>
                <p>It is however certain, that though the sap was no longer visible in the wood
                    after the leaves were developed, it continued nevertheless to rise through it;
                    for in no other way could the leaves obtain the large portion of fluid which it
                    is known that they constantly discharge by transpiration; and coloured fluids
                    manifest their presence in the vessels of the wood, as well after as before the
                    development of the leaves. The leaves, therefore, must be regarded as the organs
                    which, by their perspiration, draw off, as Dr Hales observes, the redundant sap;
                    and hence, in an experiment where a notch was cut two or three feet above the
                    lower end of a stem, though a great quantity of sap passed by the notch, yet was
                    it perfectly dry; because, stfys he, “the attraction of the perspiring leaves
                    was greater than the force of trusion from the column of water.” <hi
                    rend="italic">(Vegetable Statics,</hi> p. 111.)</p>
                <p>Not only, however, does the development of the leaves render the sap no longer
                    visible in the wood, but they also appear to be the organs by or through which
                    it finds its way to the bark. In all the experiments just recited, the bark
                    continued dry until the sap disappeared from the wood; in other words, until it
                    was drawn off by the leaves; and then, and not till then, the bark became moist,
                    and continued laden with sap through the rest of the summer. Now, as it has been
                    before shown that no sap enters the bark by the roots, nor gets into it directly
                    from the wood, there is no other known channel by which it can be conveyed,
                    except through the leaves; and these, therefore, necessarily appear to be the
                    organs by which it is apparently carried off from the wood, and by or through
                    which it at the same time finds its way to the bark.</p>
                <p>This inference appears to follow, not only from the fact of the bark continuing
                    dry until the leaves are developed, but from the circumstance that it is again
                    rendered dry after having become moist, if these same leaves be removed. If,
                    says Du Hamel, we remove the leaves of a young tree when in full sap, and whose
                    bark is easily detached, ill a few days after the same bark will adhere as
                    closely to the wood as it commonly does during winter. This direct connection
                    between the leaves and bark is also well illustrated in an experiment of Hales,
                    employed by him for a very different purpose. From two thriving shoots of a
                    pear-tree he cut, in several places, half an inch of the bark off all round.</p>
                <p>All the ringlets of bark between these incisions had a leaf-bud upon them except
                    one, and all but this one ringlet grew and swelled at their bottoms till August;
                    and the larger and more thriving the leaf-bud was, so much the more did the
                    adjoining bark swell. <hi rend="italic">( Veg. Statics,</hi> p. 149.) Mr Knight
                    also found the bark of the vine to become shrivelled and dry when the leaves
                    were stripped off; but in those parts in which it communicated directly with the
                    leaves, it continued moist and flourishing. <hi rend="italic">(Phil. Trans.</hi>
                    1801, p. 335.)</p>
                <p>By connecting, therefore, the circumstances attending the flow of sap with the
                    development of the leaves, we gain satisfactory reasons for all the apparent
                    anomalies observed to attend its course. Early in spring, before the appearance
                    of the leaves, no natural outlet for the escape of the rising sap exists, and
                    therefore, when the vessels arc cut or perforated, they readily pour out their
                    sap, or bleed; but late in spring, and in summer, when the leaves are developed,
                    the more watery parts of the sap are thrown off by transpiration; and while this
                    process proceeds, the fluids do not accumulate in such quantity in the minute
                    vessels of the trunk as to be effused or bleed through their cut or perforated
                    sides. A cold day, however, or a moist and still atmosphere, by checking
                    transpiration from the leaves, restores more or less the propensity to bleeding
                    from the trunk; and in autumn, when fructification begins, and vegetation makes
                    a pause, the same disposition to bleeding recurs in the trunk, from the check
                    imposed on the more active powers of growth.</p>
                <p>It is further evident, that, when the vessels of the bark become supplied with
                    fluid, they cannot have derived it immediately from those of the wood, since, in
                    these different parts, the fluids have frequently no sort of agreement in
                    properties. Thus, Grew remarks, that almost all plants, late in spring, and in
                    summer, bleed from their bark; and the sap has either a sour, sweet, hot,
                    bitter, or other taste. At this period the bark of the vine yields a sour sap;
                    but, “what is vulgarly called bleeding in the vine is,” he adds, “quite another
                    thing, both as to the liquor which issueth, and the place whence it issues; that
                    is, it is neither a sweet nor a sour, but a tasteless sap, issuing, not from any
                    vessels in the bark, but from the air-vessels of the wood.” <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Anatomy of Plants,</hi> p. 125.) Malpighi, also, was well aware of the
                    difference in the qualities of the sap, and thought every plant possessed its
                    peculiar sap; but he has not so accurately defined the situation of the vessels
                    that contain it. Du Hamel, however, points out distinctly the difference of
                    quality in the sap of the bark and wood. In the bark of some plants it is white,
                    in others red, and in others yellow. It is in some instances milky, in others
                    resinous, and in others gummy. In many plants it has a sweet taste, in some it
                    is caustic, and in others insipid. It has sometimes much odour as well as
                    flavour, and frequently it is destitute of both. <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Phys,</hi><hi rend="italic">des Arbres,</hi> tome i. p. 68.)</p>
                <p>But if the qualities of the sap in the bark be thus different from those of the
                    sap in the wood; if these peculiar qualities are detected in it only after the
                    development of the leaves, and the leaves be the organs by which alone the sap
                    can be conveyed from the one part to the other; then it seems to follow that the
                    sap must acquire these new properties in the leaves during its transmission
                    through them. Malpighi remarked the existence of this altered sap in the leaves,
                    and held them to be the organs which prepared nutrient matter for the plant; and
                    Dr Darwin, by immersing plants of spurge in coloured liquors, not only saw, as
                    others had previously done, the red fluid ascend through the leaf, but another
                    fluid, of a <pb break="no" facs="nls:193096237" xml:id="kp-eb0703-6237-0052"
                    />white colour, returning at the same time from the extremities of the leaf, and
                    descending into the petiole. <hi rend="italic">(Botanic Garden,</hi> vol. i.
                    notes, p. 450-53.) This same returning fluid Mr Knight observed in similar
                    experiments on branches of the apple and horse-chesnut trees, and even traced it
                    through the petiole into the inner bark, by the vessels of which it seemed to be
                    conveyed to the extremities of the roots. <hi rend="italic">(Phil. Trans.</hi>
                    1801.) The motion, therefore, of the sap in the bark is not that of <hi
                    rend="italic">ascent,</hi> as Grew and Malpighi and many others have believed,
                    but of <hi rend="italic">descent,</hi> as the observations and experiments of Μ.
                    de Sarrabat, Du Hamel, Knight, and others, abundantly prove. To these vessels of
                    the bark Grew assigned particular names, according to the apparent quality of
                    the fluid they conveyed. Malpighi gave them the general appellation of <hi
                    rend="italic">vasapeculiaria,</hi> from their containing a fluid different from
                    the common sap. By others they have been called <hi rend="italic">cortical
                    vessels,</hi> a term, however, not applicable to many tribes of vegetables which
                    are entirely destitute of bark. Lastly, Du Hamel and others denominated them <hi
                    rend="italic">proper vessels,</hi> which term differs but slightly from the
                    appellation of Malpighi, and, though not very precise, is that we shall continue
                    to employ.</p>
                <p>From regarding the newly formed vessels of the wood as part of the bark, Grew
                    uniformly represents the bark 'as possessing two distinct species of vessels, in
                    which he has been since followed by several other writers; but the vessels which
                    he calls <hi rend="italic">lymphoeducts</hi> belong rather to the wood, so that
                    we may regard him as describing only one species of <hi rend="italic">proper
                    vessels.</hi> In herbs, these vessels stand sometimes in distinct parcels or
                    columns; sometimes they are disposed in a ring; sometimes they have a radiated
                    position; and sometimes they are more intermixed with the sap-vessels, and seem
                    to alternate with them. In trees, the vessels of the bark are more distinct, and
                    have a much more regular appearance. They are commonly postured near the inner
                    margin of the bark, and, when viewed in a longitudinal direction, seem collected
                    into fasciculi, which are more or less numerous, and the component vessels of
                    which continually diverge and join with others, so as to form a reticulated
                    appearance, as in fig. 24, Plate XXXVIII. Of these reticulated fasciculi, many
                    layers’ exist in an old tree; and to these layers the thickness of the bark is
                    chiefly owing. As they proceed inward, the direction of the fasciculi is less
                    oblique, so that near to the wood they are almost straight. Hence the spaces
                    formed by the reticulations are very unequal, often large in the exterior part
                    of the bark, and diminishing in size towards the wood: they are. everywhere
                    filled with cellular tissue. Such is a general description of the situation of
                    the <hi rend="italic">proper vessels of</hi> the bark, as given by Grew,
                    Malpighi, and Du Hamel.</p>
                <p>The vessels which thus form the vascular portion of the bark appear to differ but
                    little in <hi rend="italic">structure</hi> from the more simple vessels of the
                    wood. Grew considered them to possess a similar structure, from believing them
                    to be formed by the inner bark at the same time with the vessels of the wood;
                    and therefore, he adds, “they may be reasonably thought similar in the bark and
                    wood.” <hi rend="italic">(Anat. of Plants,</hi> p. 112.) Malpighi regarded them
                    as simple tubes, containing sometimes peculiar juices; but advances nothing
                    particular respecting their structure. <hi rend="italic">(Anat. Plantar,</hi> p.
                    3.) Μ. Mirbel’s opinion deserves some notice, inasmuch as he declares the
                    structure of these vessels to differ entirely from all those of the wood. Their
                    sides, says he, are perfectly entire; they have neither pores nor clefts, and
                    may therefore be deemed simple tubes. <hi rend="italic">(Exposit.</hi><hi

                    kind is represented in Plate XXXVIII. fig. 22; and in fig. 23 a fasciculus of
                    the same vessels magnified is given as delineated by Μ. Mirbel. A re-, mark also
                    of Hill, if it be deemed to rest on correct observation, is entitled to great
                    attention. “The vessels of the bark that form the fasciculi are not,” says he,
                    “united to each other, but are connected with the cellular tissue at numerous
                    places; and, when separated from it, there appear on the sides of the vessels
                    small oval depressions, dotted as it were with pin-holes.” <hi rend="italic">(
                    On the Construction of Timber,</hi> p. 28.) These appearances he regards as of a
                    glandular nature, but their description corresponds better with that of
                    Lecuwenhoeck respecting the lateral ramifications from the vessels of the wood;
                    and they may probably be the points at which communication is effected between
                    the vessels and cells.</p>
                <p>The cause of the reticulated appearance· which the vessels of the bark exhibit in
                    trees, is doubtless to be attributed, as we think Du Hamel somewhere remarks, to
                    their peculiar mode of growth. A new layer of cortical vessels is every year
                    added to. the inner surface of the bark, as well as a new layer of ligneous
                    vessels to the outer surface of the wood; so that, as Grew observes, the new
                    matter of the tree is every year distributed two contrary ways,—one part falling
                    outward towards the bark, and the other part retaining its situation inward to
                    constitute the wood. At first the newly formed cortical vessels are straight,
                    and stand parallel, likç those of the wood; but, by the continual growth of the
                    new parts formed between the bark and the wood, the older vessels of the bark
                    are gradually forced, outward; and being thus every year disposed around a large
                    cylinder, are necessarily more and more separated from each other, and produce
                    at length that-net-like form which we .observe them to possess. The newly formed
                    vessels of. the wood, on the other hand, retain their original position,· and
                    therefore preserve their parallelism, seldom or never exhibiting those flexures
                    and reticulations so common to the vessels of the bark.</p>
                <p>In the bark, as well as in the wood, the vessels are I found to possess different
                    sizes. In the pine, vessels containing turpentine are represented by Grew, which
                    are very much larger than the common sap-vessels, and are surrounded by smaller
                    ones, exactly as the large spiral tubes of the wood are said to be ensheathed by
                    the common sap-vessels. The milky juice of a species of sumach is contained in
                    very large vessels, disposed so as to form a ring, and each large vessel is
                    surrounded by many smaller ones. <hi rend="italic">(Anat. of Plants,</hi> tab.
                    20.) The appearance of these large vessels in one species of pine is well
                    represented by Hill, and the account he gives of their formation is probably
                    correct. In this tree <hi rend="italic">(pinus orientalis),</hi> some of these
                    vessels form oval openings, large enough to admit a straw; these openings occupy
                    the centre of the bark, and are surrounded by a ring of smaller vessels. As
                    their contents are soluble in alcohol, it is easy to obtain them empty. In
                    fig.26, Plate XXXVIII., the vessels of this tree, as they appear in the bark,
                    are displayed; the woody portion of the tree having been scooped away, so that
                    the longitudinal aspect, as well as the transverse sections of them, is
                    exhibited. From a strict inquiry into their nature, Dr Hill concluded that these
                    larger vessels were originally the same as those of the smaller fasciculi in the
                    bark of the same tree; “so that if we conceive one of these smaller fasciculi
                    opened in its centre, and the vessels driven every way outward, till they are
                    stopped by the substance of the bark, we shall have an idea of the structure of
                    this large vessel, which is nothing more than a great cylindrical hollow formed
                    in the centre of such a fasciculus.” (Hill <hi rend="italic">on the Construction
                    of Timber,</hi><pb break="no" facs="nls:193096250" xml:id="kp-eb0703-6250-0053"
                    /> p. 29.) It is in trees that have copious and viscid juices that these
                    enlarged vessels are formed; and where the juices do not concrete, it is
                    probable that, as the vessels annually recede from the centre, they suffer a
                    reduction in size from the continued effects of desiccation and compression to
                    which they are exposed.</p>
                <p>The foregoing varieties appear alone entitled to the appellation of the <hi
                    rend="italic">proper vessels</hi> of the bark. In many tribes of vegetables,
                    however, as will afterwards be shown, no distinction of bark and wood exists;
                    but one uniform distribution of vessels extends from the centre to the
                    circumference of the plant. Such plants have also their <hi rend="italic">proper
                    vessels,</hi> but the place and disposition of these vessels are not so
                    precisely ascertained. From the mode in which their growth is accomplished, as
                    well as from observation of their structure, it may be inferred that their <hi
                    rend="italic">proper vessels</hi> are distributed through the whole substance of
                    the plant, accompanying in every part the sap-vessels. In some plants possessing
                    this arrangement of parts, such as different species of. wheat,∙Malpighi <hi
                    rend="italic">(Anat. Plant.</hi> tab. 4, fig. 15) describes and delineates a <hi
                    rend="italic">vas proprium</hi> as forming a part of each fasciculus of vessels;
                    and a similar intermixture, of the two kinds must, we conceive, exist in all
                    similaŗ structures.</p>
                <p>Even in many plants possessing a distinct bark, vessels containing proper juices
                    are found in the wood. In every circle of wood, from the inmost that surrounds
                    the pith, to the outmost in contact with the bark, vessels containing a gum,
                    turpentine, or some other concrete or coloured juice, hiay frequently be found.
                    Malpighi conceived 4hem to exist in all plants, though, from the nature of their
                    fluids, they could not always be distinguished; and he believed them to afford a
                    highly perfect juice for the nutrftion-oî.the plant. According to Grew, “the
                    turpentine vessels that are scattered up and down the wood of the pine and fir
                    are the self-same which did once appertain to the bark; but being pinched up by
                    the wood, they are become much smaller pipes.” <hi rend="italic">(Anat. of
                    Plants,</hi> p. 115.) Du Hamel also regarded them as similar to those of the·
                    bark, but rendered much smaller by compression. In the ,pine and fir they are
                    disposed circularly around the axis, much like, the sap-vessels, and alternate
                    with them. <hi rend="italic">(Phys,</hi><hi rend="italic">des Arbres,</hi> tħme
                    i. p. 41.)</p>
                <p>In <hi rend="italic">Piscidia erythrina,</hi> the proper juices are of a scarlet
                    colour, and the vessels that contain them are therefore readily discerned
                    wherever they exist. This plant has been selected by Hill to demonstrate the
                    position of these vessels. In the bark they are collected into fasciculi, all
                    the vessels of which contain coloured juices, and are disposed in a ring on the
                    inner margin of the bark. Within this ring stands the alburnum, through the
                    substance of which many smaller red vessels are distributed; and similar red
                    vessels are more sparingly seen in every layer of wood, particularly in that
                    which envelopes the pith. <hi rend="italic">( Construction of Timber.)</hi></p>
                <p>Now the red vessels thus observed in the wood of the above-mentioned plant must
                    either have been formed in the situations they occupy, or transported from some
                    other place. The latter supposition is inadmissible, inasmuch as the wood of
                    trees is formed by layers of new vessels superimposed on one another; and no
                    removal of the old vessels, nor reproduction of new vessels within the old
                    layers, ever takes place; consequently no actual transposition of vessels could
                    occur, nor could new vessels be developed in the wood after it had been
                    completely formed. Ifi however, an alternate deposition and absorption of matter
                    go on into and from the cells, it is possible that the vessels might in this way
                    become filled with a matter different from that which they originally possessed;
                    but in the case before us, a readier explanation presents itself. The new matter
                    of the wood is formed at the same time, and in the same place, as that of the
                    bark; and through this new woody matter the red vessels were dispersed as well
                    as in the bark. Consequently every addition made to the ligneous layers would
                    furnish some vessels that contained these proper juices; and this, being
                    annually repeated, would exhibit that intermixture of proper vessels with
                    sap-vessels which is observed in all the ligneous layers of this and many other
                    trees. Hence these <hi rend="italic">proper vessels</hi> of the wood must be
                    held to retain the position in which they were originally produced, and cannot
                    be said to have approached nearer to the centre, but only, by the addition of
                    new layers exterior to them, to be placed farther from the circumference of the
                    tree. As Grew, therefore, held the alburnum to be a part of the bark, he might
                    correctly say that these vessels “did once appertain to it.”</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Art.</hi> VII.— <hi rend="italic">Of Collections of the
                    Proper Juices in the Cellular Tissue.</hi></p>
                <p>Besides this accumulation of the proper juices in certain vessels of the wood, it
                    frequently happens that depositions of similar matter occur in all parts of the
                    cellular tissue of plants. In the bark of the oak and poplar, and of other
                    trees, resinous concretions are often found in the cells; they are situated
                    irregularly, and, according to Malpighi, are observed even in very young bark.
                    Sometimes the cells containing milky and resinous juices are so postured in the
                    bark, says Grew, as to form cylindrical channels, which are neither parallel nor
                    anywhere inosculated, but run, with some little obliquities, distinct from one
                    another. They appear to be formed out of the cells, and are not bounded by any
                    walls or sides proper to themselves, but only by those of the cells. <hi
                    rend="italic">(Anat. of Plants,</hi> p. 112.) They are often short and tortuous,
                    always isolated; and are sometimes placed irregularly, at others disposed in a
                    circular form. They occur sometimes in the pith, and possess very different
                    sizes and figures. They have frequently been deemed a species of <hi
                    rend="italic">proper vessels,</hi> from the mere circumstance of their
                    containing similar juices, and from possessing sometimes an elongated form; but
                    they are organs which, neither in form nor in function, bear any resemblance to
                    vessels. Mirbel proposes to name them <hi rend="italic">secretory canals,</hi>
                    and Μ. Link <hi rend="italic">cellular reservoirs</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi>
                    the term certainly most generally applicable, and involving no hypothesis
                    respecting either their formation or functions.</p>
                <p>The manner in which these cellular reservoirs, may be produced in the bark or
                    pith is readily explained, on the supposition that a communication everywhere
                    subsists between the vessels and the cells. One set of vessels has been shown to
                    receive and carry sap to the leaves, and another to bring it back from them to
                    the bark; and these two sets of vessels are everywhere in their course
                    surrounded by cellular tissue. Hence the cells in every part may receive a
                    portion of the fluid which the vessels are employed to convey. Thus in herbs,
                    the cells both of the bark and pith are filled with fluid, which led Grew to
                    believe that the sap was actually transmitted through those organs; but at the
                    same time he delivers facts which, even in his own opinion, prove that it is
                    derived directly from the vessels. Not only in herbs, but “in every annual
                    growth, whether of a sprout from a seed, of a sucker from a root, or of a scion
                    from a branch, the pith is always found the first yeaŗ full of sap; but in the
                    second year the same individual pith always becomes dry, and so it continues
                    ever after. One cause whereof is, that the <pb break="no" facs="nls:193096263"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0703-6263-0054"/> lymphaeducts of the bark being the first year
                    adjacent to the pith, they do all that time transfuse part of their sap into it,
                    and so keep it always succulent. But the same lymphaeducts the following year
                    are turned into wood, and the vessels which are then generated and carry the sap
                    stand beyond them in the bark; so that the sap, being now more remote from the
                    pith, and intercepted by the new wood, cannot be transfused with that sufficient
                    force and plenty as before into the pith, which, therefore, from the first year
                    always continues dry.” <hi rend="italic">(Anat. of Plants,</hi> p. 124.)</p>
                <p>All that is here said respecting the transfusion of the common sap from the
                    vessels into the cells as it ascends through the wood, is equally applicable to
                    the <hi rend="italic">proper juices</hi> as they descend through the bark.
                    During the first year of growth, both the sap and proper vessels are adjacent to
                    the pith as well as to the bark, and each order may· therefore transfuse its
                    fluids into the cells of either. The common sap, from retaining its fluidity, is
                    frequently removed by absorption, and the cells that contained it appear empty
                    and dry; but where the proper juices arc transfused, and become viscid or
                    concrete, they are retained, and appear in different quantities and forms both
                    in the bark and pith, according to the nature and properties of the fluids from
                    which they are derived, and the texture and situation of the tissue into which
                    they are poured.</p>
                <p>To these collections of the <hi rend="italic">proper juices</hi> in the cells of
                    the cellular tissue may be referred the opinions of those who describe them as
                    existing sometimes in vacuities between the cells. Grew had remarked the
                    occasional presence of these juices in cylindrical channels formed by these
                    vacuities, to which Μ. Treviranus has given the name of <hi rend="italic"
                    >intercellular canals.</hi> According to him, these canals not only contain the
                    proper juices, but convey them to all the cellular parts of plants, and are the
                    true <hi rend="italic">proper vessels</hi> of the bark. We before saw that Μ.
                    Kieser, after making the wood to consist almost entirely of spiral vessels,
                    destined only to convey air, supposed the sap to be carried by these same
                    intercellular canals. (Kieser, <hi rend="italic">Mém. sur</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >l’</hi><hi rend="italic">Organisât,</hi><hi rend="italic">des Plantes,</hi> p.
                    36.) With Μ. Treviranus, he also considers them as the real <hi rend="italic"
                    >proper vessels</hi> of the bark, by which alone the juices are conveyed. <hi
                    rend="italic">(Ibid.</hi> p. 86.)</p>
                <p>Μ. de Candolle considers the proper juices to possess no special organ for their
                    conveyance, but to nestle in the cavities that surround them, and form sacs or
                    reservoirs of various size and form. He distinguishes several kinds of these
                    reservoirs, which vary with the figure of the containing sac. Thus, what others
                    call “proper vessels,” he designates by the names of tubular and fascicular
                    reservoirs. In this, however, he appears to confound the “proper juices,”
                    destined immediately to the functions of nutrition and growth, with various
                    fluid or solid matters, either simply deposited in the cellular tissue, or that
                    have undergone subsequent alteration by the agency of a secreting organ. The
                    reservoirs of the proper juices, and the juices themselves, are, he says,
                    readily seen in many families of dicoyledons; but have not been observed with
                    certainty, either in monocotyledonous or acotyledonous tribes. <hi rend="italic"
                    >( Organog. Veg.</hi> tome i. chap. 11.) The reason of this seems to be, that in
                    dicoyledons the bark, in which the proper juices are seen, is distinct from the
                    wood, in which the common sap flows; and the colour, consistence, and qualities
                    of the two' fluids, therefore, at once point out their respective places; but in
                    plants belonging to the two latter tribes there is no proper distinction of bark
                    and wood; and the two orders of vessels, as shown by Malpighi in the instance of
                    wheat, are associated together through the whole substance of the plant, which
                    renders the discrimination of their common and proper juices more difficult.</p>
                <p>Besides two orders of vessels existing in the ligneous part of trees, Μ.
                    Dutrochet describes a particular form of cell, which, in the wood, serves only
                    as a receptacle for fluids; but to which, in the bark, he assigns a vascular
                    function. This is the elongated cell observed by Malpighi, and represented by
                    him in fig. 18, Plate XXXIX. Μ. Dutrochet, from the resemblance which its figure
                    is said to bear to a spindle, has given it the name of <hi rend="italic"
                    >clostre;</hi> and his representation of it is given in fig. 17, Plate XXXIX.
                    These elongated cells form what Kieser and others have called the ligneous
                    fibres. By Μ. Du-trochet they are regarded as reservoirs of the nutrient juices,
                    and as containing secretions which impart solidity to the wood. In the bark,
                    however, these same clostres are declared to be the organs in which the
                    elaborated sap is contained, and by which įt is transmitted to the roots to
                    furnish the materials of their growth. The clostres, which thus convey the
                    nutrient matter, ought not, he adds, to be confounded with the “proper vessels,”
                    which are the true secretory organs. These vessels are tubes of greater diameter
                    than the clostres, and contain various excrementitious substances, as resin,
                    &amp;c. in different plants. <hi rend="italic">(Recherches Anatomiques,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">&amp;c.</hi> p. 36, 37.) According to Μ. Dutrochet, therefore, the
                    elongated cells and vessels which exist in the bark and wood exercise functions
                    precisely opposite; for whilst in the wood the corpusculiterous vessels convey
                    the sap, and the cells are reservoirs for containing it, in the bark the cells
                    are the organs which transmit the elaborated sap, and the vessels those in which
                    the excrementitious matters are contained.</p>
                <p>In our view, these notions are the reverse of fact, since we consider the
                    vessels, both in the wood and the bark, as the organs by which the fluids are
                    conveyed, and the various forms of the cellular tissue as the general
                    receptacles into which they are in part deposited: they may, however, in some
                    instances be retained in the vessels themselves, as well as in the cells.</p>

                <p>Connected with the vessels that distribute the fluids through organized bodies,
                    is another system of vessels, by which extraneous matter is taken -up to support
                    the growth of parts, and supply the waste occasioned by the exercise of the
                    various functions. To these vessels anatomists have given the name of <hi
                    rend="italic">Absorbents.</hi> The function which they perform is carried on
                    either from the external surface, or from some internal part of the body; and
                    its exercise, in animal bodies, may be distinguished into three kinds or stages.
                    The first is that in which new or extraneous matter is taken up and added to the
                    system, as in the absorption of substances from the skin, or of chyle from the
                    intestines; the second is that in which substances previously separated from the
                    fluids by secretion, but without becoming organized, are again taken up by the
                    absorbents, and reconveyed into the blood-vessels, as in the absorption of milk,
                    bile, and fat; the third kind is that in which the secreting organs themselves,
                    and successively all the solid parts of the body, are removed by the action of
                    the absorbent vessels. By plants this function is exercised to less extent, and
                    seems to comprise only the first two kinds or degrees of it, viz. the primary
                    absorption of extraneous matter, and the reabsorption of certain secreted
                    matters; but in them there <pb break="no" facs="nls:193096276"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0703-6276-0055"/>does not appear any power of re-absorbing what has
                    once formed an organized part of the system. Hence the formation of organized
                    parts in plants is not accompanied, as in animals, by the unceasing removal of
                    old particles; but the particles which have once become organized continue
                    permanent until removed by some cause or process foreign to the living powers of
                    the plant. When once, therefore, the organs of plants have become mature, they
                    are exposed to decay only from the operation of foreign causes, and cannot be
                    mined from within by that gradual loss of balance between the secreting and
                    absorbing functions which the advances of age bring on the animal system.
                    Neither, in the vegetable system, can the removal of organized parts under
                    disease, any more than in health, have place; and, consequently, the several
                    modes or stages of ulcerative absorption, so finely illustrated by the
                    researches of Mr Hunter, belong not to the economy of plants.</p>
                <p>As the function of absorption is thus of more limited extent in plants than in
                    animals, so may we expect to find the arrangement of organs destined to its
                    exercise. In the more perfect animals, the absorbent vessels are quite distinct
                    from those which carry blood, are provided everywhere with glands, and, like the
                    veins, are furnished with valves. From their beginnings, in all parts of the
                    body, to their termination, they continually unite with one another, until,
                    after a long course; they form at length two trunks, which deliver their
                    contents into the large veins near the heart. As no common reservoir exists in
                    plants, there is no such single point to which their absorbed fluids require to
                    be carried. Hence their absorbents seem everywhere to have a very short course,
                    to form no union with one another, but to deliver their contents at once into
                    the sap-vessels adjacent to them. They appear to be destitute alike of glands
                    and valves, and indeed, in an anatomical view, they can scarcely be considered
                    distinct from the sap-vessels, but may rather be deemed ramifications from them;
                    so that although we grant, with Grew, that the ordinary sap-vessels do not
                    ramify one out of another, yet they certainly send off those fine ramifications
                    which, from their office, we denominate the absorbents of plants.</p>
                <p>In the root, the absorbents are capable of being demonstrated. When a plant is
                    immersed in coloured fluids, many of its capillary absorbents become tinged
                    through their whole course to their termination in the sap-vessels, proving them
                    to be simple ramifications from these vessels themselves. A further proof of the
                    identity of these two systems is derived from the fact, that any part of a
                    sapvessel is not only capable of emitting capillary absorbents from its sides,
                    but of exercising itself an absorbent function, whenever its cut extremity is
                    brought into contact with a fluid. These absorbents are formed very speedily and
                    in great multitudes on the roots of annual plants; and even in perennial plants
                    they appear, like the leaves, to suffer an annual decay, and to be reproduced
                    with the return of vegetation.</p>
                <p>Μ. de Candolle describes a structure as existing at the extremities of the roots
                    and of the pistil, and also on the outer coat of seeds, which possesses a
                    peculiar aptitude for absorption. To this structure he gives the name of
                    spon-giole: it is composed of small round cells, and in roots is situated at all
                    their fibrous extremities. The entire body of each radical fibril is indeed made
                    up of an analogous cellular tissue; but it is the extremity alone which actually
                    absorbs, and which therefore possesses <hi rend="italic">a</hi> peculiar
                    absorbent or hygroscopic power. The pistillary spongioles are in like manner
                    situated at the extremity of that organ, and absorb the fecundating liquor. The
                    third variety, or seminal spongioles <hi rend="italic">(spongiolae</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">seminales),</hi> are placed on the surface of the grain,
                    apparently with great regularity; and by them the absorption of moisture is
                    effected. Not only water, but coloured liquors, are absorbed by these
                    spongioles, though the molecules of such liquids never enter the ordinary pores
                    of plants, which pores must be infinitely greater than the apertures with which
                    the spongiolcs may be furnished. This is the more remarkable, says Μ. de
                    Candolle, when we call to mind that these colouring molecules traverse the
                    compact and almost stony coats of seeds, and yet do not enter leaves whose
                    tissue is so lax, and which are visibly furnished with pores that have the power
                    of absorbing water when in contact with it. <hi rend="italic">( Organog.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Végétale,</hi> tome i. chap. 7.)</p>
                <p>But plants absorb fluids by other parts of their surface as well as by the roots.
                    This absorbing power extends, in some of the lower tribes, over the entire
                    surface of the vegetable, which is destitute of any organ analogous to a root;
                    in other instances, where the roots are small and the soil arid, the plant
                    derives almost all its moisture by the absorption of dews through the leaves.
                    The experiments of Bonnet show that all leaves, both those of herbs and of
                    trees, when brought into contact with water, are capable of absorbing it, and
                    that the moisture thus absorbed is communicated through the vascular system of
                    the leaf. The leaves of herbs he found to absorb nearly alike from either
                    surface; but those of trees absorbed best by the lower surface. The petiole and
                    larger riblets appeared to absorb much less than the other parts of the leaf. So
                    great and general is this absorbing power, that vegetables, says he, may be said
                    to be planted in the air, nearly as they are in the earth, the leaves being to
                    the branches what the capillary rootlets are to the roots. <hi rend="italic"

                <p>What then are the organs by which this function is carried on in the leaf? Μ.
                    Bonnet imagined the vessels of the leaves to receive their fluids through the
                    pores adjacent to them; and that the leaves, which had only few pores, possessed
                    but little absorbent power. <hi rend="italic">(Ibid.</hi> p. 20, 22.) He
                    thought, also, that the hairs frequently distributed over the leaf attracted
                    moisture, and might even act as absorbents; though he admits that many leaves
                    which have only slight inequalities on their surface, without hairs, exercise an
                    absorbent function. <hi rend="italic">(Ibid.</hi> p. 47.)</p>
                <p>This subject has been since investigated by Μ. de Candolle, whose researches
                    appear to confirm the account of Bonnet as to the absorbing power of the pores.
                    According to him, these pores are found on all parts of the leaf except the
                    riblets, which have none, but are covered with hairs. At the mouth of the pore a
                    vascular net-work is always to be found, which he regards as a production from
                    the larger vessels of the leaf. He asserts that pores are found only in those
                    parts where vessels go to terminate, and not in others; and that in trees this
                    structure occurs chiefly on the lower surface of the leaf, while in herbs it is
                    equally seen on both surfaces. The stem in general has few or no pores, except
                    where it is soft and herbaceous; and even then the pores occur only in the
                    deeper green furrows, not on the prominent lines which bound them, and are
                    usually covered with hairs. No pores are to be found on roots or bulbs or fleshy
                    fruits, but most of the organs above ground are more or less furnished with
                    them. Exposure to the air seems necessary to their formation; for plants, or
                    parts of plants, that live beneath water or earth, are destitute of pores, but
                    acquire them if brought into the free air. Exclusion of light prevents also the
                    formation of pores; and hence etiolated plants are not furnished with them. <hi

                    xml:id="kp-eb0703-6289-0056"/>istence of pores in leaves agreed with the results
                    of Bonnet’s experiments on the absorbing power of their surfaces; and when we
                    consider that all plants and parts of plants secluded from the air are at the
                    same time destitute of pores, and of the power of absorbing by their surfaces,
                    it may be inferred that the organs of absorption on the external surfaces of
                    plants are the minute vascular productions which, in tender and succulent parts
                    exposed to the air and light, everywhere perforate the cuticle, and form in it
                    those innumerable orifices which we denominate pores.</p>
                <p>But the function of absorption in plants is not confined to the taking up of
                    extraneous matters. Many facts prove that, in every part where active vegetation
                    exists, <hi rend="italic">internal absorption</hi> is continually going on. The
                    organs by which this absorption is immediately performed cannot, perhaps, from
                    their extreme delicacy and minuteness, be rendered capable of anatomical
                    demonstration; but certain facts which occur in plants, coupled with certain
                    analogies derived from other organized textures, must, we think, carry complete
                    conviction of their existence. In almost every part, and on every surface of
                    animal bodies, the vessels which exercise absorption may be traced; but the
                    mouths or orifices by which they actually absorb are scarcely ever to be seen.
                    In one instance only, viz. in the intestines, have they been followed to their
                    beginnings, and discovered in the act of exercising their appropriate function.
                    (Gordon’s <hi rend="italic">System of Human Anat.</hi> vol. i. p. 70.) But
                    though their orifices remain in other parts undiscovered, no anatomist hesitates
                    to admit their existence when he sees the canals of the vessels themselves laden
                    with blood, or milk, or bile; and seeing them thus to convey fluids whose colour
                    manifests their presence, he equally believes them capable of absorbing and
                    conveying other fluids, though they may not be visible to the eye. Believing
                    further, that no solid part of the body, nor even fluid part that has been
                    deposited in close cavities, can be removed in a natural manner from its place,
                    but by the agency of these vessels, he comes to regard the simple fact of the
                    disappearance of such solid or fluid part as sufficient evidence of its
                    absorption.</p>
                <p>Now the facts and analogies on which <hi rend="italic">internal</hi> absorption
                    rests in the vegetable system are precisely of the same nature, and the evidence
                    of its existence is scarcely less complete. In every part of the cellular tissue
                    of plants various substances have been found which must have been primarily
                    derived from the vessels, the only organs which furnish new materials to the
                    plant. These substances, however, often disappear from the cells, and are again
                    to be detected in the vascular system. Thus, in the seed, as will afterwards be
                    shown, the cells of the cotyledon contain a solid unorganized matter, which
                    could have been originally deposited in them only by means of the vessels.
                    During germination, this solid matter is rendered fluid, disappears from the
                    cells, and is again to be traced in the vessels on its way to afford nutriment
                    to the radicle and plume. We say, then, that this unorganized matter must have
                    been taken up from the cells of the cotyledon, and conveyed into the vascular
                    system, by the agency of absorbent vessels, which, it is probable, are
                    distributed everywhere on the inner surface of these cells; just as, in the
                    animal system, absorbent vessels are considered to take up the fat from the
                    inner surface of the cells in which it is deposited, and convey it into the
                    vessels of the animal.</p>
                <p>This alternate absorption and deposition of the nutrient matter of seeds is
                    sometimes strikingly displayed in the growth of potatoes. It frequently happens
                    that potatoes lying in a damp cellar put forth shoots which grow to a
                    considerable size, without the access of any foreign agents except heat, water,
                    and air. On these shoots young bulbs, as large as the eggs of pigeons, are
                    sometimes to be found, and the substance of the old bulb has in great part
                    disappeared. In such cases, the matter from the cells of the old bulb must be
                    considered as removed by absorption, and conveyed into the vessels of the shoot,
                    where it was in part employed in forming the new organs of the young bulb, and
                    in part deposited, to experience, perhaps, in some future growth, similar
                    successions of removal and deposition. In the living parts of perennial plants,
                    also, nutrient matter appears to be alternately deposited and absorbed from the
                    cells during the active periods of vegetation; and in the cellular tissue of
                    herbaceous plants a similar deposition and absorption of fluids seems to be
                    frequently taking place; so that, in all the vegetating parts of plants, these
                    alternate functions of secretion and absorption are more or less constantly
                    exercised.</p>
                <p>A good illustration of the manner in which these functions are alternately
                    exercised is afforded by an experiment of Μ. de Candolle. The parasitic plant
                    called misletoe draws its nourishment, as is well known, from the tree on which
                    it grows. Μ. de Candolle placed a branch of an apple-tree, bearing a stalk of
                    misletoe, in an infusion of cochineal for five days. He then dissected it, and
                    observed the coloured liquor to have risen through the wood and alburnum of the
                    apple-branch, and reached the place of junction between it and the misletoe,
                    which it strongly reddened; and from thence it penetrated into the woody part of
                    the misletoe. There did not, however, appear to be a true anastomosis between
                    the vessels of these different plants; but, at the base of the misletoe, where
                    the parts were so deeply reddened, a minute cellular structure was observed.
                    Into these cells the vascular system of the apple appeared to deposit its sap,
                    and from them the capillary absorbents of the misletoe, distributed upon the
                    cells, seemed, like the ordinary absorbents of roots, to take it up. <hi
                    rend="italic">(Mém. de l’lnstit. Nat.</hi> tome i. p. 370.) From these and many
                    similar facts it may be inferred, that absorbents, communicating with the
                    vessels of the plant, exist in every part, and that the removal of all secreted
                    matters from the cells and other close cavities of the vegetable, when effected
                    by the living powers of the plant, is accomplished, as in animal bodies, by the
                    exercise of an absorbent function.</p>

                <p>But from their external surface, and from the same parts as we have seen to
                    exercise an <hi rend="italic">absorbent</hi> function, plants, in certain
                    circumstances, give off a large quantity of fluid by <hi rend="italic"
                    >transpiration;</hi> and the organs by which this function is performed seem,
                    from many considerations, to be the same as those by which, under other
                    circumstances, absorption is accomplished. This function of transpiration is
                    common to all terrestrial plants, and, with few exceptions, all are more or less
                    furnished with pores; hut it does not occur in aquatic plants, according to De
                    Candolle, which are destitute of pores. Fleshy leaves and fruits, and the petals
                    of flowers, which have but few pores, transpire little; and etiolated plants,
                    which are destitute of pores, do not transpire at all. On the contrary,
                    herbaceous stems and plants, which have numerous pores, throw off most fluid by
                    transpiration. This general agreement between the existence of pores and the
                    exercise of the transpiratory function leads to the presumption that they are
                    the orifices through which the fluids are discharged; and if it be admitted that
                    these pores are situated at the extremity of the fine ramifications that come
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:193096302" xml:id="kp-eb0703-6302-0057"/>’ off from the
                    vessels, their fitness for such an office cannot be denied. Comparing these
                    facts regarding transpiration with those previously stated concerning
                    absorption, Μ. de Candolle is led to conclude that the pores on the surfaces of
                    plants are the organs by which these functions are alternately carried on,
                    according to the existing condition of dryness or humidity in the surrounding
                    atmosphere-</p>
                <p>Repulsive as this conclusion may at first seem to our ordinary conceptions of
                    organized bodies, yet there are many circumstances in the structure and habits
                    of plants that give to it great probability; so much so, that we ourselves had
                    long since reached the same point by a route different from that pursued by Μ.
                    de Candolle. It is highly probable that the exhalents of the leaves are simple
                    ramifications from the larger vessels, like the capillary rootlets; and as they
                    have no valves in their canal, there is no mechanical impediment to their
                    exercising an inverted action. The sap-vessels themselves readily absorb even
                    coloured fluids when inverted; and though their exhalent terminations are too
                    fine to receive such fluids, yet why may they not, like the trunks from which
                    they spring, be capable of taking up ordinary fluids in that manner? The fluids
                    absorbed through the leaves must at once enter the sap-vesśels, for there is no
                    common reservoir to which they can first be carried; and it is extremely
                    improbable that, from the same parts of the same vessels, exhalents and
                    absorbents, capable of exercising only opposite functions, should at the same
                    time arise. In the animal system the exhalents spring from arteries, and the
                    absorbents terminate in veins; but in the less complex structure of plants it
                    seems demonstrable that both orders of vessels must at once communicate with the
                    same sap-vessels. It is therefore more probable to suppose that, instead of two
                    distinct orders of vessels, as in animals,, one only should be provided,
                    capable, under different circumstances, of exercising different functions. This
                    vicarious office of the organs under consideration leads to no confusion in its
                    exercise; for the condition of the atmosphere, which favours transpiration, is
                    that which removes from the leaves the power of absorption; and, on the
                    contrary, absorption occurs only in a humid atmosphere, when, as Hales has
                    shown, little or no transpiration takes place.</p>
                <p>Besides exhalation carried on through visible pores, plants, like other bodies,
                    lose their humidity by simple evaporation. This evaporation seems to go on in a
                    moderate degree under favourable circumstances by day and by night, and is quite
                    distinct from the copious transpiration that is carried on by the agency of
                    solar light through the pores. That the pores are exhaling organs, was an
                    opinion first advanced by Hedwig, and subsequently illustrated *by De Candolle,
                    Sprengel, Link, and Rudolphi. <hi rend="italic">(Organog.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Végétale,</hi> tome i. p. 86.) In like manner, though absorption may be carried
                    on in certain circumstances through the pores of leaves, yet there are plants
                    which largely imbibe water, but in which few or no pores have been detected.
                    Thus, fleshy leaves which have lost their moisture quickly regain it either when
                    plunged in water or exposed to rain, though they possess but few pores; and’;
                    The aquatic algae, says Μ. de Candolle, evidently imbibe water over their whole
                    surface, though they are wholly destitute of pores. He supposes that, beside the
                    ordinary pores which may be readily seen, plants may be furnished with others
                    that are invisible from their extreme minuteness. By such pores we might account
                    for the loss of weight which plants destitute of visible pores gradually undergo
                    when exposed to the free air, and also for the increase of weight which mosses,
                    and other plants equally destitute of pores, rapidly acquire when plunged in
                    water. <hi rend="italic">(Organog. Végét.</hi> tome i. p. 88.)</p>
                <p>The view thus presented of the <hi rend="italic">external</hi> absorbent and
                    exhalent vessels may probably be extended to the' minute vascular productions
                    which seem everywhere toļ spring from the vessels <hi rend="italic"
                    >internally.</hi> If secreting and absorbing vessels be held to exist in every
                    part of the plant, ∣ they must everywhere communicate with the vascular system;
                    for it is from the vessels of this system that the matter of their secretions is
                    primarily derived, and it is into the same vessels that, in many cases, these
                    secretions are subsequently returned. Nor does the exercise of the two functions
                    of secretion and absorption in plants present. any apparent obstacle to the
                    supposition of their being performed at different times by the same organs.
                    Thus, when nutrient matter is deposited in the cellular tissue of the seed, it
                    is destined only for a future use; and the purpose of nature would be defeated
                    were an absorbent function to be at the same time employed for its removal. On
                    the other hand, when this matter is again taken up during the germination of the
                    seed, no secreting function seems then to be exercised in that part; for the
                    organ itself, in many seeds, gradually wastes, and no fresh matter is deposited
                    in it. Even when the, cotyledon to a certain extent augments in size, its
                    nutrient matter is continually drawn off for the support of the, radicle and
                    plume, and no fresh matter of the same kind seems to be then deposited; so that
                    the same vessels which formerly exercised the function of secretion may, without
                    disturbing the economy of the plant, be now employed in the exercise of
                    absorption. As thus the two functions do not require to be performed in the same
                    part at the same time, they may, if nothing else forbid, be exercised at
                    different times by the same organs. In the animal system, where the organs
                    themselves are removed, secreting and absorbing vessels must necessarily
                    co-exist; and to maintain the integrity of parts, their functions must proceed
                    at the same time, and to a certain extent balance each other; but as no similar
                    operations appear to be carried on in the vegetable system, no such complex
                    organization is required to sustain them.</p>

                    <hi rend="italic">Description and Structure of the Cells.</hi></p>
                <p>The elementary organ denominated <hi rend="italic">cellular tissue</hi> may: be
                    said to consist of a membranous substance, disposed into a great number of small
                    circumscribed cavities, connected with each other, and arranged in rows or
                    suites, generally in a direction opposed to that of the tubes, which represent
                    the vascular system. From Grew it received the appellation of <hi rend="italic"
                    >parenchyma,</hi> a term still often used in describing different parts of this
                    tissue; by Malpighi, it was called the <hi rend="italic">utricular
                    substance</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and it owes, we believe, its present name
                    to Μ. du Hamel.</p>
                <p>The cavities which distinguish its construction were: called indifferently bags
                    or bladders, pores and cells, by Grew; by Malpighi, utricles; by others,
                    vesicles; and more commonly cells. The form of these cells varies so much, not
                    only in different plants, but in different parts of the same plant, as to have
                    authorized, in. some degree, these different appellations. The tissue which they
                    constitute enters into the composition of every organ in the more perfect
                    plants. Of many herbaceous plants it forms the chief portion, and some of the
                    lower tribes of vegetables, as the algae, lichens, mushrooms, &amp;c. are said
                    to be wholly composed of it; in other words, no vessels can be <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193096315" xml:id="kp-eb0703-6315-0058"/>actually demonstrated in
                    them. In most cases it contributes greatly to modify the form of organs, and
                    adds always to their bulk and strength. Nothing can exceed the diversity of
                    appearance in figure, bulk, and texture, which it exhibits in the several parts,
                    circumstances, and conditions in which it is placed. It represents sometimes a
                    lax cellular substance, all the parts of which are succulent and transparent; in
                    other instances it is compressed into a solid, opaque body, retaining but faint
                    traces of its former cellularity; and in others, again, it is spread out into a
                    most thin and delicate membrane, in which the cellular character is wholly lost.
                    It everywhere envelopes and holds together the vascular system, and seems to be
                    the général receptacle of almost all the vegetable secretions.</p>
                <p>The figure of the component cells of this tissue is exceedingly various.
                    Sometimes they have nearly a globular or spheroidal shape; in other instances
                    they are angular, and exhibit in their section a greater or lesser number of
                    sides and angles, being in a few examples triangular; in others square, but more
                    commonly hexagonal, the figure which collections of soft cells, mutually
                    impressing each other, seem naturally disposed to assume. This form is
                    represented in the transverse section of cells, fig. 28, Plate XXXVIII.; they
                    seem in this figure, and in most of those given in different works, to possess
                    double sides; but, as Μ. Kieser has remarked <hi rend="italic">(Mém. sur</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">l’</hi><hi rend="italic">Organisât.</hi><hi rend="italic">des
                    Plantes,</hi> p. 91), this appearance is produced by the borders of the
                    subjacent cells being seen through the transparent sides of the superior layer.
                    In Plate XXXIX. fig. 16, is a representation of a transverse slice of the
                    cellular part of sugar-cane, drawn from nature, and so thin as to exhibit only
                    one layer of cells, in which the sides appear distinctly single; but, in a
                    thicker slice of the same plant, fig. 21, comprehending more than one layer, the
                    double appearance becomes very evident.</p>
                <p>The size of the cells varies not less than their figure in different plants and
                    in different parts of the same plant. In one of the plates of Grew they are
                    represented as possessing twenty different sizes, from that of a minute pore, to
                    the size of a common pea. Hooke examined them in cork, and in the pith of many
                    plants. In cork he reckoned several lines of these cells or pores, as he calls
                    them, and found there were about sixty placed endwise in one eighteenth part of
                    an inch, or somewhat more than a thousand in the length of an inch; and,
                    therefore, in a square inch above a million, and in a cubic inch above 1200
                    millions. <hi rend="italic">(Micrographia,</hi> p. 114.) In this substance the
                    cells are not visible by the naked eye, but become very distinct when highly
                    magnified. In most plants, however, they are readily visible, and their
                    appearance is familiar to every one.</p>
                <p>When viewed in a longitudinal section, their hexagonal form is much less
                    distinct, and is sometimes wholly lost. In fig. 22, Plate XXXIX., is a series of
                    single columns of the cells of sugar-cane, in which each cell is, to appearance,
                    bounded only by four sides. Similar representations are given by Hooke of the
                    cells in cork, and by Kieser in most of the figures which exhibit longitudinal
                    sections of the cellular tissue; but in some instances the hexagonal form is
                    visible even in these sections. In fig. 23 of the 'βame plate we have given, in
                    outline, the appearance of two series of columns of these transparent cells, in
                    which one series is seen behind the other, and gives somewhat of the confused
                    double appearance exhibited in the transverse section, fig. 21.</p>
                <p>The nature of the matter contained in the . cells of this tissue varies according
                    to the part in which it exists, and the peculiar powers of the plant. Both Hooke
                    and Grew remarked, that in the pith and bark of succulent plants the cells were
                    often filled with aqueous juices, and in the same plant, at other periods, they
                    appeared empty, or filled only with air. In the seed, the cells of the
                    cotyledons contain minute unorganized particles, which, at a future period,
                    serve as nutriment for the young plantule. Other particles of still smaller
                    size, of a resinous nature and a green colour, exist in other parts of this
                    tissue, and bestow on the plant its verdure. In every part of the plant these
                    cells are also the occasional receptacles of the peculiar fluids which both the
                    sap-vessels and the proper vessels convey; and hence various gummy and resinous
                    substances, corresponding in quality to the fluids previously existing in the
                    vascular system, are frequently detected in them. In the pulp of fruits, the
                    various acid, saccharine, and austere juices that we meet with, are contained in
                    different modifications of this tissue; and it is into its cells that the
                    osseous secretions, which constitute their shells and stones, are made. These
                    facts prove not only the great importance of this tissue in the construction of
                    the vegetable organs, but the active share it bears in the economy of their
                    functions; and demonstrate likewise an universal communication between the
                    vessels and the cells.</p>
                <p>The sides of these cells, when emptied of their contents, and viewed through the
                    microscope, appear to be formed by a very fine transparent membrane, which some
                    maintain to be everywhere entire, and others to be perforated with pores. The
                    same sources of error exist here as before noticed in similar microscopical
                    observations on the vascular system; and, accordingly, the respective disputants
                    maintain, with equal confidence, the same opinions with regard to the porosity
                    or non-porosity of the cells, as they had previously held concerning the
                    vessels. We must therefore call in the aid of other means besides those of the
                    microscope, for determining the important fact whether the cells have or have
                    not any direct communication with each other.</p>
                <p>Dr Hooke examined the films or sides of the cells of cork, of the pith of elder,
                    and of many other plants, for' the very purpose of discovering whether any
                    direct communication existed between them; but “each cavern or cell,” says he,
                    “is distinctly separate from the rest, without any kind of hole in the
                    encompassing films nor could he, with his microscope, nor by his breath, nor by
                    any other way that he tried, “discover a passage out of one of those cavities
                    into another.” <hi rend="italic">{Micrographia,</hi> p. 116.) Dr Grew describes
                    the little cells or bladders that compose the bark of roots as possessing a
                    spheroidal shape in most plants. When viewed with the microscope, their sides
                    are as transparent as water; and “none of them,” he adds, “are visibly pervious
                    from one into another, but each is bounded within itself.” <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Anat. of Plants,</hi> p. 64.) Both Hooke and Grew, however, believed a
                    communication to exist between the cells, from the fact of their containing
                    liquor; and Malpighi held the same opinion from similar considerations; but they
                    nowhere describe the mode or structure by which they conceived it to be
                    accomplished.</p>
                <p>Later writers have not only adopted this opinion, but professed to demonstrate
                    the. structure by which the communication is maintained. Μ. Mirbel describes the
                    sides of the cells as composed of an extremely thin, colourless, and transparent
                    membrane, which is commonly perforated with pores, the diameter of whose
                    aperture is not perhaps the 300th part of a millimetre. These pores are ranged
                    generally in transverse series, and through them, it is said, the cellular
                    tissue both receives fluids. from the vessels, and transmits them very slowly
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:193096328" xml:id="kp-eb0703-6328-0059"/>through its
                    cells. <hi rend="italic">(Exposition</hi><hi rend="italic">de la Théorie,</hi>
                    &amp;c. p. 105.) Μ. Sprengel and some others adopt this view of the porosity of
                    the cells; but it is denied by Link, Treviranus, and Kieser. The latter author
                    declares, that notwithstanding all that has been said concerning the pores in
                    the sides of the cells, his observations, made with the greatest care and
                    exactness, have not enabled him to discover the slightest trace of them. The
                    sides of the cells, he adds, are always formed by a membrane extremely thin, but
                    altogether smooth and uniform; and the cells themselves have never an open
                    communication with each other. (Kieser <hi rend="italic">sur</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">l’</hi><hi rend="italic">Organisât.</hi><hi rend="italic">des
                    Plantes,</hi> p. 94.)</p>
                <p>If, then, no pores exist in the sides of the cells for the reception and
                    transmission of the fluids they contain, some other means must be provided for
                    the accomplishment of these objects. Μ. Link, accordingly, supposes the juices
                    to pass from one cell to another by <hi rend="italic">transudation.</hi> Μ.
                    Rudolphi thinks that a <hi rend="italic">decomposition of the fluid</hi> is
                    effected by the cells themselves, during which it is transmitted through their
                    sides; and Μ. Dutrochet calls in the aid of electrical agency. To us there occur
                    no probable means of accomplishing these operations, consistently with the
                    integrity of the cellular structure, but the exercise of those alternate
                    functions of secretion and absorption which, from so many other considerations,
                    we have supposed to be carried on in every living part of the vegetable
                    system.</p>
                <p>Another question of importance in relation to the sides of the cells is, whether
                    they are single or double; that is, whether each cell has a side of its own, or
                    whether one side is in every position common to two cells. Mirbel •asserts the
                    former, and Kieser maintains the latter opinion. In fig. 29, Plate XXXVIII., is
                    an outline representation of these double sides as given by Kieser. From the
                    extreme thinness of the membrane, it is very difficult, he says, to distinguish
                    this double structure; but where the cells are large, and a glass that magnifies
                    highly is employed, each partition that separates two cells is distinctly seen
                    to be composed of two membranes, which are sometimes separated about the middle
                    of the partition, and united towards the angular points. <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Mém.</hi><hi rend="italic">sur</hi><hi rend="italic">ĭ</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Organisai.</hi><hi rend="italic">des Plantes,</hi> p. 91.) MM. Amici,
                    Dutrochet, De Candolle, and others, support this opinion. (See <hi rend="italic"
                    >Organog. Veg.</hi> tome i. p. 21.) The existence of this double structure
                    receives some countenance from the fact observed in the construction of the
                    honeycomb by the late Dr Barclay, who says that each side of every cell in the
                    comb is composed of two plates, or is double. (<hi rend="italic">Wernerian
                    Transactions,</hi> vol. ii.) It may still, however, be more properly said, that
                    each side of every cell is truly single, and is rendered double only by coming
                    into contact with the corresponding side of an adjacent cell.</p>
                <p> When the cells have a regular hexagonal figure, and arc equally distended with
                    their appropriate juices, there is no reason to suppose that any vacuities are
                    left between their sides or angles. Mathematicians have long since demonstrated
                    a regular hexagon to be one of those figures that completely fill up a given
                    space; and that no vacuities can exist either about its sides or its angles.
                    Where, however, the cells deviate from this regular figure, and more or less
                    approach to a spherical form, vacuities or interstices may readily be conceived
                    to occur. These vacuities are said to have been first noticed by Grew and
                    Lecuwenhoeck, and afterwards by Μ. Trevira-ríus, who describes them as
                    interstices left between the cells in their mutual approximations towards each
                    other. He gave them the name of <hi rend="italic">intercellular canals,</hi> as
                    already stated.</p>
                <p>On the'other hand,' MM. Mirbel and Rudolphi altogether deny their existence; but
                    Μ. Kieser contends strenuously for it. -He describes them as small interstices
                    situated at the angles of the hexagonal cells, and formed not by any sides of
                    their own, but by the mutual approach of three contiguous cells, and possessing,
                    therefore, a prismatic form. These interstices he conceives to exist at every
                    angle, and thus every cell to be surrounded by them. In fig. 29, Plate XXXVIIL,
                    the black angular points denote their place. By their conjunction with each
                    other they form a canal, which, when the hexagonal figure is perfect, and the
                    cells are ranged horizontally, extends both in a longitudinal and transverse
                    direction; and when the cells are placed obliquely, the canals have a similar
                    direction. Their size varies according to that of the cells, by the sides of
                    which they are constructed; they contain and convey the proper juices in the
                    bark, but in the pith are often dry; and their course is said to terminate only
                    with that of the cells themselves, at the surface of the plant. <hi
                    rend="italic">(Mém.</hi><hi rend="italic">sur</hi><hi rend="italic">l</hi><hi

                    >Organisat. des Plantes,</hi> p. 104.) Such are the organs which, as we have
                    seen, Μ. Kieser considers to convey both the sap and the proper juices in
                    plants. That in some circumstances they may exist, and become reservoirs of the
                    sap or other juices, seems highly probable; but of the impropriety of ascribing
                    to such casual productions the performance of the primary functions of the
                    vegetable system, we have already spoken.</p>
                <p>The cellular tissue, as described above, is that form of it which must be
                    regarded as the most perfect. From various causes, however, it is subject to
                    great alterations. In herbs, and in the pith and succulent parts of trees, the
                    cells preserve their original form and appearance for a considerable time; but
                    by the growth of the other parts, and consequent extension and compression they
                    experience, they acquire in the bark and wood an elongated figure, and this both
                    in a transverse and longitudinal direction. In the latter case they surround and
                    connect the layers of vessels with each other, constituting what has been named
                    the <hi rend="italic">parenchyma</hi> of the bark and wood. In this form their
                    size is often greatly reduced, their cavities sometimes obliterated, and their
                    cellular character altogether effaced. In other instances traces of a cellular
                    structure are occasionally visible, appearing in detached portions among the
                    perpendicular vessels. In some plants the cells become elongated in a
                    longitudinal direction, and yet preserve their capacity nearly unchanged. It was
                    probably this form of cell that led Malpighi to regard sometimes as a vessel,
                    what, in reality, appears to be only a series of elongated cells. To his
                    representation of these cells, as given fig. 18, Plate XXXIX., we have before
                    referred. Μ. Kieser considers these elongated cells as forming the ligneous
                    fibres of the wood, and that the bark is almost entirely formed of them. <hi
                    rend="italic">(Mém.</hi><hi rend="italic">sur</hi><hi rend="italic">l’
                    Organisat∙des Plantes,</hi> p. 99, 101.) These cells, he says, were originally
                    round; but in trees they become so much lengthened as to exhibit the form of a
                    tube. It is easy, however, he adds, to detect transverse partitions in these
                    seeming tubes, which, having often a diagonal direction, give to these cells the
                    form of a double pyramid with sharp points. The membrane which forms these cells
                    is, in all trees except the <hi rend="italic">Coniferae</hi> and some others,
                    smooth, without pores, and transparent. <hi rend="italic">(Ibid.</hi> p. 299.)
                    To these organs Treviranus gave the name of fibrous utricles; by De Candolle
                    they are called tubulated cells; and Dutrochet, from their spindle shape,
                    denominates them, as we have seen, <hi rend="italic">clostres.</hi> His
                    representation of them, fig. 17, Plate XXXIX., corresponds with the foregoing
                    description of Kieser.</p>
                <p>From suffering compression in a transverse direction, the cells have frequently
                    their longer diameter thrown <pb break="no" facs="nls:193096341"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0703-6341-0060"/>into that position, and thus extend from the
                    centre to the circumference of the plant. This position, as will afterwards be
                    shown, was fully noticed by Grew and Malpighi. Lecuwenhoeck also observed it,
                    but mistook the cells thus elongated for vessels, and considered their
                    partitions as valves,—errors which Μ. Kieser, as well as others, duly points
                    out. In this transverse direction the tissue forms partitions more or less large
                    between the vessels, as will afterwards be shown; and by the obliteration of its
                    cells it is frequently reduced to the condition of a solid membrane.</p>
                <p>Besides these more constant and necessary changes in the figure and character of
                    the cellular tissue, it often suffers others of a more casual and accidental
                    nature. In the pith, as the plant grows up, divers ruptures, says Grew, occur,
                    oftentimes very regularly, and observed constantly in the same species of plant.
                    These ruptures are sometimes prolonged, so as to form a tube of considerable
                    length. <hi rend="italic">(Anatomy of Plants,</hi> p. 120.) Others have observed
                    similar canals in the pith, formed not by sides of their own, but by those of
                    the adjacent cells, and very various in size and form. They have been called <hi
                    rend="italic">lacunae,</hi> or reservoirs, contain a variety of substances, and
                    sometimes, especially in aquatic plants, only air. As we have seen the cavities
                    of the larger spiral vessels to be filled with vesicles, so the larger cells of
                    the pith, according to Grew, frequently contain smaller ones, or are divided by
                    cross membranes. A similar observation is made by Kieser, who likewise remarks
                    that, in the empty cells of <hi rend="italic">Calla</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Aethiopica,</hi> he has sometimes seen small round-headed bodies, supported on
                    little peduncles, which spring from the sides, and point towards the centre of
                    the cells. Small crystallized bodies are also occasionally found in the cavities
                    of the cells, and within the intercellular canals. <hi rend="italic">(Mém.

                    cellular tissue, by which its cells are converted into receptacles and
                    reservoirs of the proper juices of the plant, we before discoursed when treating
                    of the proper vessels. To such an extent does this change sometimes proceed,
                    that, in aged oaks, and, according to Kieser, in guaiacum, and probably in many
                    other plants, the whole cellular tissue becomes filled with these secreted
                    matters, and the distinctive characters of the cells, and almost of the vessels
                    themselves, are obliterated and lost.</p>
                <p>CHAP. II.</p>
                <p>THE ANATOMY IN GENERAL OF THE COMMON TEXTURES OF VEGETABLES.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Preliminary Observations.</hi></p>
                <p>The elementary organs, whose description has so long occupied our attention,
                    form, either singly or by their combination, all the other parts of plants. Some
                    of the lower tribes of vegetables consist entirely of cellular tissue, in which
                    no vessels are at any period to be seen; and, even in the higher orders, many
                    parts exhibit no appearance of a vascular structure. There can be little doubt,
                    however, of the existence of such a structure, since, physiologically speaking,
                    we can form no just conception of the growth of an organized body, without
                    associating with it the existence of a vascular system. In all plants the pith
                    consists of a cellular tissue alone. In herbaceous plants this tissue forms
                    their greater portion; but in trees the number of vessels is so great as to
                    constitute the chief bulk of the plant. To certain forms of these elementary
                    organs, whether existing singly or in combination, we have given the name of <hi
                    rend="italic">common textures,</hi> because they are very generally to be found
                    in all plants, and in almost all parts of them, howsoever varied in quantity,
                    proportion, and arrangement. These textures are familiarly known under the names
                    of cuticle or skin, of bark, of wood, and of pith; to which may be assigned the
                    general appellations of the cuticular, the cortical, the ligneous, and medullary
                    textures.</p>
                <p>All the several textures just enumerated are readily distinguished by their
                    different places and characters in the section of most arborescent plants, in
                    which they commonly appear well defined, and perfectly distinct from each other.
                    In many plants, however, both herbs and trees, this distinction of parts is not
                    preserved; but, with the exception of the cuticle, all the other textures are
                    blended together through the entire substance of the plant, as was long since
                    noticed both by Malpighi and Grew. “In the stalk of maize or Indian wheat,” says
                    Grew, “the work of nature appears less diversified; in which, although there are
                    the same parenchymous and ligneous parts as in all other plants, yet is there
                    neither bark nor pith, the vessels being dispersed and mixed with the
                    parenchyma, from the circumference to the centre of the stalk.” “The like
                    structure,” he adds, “may also be seen in the sugar-cane and some other plants.”
                    <hi rend="italic">(Anat. of Plants,</hi> p. 104.) Similar observations were made
                    by Malpighi, not only on different species of wheat and sugarcane, but on ferns
                    and palms. “In ferns,” says he, “the vascular fasciculi are numerous, but placed
                    without order, and are everywhere sustained by the intervening cellular tissue,
                    the cells of which are sometimes much smaller than the orifices of the vessels
                    themselves.” <hi rend="italic">Anat. Plantar.</hi> p. 24, 25.) This structure is
                    represented in the transverse section of the sugar-cane, Plate XXXIX. fig. 25;
                    and in a similar section of the palm, fig. 26 of the same plate.</p>
                <p>This variety of structure, thus clearly described, and distinctly delineated in
                    the works of Malpighi anel Grew, has likewise been noticed by Μ. Desfontaines.
                    Vegetables, according to him, may be distinguished into two divisions: Is/,
                    Those which have no distinct concentric layers, whose solidity decreases from
                    the circumference towards the centre, and whose pith is interposed among the
                    vessels, and does not extend in divergent rays: 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>,
                    Vegetables which have distinct concentric layers, whose solidity decreases from
                    the centre towards the circumference, and whose pith is contained in a
                    longitudinal canal, and extends in divergent rays. The former structure he
                    considers as peculiar to plants whose seeds are monocotyledonous, and the latter
                    as belonging to those which have dicoyledonous seeds. <hi rend="italic">(Mém. de
                    l’lnstitut. Nat.</hi> tome i. p. 478.)</p>
                <p>This opinion, though partly correct, is not universally applicable. That many
                    plants which spring from monocotyledonous seeds are destitute of concentric
                    layers, and have’ no distinct bark or pith, is certain; but it is not less
                    certain that many herbaceous plants, which are produced from dicoyledonous
                    seeds, are pretty much in the same condition, being equally destitute of
                    concentric layers and of divergent rays, and in which the bark and the pith must
                    be regarded as one continuous structure. On the other hand, some
                    monocotyledonous plants, as Μ. Desfontaines admits, may deviate a little from
                    the prescribed conditions. In a paper on the organization of such plants, Μ.
                    Mirbel, who regards this doctrine as the most important step made of late years
                    in Vegetable Anatomy, says, nevertheless, it would be erroneous to assert that
                    they have never a bark. In several species of plants he produces examples to the
                    contrary; and adds, that in Some instances their diametral growth goes on at the
                    cir <pb break="no" facs="nls:193096354" xml:id="kp-eb0703-6354-0061"
                    />cumference, which would seem to approximate them to dicoyledons. As, however,
                    there is no appearance of divergent rays, or of concentric layers, these
                    examples are considered by him rather to confirm than overturn the theory of Μ.
                    Desfontaines. <hi rend="italic">(Annales du Mus.</hi><hi rend="italic">d</hi> ’
                    <hi rend="italic">Hist. Nat.</hi> tome xiii. p. 67.) But if in this theory its
                    second division embrace only those plants in which the concentric layers are
                    perfect, and divergent rays exist, then it excludes a great number of herbaceous
                    plants, whose seeds have two cotyledons; and if the absence of these regular
                    layers, and of divergent rays, serve as a passport to the first division, then
                    many of these same plants must be admitted among those whose seeds, have but one
                    cotyledon. The theory of Μ. Desfontaines, therefore, rests on too partial an
                    observation of the structure of plants.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Section</hi> I.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Of the Pith or Medullary Texture.</hi></p>
                <p>The pith (medulla) of plants, when present, occupies the centre of the stem,
                    where it is commonly surrounded by a circle of vessels which construct for it an
                    appropriate canal. In the succulent shoots of trees, its proportion to the other
                    parts is generally large; but it diminishes as the tree advances in age, and is
                    frequently entirely obliterated. Where the vessels of the wood are few in
                    number, as in herbs, only a few fasciculi are seen to surround the pith, and the
                    intervening spaces are occupied by a boundary of thickened cellular tissue. In
                    some plants, again, no pith whatever exists, but the stem is hollow or tubular.
                    In other instances, and especially in roots, the centre of the stem is occupied
                    by vessels; and in others, both cells and vessels, promiscuously blended
                    together, constitute the centre of the stem.</p>
                <p>In those plants where the pith is present, and possesses its most perfect form,
                    it is seen to be composed entirely of cellular tissue, possessing often very
                    different shades of colour, but, in its anatomical characters, resembling
                    exactly the description already given of that tissue. Its bulk in different
                    plants is exceedingly different, as are also the form and size of its cells. It
                    is frequently entirely insulated by the surrounding vessels, but is often
                    continuous with the cellular tissue of the bark. Its cells contain, especially
                    in the early age of the plant, aqueous fluids, which afterwards disappear, and
                    then the cells become fi∏cd only with air. The “proper juices” of the plant may
                    also be sometimes detected in the cells of the pith. Of the ruptures produced in
                    it by desiccation and other causes, we have already spoken in discoursing of the
                    cellular tissue: they occur particularly in succulent plants, where the cells
                    are large, and their sides thin; so that as the plant advances to maturity, the
                    pith breaks and shrinks up, making the trunk a pipe. (Grew’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Anatomy of Plants.</hi> p. 129.) We have also noticed the fact, that, within
                    the cavities of the larger cells of the pith, new vesicular productions are
                    sometimes found.</p>
                <p>Grew speaks of the existence of vessels in the pith of certain plants, as in that
                    of the fig and the pine; but he adds, that they are usually so postured as to
                    form a ring about its margin. <hi rend="italic">(Anatomy of Plants,</hi> p.
                    119.) They are doubtless to be considered as enlarged <hi rend="italic">proper
                    vessels,</hi> which made a part of the first ligneous circle, and have retained
                    therefore nearly the situation in which they were originally formed. Hence, as
                    he observes, they are of divers kinds, answerable to those of the bark,
                    containing in the fig a milky juice, and in the pine a resinous substance.
                    Similar vessels, containing a “proper juice,” were observed also in the pith of
                    elder by Malpighi, who seems to regard such appearances as common where .the.
                    contained juice concretes or possesses a dark colour. <hi rend="italic">(Anat.
                    Plantar,</hi> p. 4.) It is probable, however, that the organs here considered to
                    be vessels may in some cases be cells, into which these juices have been poured;
                    but where real vessels of this kind are found, they are not to be considered as
                    a part of the original structure of the pith, but occurring only in consequence
                    of the changes which the vegetable body undergoes in the progress of its
                    growth.</p>
                <p>The general ∙ nature of the pith is thus clearly announced by Grew. “Although,”
                    says he, “it have a different name from the <hi rend="italic">parenchyma</hi> in
                    the bark and the <hi rend="italic">insertions</hi> in the wood, yet, as to its
                    substance, it is the very same with them both; whereof there is a double
                    evidence, viz. their continuity and the sameness of their texture so that all
                    these parts are “one entire piece of work, being only filled up in divers
                    manners with the vessels.” <hi rend="italic">(Anatomy of Plants,</hi> p. 119.)
                    This continuity of the pith with the cellular tissue, of the bark, by means of
                    the insertions or transverse ranges of <hi rend="italic">utriculi,</hi> as he
                    calls them, is also adduced by Malpighi as evidence of the similarity of their
                    nature, and of the pith being, as it were, an intercepted portion of the bark
                    <hi rend="italic">(Anat. Plantar,</hi> p. 4, 30); an opinion which seems
                    abundantly confirmed by the intermixture of the medullary and cortical textures
                    in many plants, in which, as already remarked, the distinctive characters of
                    bark and pith are alike lost, and the entire stem exhibits only one uniform
                    appearance of structure.</p>
                <p>The term <hi rend="italic">medulla,</hi> employed by the ancients to note this
                    texture, derived its origin, no doubt, from the resemblance which the pith in
                    the centre of trees bore to the marrow in the bones of animals; and as the same
                    term, in animal anatomy, was incorrectly employed to express alike the marrow in
                    the bones and the nervous substance in the vertebral column, so the same
                    latitude of signification has been extended to the vegetable system. Hence, as
                    Malpighi remarks, the medulla in vegetables was regarded as analogous in its
                    nature to the brain of animals,—a doctrine which even later writers have
                    continued to espouse. It is not our present intention to describe the uses of
                    the pith, but only to remove erroneous opinions concerning its nature, and
                    restore to it that just anatomical character long since assigned it by Malpighi
                    and Grew, and which some writers have of late put forth as a considerable
                    novelty.</p>

                <p>Immediately surrounding and enveloping the pith is the part called the wood <hi

                    It is essentially composed of vessels and of cellular tissue, but combined in
                    such an infinite variety of proportions, and exhibiting such a boundless
                    diversity of forms, that it is difficult to seize even its more general
                    features, without the risk of extending our description beyond the limits which
                    our plan necessarily prescribes.</p>
                <p>Except in those vegetables in which no .vessels have been hitherto demonstrated,
                    but in which they must nevertheless be presumed to exist, this texture may be
                    considered to form a part not only of every plant, but of all its organs; for
                    into whatever part fluids are conveyed, vessels must be sůpposed to extend; and
                    wherever vessels are present, cellular tissue is to be found: hence, in its
                    distribution, it may be considered the most universal of all the textures. In
                    trees, the vessels, as we have frequently remarked, are very numerous, and, when
                    viewed in a transverse section, are seen to be disposed in layers or concentric
                    circles around the axis, and to stand also in <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193096367" xml:id="kp-eb0703-6367-0062"/>lines or radii, diverging
                    from the centre of the tree. (See fig. 4, Plate XL.) Between each line or ray of
                    vessels a thin partition of cellular tissue is interposed, which extends in the
                    direction of the ray, through the entire substance of the wood. At certain
                    distances, varying in different trees, thicker transverse portions of the same
                    substance are placed, and are readily distinguishable in almost every species of
                    wood. Between each layer that is annually added to the wood, and each of the
                    smaller layers that go to the formation of the larger one, cellular tissue seems
                    also in some trees to be longitudinally interposed; so that it is probable that
                    in both directions each fasciculus of vessels is intercepted by cellular tissue,
                    and that in such trees no two fasciculi are on any side in immediate contact
                    with each other. It is even probable that the individual vessels which
                    contribute to form the fasciculi are themselves connected by intervening
                    cellular tissue, which acts like the <hi rend="italic">neurilema</hi> that holds
                    together the filaments of the fasciculi in the nerves, or the cellular substance
                    that connects the primary filaments in the muscular fibres of animals. In this
                    manner, the whole vascular system of the plant is everywhere connected and held
                    together by cellular tissue. Of this tissue, and the different figures its cells
                    acquire, from the different modes and degrees of compression to which they are
                    exposed, we have already spoken.</p>
                <p>In many trees, however, as palms, the vascular fasciculi, though numerous, are
                    much less abundant than in the examples just referred to. They are consequently
                    placed at a greater distance from each other, and, not being disposed in regular
                    lines, do not constitute that radiant appearance so common in ordinary trees,
                    but are promiscuously dispersed through the cellular tissue. (See fig. 26, Plate
                    XXXIX.) As this tissue itself is not, from the same causes, compressed either in
                    the direction or to the extent before described, the smaller membranous
                    partitions that divide the vascular radii from each other are not produced;
                    neither, for similar reasons, is there any distinct appearance of the larger
                    partitions that, at certain distances, intersect the diameter of other trees.
                    The cellular tissue, therefore, in such plants, retains more of its primitive
                    character, and appears everywhere to surround the vascular fasciculi, but
                    nowhere to be so compressed as to form solid partitions between them. In some
                    plants which possess this structure, as the sugar-cane (fig. 25, Plate XXXIX.),
                    the cells indeed retain their perfect forms; and even the fasciculi of vessels,
                    though standing at considerable distances from each other, have towards the
                    centre of the plant a symmetrical arrangement. This latter circumstance is
                    observable in many other plants, which have even fewer vessels than the
                    sugar-cane; so that it is probable that, in the first instance, it takes place
                    in all; and that the irregular position of the vessels in the palm and similar
                    trees, particularly towards their circumference, proceeds from the peculiar
                    modes of their growth, and are not a primary condition of their structure. This
                    intermixture of the vessels and cells in the plants now under consideration
                    extends from the circumference to the centre, so as to constitute their entire
                    bulk, to the exclusion of bark and pith; unless we choose rather to say that in
                    such plants the medullary, ligneous, and cortical textures, are all blended
                    together.</p>
                <p>* In other examples the vessels form a still smaller portion of the ligneous
                    texture, consisting only of a few fasciculi, which stand at considerable
                    distances from each other, the intervening spaces being occupied by'cellular
                    tissue, which forms the chief bulk of the plant. (Fig. 15, Plate XXXIX.) Though
                    few in number, the vessels, however,' are symmètrically disposed, and iń the
                    same species preserve always the same position, the fasciculi being placed at
                    the same relative distance from each other and from the common centre of the
                    pith. Sometimes, instead of a few solitary fasciculi, they consist of several
                    ranges, forming an imperfect sort of concentric layers; and in such examples the
                    ligneous texture is commonly separated by distinct but irregular marks from the
                    two other textures. In these plants the cellular tissue preserves its
                    characters, and exhibits no appearance of divergent rays.</p>
                <p>The three modes of arrangement above described appear to constitute the chief
                    varieties of structure in the ligneous texture; but in each variety, and through
                    every stage by which they graduate into one another, the greatest diversity of
                    forms prevails. Each species of plant has its peculiar <hi rend="italic"
                    >internal structure,</hi> as well as its <hi rend="italic">external</hi> form;
                    and this seems to be in a great measure determined by the number of vessels that
                    enter into its composition, and their peculiar mode of arrangement. If the
                    vessels are few, the cellular tissue is large in proportion, and its characters
                    are distinct and well preserved ;—if they are numerous, and disposed in rays,
                    the tissue is compressed in various directions, loses more or less completely
                    its cellular character, and forms alike those divergent rays or transverse
                    partitions already so often noticed, and those thin membranous expansions or <hi
                    rend="italic">fasciae</hi> which, both in the bark and wood, are seen sometimes
                    to cover the vessels in a longitudinal direction. Though the whole of the
                    ligneous texture is thus made up of vessels and cells, variously formed and
                    blended together, yet many writers speak of ligneous fibres, which some describe
                    as consisting of vessels, others of cells, and others of an assemblage both of
                    cells and vessels.</p>
                <p>The manner, too, or rather the place, in which the vessels are developed, in
                    perennial plants, will greatly contribute to vary the appearance of the ligneous
                    texture. In those trees whose diameter is annually increased by the formation of
                    new vessels around the cylinder of older wood, the new parts must necessarily
                    present in their longitudinal section the appearance of annual layers
                    superimposed on one another, and, in their transverse section, that of
                    concentric circles; but in palms and similar trees, where the development of new
                    parts seems to be accomplished in a different manner, their appearance, under
                    similar sections, may be expected to be different.</p>
                <p>In a longitudinal section of the palm, says Μ. Desfon-i taines, we discover an
                    assemblage of large ligneous fibres <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> (that is,
                    vascular fasciculi), solid, smooth, and flexible; and these are composed of
                    others still smaller, which are firmly united together: they mostly run parallel
                    to the axis of the trunk, from the base to the summit, without interruption; but
                    some proceed obliquely, and cross the others at angles more or less sharp. (See
                    fig. 2^, Plate XXXIX.) In a transverse section of the same stem, continues the
                    author, we remark neither concentric circles nor transverse partitions; but the
                    fasciculi of vessels, placed without order by the side of each other, are
                    enveloped by the cellular tissue, which fills up all the intervals: they
                    sensibly approach each other, harden and diminish in size in proceeding from the
                    centre to the circumference (see fig. 26, Plate XXXIX.); so that the stem has
                    much more strength and solidity near the surface than in the interior,—an
                    organization quite distinct from that of ordinary trees.</p>
                <p>The cause of this diversity of structure seems to be amply accounted for by the
                    different modes in which! the growth of these trees is accomplished. When the
                    seed of a palm is sown, the leaves, says Μ. Desfontaines, successively develope
                    and augment in number for four or five years; the neck of the root augments in
                    the same proportion; the bulbous part, formed by the re-union of <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193096380" xml:id="kp-eb0703-6380-0063"/>the petioles of the leaves,
                    increases insensibly; its solidity augments, and at length the stem rises above
                    the earth with all the size it ever acquires. Its figure is cylindrical from the
                    base to the summit; and if the diameter be measured at different epochs, it will
                    be seen, as Kaempfer had already remarked, not to increase. The palm, therefore,
                    is a regular column, whose summit is crowned with leaves, disposed above each
                    other circularly: those which grow in spring shoot always from the top; the
                    older ones, placed below, dry, and when they fall leave circular impressions,
                    which furrow the surface of the stem, and mark its years until it has ceased to
                    grow.</p>
                <p>If next we examine the interior, we discover, as Μ. Desfontaines thinks, the true
                    reason why the stem rises in a column, and does not, like other trees, yearly
                    augment in size. This was done by Μ. Daubenton, who states that every leaf of
                    the date-palm, in proceeding from the bud, is formed by a prolongation of the
                    vascular fasciculi and cellular tissue which exist in the trunk of the tree, as
                    is apparent in the petiole of the recent leaves, and of the dried ones that
                    adhere to the trunk. The elongation of the trunk is produced, therefore, by the
                    leaves which annually proceed from it; and as the parts which form these leaves
                    spring from the centre, they always, as they shoot, force the older leaves
                    outwards. Hence, therefore, as the augmentation of these trees originates at the
                    centre, all the parts capable of displacement must be pushed outwards, just as
                    the new layers of bark and wood, formed annually in ordinary trees, force
                    outward the older layers of bark exterior to them.</p>
                <p>In these latter trees, continues Μ. Daubenton, the recession of the bark has no
                    limits so long as new parts continue to be formed beneath it, because the new
                    cortical layers are flexible, and the older ones readily break and give way; but
                    in the palm the substance of the trunk has more compactness as we approach the
                    circumference, and, at a certain point of density, it no longer yields to the
                    central force of the interior parts; so that when this point is reached, no
                    further enlargement takes place; and hence the date-palm scarcely exceeds ten
                    inches diameter. It is for similar reasons that the trunk of the date-palm is of
                    the same size through its entire length; for, in proportion as the tree rises,
                    the exterior parts of the trunk lose successively their flexibility; and when
                    they have acquired a certain degree of density they no longer yield to the force
                    from within; and as this is equally the case in all parts, the trunk is
                    necessarily of the same size throughout. <hi rend="italic">(Mėm. de l’lnstit.

                <p>It is further evident that, in this mode of growth, no appearance of concentric
                    circles, similar to those of ordinary trees, can have place; for, by the growth
                    at the centre, the exterior vessels are continually displaced from their
                    original positions, are more and more compressed as they are forced towards the
                    circumference, and present in their transverse section that irregular
                    distribution which they have been described to possess. Hence the cylindrical
                    figure and the absence of concentric layers are as necessary consequences of the
                    mode of growth in these trees, as the presence of those layers and the conical
                    figure are of the mode of growth in ordinary trees. The greater solidity of the
                    parts at the circumference is clearly to be ascribed to the same cause; and even
                    the want of regular transverse partitions must in part also have, a similar
                    origin, and be ascribed, perhaps, in part to the smaller number of vessels which
                    these plants possess, as well as to their irregular distribution. From this
                    difference in their mode of growth, these two great divisions have received
                    different names: those which, like our ordinary trees, augment in size by the
                    deposition of new matter near the surface, are named Exogenous; and those which,
                    like palms, grow from within, ' Endogenous.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Section</hi> HI.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Of the Bark or Cortical Texture.</hi></p>
                <p>This texture, in its component parts, resembles that of the wood, being made up,
                    like it, of vessels and cellular tissue intimately connected with each other.
                    Its structure, as a distinct texture, is best characterized in the bark of
                    ordinary trees, as it is there separated, in a great measure, from the ligneous
                    texture. As in these plants a new layer of vessels is annually made to the wood,
                    so a similar but much thinner layer is yearly added to the bark, to which the
                    name of <hi rend="italic">liber</hi> has commonly been applied. These vessels
                    are at first straight, and run parallel to the axis of the trunk; but, by the
                    successive formation of new layers beneath them, they are gradually forced
                    outward, become separated more and more from each other, and, touching in a few
                    points only, exhibit at length a reticulated figure (see fig. 24, Plate XXXVΠL),
                    the meshes of which yearly augment in size, from the greater space over which
                    they are continually spread.</p>
                <p>Between the vessels thus annually formed, a considerable portion of cellular
                    tissue is interposed, which, in the young and succulent state of parts,
                    contributes chiefly to the thickness of the bark. This tissue is variously
                    compressed by the vessels, so as to form <hi rend="italic">transverse</hi>
                    partitions between them, which, in the vine, the oak, and many other trees, as
                    both Grew and Malpighi remarked, are seen to be continuous with those of the
                    wood; and in this way the two textures are united together. In the expressive
                    language of Grew, the bark, therefore, does not “merely surround the wood as a
                    scabbard does a sword, or a glove the hand, but is truly continuous with it, as
                    the skin of the body is with the flesh.” In the willow and other trees, when
                    full of sap, the bark is so easily separated that it seems to have no connection
                    with the wood; but this is supposed by Grew to arise merely from the extreme
                    fineness and tenderness of the vessels that are annually formed in that part,
                    and which on that account oppose no obstacle to the separation. <hi
                    rend="italic">(Anat. of Plants,</hi> p. 129.) It is probable, however, that the
                    cellular tissue forms the only direct connection between the cortical and
                    ligneous textures; and that, if a vascular communication exist, it is only, as
                    in all other cases, through the medium of that tissue.</p>
                <p>Besides the transverse compression which the cellular tissue experiences from the
                    vessels, it is compressed in: the opposite direction by the formation of the new
                    layers of bark and wood beneath the older bark. These in the progress of their
                    growth exert an expansive force outwards, so that the cells of the tissue are
                    made to assume an oblong or flattened form in the direction of the vessels of
                    the trunk, or sometimes to form a thin <hi rend="italic">fascia</hi> upon the
                    vessels, in which the cellular character is nearly or entirely obliterated. It
                    is by the continued exertion of this force acting on the exterior and desiccated
                    layers that these, latter ultimately crack, producing figures of different
                    sizes, which have frequently the shape of rhombs, the fissures of which
                    represent, according to Grew, the position and track of the vessels in their
                    reticulations. <hi rend="italic">(Anat. of Plants,</hi> p. 129.) The spaces or
                    meshes formed by these reticulations are always filled up by cellular tissue,
                    which, in the opinion of Malpighi, originates from the vessels themselves.</p>
                <p>Both in the vessels and cells of this texture, collections <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193096393" xml:id="kp-eb0703-6393-0064"/>of the “proper juices”
                    frequently occur; especially in plants in which these juices are of a viscid
                    nature, and disposed to concrete; as was before remarked, when treating of the
                    proper vessels. Similar collections of matter, originally existing in the bark,
                    are likewise met with in every layer of wood, and even in the pith of certain
                    trees. It is only in plants in which the “proper juices” are coļoured, or
                    disposed to concrete, that this intermixture of the cortical and ligneous
                    textures has been traced through the whole substance of the tree; but it is
                    probable, from the conjunction of the vessels of the bark and wood at the period
                    of their formation, that it is common to other plants, the nature and properties
                    of whose juices afford no clew to its detection.</p>
                <p>In most herbaceous plants, the cortical texture is not so clearly distinguished
                    from the ligneous, since in them the greatest variety obtains both in regard to
                    the number and relative position of the sap and “proper vessels ;” and very
                    frequently the cellular tissue is quite continuous and of uniform appearance
                    through the entire substance of the plant. In general, however, the sap-vessels
                    occupy the inner place, and are surrounded by the “proper vessels,” disposed
                    either in rings or distinct fasciculi, more or fewer in number. Sometimes the
                    sap-vessels seem to be placed exterior to the others; and hence it is difficult
                    to discover the true place of the “proper vessels” in such plants, unless the
                    nature of their juices conduct to it. From the position of the vessels,
                    therefore, it is often difficult to define the boundaries of the cortical and
                    ligneous textures; and, for the reason already assigned, the cellular tissue
                    rarely affords much assistance. According, however, to the number and
                    disposition of the vessels, this tissue, even in these plants, suffers a certain
                    degree of compression, so as to form thickened boundaries around the fasciculi,
                    or sometimes large transverse partitions, which communicate with those of the
                    wood, in which, though the figure of the cells is more or less altered, the
                    cellular character is usually preserved.</p>
                <p>In other plants, the intermixture of “proper vessels” with those that carry sap
                    seems to be general through the whole plant; and consequently no distinction can
                    be made between the ligneous and cortical textures. In such plants the “proper
                    juices” must be considered to exist in every part; and accordingly Malpighi, as
                    we before remarked, points out a <hi rend="italic">vas proprium,</hi> or “proper
                    vessel,” as accompanying every fasciculus of vessels in different species of
                    wheat. <hi rend="italic">(Anat. Plantar,</hi> p. 24.) From the similarity of
                    structure in palms, and especially from their mode of growth, there can be
                    little doubt that a similar intermixture of the two kinds of vessels prevails
                    everywhere in them; and with respect to these plants, what has already been said
                    of the construction of the ligneous texture, is equally applicable to that of
                    the bark.</p>
                <p>We have thus given a very brief and general view of the principal textures that
                    enter into the construction of plants, and pointed out the more prominent
                    diversities of character and appearance which they exhibit, as well in their
                    simple as in their more complex forms, and as they exist either separately or
                    variously intermingled together. Our descriptions have been confined entirely to
                    the trunk or stem; but, with slight variation, they are applicable; equally to
                    the root and branch, in which a similar combination of the elementary organs
                    obtains. In the root, however, they commonly exist in a more compressed and
                    compacted form, so that the ligneous texture is seen chiefly to predominate,
                    frequently to the entire exclusion of the pith, and often in great part also to
                    that of the cellular portion of the bark. This, however, is not universal,
                    especially in annual plants, some of which, as the carrot and others,
                    particularly in a cultivated state, are distinguished by the very large portion
                    of cellular tissue which enters into the construction of the cortical texture.
                    Of the modifications of these several textures, as they exist in leaves and
                    other organs, we shall have occasion to speak when we come to treat of them
                    individually.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Section</hi> IV.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Of the Connection subsisting between the Vessels and Cells in
                    the several Textures.</hi></p>
                <p>In our discussion of these several textures, we have noticed only in a general
                    way the direct means by which the vessels and cells that construct them are
                    connected with each other; but, when treating of the sapvessels, of the
                    absorbent vessels, and of the cellular tissue, we endeavoured to show that an
                    universal communication obtains between these elementary organs, and
                    consequently inferred that some mode of connection, by which it can be
                    accomplished, must have place. Grew considered the vascular and cellular parts
                    to be connected with each other, not only by the transverse partitions of
                    cellular substance that intercept the vessels, but “<hi rend="italic">ļìer
                    mini-mas partes</hi><hi rend="italic">organicas</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi>
                    that is to say, the parenchymous fibres are wrapped round about the vessels, or
                    at least interwoven with them, and with every fibre of every vessel, as in very
                    white ash or fir wood may be observed.” <hi rend="italic">(Anat. of Plants,</hi>
                    p. 121.) These fibres Grew elsewhere considers as vessels, and consequently must
                    be regarded as maintaining a vascular connection between these organs. In a
                    description of the young branches of chesnut and oak, Malpighi delineates minute
                    filaments springing on every side from the vessels of the wood, and continued
                    into the adjacent cellular tissue <hi rend="italic">(Anat. Plantar,</hi> p. 27);
                    but he does not state whether they are to be regarded as vessels or simple
                    fibres. He elsewhere describes minute vessels as surrounding the cells of the
                    trunk like a network, and thinks it probable that the cells of the transverse
                    septa are similarly furnished with vessels. In the cells of the pith of elder
                    <hi rend="italic">(sambucus),</hi> and of some other plants, the vessels are
                    very abundant, and in every case are probably derived from the straight ligneous
                    fibres (vessels) both of the bark and wood. <hi rend="italic">(Ibid.</hi> p.
                    29.) Indeed he held it probable that the nutrient fluids moving through the
                    vessels were in all parts poured into the cells, and there undergoing a certain
                    preparation, were afterwards mixed with more recent juices, and with them taken
                    up and applied to the support of the young buds and leaves. <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Ibid.</hi> p. 30.) This doctrine has since been held by Darwin and Knight, and
                    it necessarily supposes a vascular connection between the vessels and the cells,
                    by which the functions both of secretion and absorption can be performed. The
                    microscopical observations of Lecu-wenhoeck, already noticed, supply further
                    evidence in support of this opinion.</p>
                <p>In the hypothesis of Mirbel both cells and vessels are considered as formed out
                    of one and the same membrane. He rejects, therefore, the aid of all intermediate
                    organs as necessary to connect them together, and supposes a communication to be
                    everywhere maintained between the vessels and cells, by the medium of pores in
                    their sides. As, however, these pores are nowhere proved to have existence but
                    in the imagination of the author, we may altogether reject their agency in
                    maintaining a communication between the vessels and cells of plants. In the
                    opinion of Μ. Kieser, the conjunction of the cells with the vessels is extremely
                    simple, the sides of the cells, says he, being contiguous to the sides of the
                    vessels. <hi rend="italic">(Mém. sur</hi><hi rend="italic">ι</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Organisât,</hi><hi rend="italic">des Plantes,</hi> p. 94.) But
                    mere contiguity of parts does not amount to connection, much less does it afford
                    any information concerning the actual commuhica-tion<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193096406" xml:id="kp-eb0703-6406-0065"/> that exists between these
                    organs. In addition, therefore, to connection by cellular substance, it seems
                    abso- 'lutely necessary to suppose also the existence of a vascular structure,
                    which shall at once serve as a medium both of connection and communication.</p>
                <p>Before concluding this branch of the subject, we may observe that the structure
                    of the cellular tissue, and its relation to the vascular system in plants,
                    appear, in many points, to resemble that of the adipose cells, and their
                    relation to the vascular system of animals. These cells are described as minute
                    close cavities, possessing no apparent communication with each other; and within
                    them adipose matter is alternately deposited and removed. Now the deposition of
                    this matter could only be accomplished by secreting vessels which terminated in
                    the cells, and its removal be effected by absorbents which originated from them;
                    and accordingly both blood-vessels and absorbents are found to be present in
                    this texture; but neither the secreting nor absorbing orifices have ever been
                    actually observed. Within the cells of the cellular tissue of plants the
                    alternate deposition and removal of various matters are not less certain; and in
                    the germinating seed the matter that actually existed in the cells is found
                    afterwards in the vessels. We are led, therefore, or rather we arc driven, not
                    only by the direct exclusion of all other alleged means of communication, but by
                    a close analogy in the exercise of these animal and vegetable functions, to
                    conclude, that secreting and absorbing vessels must be employed to deposit and
                    remove the secreted matter from the cells of plants, in the same way as they are
                    considered to effect similar depositions and removals of adipose matter from the
                    cells of animals: and as this alternate function seems to go on in every part of
                    the plant capable of active vegetation, it may further be inferred that a
                    vascular communication exists between the vessels and cells in all parts of the
                    vegetable system.</p>
                <p>By means of this general communication between the vessels and the cells, we are
                    enabled to assign satisfactory reasons for some puzzling phenomena, which have
                    occurred in relation to the movements of the sap. It is by this alternate action
                    of secretion and absorption that in young plants we must suppose the cells of
                    the pith, during the first year, to be filled with fluid, and to be rendered dry
                    for the most part ever after. In like manner, the surface of the bark in contact
                    with the wood appears in some trees, as the birch, to be rendered moist during
                    the rise of the sap in spring; which led Dr Walker and others to suppose that
                    the sap rose in part between the bark and the wood,—an opinion not at all
                    probable in itself, and certainly not supported by what is observed in most
                    other trees. The fact, however, is easily explicable, on the supposition that
                    the sap was transfused from the alburnous vessels of the wood, in the same
                    manner as, at a later period, it is secreted in the same part, but in a
                    different form, by the vessels of the bark, to form the new matter that is
                    annually added to the tree.</p>
                <p>That the sap of plants was capable of moving in a <hi rend="italic">lateral</hi>
                    direction, was inferred by Malpighi, from the fact that parts lived and grew
                    when the perpendicular vessels that supplied them with nutriment had been
                    destroyed. <hi rend="italic">(Anat. Plantar,</hi> p. 13.) The experiments of
                    Hales afford more decisive evidence regarding this lateral movement of the sap.
                    He cut two large gaps in the opposite sides of an oak-branch, at four inches
                    distance from each other, carrying the incisions down to the pith: the branch
                    nevertheless absorbed and perspired water, but only in half the quantity that
                    another similar but uncut branch did. In a branch of cherry-tree he made four
                    similar cnts down to the pith, at four inches distance from each other, and
                    opposed to the four points of the compass: the branch notwithstanding absorbed,
                    in forty-eight hours, twenty-four ounces of water. <hi rend="italic">( Veg.
                    Statics,</hi> p. 128, 3d edit.) And when similar incisions were made on branches
                    while still attached to the tree; their leaves continued green nearly as long as
                    those of other branches in a natural state; whence he justly inferred that, at
                    these gaps made in the branch, a lateral movement of the sap must have taken
                    place. Experiments of a similar nature have been made, and like results
                    obtained, by Mr Knight <hi rend="italic">(Phil. Trans.</hi> 1808); so that it
                    seems clear that in certain circumstances a lateral movement of the sap must
                    have place.</p>
                <p>In what manner, then, must we suppose this movement to be accomplished? Grew
                    supposed the cellular tissue, that stretches from the circumference to the
                    centre of the plant, to be the organ by which such a communication could be
                    maintained; but the impermeability of this tissue to fluids opposes such an
                    opinion. Malpighi thought the lateral communication to be made by an <hi
                    rend="italic">anastomosis</hi> of vessels; but in the vessels of plants no such
                    mode of communication appears to exist. From the ascent of the sap in branches
                    in which the vessels had been thus previously cut through, Mr Knight infers that
                    this fluid does not rise in the vessels at all, but is conveyed through the
                    cellular tissue. This opinion necessarily implies the permeability of this
                    tissue by fluids, which, as we have shown, is contradicted by direct experiment,
                    as well as by microscopical observation. Since, therefore, this lateral movement
                    of the sap cannot be accomplished, either by simple percolation through the
                    cells or vessels, or by direct anastomosis of the vessels with one another, no
                    other known means of effecting it remain, but those of alternate deposition and
                    absorption by the vessels into and from the cells. And if, as we have seen, the
                    sap-vessels of plants deposit coloured fluids in the cells, which the capillary
                    absorbents of parasitic plants are able to take up, there seems no reason for
                    denying to the vascular productions, which have been supposed everywhere to
                    spring from the perpendicular vessels, a like capacity of absorbing fluids from
                    the adjacent cells. These fluids must, however, in all cases, have been
                    deposited before they could be absorbed; and, by the alternate exercise of these
                    functions, there is no difficulty in conceiving how a lateral movement of the
                    sap might be accomplished in parts where, by the incision of the vessels, a stop
                    was necessarily put to its perpendicular ascent.</p>

                    the Skin.</hi></p>
                <p>The skin, rind, cuticle, or epidermis, as it has been variously named, is the
                    last of the common textures that remains to be described. It is the general
                    envelope which invests all parts of the plant and all its productions, being
                    equally common to the trunk and branches, the root, the leaves, the flowers, and
                    the fruit; but in these different parts, and even in similar parts of different
                    plants, it exhibits the greatest diversity of appearance and form.</p>
                <p>In herbaceous plants, and in the young shoots of those; which are arborescent, it
                    resembles a thin membrane, but∣ is generally thicker on the stem than on' the
                    roots or leaves. In some leaves, however, it is thick and dense, as is the case
                    also in several fruits, and is thereby fitted ι to resist the effects of too
                    rapid desiccation. On the upper surface of some leaves, on many fruits, and on
                    roots, it is an entire membrane, destitute of any apertures <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193096419" xml:id="kp-eb0703-6419-0066"/>or pores; but on many stems
                    on the under surfaces of leaves, and sometimes on the upper, it is frequently
                    furnished with numerous pores, often visible to the naked eye, and with other
                    luminous points of smaller dimensions, which Du Hamel also regards as apertures.
                    It is readily separable from the bark in recent and succulent parts, or after
                    maceration in water; and in certain leaves it is very completely separated by a
                    species of caterpillar, named by Reaumur the <hi rend="italic">miner.</hi> It
                    appears then to be a thin transparent membrane, often destitute of colour, and
                    deriving, therefore, its appearance from the colour of the parts beneath; but
                    both in leaves and flowers it is often itself coloured. It is frequently seen to
                    extend in all its dimensions, in common with the parts it covers. Very often,
                    too, as will be noticed hereafter, its surface is covered with hairs; and
                    sometimes small follicles or utricles are met with, which exercise a glandular
                    function.</p>
                <p>The characters above enumerated belong chiefly to the cuticle in its young and
                    succulent state. In perennial plants it commonly possesses others that are quite
                    dissimilar. It is of a different colour not only on different trees, but on
                    different parts of the same tree. It is white and shining on the trunk of the
                    birch, and browner on the branches; greyish on the plum-tree; red and silvery on
                    the cherry; green on the young branches of the peach; and ash-coloured on the
                    larger branches. In these and many other instances it does not, says Du Hamel,
                    merely participate in the colour of the body it covers, but contributes itself
                    to give colour to the exterior bark; for when it is stripped off, the substance
                    below has frequently a different colour. <hi rend="italic">(Phys,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">des Arbres,</hi> tome i. p. 10.) By the gradual enlargement of the
                    trunk it is stretched and dried, and at length loses its vitality, and, as well
                    as the bark beneath, is variously cracked and broken. Before this happens,
                    however, it often undergoes considerable extension in all its dimensions,
                    enlarging in breadth, and stretching longitudinally over the young shoots. This
                    expanded state is particularly remarkable in certain fruits, in which, when they
                    enlarge slowly, the cuticle is extended without rupture to a very large size;
                    but if the expansion be very rapid, as after considerable rains, the cuticle
                    then gives way. In certain trees the cuticle is more susceptible of expansion
                    than in others; and in very vigorous trees it breaks more slowly than in those
                    whose growth is languishing, although these latter push forward more slowly than
                    the former. <hi rend="italic">(Ibid.</hi> p. 11.) In some vigorous trees of this
                    description it altogether resists rupture; and in this state the tree is often
                    said to be hide-bound or barkbound.</p>
                <p>In most instances the cuticle, when taken from young branches, appears to consist
                    of a single layer; but on the branches of many species, says Du Hamel, after one
                    plate or layer has been removed, another may be seen beneath, which resembles
                    the former in its texture, but is much thinner and more green and succulent.
                    From the birchtree he has removed more than six layers, very thin and very
                    distinct from each other, and is of opinion that more might still be separated.
                    Sometimes the original cuticle seems to be entirely thrown off, and the exterior
                    covering is formed by a portion of the cellular tissue of the bark. Grew thinks
                    that this substitution takes place annually, the older skin being cast off, like
                    the skin of an adder, by the generation of a new one beneath. <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Anat. of Plants,</hi> p. 114.) Du Hamel describes also the existence of small
                    leaflets or scales, which are continually detached from the cuticle of some
                    trees; and these he considers to be as constantly replaced, by the formation of
                    new ones beneath them.</p>
                <p>• Concerning the regeneration of the. cuticle on parts from which it has been
                    removed, Du Hamel observes, that when the wound is covered with waxed cloth, a
                    new cuticle is promptly formed without any separation of a portion of the bark
                    beneath. When the exterior portion of the bark is removed with the skin, the
                    inner part of it is equally capable of regenerating a cuticle; but if the wound
                    be not protected from the air, a certain degree of exfoliation first occurs,
                    and, under the decayed parts, a new skin forms. Even where the bark of a
                    cherry-tree was entirely removed from the trunk, he found that the wood was
                    capable of regenerating a new bark and cuticle, if the parts were properly
                    protected from the air. This cuticle did not originate from that which remained
                    on the roots and branches, but was reproduced in isolated portions on different
                    parts of the trunk; it continued, however, after the lapse of fifteen years,
                    always different from that of the natural growth. In other instances, he adds,
                    the cuticle does not seem to be regenerated at all. He remarks certain analogies
                    to exist between the cuticle in some plants and in animals. In both, he adds, it
                    seems in certain circumstances capable of great extension; inboth it is easily
                    regenerated, and that too in isolated portions, and not by continuity of organs,
                    as is common in other instances; and in both, lastly, it is perpetually
                    obliterated, and continually and imperceptibly renewed. <hi rend="italic">(Phys,
                    des</hi><hi rend="italic">Arbres,</hi> tome i. p. 11.)</p>
                <p>With respect to the nature of the cuticle, very different opinions have been
                    advanced, and still continue to prevail. Are we to regard it as a peculiar
                    organ, formed immediately by the proper exercise of the vegetative functions, or
                    is it produced in a sort of secondary manner, by some changes induced on some
                    previously constructed organ? Grew asserted it to be sometimes original, and in
                    some instances produced out of the exterior layer of the cortical texture
                    beneath it; and this first view of its origin seems to be generally supported by
                    the descriptive character which has been assigned to it. Its co-existence with
                    the first traces of vegetable organization, its continued growth and expansion,
                    and its subsequent regeneration after removal, all seem to favour its primary
                    and independent origin, which is also supported by investigations into its
                    minute structure. Mirbel, however, and some other writers, after Hill, have
                    regarded it, in all cases, not as an original membrane, but formed by the
                    exterior sides of the common tissue of the plant; and where there is no
                    separation of these sides in the form of a membrane, such plants are held to be
                    destitute of a cuticle. <hi rend="italic">(Exposit. de l’</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Organisât.</hi><hi rend="italic">Végét.</hi> p. 103.)</p>
                <p>Another question relating to this organ is, whether it must be considered a
                    simple membrane of uniform structure, or a compound of two distinct parts, like
                    the true skin and the cuticle in animals. Grew seems to have regarded it as a
                    simple body, but constructed both of vessels and cells, the cells being
                    continuous with those of the bark. <hi rend="italic">(Anat. of Plants,</hi> p.
                    62.) Such, too, seems to have been nearly the opinion of Malpighi, who describes
                    it as constructed of horizontal ranges of cells, but often delineates
                    reticulations of vessels as constituting a part of its structure. <hi
                    rend="italic">(Anat. Plantar,</hi> p. 2, 19.) In the birch, the plum, the
                    cherry-tree, and others, Du Hamel declares the component fibres of the cuticle
                    to possess a direction transverse to that of the trunk; but this is not general.
                    In the birch-tree the fibres seemed to be placed parallel to each other, and to
                    be connected together by lateral fibres; but he could see nothing of the
                    vesicular structure of Malpighi and Grew, and therefore regards the structure of
                    this texture to be altogether fibrous. <hi rend="italic">(Phys, des</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Arbres,</hi> tome i. p. 8 and 9.) Μ. Desfontaines, on the other
                    hand, describes it as a membrane resembling in ap: <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193096432" xml:id="kp-eb0703-6432-0067"/>pearance a thin plate of
                    parchment, and perforated by imperceptible pores, which give issue to the
                    insensible transpiration. Its structure he regards as unknown, but considers it
                    capable of regeneration. (Jfe⅝. ¢fe <hi rend="italic">l’lnstit. Nat.</hi> tome
                    i. p. 481.)</p>
                <p>Μ. Kιeser, who professes to have studied this texture with great attention,
                    adopts nearly the opinion of Grew, pronouncing the cuticle to be constructed of
                    a very fine cellular tissue, and of extremely minute vessels which run through
                    its whole extent. These vessels form an exceedingly delicate and subtile
                    net-work, the meshes of which possess very different forms, and their vessels
                    terminate at the orifice of a pore. His observations were made on the cuticle of
                    leaves. On the inferior surface of the leaf of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Amaryllis</hi><hi rend="italic">formosissima</hi> (fig. 14, A, Plate XLI.),
                    magnified 260 times, these vascular meshes of the cuticle have an elongated
                    hexagonal form; and four of their vessels proceed always to terminate at the
                    orifice of the little oblong aperture or pore situated at their junction. In <hi
                    rend="italic">Canna</hi><hi rend="italic">Indica,</hi> the vessels of the meshes
                    on the lower part of the leaf, which thus terminate in the pores, are said to
                    originate from a fasciculus of the spiral vessels that ramify through the leaf,
                    as is represented at <hi rend="italic">a'</hi> in fig. 14, B, Plate XLI.; and
                    within the areas of the larger meshes a still finer net-work of vessels is seen.
                    On the inferior surface of the leaf of a species of fern, the vessels of the
                    cuticle, instead of forming meshes of different figures, exhibit the appearance
                    of sinuous lines, which run in every direction through the cuticle. See fig. 15,
                    Plate XLI. which represents the central part of the little adjoining leaf,
                    magnified 130 times. These sinuous vessels often join, and, after making a
                    half-circle, terminate by one extremity in the minute pores everywhere spread
                    over the leaf, and by the other in the larger vascular fasciculi that ramify
                    through it. At the letter <hi rend="italic">b',</hi> in this figure, the
                    hexagonal cells that construct the parenchyma of the leaf are distinctly visible
                    through the vascular sinuosities of the cuticle. It was by the examination of
                    this leaf that Μ. Kieser was first enabled to discover the origin and
                    termination of the vessels that construct the cuticle, having in all his
                    previous investigations examined the cuticle in its separated state, after it
                    was detached from its connection with the other organs; but the researches made
                    on this leaf rendered every thing clear. (<hi rend="italic">Mém. sur</hi><hi

                <p>The vascular net-work of the cuticle, thus described by Μ. Kieser and others, had
                    been regarded as a deception by Μ. Krocker, who considered these reticulated
                    figures as no part of the real structure of the cuticle, but merely as the sides
                    of the subjacent cells; in which opinion Sprengel, Link, Jurine, and Mirbel,
                    concurred; but Μ. Kieser, in opposition to this opinion, maintains that, in the
                    fern and other leaves, the real cellular structure of the parenchyma is seen
                    entire through the vascular reticulations of the cuticle, with the meshes of
                    which the sides of the subjacent cells do not anywhere coincide. He observes
                    that these cells are commonly much smaller than the vascular meshes which cover
                    them; and that the vessels of these meshes may be traced, as before remarked, to
                    the larger fasciculi that construct the leaf. In the fern the vascular structure
                    of the cuticle is the same on both sides of the leaf, but the superior side does
                    not possess pores.</p>
                <p>A very different view of the structure of the cuticle was taken by the late
                    celebrated Μ. de Saussure. He regarded it not as a simple, but a compound
                    texture, consisting of a very delicate external pellicle or membrane, beneath
                    which was placed a net-work of very fine vessels. The external membrane he
                    describes as perforated by pores of unequal figure, between which he observed
                    some opaque and tortuous filaments, disposed in a reticulated manner, each mesh
                    being formed by six filaments, four of which terminated at each pore. To this
                    arrangement of .filaments he gave the name of cortical net-work, and regarded it
                    as quite distinct from the cuticle that covered it. The meshes of this net-work
                    differ much in size and figure in different leaves; and, when minutely examined,
                    they are often seen to form junctions, but never to cross each other; whence he
                    was led to regard them as vessels derived from those of the expanded petiole,
                    and thus constituting a very fine vascular net-work. A similar structure was
                    observed in the petals of the flower. <hi rend="italic">(Encyclop. Method,</hi>
                    tome i. p. 67.)</p>
                <p>Μ. de Candolle considers the cuticle in certain parts to be a simple and proper
                    membrane; in other parts to be formed by layers of cellular tissue. The cuticle
                    of leaves, and probably of all annual shoots, appears to be formed of a layer of
                    flattened cells, differing in form and in other conditions from those of the
                    parenchyma of the leaf. It may be regarded in this state as a proper membrane.
                    When stripped off and examined by the microscope, it exhibits small spaces,
                    bounded by lines or rays, or a sort of net-work, the meshes of which have
                    different figures in different plants. The lines, says he, appear in the form of
                    single or double filaments, and may be considered hollow, and as forming a
                    system of cuticular vessels which terminate in the pores. In more advanced age,
                    and especially in the trunks of old trees, this primitive cuticle gradually
                    changes its character, and finally disappears. It is then succeeded by a thicker
                    membrane, which no longer exhibits the net-like figure of the former, and
                    appears evidently to be formed by the exterior cells of the cellular tissue,
                    which, by the combined effects of distention and desiccation, assume a
                    membranous appearance, to which the term <hi rend="italic">epidermis</hi> is
                    properly applicable. This epidermis may be considered single when composed of
                    one layer of cells, and double, triple, or multiple, when formed of two or more
                    successive layers. It is thus that Ulloa, in describing a tree in Peru, speaks
                    of having detached more than 150 epidermoidal layers, when he lost all patience
                    in counting them, seeing that he had not then reached to half the thickness of
                    the bark. A similar appearance is exhibited in the numerous layers that form the
                    epidermis of the white birch, amounting sometimes to 15 or 18 in advanced age,
                    and which ends by breaking into that cracked condition of the bark that presents
                    only discontinuous portions of white epidermis on the remnants of its cellular
                    envelope. At an early period the cuticle is most easily torn in a longitudinal
                    direction, which is that of its growth; but at a later period, when the
                    diametral growth has increased, the cells of the tissue are drawn out more in
                    that direction, and therefore more readily break transversely than in length.

                    Skin.</hi></p>
                <p>The pores of the cuticle, called sometimes cortical or miliary glands, sometimes
                    exhaling pores, sometimes cortical pores, and more lately, by Link and De
                    Candolle, <hi rend="italic">stomata,</hi> were first noticed by Grew, who
                    describes many orifices as existing on the leaves of different plants, which
                    vary in size, number, shape, and position. In the white lily they are of an oval
                    shape, of a white colour; and each is surrounded by a slender border. When
                    viewed through a good glass they appear as if standing about one sixth or one
                    eighth of an inch apart all over the leaf, but not arranged in any regular
                    order. In the pine, also, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193096445"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0703-6445-0068"/>they have an oval shape, but have no rising
                    border, and are arranged in lines from one end of the leaf to the 'other. <hi
                    rend="italic">(Anat. of Plants,</hi> p. 153.) Hedwig considered the borders
                    mentioned by Grew as produced by a ring of one or more vessels, which terminated
                    in the pore. Ιhe number of pores he represents as exceedingly great. In the
                    square of a line of the cuticle of a bulbous lily he reckoned 577 pores.</p>
                <p>The characters and position of these pores or stomata have been further examined
                    by Μ. de Candolle on more than GOO plants. They occur most frequently on the
                    leaves, occupying both surfaces in some herbs, and in trees chiefly the inferior
                    surface. Stems in general have no pores, except, as in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Gramineoe,</hi> where they are succulent, and have the character of leaves; or
                    where the plant is altogether destitute of leaves, as the Cactus. On the
                    prominent lines or vessels of the leaves and stems no pores are to be seen, but
                    only in the grooves or depressed surfaces of the parenchyma. They are never
                    observed on the root, not even on bulbous roots, where the scales of the bulb
                    are true leaves. The small leaflets called <hi rend="italic">stipulae</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">bracteoe</hi> sometimes have and sometimes have not pores. The
                    <hi rend="italic">calices of</hi> the flower in general have pores, but the
                    petals have not. Pericarps of a foliaceous consistence have pores: when fleshy,
                    they are destitute of them. The envelopes of the seed are destitute of pores,
                    but they are found on all seminal leaves that rise above the ground. The lower
                    tribes of vegetables, as the <hi rend="italic">fuci,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >musci,</hi><hi rend="italic">hepatic(e, fungi,</hi> &amp;c. are destitute of
                    pores.</p>
                <p>The occurrence of pores in those plants where they are found seems to be much
                    influenced by external circum- &gt; stances. They are never met with but on
                    vegetables, and those parts of vegetables that are exposed to the air; and
                    therefore the internal surfaces of many leaves that embrace the stem are without
                    pores, though on the external surfaces of the same leaves they are abundant. No
                    plant that is completely aquatic, nor any part of it that is habitually under
                    water, is provided with these organs; but the parts which rise above the water
                    are furnished with them. In <hi rend="italic">ranunculus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >aquaticus</hi> the leaves that are constantly under water are destitute of
                    pores, while those that float on the surface are provided with them, but only on
                    their superior face. Even leaves which do not naturally possess pores when under
                    water, acquire them if they are made to grow in air; and land plants, on the
                    contrary, when made to grow under water, may, by such treatment, be deprived of
                    their pores. Thus, the leaf of green mint, when growing in air, possesses not
                    fewer than 1800 pores on its lower surface; but if kept for a month under water,
                    its leaves fall, and the new ones that succeed are destitute of pores.</p>
                <p><hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> Light seems to be necessary also to the production
                    of pores, for etiolated plants do not possess them. When grown by the light of
                    lamps, the leaves possess a few pores; and, in all cases, the parts secluded
                    from light and air are destitute of these organs, but acquire them if they are
                    duly exposed. <hi rend="italic">(Mém. de īlnstit. Nat.</hi> tome i. p. 351.)</p>
                <p>This general account of the pores of plants is confirmed by the researches of Μ.
                    Rudolphi. In most herbaceous plants he found the pores to occupy both sides of
                    the leaf, but in trees only the inferior surface. They were not often met with
                    on the parts of the flowers, or on fruits; they were never seen on roots, nor on
                    the trunks of trees; nor ever on aquatic plants, except on such parts as were
                    raised above the water. The lower tribes of vegetables seemed to be universally
                    destitute of them; the leaves also of those plants that were covered thickly
                    with hairs on both sides had no pores. The form of the pores was commonly oval
                    or elliptical, but in a few instances square or rhomboidal. In size they very
                    much varied in different plants, but in the same plant the size was uniform. The
                    largest pores were seen on the leaf of the white lily,’ the smallest on that of
                    the French bean. (Kieser’s <hi rend="italic">Mém.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >sur</hi><hi rend="italic">l’</hi><hi rend="italic">Organisât, des</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Plantes,</hi> p. 144.)</p>
                <p>Although the pores are generally dispersed over the parenchyma of leaves at
                    nearly equal distances, yet where the vessels run parallel, they are disposed in
                    one or more lines between them. Sometimes, again, they are collected into little
                    clusters, as in the leaves of <hi rend="italic">crassula</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >cordata,</hi> where the roundish dots or points, visible by the naked eye, are
                    clusters of pores or stomata. This appearance suggested to Μ. de Candolle the
                    idea that the stomata might be the orifices of vessels, as each of the little
                    points mentioned above is the termination of a fibre, which is itself a bundle
                    of vessels. This idea is further strengthened by the fact that these pores are
                    not found in plants that are destitute of vessels; and though he could never
                    trace the continuity of a vessel with a pore, yet Μ. Com-paretti assures us he
                    has seen the vessels terminate in them. Mirbel, on the other hand, considers the
                    pores to be the orifices of cells; and Kieser regards them as connected with the
                    intercellular canals. <hi rend="italic">(Organog. Végét.</hi> tome i. chap.
                    6.)</p>
                <p>Some have considered the pores as organs, by which the resinous or waxy matter
                    found on certain leaves is exhaled; others, as organs for the absorption and
                    transpiration of air or gas; and others, with more probability, as those by
                    which moisture is thrown off by the leaf. In support of this last opinion, it
                    may be stated that pores exist in all leafy parts that transpire, and are more
                    numerous in membranous leaves that transpire most, than in fleshy leaves which
                    transpire little. They are wanting altogether in aquatic leaves and in etiolated
                    leaves; also in fleshy fruits, in roots, and in the petals of flowers, which do
                    not transpire in any degree analogous to leaves. In darkness too, when
                    transpiration ceases, the pores are closed; and they again open and transpire
                    when light reappears, and especially in bright sunshine. It is always necessary
                    to distinguish the evaporation, more or less great, that goes on through the
                    tissue in all organs by day and by night, from the active transpiration which
                    occurs in sunshine, but only in organs furnished with pores, and which seems to
                    be executed by them.</p>
                <p>Besides transpiration, Μ. de Candolle believes that, in certain cases, the pores
                    may also serve for <hi rend="italic">absorption;</hi> but this he considers to
                    be rarely the case, and out of the natural course of vegetation; and that the
                    experiments which favour this opinion may be explained by the hygroscopic powers
                    of the vegetable tissue. He thinks the results obtained by Bonnet, who kept
                    leaves a long time in life by laying their porous surfaces on water, may be
                    explained by supposing this treatment to prevent decay by checking
                    transpiration, rather than by promoting absorption. <hi rend="italic">(Organog.
                    Végét.</hi> tome i. p. 87.) This suggestion will not, however, explain the
                    phenomena of an experiment continued for many years in the conservatories of the
                    Royal Botanic Garden here, under the care of Mr Macnab. He has kept a species of
                    fig <hi rend="italic">(ficus elastică)</hi> for several years fastened against
                    the wall, with its roots, stem, and branches entirely exposed to the air; and in
                    that situation it has not only lived, but actually grown in every part, so as to
                    have increased greatly in size, only by being thus kept in a warm and moist
                    atmosphere, and occasionally sprinkled with water.</p>
                <p>In addition to these visible pores, it is probable, says! Μ. de Candolle, that
                    the surface of vegetables is furnished! with others that are invisible, but so
                    small that with the strongest microscopes we are unable to recognise them: <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193096458" xml:id="kp-eb0703-6458-0069"/> their existence,
                    therefore, can only be presumed from physiological phenomena. Thus, a part of a
                    vegetable destitute of pores loses weight when exposed to the air, by the escape
                    of the fluid it contained; or a portion of moss equally destitute of pores, if
                    placed in water, speedily acquires additional weight. Whether these results are
                    obtained through the medium of minute pores, or of unorganized apertures, such
                    as are admitted to exist between the molecules of all matters,—and whether
                    through the same pores or apertures a passage is afforded to gases or other
                    fluids, or to the oily or waxy secretions that cover certain surfaces,—are
                    questions, adds Μ. de Candolle, to which no answer can at present be given. <hi

                <p>From the surface of the cuticle, in many parts of herbaceous plants, and in the

                    seen to spring. They possess very different forms, and vary likewise greatly in
                    texture. In a strict sense, they may be defined small filaments possessing
                    considerable stiffness, which project from the surface, and stand out pretty
                    erect. When they are very numerous, a little soft, and less erect, they take the
                    name of <hi rend="italic">villi</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> when still softer
                    and less numerous they are termed down <hi rend="italic">(pubes).</hi> Sometimes
                    this down is composed of long hairs nearly resembling wool, at other times it
                    approaches more to the character of cotton. When the hairs are stiff and ranged
                    along the edge of a surface, like the lashes of the eye, they are named <hi
                    rend="italic">cilia</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and if, with these characters,
                    they are produced to a greater length, as in the beard or awn of wheat, they
                    acquire the name of <hi rend="italic">barba</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >arista.</hi> Sometimes they resemble the bristles of the hog, and arc then
                    called <hi rend="italic">setae.</hi> Many other varieties are enumerated by
                    botanists, who further distinguish them by various names, according as they
                    terminate in a single point, or are hooked, or forked, or branched, or
                    feathered, &amp;c. In some instances, instead of appearing like one continuous
                    substance, they are composed of many joints, or are said to be articulated. In
                    fig. 16 and 17, Plate XLI., we have copied from Du Hamel a few of the varieties,
                    both of single and jointed hairs; but the forms they exhibit are so numerous and
                    diversified, that we must refer to the writers on botany for minuter
                    information. In some examples the point of the hair is terminated by a small
                    rounded globulet, and sometimes by a fine filament, that seems to proceed out of
                    the hair.</p>
                <p>Some writers distinguish hairs into two general classes, —the glandular and
                    lymphatic. In the former class, the hair or filament is sometimes the excretory
                    duet of the small gland situated at its base; and in other instances, as in the
                    chick-pea, the glandular or secreting organ is seated at the extremity of the
                    hair. The lymphatic class embraces a much greater variety of hairs, which differ
                    widely from each other in consistence, direction, and form. They spring only
                    from the parts of plants which are exposed to the air, and are not found,
                    therefore, on the parts concealed below the earth or in water: they are also
                    rare on plants that grow in the shade, are wanting altogether in <hi
                    rend="italic">etiolated</hi> plants, and are most abundant, in general, on
                    plants that grow in warm places, and are well exposed to solar light. With
                    respect to their seat or origin, as compared with that of the pores, although,
                    says Μ. de Candolle, these two kinds of organs appear sometimes mingled, yet
                    each has a determined place; for the pores are seated on the cellular or
                    parenchymatous parts, while the lymphatic hairs constantly spring from the
                    vascular or ligneous parts. Yet the hairs, he adds, are almost always placed on
                    the same surface as the pores; and hence the superior surface of the leaf, which
                    is commonly destitute of pores, has in general but few or no hairs. The pores,
                    as before stated, seem to be the true organs of transpiration; and the various
                    kinds of hairs serve to protect the plant against the excess of solar light,
                    against variations of temperature, against humidity, or sometimes against
                    insects. (<hi rend="italic">Organog. Vég.</hi> tome i. chap. 10.) Hairs, also,
                    of various kinds are met with on the different parts of the flower. These often
                    have the colour of the petals or other parts on which they grow, and are
                    distinguishable from the true lymphatic hairs, though sometimes associated with
                    them on the same organ.</p>
                <p>With regard to the structure of these minute bodies, little that is satisfactory
                    can be said. They seem to originate either directly from the cuticle or from the
                    cortical texture beneath it; but not often from the ligneous texture, except in
                    those instances where they are very long and rigid, as in the awns of wheat. Du
                    Hamel observes that almost all of them are implanted on small bodies, similar to
                    the bulbs which give origin to the hairs o'f animals. <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Phys,</hi><hi rend="italic">des Arbres,</hi> tome i. p. 183.) They, commonly
                    resemble simple filaments, but often appear like elongated cells threaded on one
                    another, and, instead of terminating in a sharp point, end in a small papilla or
                    utricle, which yields in many instances a viscid or oily matter, or sometimes a
                    coloured liquor, which has led many to regard them as exercising a glandular
                    function.</p>
                <p>One species of these supposed glandular organs has been more particularly
                    examined, and their fluid analyzed, by Μ. Deyeux, who gives the following
                    account of it. Soon after the seeds of the chick-pea <hi rend="italic">(cicer
                    arietinum)</hi> are sown, its first leaves are seen to be covered with hairs, at
                    the extremity of each of which is a transparent globule, about the size of a
                    small pin-head, consisting of a fluid matter. It abounds most in mid-day, when
                    the air is warm and dry, and is scarcely perceptible at night, or when the air
                    is cold and moist; after rain, indeed, it does not again appear for two or three
                    days. When these fluid globules were removed in a dry day by blotting-paper,
                    they soon re-appeared; they were acid to the taste, reddened litmus paper, and
                    caused an effervescence in carbonate of potash when brought in contact with it.
                    He regarded them as composed of oxalic acid, the properties of which they
                    precisely resembled. <hi rend="italic">(Mém, de ľìnstit. Nat.</hi> tome i. p.

                <p>It is not easy to discriminate between some of the harder species of hairs,
                    described in the former article, and those to which the appellation of prickles
                    <hi rend="italic">(aculei)</hi> has been assigned. They are defined by Du Hamel
                    to be excrescences, often hard, and always terminated by a sharp point, which
                    are developed with the other productions of plants, but are not inclosed in
                    particular buds; so that they may for the most part be regarded as hard and
                    solid hairs. They spring equally from the stem, the branches, the petioles of
                    the leaves, and also from the leaves themselves in various plants; and' in the
                    chesnut and some others they are seen to cover the fruit. They are frequently
                    straight, but in the rose and many others are curved at the point, as in fig.
                    18, Plate XLI.; and, according to Malpighi, possess sometimes in this plant a
                    little head, which yields a viscid fluid.</p>
                <p>Regarding their structure, Grew remarked that they were connected only with the
                    skin or the bark, and he therefore named them <hi rend="italic">cortical,</hi>
                    to distinguish them from thorns properly so called, such as those of the
                    hawthorn, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193096471" xml:id="kp-eb0703-6471-0070"
                    />which spring from the wood, and which he denominates <hi rend="italic"
                    >ligneous.</hi> These latter, he adds, always ascend, while the cortical thorns
                    commonly point downwards. <hi rend="italic">(Anat. of Plants,</hi> p. 33.) In
                    proof of their origin from the bark, Du Hamel remarks, that if, after maceration
                    in boiling water, the bark of such plants be stripped off, all the prickles come
                    away with it, and leave not the smallest impression on the wood, nor even on the
                    more interior layers of the bark itself. When a section also is made of the
                    branch and prickle, as in fig. 18, Plate XLI., the wood <hi rend="italic">y</hi>
                    and the pith <hi rend="italic">z</hi> are both seen to have no connection with
                    the prickle, but the inner layer <hi rend="italic">x of</hi> the bark is
                    interposed between the base of the prickle and the wood. The prickle does not,
                    however, spring from the skin, for it is formed of many layers like the bark. As
                    the parts become more solid, it is less freely supplied with juice, and
                    therefore hardens and turns brown. <hi rend="italic">(Phys,</hi><hi

                    Malpighi states, that beside the common prickles on the leaves, there are among
                    them others of a different description. They possess more of a ligneous
                    character, are hollow internally, and contain a juice which, when it gains
                    admission beneath the skin, excites itching and tumour. <hi rend="italic">(Anat.
                    Plantar,</hi> p. 137.) Dr Hooke had previously given a much more minute account
                    of the sting of this plant. Almost every part of it, says he, is covered with
                    prickles like sharp needles. Each prickle consists of two parts, very different
                    in shape and quality from one another; one is shaped much like a round bodkin,
                    is very hard and stiff, exceedingly transparent and clear, and hollow from top
                    to bottom. When this bodkin is thrust into the skin, it does not at all bend;
                    but a certain liquor is then seen to move up and down in it, rising towards the
                    top, when the point is pressed down on the base. This base is formed by a little
                    bag, is more pliable than the bodkin part, and within it is a cellular
                    structure, which contains a thin transparent liquor (see fig. 19, Plate XLI.):
                    it is this liquor that rises in the tube, and, being deposited beneath the skin
                    after it is punctured, excites the irritation that succeeds. <hi rend="italic"

                <p>The true thorn <hi rend="italic">(spina)</hi> derives its origin, as Grew
                    remarked, from the ligneous part of the plant, and in some plants is produced
                    from the degeneration of some other organ, as of the leaf, or even the branch
                    itself: we shall therefore defer the further consideration of its structure,
                    until we come to treat of that of the branch.</p>

                <p><hi rend="italic">Of the Glands of Vegetables.</hi></p>
                <p>Perhaps in the whole science of anatomy there is no word that has been employed
                    with such latitude of signification, and is therefore exposed to so much
                    ambiguity, as the term <hi rend="italic">gland.</hi> In animal anatomy it was
                    doubtless used at first to denominate certain organs, from the external
                    resemblance which they bore to certain fruits or seeds; and in that sense it is
                    still employed on several occasions. Afterwards it was understood to signify not
                    so much the external form as the internal organization, and was considered to
                    express a certain structure, by which alone the function of secretion could be
                    exercised; but it is well observed by Dr Thomson, in his valuable work on
                    Inflammation, that “the definition of a secreting glandular part must be taken
                    from its function, and not from its structure; for nothing can be more various
                    than the internal structure of those organs that are denominated glandular
                    secreting organs: they consist sometimes of convoluted vessels, sometimes of
                    follicles or small hollow bags, and sometimes of transparent membranes, in which
                    neither convoluted vessels nor mucous follicles can be perceived,’.’ <hi
                    rend="italic">(Lectures on Inflammation,</hi> p. 318.) Besides these mor <hi
                    rend="subscript"> c</hi> simple structures, it is well known that most of the
                    internal <hi rend="italic">viscera</hi> are likewise denominated glands, though
                    dif? fering in all their characters from those just mentioned.</p>
                <p>The ambiguity which thus prevails in animal anatomy,i in relation to the use of
                    the term gland, has been increased! tenfold in the applications that have been
                    made αf it <hi rend="subscript"> to</hi> t the organs of vegetables. It is
                    justly observed by Μ. de Candolle, in reference to this subject, that the
                    numerous approximations in structure between vegetables and animais have often
                    promoted our researches into the former but have sometimes led physiologists
                    astray, and int∏&gt; duced into the language of botany many inexact expres∙
                    sions. In animal anatomy the term gland is understood to express some organ that
                    exercises a secretory function; but in vegetable anatomy this term has often
                    been applied to bodies that are not known to be real secretory organs. Thus the
                    cells of the cellular tissue, which frequently contain resinous or oily matter,
                    have been sometimes named <hi rend="italic">cellular glands</hi><hi

                    is therefore deemed a gland; but. Linnaeus, with his usual disregard both of the
                    structure and function of organs, considers as a nectary, not only the body
                    which may secrete, but any other that may serve as a receptacle of the
                    secretion; and indeed is said to comprehend under this term all those bodies
                    which have no resemblance to the other parts of the flower, in whatever variety
                    of form they may appear, or whatever purpose they may serve. (Will-denow’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Principles of Botany,</hi> p. 87.) In some other instances the
                    term gland has been used, not to express the secreting organ itself, nor even
                    the receptacle of the secretion, but the solid excreted matter on the surface of
                    certain leaves; and others consider hairs, and every other protuberance that
                    projects from the surface, and contains a fluid different from the common sap,
                    as entitled to the distinctive appellation of gland.</p>
                <p>Amid such diversity of opinion concerning the structure, position, and function
                    of these minute organs, and. such vagueness in the methods employed to
                    characterize! them, it is extremely difficult to define their true nature, or
                    declare the principle on which this definition should proceed. The mere
                    existence of a fluid, distinct from the common sap in any organ, cannot be
                    considered as bestowing on it the title of gland, otherwise the greater portion
                    of some plants would come to be regarded as glandular: those varieties of
                    structure which exercise no secretory function may also be excluded from the
                    list of glands; and so likewise the hairs of plants, though containing peculiar
                    fluids, may be excluded, since these peculiarities appear to arise frequently
                    from circumstances foreign to the action of the organ itself; and even if they
                    do not, some specific variation of the general name they bear is preferable to
                    the employment of so ambiguous a word as gland. But where any organ is distinct
                    from the com· mon textures of the vegetable, and by the peculiarity of its
                    structure is fitted to produce those changes on the vegetable fluids which we
                    name secretion, it may be deemed a secreting organ. This secretory function,
                    however, may sometimes be exercised, as in animal bodies, by membranous
                    surfaces, and sometimes by small isolated bodιe⅛ to which, perhaps, may properly
                    belong the denomination of glands.</p>
                <p>But even though this method of defining glands were <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193096484" xml:id="kp-eb0703-6484-0071"/>adopted, it still is a matter
                    of no small difficulty to distingish their species by appropriate appellations.
                    In animal anatomy no settled rule obtains; but the name of the gland is assigned
                    from some accidental circumstance of situation, figure, use, &amp;c. In
                    vegetable anatomy the btanist, regarding glands only as aiding the
                    discrimination of species, refers commonly to their situation, and speaks of
                    foliaceous, stipular, or petiolar glands, according as they happen to be seated
                    on the leaves, the stipules, or the petioles. The anatomist imposes names
                    according to their forms, as they chance most to resemble a globule, an utricle,
                    or some other figure; and the physiologist is chiefly directed by ideas which
                    indicate their functions, disstinguishing them into mucous, oily, resinous, or
                    nectariferous glands, according to the nature of the fluid they furnish. Of
                    these different modes, that which proceeds on the apparent form, where it can be
                    discovered, seems the most precise; but as this cannot always be accomplished,
                    the situation of the organ, or the nature of the secreted fluid, must
                    occasionally be had recourse to.</p>
                <p>Of these bodies it is to be remarked that they differ in one respect from most of
                    the corresponding organs in aninimals, almost all of them being seated on the
                    <hi rend="italic">external parts</hi> of the plant, like several of the more
                    simple glandular bodies in animals. This arises from the greater simplicity of
                    vegetable organization, particularly as it regards the absorbent system, the
                    mode of growth, and the permanence of the organs produced; whence it happens
                    that the living parts of aged perennial plants are situated only at or near the
                    surface; and it is only in such parts that active secretory functions can have
                    place. Hence it is on .cculent stems, on leaves, flowers, and fruits, during the
                    active state of vegetation, that the glandular functions of vegetables must be
                    exercised; and which parts, therefore, are the appropriate seat of glands.</p>
                <p>In some leaves a secretory function extends over a great part of the surface, as
                    in some species of <hi rend="italic">Cistus,</hi> of sugar-maple, of larch, and
                    others enumerated by Du Hammel, on which various collections of saccharine,
                    gummy, and resinous matter arc found. <hi rend="italic">(Phys,</hi><hi

                    mentions the occurrence of an infinite number of round balls resembling pearls,
                    and which, says he, are nothing but a gummy exudation. <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Micrographia,</hi> p. 142.) Μ. Guettard has described not fewer than seven
                    species of glandular bodies on the leaves of different plants, to which he
                    assigned names, chiefly from the appearance of their form; these are the <hi

                    species is found to be identical with the thin scale that covers the
                    fructification of ferns. Others add to this list the organ called nectary; but
                    the very vague notions entertained of its nature and use altogether preclude the
                    possibility of assigning to it any precise anatomical character.</p>
                <p>Other writers have proposed to reduce all the bodies: called glands to two
                    classes, the <hi rend="italic">cellular</hi> and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >vascular,</hi> according as they conceive them to be formed of cellular tissue
                    simply, or of this tissue and vessels combined. But such an arrangement would
                    lead us, in some instances, to confound the mere receptacles of secreted fluids
                    with the organs that secrete them,—would bestow a secretory function on organs
                    considered by these writers to be <hi rend="italic">non-vascular,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">—</hi> and convert the entire cellular tissue of the plant into a
                    simple glandular body. The glands of plants may indeed possess the form and size
                    of cells; but they are not, like cells, close cavities; they resemble more the
                    follicles and mucous glands of the animal system, and, from the nature of their
                    function, must always be regarded as vascular.</p>
                <p>Of organs so minute, and so very imperfectly known and characterized, nothing can
                    be attempted in the way of anatomical demonstration. This, however, is the less
                    to be regretted, as the glandular system in plants appears in general to be of
                    much less consequence in the vegetable than it is in the animal economy.</p>
                <p>PART II.</p>
                <p>THE ANATOMY OF THE INDIVIDUAL MEMBERS AND ORGANS OF VEGETABLES.</p>
                <p>In the preceding Part we have described, in general, the nature of the elementary
                    organs and common textures that compose the entire plant; and we come now to the
                    second division of our subject, viz. the description of individual members and
                    organs. Following the method of Grew, we shall first exhibit the anatomy of the
                    seed, and the changes of form and structure displayed in its evolution. We shall
                    next treat of the mature plant, and exhibit views of the more remarkable
                    varieties of structure observed in its several members, as the trunk, the
                    branch, and the root. The organs that originate from these members, as buds,
                    leaves, flowers, and fruits, will then be duly noticed; and we shall terminate
                    our descriptions by a brief exhibition of the formation and structure of the
                    vegetable <hi rend="italic">ovum</hi> in its progress towards the state of the
                    perfect seed.</p>
                <p>The limits within which, in a work like the present, we are necessarily
                    circumscribed, will render our view of these individual structures, when
                    compared with the immense variety that obtains in nature, exceedingly imperfect;
                    but our purpose will be accomplished if we succeed in exhibiting a correct and
                    tolerably comprehensive outline of the great features of vegetable organization,
                    as they are displayed in the individual parts and organs of the more perfect
                    plants.</p>
                <p>CHAP. I.</p>
                <p>THE ANATOMY OF SEEDS.</p>

                    >Art.</hi><hi rend="italic">Ĩ.—Of the External Characters and Component Parts of
                    Seeds.</hi></p>
                <p>The seed or egg of vegetables <hi rend="italic">(semen vel ovum)</hi> is formed
                    at the base of the pistil of the flower, in an organ called the ovary <hi
                    rend="italic">(ovarium),</hi> hereafter to be described. This organ takes the
                    name of pericarp when the seed is mature, and is then said to be formed of three
                    parts, enveloping each other. The outer membrane has been called epicarp, and
                    the inner one endocarp, between which the thicker portion, called sarcocarp, is
                    placed. In fleshy fruits, as the peach and apple, the sarcocarp is very thick,
                    and contains the matter which nourishes the seed. Interiorly, the pericarp is
                    either simple or separated by one or more partitions into cells, which contain
                    the seeds. The seeds accordingly communicate with or are attached to the
                    pericarp, at the point of the seed named <hi rend="italic">hilum,</hi> from
                    which point the vesSels<pb break="no" facs="nls:193096497"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0703-6497-0072"/> pass through the inner membrane of the pericarp,
                    and are continued to its fleshy portion, which supplies the materials for its
                    growth. These vessels form the umbilical cord <hi rend="italic"
                    >(funiculus</hi><hi rend="italic">umbilicalis')</hi>; but sometimes, it is said,
                    this cord, from its extreme tenuity, or implication with other organs, cannot be
                    discovered. When the seed has attained to maturity, the umbilical cord dries up
                    and breaks, and the pericarp opens in various ways in different plants, to
                    permit the escape of t∣ħβ seed-</p>
                <p>• The seeds of different plants exhibit the greatest diversity in number, size,
                    and figure. Sometimes they are few, in other instances very numerous. In one
                    plant of white poppy Grew reckoned 32,000 seeds, and on the spike of a species
                    of <hi rend="italic">typha</hi> he numbered 40,176 seeds; so that, upon the
                    three spikes which one stalk of this plant bears, there are every year produced
                    more than 120,000 seeds. <hi rend="italic">(Anat. of Plants,</hi> p. 198.) In
                    figure the varieties in seeds are so numerous as to baffle description; and,
                    with respect to size, many are so minute as not to be visible to the naked eye,
                    and others so large as to reach several pounds in weight.</p>
                <p>The part at which the seed has separated from the ovary is indicated by a small
                    mark or scar, called by Malpighi <hi rend="italic">fenestra,</hi> by Linnaeus
                    <hi rend="italic">hilum,</hi> and by Gaertner <hi rend="italic">umbilicus.</hi>
                    In some seeds this scar is of considerable extent, and is the only mark that is
                    visible; in other instances there seems to be present a <hi rend="italic"
                    >foramen</hi> in addition to the scar. All seeds, says Grew, have their outer
                    coats open, either by a particular aperture, or by the breaking off of the cord,
                    or by the entrance of the cord into the substance of the seed, as in those which
                    have a shelly or stony covering. In the bean this aperture is placed on the
                    side, in the chesnut on the top, in the gourd at the bottom; and in each case
                    the point of the radicle is opposed to the aperture, and first pushes forth
                    through it. <hi rend="italic">(Anat. of Plants,</hi> book i.) In many seeds,
                    however, the radicle is not thus opposed to the umbilicus, but, according to
                    Gaertner, is variously placed with regard to it; and in the seeds of the apple
                    and pear, Malpighi considers no proper umbilical aperture to exist, but only an
                    <hi rend="italic">hiatus</hi> to be formed by the relaxation of the tunics,
                    through which the radicle makes its way. <hi rend="italic">(Anat. Plantar,</hi>
                    p. 9.)</p>
                <p>There can be no doubt that, in every case, a connection subsisted between the
                    seed and the ovary during the formation of the seed; but this, in different
                    examples, may have much varied. In all cases an umbilical cord must have
                    existed, and appears, in many examples, from inspection of mature seeds, to have
                    been the only visible medium of connection. In the bean, however, besides the
                    umbilical cord there are marks of a connection also between the coats of the
                    seed and those of the ovary that contained it, so that the scar or cicatrix, in
                    that and similar cases, is distinct from the umbilical aperture. The scar is the
                    mark left by the separation of the tunics continued from the ovary; the foramen
                    is the aperture produced by the separation of the umbilical cord. It will be
                    afterwards stated that the outer coat of the seed appears always to have
                    originated from the inner coat of the ovary, so that it forms a sheath about the
                    umbilical cord. If, therefore, as in the bean, these coats are thick, and the
                    umbilical cord short, then traces of the separation, both of the coats and of
                    the cord, will remain on the seed; if, on the other hand, the coats are thin,
                    and the cord more elongated, this latter will be closely invested by the former,
                    and the umbilical scar will present the appearance only of a simple aperture, as
                    is common to many seeds.</p>
                <p>A late writer, Μ. Turpin, regards the umbilical scar as consisting of three
                    parts, viz. the proper cicatrix itself, in the centre of which he describes an
                    aperture through' which the nutrient vessels passed to the embryo; and near' to
                    it another smaller aperture, through which he believes the spermatic vessels to
                    have passed. The former he calls the <hi rend="italic">omphalode,</hi> the
                    latter the <hi rend="italic">micropyle,</hi> and declares that he observed it in
                    more than 1200 seeds. <hi rend="italic">(An. du</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Mus.</hi><hi rend="italic">d’Hist. Nat.</hi> tome vii. p. 199.)</p>
                <p>From the situation of the umbilicus, the several parts or regions of the seed
                    have been defined. They are six' in number. The part where the umbilicus itself
                    is placed is termed the <hi rend="italic">basis,</hi> and the point at the
                    opposite extremity the <hi rend="italic">vertex</hi> of the seed; the upper or
                    back part is named the <hi rend="italic">dorsum</hi> or back, and the part
                    opposite to it the <hi rend="italic">venter</hi> or belly; while the two lateral
                    portions are called the sides <hi rend="italic">(laterd).</hi> The point where
                    the umbilical cord is inserted into the inner coat has been named the <hi
                    rend="italic">internal umbilicus.</hi> This point usually coincides with that of
                    the external, but, from a change in the relative position of the parts during
                    their formation, this coincidence is not always to be observed. (Gaertner <hi
                    rend="italic">de</hi><hi rend="italic">Fructibus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >et</hi><hi rend="italic">Seminibus</hi><hi rend="italic">Plantarum,</hi> vol.
                    i.)</p>
                <p>When examined in its mature state, the seed is found' to be composed of certain
                    coats or tunics, which inclose' a kernel or <hi rend="italic">nucleus,</hi> that
                    also consists of several distinct parts. At an early period of growth, while the
                    parts are still green and succulent, two coats are easily distinguished, as in
                    the transverse section of the bean (fig. 30, Plate XXXVIII.), in which the inner
                    coat <hi rend="italic">a</hi> appears much thicker than the outer, and the
                    radicle <hi rend="italic">b</hi> is seen rising through it.</p>
                <p>When these coats are stripped off, the parts which form the <hi rend="italic"
                    >nucleus</hi> are brought into view. They consist, in the bean and most other
                    seeds, of two distinct parts, the lobes or cotyledons, as they have been called,
                    and the radicle and plume. These several parts can be seen only by separating
                    the two lobes from each other, as is done in fig. 31, where the letters <hi
                    rend="italic">cc</hi> denote the cotyledons, <hi rend="italic">d</hi> the
                    radicle, and <hi rend="italic">e</hi> the plume. Such seeds as have thus two
                    coty ±edons are named <hi rend="italic">dicoyledonous.</hi></p>
                <p>In many seeds, however, the part called cotyledon is single, and often bears but
                    a small proportion to the entire bulk of the seed. Seeds which have thus but one
                    cotyledon are named <hi rend="smallcaps">Monocotyledons</hi>; and to this
                    division the seeds of wheat, of barley, and of all the grasses belong.</p>
                <p>Many of the lower tribes of plants are entirely destitute of a cotyledon, and are
                    called <hi rend="smallcaps">Acotyledons.</hi> Some writers assert that some
                    seeds have more than two cotyledons, and such seeds they have denominated <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Polycotyledons;</hi> but others, again, choose to consider
                    these appearances not as distinct cotyledons, but only as deep fissures, or
                    divisions into two primary lobes; and hence conclude, that all seeds having a
                    cotyledon may be classed under the two divisions of mono and di-cotyledons.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Art.</hi> II.— <hi rend="italic">Description and Structure
                    of the Coats of Seeds.</hi></p>
                <p>Having given this general view of the several parts that compose the seed, we
                    proceed now to a more particular description of their structure; and, as the
                    tunics come first into view, we shall begin with them. These tunics, in some
                    seeds, are two; in others, three in number. By Grew they were named coats or
                    covers; by Malpighi&gt; <hi rend="italic">secundinae</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi> and by Gaertner, <hi rend="italic">testa</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >membrana</hi><hi rend="italic">interna.</hi> We shall speak of them in the
                    familiar terms of the outer, the inner, and the middle coats or tunics.</p>
                <p>The outer coat or <hi rend="italic">testa</hi> of Gaertner is described as a
                    constant and essential part of the seed. It existed before the period of
                    fecundation, and is sometimes the only apparent <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193096510" xml:id="kp-eb0703-6510-0073"/>∣, covering possessed by the
                    mature seed. Some seeds have indeed been considered to possess no tunic
                    whatever, and have therefore, says Gaertner, been named <hi rend="italic"
                    >acocca</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> but in such seeds there existed a coat
                    before they arrived at maturity, and its apparent absence has been inferred from
                    its extreme thinness, or its condensation with the sides of the surrounding
                    ovary. <hi rend="italic">(De</hi><hi rend="italic">Fructib.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">et</hi><hi rend="italic">Seminib. Plantar.</hi> vol. i. p∙ 132.) A
                    distinguished botanist, however, Mr Brown, is said to have discovered two
                    examples of seeds absolutely destitute of a covering, from their first
                    appearance to their state of maturity. (Thomson’s <hi rend="italic">Annals of
                    Philosophy,</hi> vol. i. p. 310.)</p>
                <p>∣ In different seeds this tunic possesses a very different structure, being in
                    some thin and membranous; in others of a spongy or fleshy nature; and in others,
                    again, it approaches to the consistence of leather or bone. But how various
                    soever in this respect, it is always an entire tunic, and has no aperture but
                    that of the umbilical foramen. Its colour is usually deeper than that of the
                    other parts of the seed; and in this particular it presents every possible
                    variety. It has rarely any connection with the nucleus, except in some
                    monocotyledons. (Gaertner, vol. i. cap. 9.) With regard to its origin, Malpighi
                    describes it, in its earliest state in the almond, as derived from the ovary
                    itself, being composed of reticulated vessels, which spring from the surrounding
                    organ. In other instances it is thicker, and is distinctly seen to be cellular
                    as well as vascular; and in the bean and pea, little tubes are said by Malpighi
                    to originate from the cells, and terminate by open mouths on the surface. <hi
                    rend="italic">(Anat. Plantar,</hi> p. 9.)</p>
                <p>Both Malpighi and Grew discovered, in some instances, a very thin membrane to
                    cover this outer coat, which, according to Gaertner, may be found in most seeds,
                    if the parts be scrupulously examined. Its structure is sometimes membranous,
                    often downy, and sometimes mucilaginous; it possesses occasionally considerable
                    thickness, and at other times is a mere pellicle, and thence has been named <hi
                    rend="italic">pellicula.</hi> It covers the whole seed, and does not ever
                    separate spontaneously from it. (Gaertner <hi rend="italic">de Fructib.</hi>
                    &amp;c. vol. i. cap. 9.)</p>
                <p>Besides this pellicle, another fine tunic named <hi rend="italic">arillus</hi> is
                    sometimes observed on the surface of the seed, as in the seed of euphorbia. It
                    originates from the umbilical cord at the base, and extends more or less
                    completely over the body of the seed. Its structure is very various, being
                    sometimes soft and pulpy, at others thin and membranous, and in others forming a
                    husky covering. It forms, in some instances, only a loose and partial covering;
                    and in others it invests the seed so closely and completely, that it can
                    scarcely be distinguished from the outer coat itself. Both in figure and colour
                    it often varies greatly, but, like the pellicle before described, it is regarded
                    rather as an accessory than a necessary integument.</p>
                <p>To the exterior coat of the seed various appendages are sometimes attached, as
                    down, wings, spines, hooks, all designed either as a defence to seeds or to
                    facilitate their dispersion. They are distinguished and described by the
                    botanist, but are in general of too fine a texture to be made the subject of
                    anatomical demonstration.</p>
                <p>ſhe inner tunic <hi rend="italic">(membrana</hi><hi rend="italic">interna of</hi>
                    Gaertner) is a common but not constant part of the mature seed. It appears
                    sometimes to be wanting, when in reality it is present. During the formation of
                    the seed it is frequently so extenuated, or coalesces so completely with the
                    outer coat, that it cannot be properly distinguished. In its earlier state it is
                    represented by Grew as a very spongy and succulent body, and as thick and bulky
                    as one or the lobes itself; but it dries and shrinks up as the seed approaches
                    maturity, so that it is sometimes scarcely discernible. <hi rend="italic">(Anat.
                    of Plants,</hi> p. 47.) In the seeds of mpst plants it closely invests the
                    nucleus, but is easily separable from the outer tunic. In those of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Gramineae,</hi> where the bulk of the seed consists almost
                    entirely of unorganized matter, no separation of this tunic from the contained
                    parts occurs; but its inner surface is formed into a cellular tissue, in the
                    cells of which the nutrient matter is lodged. In other instances the inner
                    surface is prolonged into processes, which penetrate into the nucleus, and
                    intersect it in various directions.</p>
                <p>This inner tunic does not, like the former, exist before fecundation, but is
                    formed subsequently to it. It is composed of vessels and cellular tissue. The
                    cells are commonly larger than those of the outer coat. It has no aperture, says
                    Gaertner, not even an umbilical one; but resembles a shut sac, over whose
                    external surface the umbilical vessels creep, and open, in an insensible manner,
                    within its cavity. <hi rend="italic">(De Fructib. &amp;c.</hi> cap. 9.) The
                    distribution of the vessels throughout the whole of this coat Grew compares to
                    that in the leaf.</p>
                <p>Beneath this inner tunic Grew describes another fine membrane, which immediately
                    invests the lobes or cotyledons of the seed. In the bean it is exquisitely thin,
                    and so firmly continuous with the lobes, that some dexterity is required to
                    accomplish its separation. It is spread not only over the convex surface of the
                    lobes, but also over the inner or flat surfaces, where they are contiguous,
                    extending likewise over the radicle and plume, and so over the whole nucleus of
                    the seed. It does not, like the other tunics, cease to grow in germination, but
                    is augmented and grows with the organic parts. <hi rend="italic">(Anat. of
                    Plants,</hi> b. i. ch. 1.) This tunic may be regarded either as a covering to
                    the nucleus, or as an actual portion of it, as Gaertner, who speaks only of two
                    coats, seems to have considered it. It appears, however, more proper to regard
                    it as the inmost coat, and thus to conclude, with Grew, that the covers in most
                    seeds are three. <hi rend="italic">(Ibid.</hi> b. iv. ch. 3.) The coat last
                    described must in that case be considered as the middle tunic, being situated
                    between the outer one and that which is continuous with the nucleus. In many
                    seeds, however, only two coats are distinctly visible.</p>
                <p>The foregoing tunics not only contain the nutrient matter, and afford a
                    mechanical protection to the organic parts, &lt; but seem fitted also, by their
                    chemical constitution, to resist the operation of agents that might otherwise
                    effect their decomposition, and that of the nucleus they inclose. From the
                    experiments of Fourcroy and Vauquelin, on the tunics of certain seeds that grow
                    in marshy situations, it appears that, besides the usual ingredients of
                    vegetable substances, there exists in them a compound, formed by a combination
                    of tannin with a peculiar matter of an animal nature, in union with a vegetable
                    acid. This combination of tannin with the matter just mentioned renders these
                    tunics insoluble in water, and enables them to resist putrefaction, although
                    buried for long periods in the moist earth. The tunics of those seeds which do
                    not possess this chemical constitution may, it is added, by their ligneous or
                    horny texture, or by the oily matter with which they are penetrated, present
                    similar obstacles to the action of decomposing agents. <hi rend="italic"

                <p>We proceed next to describe the parts contained with-; in the above-mentioned
                    coats or tunics, and which con-i stitute the <hi rend="italic">nucleus</hi> of
                    the seed. These parts, as already 1 observed, consist of the radicle, the plume,
                    and cotyledons, together, in most instances, with the nutrient mat <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193096523" xml:id="kp-eb0703-6523-0074"/> ter destined to
                    support their future growth. The three former bodies are completely organized,
                    but the nutrient matter is wholly inorganic, varies greatly in quantity and
                    proportion in different seeds, and is very variously situated with respect to
                    the organized parts.</p>
                <p>These parts, which in the progress of their evolution give birth to the new
                    vegetable, derive their visible origin from a medullary point, that succeeds to
                    the act of fecundation. By some these organized parts have been called the <hi
                    rend="italic">corcuhιm,</hi> by others <hi rend="italic">embryo,</hi> by others
                    <hi rend="italic">foetus,</hi> and by others <hi rend="italic">plantula</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">seminalis.</hi> The primary point or particle from which they
                    originate may with propriety, says Gaertner, be termed <hi rend="italic"
                    >corculum,</hi> since it is the source and scat of vegetable life, and from it
                    the whole vascular system of the embryo proceeds. In some instances this
                    corculum increases so little as to be scarcely visible even in the mature seed,
                    or exhibits only a palish spot, which has been termed <hi rend="italic"
                    >cicatricula</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> in others it forms a roundish radicle,
                    whose apex is free and rises above the nucleus, but whose base is firmly
                    connected with it; in others, again, the corculum is still more disengaged,
                    enlarging at each extremity, and producing at one end the radicle, and
                    separating at the other into the two lobes called cotyledons, between which the
                    first bud or plume of the future plant is situated. From this varying growth of
                    the corculum, an embryo, more or less perfect, is produced. When the embryo
                    presents only a mere germinating point, it is styled <hi rend="italic"
                    >imperfect</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> when it exhibits a simple radicle, it is
                    deemed <hi rend="italic">incomplete;</hi> when it possesses both radicle and
                    cotyledon, it is considered <hi rend="italic">perfect</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi> and when it consists of radicle, cotyledon, and plume, it is pronounced
                    <hi rend="italic">complete.</hi> (Gaertner <hi rend="italic">de Fructib.
                    &amp;c.</hi> vol. i. cap. 13.)</p>
                <p>In the mature seeds of the less perfect plants the embryo is altogether invisible
                    until after germination, and even in many other instances its characters cannot
                    be accurately traced. Its general figure is determined by that of the radicle
                    and cotyledons, and is exceedingly various in different seeds. In size it ranges
                    from a minute point to that of a body of considerable magnitude. In consistence
                    it is almost always soft and herbaceous, but its radicle possesses sometimes a
                    ligneous hardness. No seed contains more than one embryo, except in cases of <hi
                    rend="italic">superfoetation,</hi> of which Gaertner saw one instance in <hi
                    rend="italic">Pinus</hi><hi rend="italic">Cembra,</hi> a seed of which contained
                    two embryos within one and the same cavity. <hi rend="italic">(De Fructib.</hi>
                    &amp;c. vol. i. p. 168.) Malpighi also records a similar occurrence in a seed of
                    <hi rend="italic">Prunus Armeniaca</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and the seeds of
                    some <hi rend="italic">Gramineae,</hi> as will afterwards be shown, are capable
                    of evolving an indefinite number of embryos. Every <hi rend="italic"
                    >complete</hi> embryo is said to consist of three distinct parts beside
                    cotyledons. These are the radicle, the stem, and the plume.</p>
                <p>The radicle <hi rend="italic">(radicula),</hi> called <hi rend="italic"
                    >rostellum</hi> by Linnaeus, is the most constant part of the embryo, being
                    found in some seeds in which no other trace of that body can be discovered. In
                    the seeds, however, of the less perfect plants, and even in those of some
                    monocotyledons, no radicle is visible antecedent to germination. In some rare
                    instances among dicoyledons, as in <hi rend="italic">nelumbo nucifera,</hi> no
                    radicle exists; but in germination the stem first rises upward, and afterwards
                    emits rootlets from its sides. <hi rend="italic">(An.</hi><hi rend="italic">du
                    Mus.</hi><hi rend="italic">d’ Hist. Nat.</hi> tome xiii.)</p>
                <p>The size of the radicle is very various, and so also is its figure, being either
                    conical, cylindrical, filiform, or tubercular, &amp;c. It always, says Gaertner,
                    occurs solitary, except in <hi rend="italic">secale, triticum,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">hordeum,</hi> to which alone, of all known seeds, three, four, or
                    six radicles, properly formed, and distinct from each other, are furnished to
                    each embryo. <hi rend="italic">(De Fructib.</hi> &amp;c. p.,169.) This plurality
                    of radicles in the <hi rend="italic">cerealia</hi> had before been remarked by(
                    Malpighi. Μ. du Hamel describes the seed of misletoe'' <hi rend="italic"
                    >(viscum</hi><hi rend="italic">album)</hi> as emitting numerous radicles like
                    those of wheat. <hi rend="italic">(Mém. de l’Acad. des Sciences,</hi> 1740.)</p>
                <p>The stem <hi rend="italic">(scapus)</hi> of the embryo is a continuation of] the
                    radicle, and connects it with the plume. It is frequently wanting altogether,
                    nor, when it is present, can we fix precisely on the point where the radicle
                    ends and the stem begins. What is called stem descends frequently into the
                    earth, and becomes a true root; so that every part of the embryo situated
                    beneath the cotyledons might without impropriety be denominated radicle. The
                    place of junction between the radicle and stem was called by Grew the <hi
                    rend="italic">coarcture,</hi> from its presenting often an evident degree of
                    contraction; but Μ. Bonnet and others have given it the more appropriate name of
                    the neck <hi rend="italic">(collum)</hi> of the seed.</p>
                <p>The plume <hi rend="italic">(plumula)</hi> is the first bud of the new plant In
                    seeds that possess but one cotyledon it is very generally wanting; and even in
                    those which have two cotyledons it is not unfrequently absent, or is at least
                    concealed within the stem. In most of the latter sort of seeds, however, the
                    plume is met with. It is placed on the top of the stem or radicle, and lies
                    between the cotyledons, by which it is variously compressed and folded on
                    itself. In the greater number of seeds it is not entire, but at its free end is
                    divided into several pieces, all closely couched together, like feathers in a
                    bunch, and thence called the <hi rend="italic">plume</hi> by Grew. In different
                    seeds its several little leaves vary much in figure, size, and number. The
                    structure both of the radicle and plume will be most advantageously displayed in
                    connection with that of the cotyledons.</p>
                <p>Of the organized parts of the seed, the organs called by ’ Grew <hi rend="italic"
                    >lobes</hi> or <hi rend="italic">dissimilar leaves,</hi> by Malpighi <hi
                    rend="italic">seminal leaves</hi> or cotyledons, remain to be described. The
                    cotyledons derive their origin from the embryo itself, of which they constitute
                    a part. The seeds, however, of some tribes of vegetables, as before remarked,
                    are held not to possess these organs; and in many others the mass of nutrient
                    matter has been confounded with them. When present they are either simple or
                    divided. The simple cotyledon is formed by the mere extension of the corculum,
                    and is in truth scarcely distinguishable from the stem itself. The double or
                    conjugate cotyledons are produced by fissures, which usually divide that part of
                    the embryo that is opposed to the radicle into two or more equal portions or
                    lobes. These lobes have at first the appearance of mere tubercles, and in many
                    seeds they retain this form unchanged; but in others they gradually expand into
                    <hi rend="italic">lamella</hi> or plates, which augment in size, and finally
                    exhibit the proper form of cotyledons. This form is very various, as likewise is
                    the size of these organs. Sometimes they are so small as to be scarcely visible,
                    and sometimes so large as to form the chief portion of the seed. Their substance
                    is either thin, or thick, or turgid. Their colour is commonly white, but
                    sometimes yellowish, purple, or green, the colour into which they all pass
                    during germination.</p>
                <p>Concerning the structure of the cotyledons, it may be said that, in the more
                    perfectly developed seeds, they are formed of cellular tissue, through which
                    vessels are everywhere distributed; and, as we have already remarked, they are
                    everywhere covered by a fine pellicle or coat, which prevents alike their
                    adherence to the plume and to each other. This cellular structure of the
                    cotyledon is well displayed by Grew (fig. 32, Plate XXXVIII.) in a slice of the
                    cotyledon of the recent bean; and it is easily seen in a thin slice of almost
                    any mature seed, if it be held <pb break="no" facs="nls:193096536"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0703-6536-0075"/>. against the light after it has been soaked in
                    water. This 'cellular structure extends into the radicle and plume, but in much
                    smaller proportion, constituting, according to Grew, about three fifths of the
                    plume, five sevenths of the radicle, and nine tenths of the cotyledon.</p>
                <p>Through all the organs that compose the nucleus vessels are distributed, by the
                    medium of which a general communication is established among them. This vascular
                    system is likewise exhibited by Grew in the dissection of a bean (fig. 34, Plate
                    XXXVIII.), in which the vessels are seen to branch off on each side from the
                    radicle, and spread themselves by innumerable ramifications through the
                    cotyledons. From the radicle vessels also pass upwards to the plume. These
                    vessels of the radicle are visible when a transverse section is made through it,
                    as in fig. 33, α, Plate XXXVIII., in which they are seen to occupy the middle of
                    that body. When the section is made higher up at the neck of the embryo, as in
                    the same figure, <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> then the central trunk, surrounded by
                    several smaller fasciculi of vessels, passing to the different parts of the
                    plume, is still more clearly exposed. In many seeds, however, the organized
                    parts are so small that their general structure cannot be traced, except during
                    the progress of their germination. We shall therefore defer the description of
                    them till we come to treat of their evolution, and shall then also go more fully
                    into the structure of the parts just mentioned.</p>
                <p>Within the cells of the cotyledon, in many dicoyledonous seeds, the nutrient
                    matter destined to support the future growth of the embryo is entirely
                    contained. In other instances this matter is only in part received into those
                    organs; and in the <hi rend="italic">Gramineoe,</hi> and other monocotyledons,
                    it is often placed almost entirely exterior to the cotyledon. This matter is
                    produced from a clear liquor that is secreted in the tunic during the formation
                    of the seed. To this liquor Grew gave the name of <hi rend="italic"
                    >albumen,</hi> from its likeness, not only in appearance, but, as he conceived,
                    in use also, to the white of egg in animals. By Malpighi this matter, considered
                    in connection with the tissue that contains it, is often called the flesh <hi
                    rend="italic">(card)</hi> of the seed; and from its being sometimes situated
                    around the embryo, it has been denominated <hi rend="italic">perisperm</hi> by
                    Μ. Jussieu. We follow Grew and Gaertner in the use of the term <hi rend="italic"
                    >albumen,</hi> meaning to express thereby, not the primaryanimal compound to
                    which chemists have of late assigned that term, and which is found but in few
                    vegetables; but that compound substance which, whatever be its situation,
                    quantity, or colour, constitutes the nutrient matter of the seed.</p>
                <p>This albumen is a very constant part of the mature seed, but its proportion in
                    some seeds is so extremely small, that the seeds in which it occurs have been
                    termed <hi rend="italic">exalbuminous</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and in a few
                    instances it seems to be entirely wanting. Its quantity, situation, and figure,
                    in different seeds, are subject to very great variation. In the seeds of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Gramineoe,</hi> where the embryo acquires only a very small size,
                    the albumen constitutes almost the entire bulk of the seed, and is placed wholly
                    exterior to the embryo. In the <hi rend="italic">Leguminosoe,</hi> on the other
                    hand, the embryo is more completely developed, and the whole of the albuminous
                    matter is contained within the cotyledons. In beet <hi rend="italic"
                    >(beta),</hi> and many others, the albumen is partly received into the
                    cotyledons, and lies in part exterior to them; and where this occurs the embryo
                    sometimes encircles the albumen, and is sometimes encircled by it. In <hi
                    rend="italic">Rheum</hi> the embryo is placed in the centre of the albumen, in
                    <hi rend="italic">Rumex</hi> and some others it is applied on the side of it, in
                    <hi rend="italic">Atriplex</hi> the long cylindrical embryo surrounds the
                    albumen, in <hi rend="italic">B'óerhaavia</hi> the embryo and its cotyledons
                    cover entirely the granulated substance of the albumen. (Μ. Jussieu, <hi
                    rend="italic">An.</hi><hi rend="italic">du Mus.</hi><hi rend="italic">d</hi> ’
                    <hi rend="italic">Hist. Nat.</hi> tome v. p. 224.) In the onion <hi
                    rend="italic">(allium cepa)</hi> the embryo makes several curves within the
                    substance of the albumen, and in dodder <hi rend="italic">(cuscuta)</hi> it is
                    twisted around it in a spiral form; so that the relative positions of the embryo
                    and albumen, as well as their quantity, proportion, and figure, are subject to
                    endless variation.</p>
                <p>But however much in these respects the albumen may vary, it is always contained
                    within an organized structure. Sometimes this structure is that of the
                    cotyledon, as already exhibited in the bean (fig. 32, Plate XXXVIII.), the cells
                    of which contain this albuminous matter. Where the albumen is placed exterior to
                    the embryo, as in the seeds of wheat, it is nevertheless contained in a cellular
                    tissue. This is exhibited in fig. 27, Plate XXXVIII., copied from Lecuwenhoeck,
                    in which cells of an hexagonal form are seen to be filled with the albuminous
                    particles that constitute the white matter or flour of that seed. This mealy
                    part of wheat he describes as consisting of minute globules, inclosed in a kind
                    of membrane so exquisitely thin as scarcely to be observed, within which the
                    globules are contained, as it were, in cells. The globules appeared to be of
                    different sizes, not perfect spheres, but having an indentation on one part,
                    which led him to suppose that they were not formed by simple accretion, but by
                    some mode of growth, and that “the membranes which inclose them in cells must be
                    provided with so many veins or vessels, that every particle of meal may have its
                    separate vessel.” He even conceived the globules themselves to be inclosed
                    individually in a thin skin or shell; but this opinion he never brought to
                    ocular demonstration. <hi rend="italic">(Select Works by Hoole,</hi> vol. i. p.
                    169.) Similar observations on the albuminous part of wheat have since been given
                    by Mirbel; and Kieser and others have delineated the globular particles
                    contained in the cotyledonous cells of the bean and other seeds; so that whether
                    the albumen be situated in the cotyledons, or be placed exterior to them, it is
                    in every case contained in a similar and distinctly organized structure.</p>
                <p>In consistence the albumen is said to be either farinaceous, fleshy, or
                    cartilaginous; and it may exist in ' various intermediate states. The
                    farinaceous kind is <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> readily reduced to powder,
                    and is dissolved by water into a viscous mass. The embryo is generally placed
                    exterior to this species of albumen, as in the <hi rend="italic">Gramineoe.</hi>
                    The fleshy albumen is more frequent. It is softer than the former, and dissolves
                    by water into a gelatinous mass. It is often entirely contained within the
                    embryo and its cotyledons, and yields the thick oil that is expressed from many
                    seeds. Lastly, the cartilaginous species has a horny consistence, is difficultly
                    soluble in water, and not easily reduced to powder. The embryo is never placed
                    exterior to it, and when it contains oil, this is usually very thin. (Gaertner
                    <hi rend="italic">de Fructib.</hi> &amp;c. vol. i. cap. 10.)</p>
                <p>In many seeds the albumen serves as a support and defence to the embryo, as well
                    as for nutriment. If it be removed previous to germination, as was done by
                    Mirbel <hi rend="italic">(An.</hi><hi rend="italic">du Mus.</hi><hi

                    though planted in a rich soil, and carefully tended, grows but feebly, and for
                    the most part dies.</p>
                <p>Besides the albumen above described, Gaertner has re- <hi rend="superscript">
                    Ί</hi> vived the use of the term <hi rend="italic">vitellus,</hi> but employed
                    it to designate a very different part from that to which it was originally
                    applied by Grew. The latter made use of this term to designate the inorganic
                    matter of the mature seed, which in the early stage of its production he called
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:193096549" xml:id="kp-eb0703-6549-0076"/>albumen <hi
                    rend="italic">(Anat. of Plants,</hi> book ív. chap. 3); but it is employed by
                    Gaertner to indicate a small membranous body, which in many seeds is placed
                    between the embryo and albumen, and is closely connected with the former, but
                    separates easily from the latter. The figure of this small body is described as
                    being very various in different seeds. It is said not to rise out of the earth
                    during germination; but, like the albumen, seems destined to afford nutriment to
                    the embryo. In the <hi rend="italic">Gramineae</hi> it represents a thin scale
                    interposed between the albumen and embryo, to which, from its shield-like form,
                    he gives the name of <hi rend="italic">scutellum. (De Fructib. Plantar,</hi>
                    vol. i. cap. 11.) There can be no doubt that this scutellum of Gaertner is the
                    little “conglobate leaf” first observed in wheat by Malpighi, and which later
                    writers have denominated the cotyledon of that seed. In the next section its
                    form and situation will be clearly displayed.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Section</hi> II.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Of the Structure of Monocotyledonous Seeds, as displayed in
                    their Evolution.</hi></p>
                <p>All seeds have by some botanists been distinguished into such as possessed one or
                    more cotyledons, and such as were entirely destitute of them. In treating of
                    seeds under the two divisions of mono and di-cotyledons, we would not be
                    understood to deny the existence of seeds that possess more than two.</p>
                <p>Some seeds are so extremely minute, that, until lately, their existence was not
                    clearly ascertained; and it is only during their germination that their general
                    form and character can be detected. In many others, the organized parts are so
                    small as to be scarcely capable of demonstration, except by following the
                    progressive changes of form they exhibit in their evolution. We propose,
                    therefore, to select, from each of the two divisions of mono and di-cotyledonous
                    seeds, an example or two of the successive appearances displayed in their
                    evolution, which will, besides, form the best introduction to a knowledge of the
                    structure of the mature plant.</p>
                <p>In most of the monocotyledonous seeds the cotyledon does not appear above the
                    soil during germination, but is retained within the coats of the seed, and
                    consequently undergoes but little alteration in size. As an example of the
                    evolution of a monocotyledonous seed, we shall select that of wheat <hi
                    rend="italic">(triticum hibernum),</hi> because its development has been studied
                    with great care, and, in common with some others of the same natural family, it
                    exhibits some striking peculiarities, which add greatly to its productive
                    powers. The successive appearances exhibited in its evolution have been given
                    with great accuracy by Malpighi, who has carried its anatomy farther, in some
                    points, than most of his successors. In the earlier stages of growth, some very
                    accurate representations of it have also been given by Μ. Poiteau; and Dr Yule
                    has likewise obliged us with some valuable observations. From these different
                    authorities, confirmed generally by our own observations, we shall endeavour to
                    present a concise view of the structure and evolution of this very important
                    seed.</p>
                <p>If we take a grain of wheat, and examine its convex side, we observe, at its
                    base, a small oblong body (fig. 35, Plate XXXVIII.) lying in a semicircular
                    depression, which is well defined through the tunics that cover it. These tunics
                    are two in number; an outer one, to which the chaffy filaments at the vertex of
                    the seed are attached, and which readily separates when moistened; and an inner
                    one, which everywhere adheres closely to the cellular tissue that contains the
                    albumen. If these two tunics be raised and thrown back, as is done in fig. 36,
                    the little oblong body <hi rend="italic">h,</hi> and its semilunar appendage'
                    <hi rend="italic">i,</hi> placed behind it, are brought into view; and,
                    together, they constitute the embryo.</p>
                <p>Let next a vertical section of another seed be made in the direction of the
                    furrow that runs along its flatter side, and let this section pass through the
                    embryo, as is represented in fig. 37: we then observe the seed to be composed
                    almost entirely of albumen <hi rend="italic">k,</hi> with which the embryo <hi
                    rend="italic">I,</hi> consisting of minute convoluted leaves, is in close
                    contact. The part of the embryo that is applied against the albumen is the
                    cotyledon, which on that surface is convex, and on the opposite one concave.</p>
                <p>In fig. 38, the entire embryo has been removed from its connection with the
                    albumen, and a front view of it, considerably magnified, is there given, in
                    which the letter <hi rend="italic">m</hi> denotes the cotyledon, in the
                    concavity of which the plume <hi rend="italic">n</hi> is lodged, and <hi
                    rend="italic">o</hi> indicates the protuberances from which the radicles
                    afterwards spring. If now this same embryo be reversed, as is done in fig. 39,
                    then the convex back of the cotyledon only is seen, with the extremity of the
                    principal radicle at the base. It is this side of the cotyledon that was applied
                    against the albumen; and its polished surface, says Μ. Poiteau, proves that it
                    nowhere adhered by any organic structure. Gaertner also remarks that the
                    connection between these parts is not organic, but merely superficial,—an
                    observation that is true as far as relates to the embryo itself and the
                    albuminous matter, but not as applied to the tunics which envelope them; for, at
                    the base of the seed, the inner membrane, which contains the albumen, appears to
                    be continuous, as Lecuwenhoeck remarked, with that which covers the cotyledon,
                    being reflected from the albumen over the cotyledon, much in the same way as the
                    <hi rend="italic">pleura</hi> and <hi rend="italic">peritonaeum,</hi> that line
                    the sides of the great cavities in animal bodies, are reflected over the <hi
                    rend="italic">viscera</hi> they contain. Such are the appearances presented by
                    this seed antecedent to germination: let us next follow it through the several
                    stages of that process.</p>
                <p>After a seed of this species has been in contact for 24 or 30 hours with the
                    humidity necessary to its germination, its embryo becomes swollen, and, when
                    removed from the other parts, and moderately magnified, presents the appearance
                    exhibited in fig. 40. In this figure the radicle is rendered more protuberant,
                    and the fine tunic that invests it has undergone an alteration, being changed
                    from a smooth, opaque, and solid texture, to one that is villose, transparent,
                    and cellular. A vertical section of the same] embryo, as exhibited in the next
                    figure (41), shows the elongation of the principal radicle <hi rend="italic"
                    >p,</hi> which caused the protuberance below, and the sprouting of the two
                    lateral radicles <hi rend="italic">p p,</hi> which push forth more slowly on the
                    sides. These three radicles soon force their way through the sac that envelopes
                    them, which then forms sheaths around their origins. In the same figure, the
                    letter <hi rend="italic">q</hi> denotes the plume, consisting of several
                    convoluted leaves, and resting on the cotyledon. In fig. 42 the appearance of
                    the seed, in a stage a little more advanced, is exhibited. The plume <hi
                    rend="italic">r</hi> is now seen to have risen above the cotyledon <hi
                    rend="italic">s,</hi> and the three radicles, surrounded at their origins by
                    their proper sheaths, have greatly increased in length, and in- <hi

                <p>The daily appearances exhibited in the evolution of this seed, as previously
                    given by Malpighi <hi rend="italic">(Anat.</hi><hi rend="italic">Plantari</hi>
                    p. 103), accord well with the above representations of Μ. Poiteau; and he has
                    noticed some additional particulars of considerable importance. On the first day
                    of germination, he represents the plume of the embryo as beginning to <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193096562" xml:id="kp-eb0703-6562-0077"/>open, and the
                    protuberances, whιeh indicate the eruption of the three radieles, as beginning
                    to form. The radicles at this period are completely enveloped in a membranous
                    sac or involucrum; and the body of the embryo is closely connected with a
                    “conglobate farinaceous leaf, by which nutriment is administered.” This
                    conglobate leaf is the cotyledon before mentioned, and its connection with the
                    radicle and plume is well shown by Malpighi. In fig. 43, <hi rend="italic"
                    >t,</hi> he exhibits a front view of the radicle and plume, as they appear when
                    separated from the cotyledon; and at the letter <hi rend="italic">v</hi> of the
                    same figure a back view of the same body is displayed, in which the letter <hi
                    rend="italic">x</hi> points to the mark or scar that denotes the place of
                    separation. Malpighi believed these parts to be united with each other by a
                    little node, hereafter to be described; but it is by the medium of vessels that
                    this connection between the cotyledon and the other parts of the embryo is
                    maintained; and by this route alone can the nutrient matter or albumen be
                    conveyed through the cotyledon to the radicle and plume. To these vessels Μ.
                    Bonnet gave the distinctive appellation of <hi rend="italic">mammary</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">:</hi> the union they form between the different parts of the
                    embryo is so close, that at this part, says Gaertner, the cotyledon, and
                    radicle, and plume, form one undivided body. (Gaertner <hi rend="italic">de
                    Fructib. Plantar.</hi> vol. i. p. 149.)</p>
                <p>On the second day of germination the exterior tunie of the seed, according to
                    Malpighi, gives way; the plume rises upward; the radieles do not as yet pierce
                    their investing sac, but this sac is turgid with juice, and is covered
                    exteriorly by a fine white down: the cotyledon also, at this period, is rendered
                    moist.</p>
                <p>During the third day the cotyledon is quite turgid with juice; the plume is much
                    enlarged, and begins to look green; the three radicles have pierced the
                    enveloping sac, and are everywhere thickly covered with hairs; and above the
                    first two lateral radicles, two small protuberances, <hi rend="italic">y,
                    z,</hi> fig. 44, the origins of two more radicles, are now seen to emerge, while
                    the sac that envelopes them is observed sensibly to waste.</p>
                <p>When the third day has elapsed, the plume, inclosed in a fine transparent
                    membrane, is still more elevated, and acquires a greenish colour: the
                    protuberances of the two new radicles are more prominent, and the three former
                    radicles have greatly augmented; the cotyledon is much softer, and, as if milky,
                    yielding, when compressed, a white and sweetish liquor.</p>
                <p>After the completion of the fourth day, the plume, continuing to ascend, pierces
                    the membranous covering <hi rend="italic">a'</hi> (fig. 45), and pushes into day
                    a permanent leaf, green and convoluted, around which the membrane forms a
                    sheath. Inferiorly, the first three radicles have greatly extended, and the two
                    others, <hi rend="italic">b' b',</hi> are much increased: the outer coat of the
                    seed now begins to lessen, but still contains a sweetish liquor. Μ. Poiteau
                    gives a section of the entire plantule about this period of its growth,, which
                    agrees very exactly with the figure of Malpighi. In -this section (fig. 46) the
                    plume <hi rend="italic">d</hi> is seen to have pierced the membrane <hi
                    rend="italic">d’</hi> that formerly inclosed it; the albumen <hi rend="italic"
                    >d</hi> is diminished; the cotyledon J* ʹ retains its situation and form; and
                    the five radicles <hi rend="italic">ġ d</hi> are nearly of a length, and covered
                    with hairs.</p>
                <p>About the sixth day the plantule, still invested by its sheath, begins to open
                    and expand; the seminal tunics shrink, and the surface of the outer coat is
                    corrugated. ∏ these tunics are cut open, the cotyledon within is observed in
                    some parts to be firmer than before, and has the appearance of a concave leaf;
                    but in other parts it is more vascular and filled with juice, especially in that
                    part near to the mammary vessels.</p>
                <p>After the eleventh day these tunics still adhere to the plantule, but appear much
                    wasted, and the juice they contain is mixed with bubbles of air; while the stem
                    forming many knots, and the radicles emitting innumerable rootlets, continually
                    augment in size. Where the vegetation has been very active, the whole original
                    contents of the seminal tunics are by this time exhausted, and, when compressed,
                    they yield only a watery fluid.</p>
                <p>After the lapse of a month, when the parts already developed are still farther
                    advanced, new buds break out from the primary seat of growth and rise upward,
                    and new radicles push forth and descend. So readily are these radicles produced,
                    that sometimes, if the primary ones be removed, others in crowds spring forth;
                    at the same time new buds or shoots, protected in their proper sheaths, arise
                    from the same part, and surrounding the primary plantule, are borne upward with
                    it. Of these appearances accurate delineations are given, and they may be
                    observed in every field of growing wheat.</p>
                <p>The foregoing descriptions of Malpighi are in general very correct, and his
                    figures, though somewhat rude, exhibit faithful delineations of the objects they
                    are destined to represent. In one or two points, however, he has fallen into
                    error, which, in the above statement of his opinions, to avoid confusion, we
                    corrected as we went along. Thus, though he distinctly points out the
                    “conglobate farinaceous leaf” as the organ by which nutriment is administered to
                    the radicle and plume, he assigns to the sac that, in an early state, envelopes
                    the radicles, the function of <hi rend="italic">placentula,</hi> and even gives
                    to the exterior tunic of the seed the title of seminal leaf. The true cotyledon,
                    however, which never in this seed is produced into a seminal leaf, is the little
                    conglobate body above mentioned; and the common tunies of the seed have no title
                    to the appellation of seminal leaves. To this cotyledon Gaertner, from its
                    shield-like form, gave, as before observed, the name of <hi rend="italic"
                    >scutellum.</hi> He held it to be characteristic of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Gramineoe,</hi> and analogous to the organ to which, in some other seeds, he
                    gave the name of <hi rend="italic">vitellus.</hi><hi rend="italic">(De Fructib.
                    Plantar,</hi> vol. i. p. 139.) But later writers, as Jussieu, Smith, Brown, and
                    Poiteau, have all restored to it its proper office of cotyledon.</p>
                <p>Μ. Poiteau has gone even farther, and asserted the existence of a second
                    cotyledon in this seed, and in the oat, which he describes as situated directly
                    opposite to the former. <hi rend="italic">(An.</hi><hi rend="italic">du
                    Mus.</hi><hi rend="italic">d’Hist. Nat.</hi> tome xiii. p. 388.) In this
                    instance, however, he has mistaken the rudiment of the second bud for a second
                    cotyledon, as Dr Yule ascertained by “tracing the growth of this supposed
                    cotyledon from its first becoming visible to its final development as a plant.”
                    (<hi rend="italic">Werner. Transac.</hi> vol. i. p. 594.) Μ. Mirbel considers
                    the sac that invests the plantule to be the cotyledon of this seed, and this
                    cotyledon to form the <hi rend="italic">first enslicaihing leaf. (An.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">du Mus.</hi><hi rend="italic">d’Hist. Nat.</hi> tome xiii. p.
                    148.) But, as already remarked, the cotyledon never in this seed rises out of
                    the tunics; and, as Dr Yule observes, differs totally in situation, structure,
                    and consistence, from the ensheathing leaf of the plantule.</p>
                <p>A very remarkable peculiarity in these plants is their great reproductive power,
                    as displayed in the indefinite number of new plants which we have seen to be
                    evolved from one primary seed. Malpighi not only observed this peculiarity, but
                    has described the structure from which it originates. He considered the radicle
                    and plume of the embryo to be connected with the cotyledon, not by the mammary
                    vessels, as we have stated, but by a little body which he called the <hi
                    rend="italic">umbilical node.</hi> In a section of the lower part of the stem of
                    the plantule, made after the third day of germination, he delineates this mode
                    as situ <pb break="no" facs="nls:193096575" xml:id="kp-eb0703-6575-0078"/>ated
                    at the junction of the radicle and plume, as represented by the letter Zt' (fig.
                    48, Plate XXXVIII.); and describes it as solid exteriorly, and softer and more
                    medullary within. If a section of the same part be made on the fourth day, as in
                    fig. 47, the stem <hi rend="italic">i'</hi> of the plantule will be seen, says
                    he, to spring from, this node, from which also the radicles equally take their
                    origin.</p>
                <p>This peculiar property was also observed by Lecuwen-hoeck, though he seems not
                    clearly to have apprehended the nature of the organs from which it proceeded. In
                    the embryo of wheat he describes three points, from which not only three
                    distinct radicles spring, but they are also, he adds, “the beginnings of three
                    several spires or stalks of wheat; so that from every grain of wheat (which is
                    well worthy of observation) there will arise not merely a single stalk, but
                    three distinct ones, which are formed in the seed itself.” <hi rend="italic"
                    >Select Works by Hook,</hi> vol. i. p. 169: and in vol. ii. p. 289, are to be
                    found similar observations on the seeds of oats, barley, and rye.</p>
                <p>By Μ. Mirbel, the umbilical node of Malpighi is considered as a fleshy knot <hi
                    rend="italic">(un noeud charnu),</hi> by the medium of which the plume and
                    radicle are united. The lateral radicles which issue from it he regards as
                    distinct in their nature from the primary one, and as resembling those which
                    spring from knots in the stem; he therefore names them <hi rend="italic"
                    >articular</hi> roots, <hi rend="italic">les racines articulaires.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">(An.</hi><hi rend="italic">du Mus.</hi><hi rend="italic">d’Hist.
                    Nat.</hi> tome xiii. p. 149.) According to Dr Yule, however, this fleshy knot is
                    to be considered as a <hi rend="italic">tuber,</hi> analogous to the tuberous
                    substance interposed between the bulbs and roots of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Liliaceae</hi> and other monocotyledonous tribes; and which is destined to
                    produce an indefinite number of young plants, a greater or less number of which
                    are subsequently evolved by the joint agency of the roots and leaves. The
                    “articular roots” of Μ. Mirbel he regards as in reality young plants, the roots
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Gramineae</hi> being invariably fibrous. It is by means
                    of these lateral shoots and their <hi rend="italic">tubera</hi> that bushes,
                    consisting of from sixty to several hundred stems, are sometimes seen to
                    originate from one seed.</p>
                <p>The above important peculiarities in the germination of the seeds of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Gramineae</hi> are very perspicuously displayed by Dr Yule in the
                    three figures which we have copied from his Memoir. In fig. 49, Plate XXXVIII.,
                    Dr Yule represents the embryo of wheat as it appears when detached from the
                    albumen, a short time after germination has commenced; the ascent of the plume
                    covered with its membrane, and descent of the three primary radicles, which have
                    pierced their containing sac, are clearly exhibited; and the letter Ä' points to
                    the little cotyledon placed at the junction of the two parts just mentioned. In
                    fig. 50 the germination of the same seed is shown in a more advanced stage; the
                    plume <hi rend="italic">l’</hi> has now risen to a considerable height, and
                    pierced the investing membrane; and at <hi rend="italic">m!</hi> a second bud or
                    plume (which Μ. Poiteau mistook for a second cotyledon) is seen to shoot from
                    the tuber like the first. The letter <hi rend="italic">n'</hi> denotes the
                    seminal tunics. At a still more advanced period, four young plants, o'o'o'o',
                    fig. 51, of the second month, with their sheaths in part withered, are seen to
                    have sprung from the same part; but the two seminal tunics of the seed,
                    exhausted of their contents, still remain attached, as indicated by the letter
                    <hi rend="italic">pt. ( Wernerian Trans,</hi> vol. i. p. 589.)</p>
                <p>The description given above of the evolution of wheat is applicable, with little
                    variation, to the seeds of all the <hi rend="italic">cerealia.</hi> The seed of
                    the oat emits from four to six radicles, all of which break through their
                    enveloping sac at the same place, and thus appear to be contained in one sheath.
                    Such too is the case with barley, the plume of which extends beneath the seminal
                    tunics, and pushes out at the vertex of the seed.</p>
                <p>This peculiar constitution of the seeds above mentioned is attended with
                    important advantages in their culture, and explains the source of their great
                    productive power. A single grain of barley was observed by Du Hamel to have
                    produced 200 ears, each of which yielded 24 grains; so that one single seed
                    planted in a good soil has produced 4800 grains. Curtis and others, by
                    transplantation of the several plantules of wheat, obtained still higher returns
                    from single seeds. For the same reason, these plants are better enabled than
                    others to resist the injurious effects of accident or disease. If a seed, says
                    Dr Yule, be buried under a stone or lump of indurated clay, the seminal
                    plantules cannot shoot upward; but stems are then sent off in a horizontal
                    direction, until they can effect their escape upward. Sometimes it happens that
                    a small insect <hi rend="italic">(Musea</hi><hi rend="italic">pumilionis)</hi>
                    deposits its egg in wheat, and the grub is lodged in the very centre of the
                    stem, just above the root, by which the stem is invariably destroyed, and the
                    root so materially injured as to prevent its throwing out fresh shoots on each
                    side, or <hi rend="italic">stocking</hi> itself, as the farmers term it.
                    Nevertheless, the plants thus attacked are not permanently injured; for, in the
                    instance where these depredations occurred, the crop of wheat was good, and the
                    ears large and fine through the whole field; so that these injured plants, by
                    the production of lateral shoots, yielded an abundant crop. <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Lin. Trans,</hi> vol. ii. p. 76.)</p>
                <p>In the germination of other monocotyledonous seeds a similar succession of
                    phenomena present themselves, with the exception of those which relate to the
                    multiplication of so many individuals from a single seed. In all, the radicle
                    first shoots forth, and the plume soon follows; the cotyledon is commonly of
                    small size, and is retained within the tunics. As the embryo grows, the albumen
                    is taken up and conveyed through the cotyledon to the young plantule; and before
                    the albumen is exhausted the embryo is enabled to draw its nutriment from the
                    soil in which it grows.</p>
                <p>In many instances it appears that the primary radicle of seeds, after a short
                    time, becomes dry and falls off, and is replaced by a great number of secondary
                    rootlets. Μ. Poiteau regards this last circumstance as common and peculiar to
                    monocotyledonous seeds. He has remarked it in many hundred palms, not one of
                    which had a descending or tap-rbot. No plant in the numerous family of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Liliaceae</hi> is said to possess such a root. The radicle of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Cyperaceae</hi> does not, perhaps, perish so soon; but it does
                    not continue long. This premature and constant destruction of the radicle he
                    considers as the cause of the bulbs and truncations which occur, particularly in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Li∙ haceae</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> for the lateral
                    roots not being capable of receiving all the descending sap, it collects at the
                    lower part of the stem, and occasions these different enlargements. <hi
                    rend="italic">(An.</hi><hi rend="italic">du Mus.</hi><hi rend="italic">d</hi> ’
                    <hi rend="italic">Hist. Nat.</hi> tome xiii. p. 392.)</p>
                <p>The effects which thus succeed to the spontaneous destruction of the radicle
                    occur partly in other plants, in which the first radicle is naturally permanent,
                    if it be artificially removed. Du Hamel found that if the extremity of permanent
                    radicles were cut off, lateral rootlets were produced; that even mechanical
                    obstruction to the descent of the radicle frequently gave rise to divisions in

                    experiment, that roots extend invariably, not by an elongation of parts already
                    formed, but by new matter added to their extremities; and hence it is that
                    roots, whether ligneous or herbaceous, do not elongate if even the smallest
                    portion of their extremity be cut off. <hi rend="italic">(Phys,</hi><hi

                <p><hi rend="italic">Of the Structure of Dicoyledonous Seeds, as displayed in their
                    Evolution.</hi></p>
                <p>From the greater number of seeds which have two cotyledons, the phenomena of
                    their evolution may be expected to exhibit at least as great variety, as those
                    of the division last described. In different species they differ in this respect
                    as much from one another as they do from monocotyledonous seeds. Some seeds of
                    this class raise their cotyledons above ground during germination; in others
                    these organs are wholly retained within the tunics. Of each of these modes of
                    evolution we propose to give an example, selecting, as before, those seeds which
                    have been most accurately observed; or which, by the forms they exhibit, seem
                    best calculated to illustrate the general laws by which their evolution is
                    accomplished.</p>
                <p>In the seeds of this division the embryo is commonly much more completely
                    developed than in those of the class last described, so that the several organs
                    of the plantule become distinctly visible. The radicle and plume are readily
                    distinguished, and the cotyledons are frequently so large as to form nearly the
                    entire mass of the seed. Within the cotyledons the albuminous matter provided
                    for the nutrition of the embryo during its evolution is often entirely
                    contained; and these organs, as before remarked, rise sometimes out of the
                    earth, increase greatly in size, and after a certain period decay. In other
                    instances no increase in size nor elevation above the surface occurs, but, like
                    the greater number of monocotyledons, they remain beneath the soil, and yield
                    gradually their nutrient matter for the support of the embryo. Even in plants of
                    the same natural order, the <hi rend="italic">Papilionaceae</hi> for example,
                    some, as <hi rend="italic">lupinus,</hi> says Dr Smith, raise their cotyledons
                    into the air and light; while others, as <hi rend="italic">lathyrus,</hi> retain
                    them under ground, concealed within the tunics of the seed. As an example of the
                    latter, we shall give from Malpighi an abridged account of the successive
                    appearances exhibited by the common pea <hi rend="italic">(pisum),</hi> which,
                    in its evolution, approaches in some respects to that of the seeds last
                    described.</p>
                <p>The figure and size of this seed are familiar to every one. After being placed
                    for a day in circumstances favourable to its germination, it is much increased
                    in size; its outer coat is rendered softer, and becomes more white and thin; the
                    umbilical aperture continues closed, but near to it an irregular opening or
                    laceration is visible. If the outer coat be now stripped off, the <hi
                    rend="italic">nucleus</hi> comes into view. It is seen to consist of two
                    distinct parts or lobes, which are the proper cotyledons of the seed. These
                    cotyledons are closely invested by the inner tunic; externally they have a
                    convex surface, but internally, where they are in contact, their surfaces are
                    nearly plain. Between them, in a small depression formed in their substance,
                    lies the plume: it is composed of a number of yellowish leaves folded on each
                    other, and bent inward, and is united by a little curved stem to a small white
                    conical body, the radicle. These appearances are exhibited in fig. 1, Plate
                    XXXIX., in which one of the cotyledons has been removed, so that the inner
                    surface of the other, together with the plume and radicle, is fully brought into
                    view: the letter <hi rend="italic">a</hi> denotes the cotyledon, <hi
                    rend="italic">b</hi> the plume, and <hi rend="italic">c</hi> the radicle. This
                    radicle at its neck, or point of junction with the stem, sends off on each side
                    a little stalk or pedicle to each cotyledon. In the above figure one of these
                    pedicles has been cut through, and the other, that remains attached to the
                    cotyledon, is con-∣ cealed behind the plume. It is by these pedicles alone' that
                    the two cotyledons are connected with each other.</p>
                <p>When the second day of germination is completed, the: cotyledons are rendered
                    more tumid, the tunics give way, and the radicle begins to protrude. Soon after,
                    the cotyledons separate a little, and become somewhat concave internally. After
                    the third day the radicle has pushed out through the tunics; it is white, except
                    at its point, which is more deeply coloured, and it emits on all sides fine
                    capillary rootlets; the cotyledons are now farther separated, and by degrees the
                    stem of the embryo, with its curved plume, is disclosed.</p>
                <p>About the fifth day the stem <hi rend="italic">d,</hi> fig. 2, mounts upwards: it
                    is white, and bears on its summit the plume <hi rend="italic">e,</hi> still
                    curved, and now becoming green: the stem now also begins to exhibit the marks of
                    knots at particular parts: the radicle/is farther advanced, and small
                    protuberances, the origins of future rootlets, appear on it: the cotyledons <hi
                    rend="italic">g</hi> retain their place, are turgid and solid, and still
                    surrounded by the lacerated tunics.</p>
                <p>At the close of the seventh day the plantule is much more advanced: the knots on
                    the stem <hi rend="italic">h h,</hi> fig. 3, are quite distinct, and its apex is
                    furnished with broad green leaves, but which are not as yet unfolded. The
                    substance of the cotyledons is still solid, and when compressed yields a
                    bitterish juice: the radicle is much elongated, and has emitted numerous
                    rootlets.</p>
                <p>After the ninth day the plantule is completely formed: its stem <hi rend="italic"
                    >i,</hi> fig. 4, is now erect, and the leaves of the plume <hi rend="italic"
                    >k</hi> are expanded: the cotyledons <hi rend="italic">I</hi> are reduced in
                    size: and the radicle <hi rend="italic">m,</hi> or root as it may now be termed,
                    with its numerous rootlets, is greatly augmented. Every part of the plantule
                    except the cotyledons continues daily to increase: at the end of a month these
                    organs are still found to adhere; but are wrinkled, thin, and exhausted of their
                    nutrient matter, with which the stem and other organs are filled.</p>
                <p>The progress of evolution in those seeds that raise their cotyledons above the
                    earth is exhibited by Malpighi in that of the gourd (<hi rend="italic"
                    >Cucurbita).</hi> This seed is of an oblong figure, and has a flattened form. It
                    possesses three distinct coats or tunics: the outer one is thick, tough, and
                    coriaceous; the middle one thin, membranous, and of a greenish colour; and the
                    inmost is that transparent colourless pellicle that closely invests, and is
                    inseparably connected with, the cotyledons of the seed.</p>
                <p>After this seed has been made to imbibe moisture, the outer and middle tunics
                    readily separate, and expose the <hi rend="italic">nucleus,</hi> which is seen
                    to consist of two leaf-like cotyledons, which have no connection with each
                    other, except by the medium of the little conical body, or radicle, at their
                    base. The size and figure of these cotyledons, and the situation of the radicle
                    that connects them, are represented in fig. 5, Plate XXXIX. Their external
                    surface exhibits to the naked eye prominent lines, which indicate a vascular
                    structure, the vessels of which proceed from the radicle at their base. They are
                    commonly five in number, and from their main fascicular trunks ramifications are
                    produced, which, in their distribution, form a finely reticulated appearance
                    over the whole organ. On their inner side the cotyledons are quite plain, and
                    closely applied against each other, but, as already remarked, are nowhere
                    connected, except at the base. This surface is displayed in fig. 6, in which the
                    great vascularity of the organ is rendered more apparent. It is between the two
                    cotyledons that the plume, consisting of minute convoluted leaves, is lodged and
                    cherished. In fig. 7 a part of the nucleus of this seed is represented a little
                    enlarged, and <pb break="no" facs="nls:193096601" xml:id="kp-eb0703-6601-0080"
                    />the two cotyledons have been removed at different places by transverse
                    sections, to show more clearly the situation of the radicle and plume. The
                    letter <hi rend="italic">n</hi> denotes the place from which one of the
                    cotyledons has been removed, so as to bring the plume <hi rend="italic">o</hi>
                    into view; and <hi rend="italic">p</hi> points to the conical radicle below.</p>
                <p>When this seed has been twenty-four hours m circumstances favourable to its
                    germination, it is rendered tumid, and the umbilical aperture at its base is
                    enlarged by the swelling of the parts within: the cotyledons become turgid, and
                    the plume is augmented in size. After the second day the outer coat is much
                    softened, the middle one appears as if torn and decaying, and all the parts
                    within still further augmented in size. During the third day the colour of the
                    outer tunic becomes darker, the cotyledons are more swollen, their vessels more
                    conspicuous, and the radicle pushes out through the umbilical aperture·</p>
                <p>When the fourth day has elapsed, the plantule is still retained within the
                    tunics; and if these be now removed and examined, the middle one is found to be
                    dry and thin: the cotyledons <hi rend="italic">(q,</hi> fig. 8) are whitish,
                    soft, and flexible, but the vessels on their surface are much more distinct: the
                    radicle <hi rend="italic">r</hi> is elongated and covered with down, as likewise
                    is the stem <hi rend="italic">s.</hi> At the top of the radicle a protuberance
                    is seen, which is white and soft; and farther down appear several smaller
                    tumours, indicating the places of rootlets about to break out.</p>
                <p>About the sixth day the cotyledons <hi rend="italic">t,</hi> fig. 9, emerge from
                    beneath the tunics, representing the “dissimilar leaves” of Grew, and the
                    “seminal leaves” of Malpighi, but which we shall in future denominate <hi
                    rend="italic">cotyledonous leaves.</hi> They are thick, soft, and a little
                    separated from each other; their position is pendent; the colour yellowish; they
                    are very vascular, and between them the plume is still concealed. The radicle
                    <hi rend="italic">u,</hi> at this period, is much elongated, and rootlets
                    everywhere spring from its sides; the stem <hi rend="italic">v</hi> is also
                    lengthened and curved, and, in common with the radicle, is everywhere covered
                    with a white curling down.</p>
                <p>Towards the ninth day the cotyledonous leaves <hi rend="italic">(x,</hi> fig. 10)
                    assume an erect position. At their points they are still yellowish, but
                    elsewhere green, and their cellular tissue is filled with a greenish-yellow
                    juice; they begin to separate a little, but still entirely conceal the plume.
                    The stem <hi rend="italic">y,</hi> at this period, is greatly elongated, and its
                    lower extremity has become green; the protuberance that existed at this part is
                    greatly lessened; and below it the radicle <hi rend="italic">z</hi> is
                    continued, from which numerous rootlets, covered with capillary productions,
                    break out.</p>
                <p>During the following days the cotyledonous leaves continue to enlarge, the stem
                    to elongate, and the plume to augment in size; but it is not yet unfolded. About
                    the twenty-first day the development of the plantule appears to be completed. A
                    representation of its foliage at this period is given in fig. 13; the
                    cotyledonous leaves, <hi rend="italic">a',</hi> have now reached a great size,
                    are of a deep green colour, and very vascular: they rise by a short pedicle from
                    the summit of the stem. On each leaf seven fasciculi of vessels are visible,
                    which, beyond the middle, terminate in a nét-work, from which is produced the
                    cellular structure that contributes to form the breadth of the leaf. In the
                    axil, formed by the cotyledonous leaves, the plume <hi rend="italic">b</hi> lay
                    concealed; it is now disclosed by the removal of one of those leaves. At first
                    the leaves of the plume are curled and convoluted, but afterwards they expand,
                    and their figure is then seen to differ entirely from that of the cotyledonous
                    leaves; they have notched margins, and their surface is covered with down. In
                    this manner the young plant continues to increase, and acquires at length∣ 'its
                    full magnitude, in the progress towards which the cotyledonous leaves waste
                    gradually, and finally fall.</p>
                <p>The seeds of the radish <hi rend="italic">(Raphanus),</hi> of the lettuce: <hi
                    rend="italic">(Lactuca),</hi> and of the kidney-bean <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Phaseolus),</hi> are repre-&lt; sented by Malpighi as exhibiting, in their
                    evolution, a si- <hi rend="superscript"> s</hi> milar succession of appearances.
                    In all these seeds, and in many others of this division, the radicle first
                    pierces the seminal tunics; next the cotyledons come into view, and assume
                    generally the form of leaves, between which the tender plume is for a time
                    concealed, and at a later period is disclosed. In different seeds, however, the
                    forms of these organs, and the periods of their successive evolution, are
                    subject to the greatest variation, not only as relates to the species of seed,
                    but to the soil, the climate, and season in which it is destined to grow.</p>
                <p>Having thus surveyed the changes in <hi rend="italic">external</hi> form: which
                    the germinating seed exhibits, we shall conclude <hi rend="superscript"> s</hi>
                    our description by a display of the peculiarities of its <hi rend="italic"
                    >internal</hi> structure. This we shall find to consist entirely of vessels and
                    cellular tissue, variously proportioned and combined. In a longitudinal section
                    of the radicle of the pea in an early stage, Malpighi represents it, as in fig.
                    11, to be composed entirely of cellular tissue exteriorly, in the centre of
                    which the vascular system, separating at the top into three divisions to supply
                    the plume and cotyledons, is placed. A similar section of the radicle (fig. 14)
                    on the seventh day exhibits corresponding sections of the rootlets it puts
                    forth; which are seen also to consist of cellular tissue, and of vessels that
                    come off from the central fasciculus of the radicle.</p>
                <p>The stem, when about a month old, is composed of a thick bark formed of cellular
                    tissue, within which are several fasciculi of vessels. In some very thin slices
                    of the stem of the pea, viewed through a microscope of considerable power, the
                    arrangement and distribution of the vessels and cellular tissue appeared to us
                    as represented in fig. 15. The centre of the stem was occupied by cellular
                    tissue, round which was a zone of vessels, <hi rend="italic">c,'</hi> forming
                    four principal fasciculi. Exterior to this zone was a small ring of thickened
                    cellular tissue, and beyond this the proper cellular substance of the bark. Near
                    the circumference of the stem were four larger fasciculi, which may probably be
                    considered as the “proper vessels,” while those near the centre may be deemed
                    the sap-vessels.</p>
                <p>In the plantule of the gourd a similar structure is observable. In fig. 19 is
                    represented a longitudinal section of its stem and radicle on the ninth day, as
                    given by Malpighi. In this stem the vessels are disposed in a circle that
                    surrounds the pith; but as they descend towards the root, they approach each
                    other, and give off ramifications to form the rootlets. In a transverse section
                    of the stem, on the 21st day, Malpighi describes it as hollow in the centre,
                    around which six fasciculi of vessels are disposed, and the intermediate portion
                    is occupied by cellular tissue. Hedwig and Kieser, however, enumerate not fewer
                    than ten fasciculi of vessels in the stem of this plant, some of which are
                    placed next the pith, and others near to the bark, as in fig. 28.</p>
                <p>To these representations of the structure of the pea and gourd by Malpighi, we
                    shall add that of the bean in its early stages, as delineated by Grew, who has
                    traced the distribution of the vessels in the radicle and cotyledons with great
                    minuteness. In fig. 12, Plate XXXlX., is exhibited a vertical section of a young
                    bean, which is made to pass through the cotyledons, the plume, and radicle. From
                    the extremity of the radicle the vessels ascend in fasciculi to the neck of the
                    plantule, where they are seen to diverge towards each cotyledon, and ramify
                    through it, while a <pb break="no" facs="nls:193096614"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0703-6614-0081"/>central vascular portion is continued to the
                    plume. In fig. 20 the vascular and cellular structures of the germinating 'bean
                    are shown in conjunction, in a highly magnified representation, presented here
                    in a reduced size from Grew. In this figure <hi rend="italic">d'</hi> denotes

                <p>In the foregoing chapter we have traced the successive changes of form which the
                    seed exhibits in its progress to constitute the perfect plant; we have next to
                    display the structure of the plant itself in its more remarkable varieties and
                    forms. The leading features of this structure have already been laid before the
                    reader when discoursing on the <hi rend="italic">common textures</hi> of plants:
                    it remains now to exhibit individual examples of it, as they occur in the
                    several members of the trunk, the branch, and the root.</p>
                <p>Botanists employ different terms to distinguish the different kinds of stems or
                    stalks that support the leaves and the organs of fructification. These are the
                    stem <hi rend="italic">(caulis),</hi> which is considered peculiar to herbaceous
                    plants; the trunk <hi rend="italic">(truncus),</hi> which is proper to herbs and
                    trees; the straw <hi rend="italic">(culmus),</hi> which is the appropriate stem
                    of the grasses; and the stalk <hi rend="italic">(scapus),</hi> which differs
                    from the other varieties in bearing flowers only, and not leaves. For the
                    peculiarities in external form and character which distinguish these several
                    kinds of stems, as they occur in different species of plants, we must refer to
                    the writers on botany; and shall proceed to exhibit a general outline of their
                    internal structure.</p>
                <p>Perhaps there is no plant in which the simplicity of vegetable organization is
                    more clearly displayed than in the sugar-cane, which belongs to the family of
                    <hi rend="italic">Graminece.</hi> In its stem or culm the cells and vessels are
                    comparatively large, retain much of their more perfect forms, and are quite
                    distinct from each other. When treating of the cellular tissue we referred to
                    the cells of this plant exhibited in the very thin transverse slice, fig. 16,
                    Plate XXXIX., as illustrative of their hexagonal figure, and of their being
                    bounded on every side apparently by a single membrane. In some parts, when the
                    observer is viewing these cells through the microscope, some of them appear
                    quite transparent, from the upper and lower bounding membranes being entirely
                    removed, and the light, in consequence, being freely transmitted; but in others
                    one or both of these membranes remain, and though they are exquisitely thin,
                    yet, when viewed by a strongly reflected hght, a degree of refraction seems to
                    be produced, which communicates to the surface of the membrane an irregu-ar
                    appearance, such as it has been attempted to express in the darker cells of the
                    same figure. The deception that arises from viewing two layers of these cells in
                    conjunction, which imparts the appearance of double sides, as in fig. 21, was
                    before noticed; and the longitudinal appearance of the same organs, as seen both
                    in a single and double series of columns (fig. 22 and 23) was at the same time
                    described.</p>
                <p>It is through this cellular structure that the vessels which constitute the other
                    component part of the culm of this plant are distributed. They occur in
                    fasciculi, which, towards the centre, are placed at considerable distances from
                    each other, and preserve a symmetrical arrangement; but nearer to the
                    circumference they are more numerous, and their distribution is much less
                    regular. In fig. 25, Plate XXXIX., a very thin transverse slice of this plant is
                    exhibited, in which this regular disposition of the vessels at and near the
                    centre <hi rend="italic">st s</hi><hi rend="italic
                    superscript"> r</hi><hi rend="italic">,</hi> and their crowded state near the
                    circumference <hi rend="italic">t’,</hi> are well shown; the cells, too, at the
                    centre are larger, and have a more perfect form than those near the
                    circumference of the figure. In fig. 27 a very thin longitudinal slice of this
                    same plant is delineated; it is considerably magnified; the letter <hi
                    rend="italic">u'</hi> denotes the cellular tissue, and <hi rend="italic">d
                    v'</hi> two fasciculi of vessels which ascend through it.</p>
                <p>In the palm, which, though belonging to the division of trees, we shall notice in
                    this place, a similar disposition of the elementary organs is observed; but both
                    the vessels and cells are smaller than in the sugar-cane, and the fasciculi of
                    vessels are also much more numerous. This structure is exhibited in the
                    transverse section of the trunk of the palm, fig. 26, in which the dark spots
                    indicate the vascular fasciculi, and the whiter portion the cellular tissue. As
                    before observed in the sugar-cane, the vessels are seen to be less numerous at
                    the centre than at the circumference, where they are much crowded together, and
                    very irregularly distributed, in consequence of the peculiar mode in which the
                    growth,of these trees is accomplished.</p>
                <p>In fig. 24 of the same plate we have also copied from Μ. Desfonta,ines a portion
                    of the longitudinal section of the trunk of another species of palm <hi
                    rend="italic">(dracaena draco),</hi> which displays more clearly the irregular
                    direction which the vessels take in the lax cellular tissue through which they
                    are distributed. It was before remarked that these plants do not naturally
                    produce branches, but that their vascular system is expended wholly in the
                    production of leaves at their summit, and their trunk is perfectly cylindrical.
                    If, however, the top of the plant has been cut off, or broken by accident, a
                    division into branches is said to take place. <hi rend="italic">(Mém. de
                    l’lnstit. Nat.</hi> tome i. p. 486.)</p>
                <p>As in these plants the ligneous and cortical textures are uniformly blended
                    together through the entire stem, it must be presumed that the sap-vessels and
                    <hi rend="italic">proper</hi> vessels are everywhere associated. This fact is
                    accordingly pointed out by Malpighi as occurring in several species of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Gramineae,</hi> who, as we before remarked, delineates a <hi
                    rend="italic">proper</hi> vessel as existing in each fasciculus of
                    sap-vessels.</p>
                <p>The next variety of structure we shall notice is that of certain herbaceous
                    plants, in which the proportion of eel-, lular tissue in the stem much exceeds
                    that of vessels; and, though belonging to the division of dicoyledons, they in
                    several points resemble in structure those just described. In a section of the
                    pea already given (fig. 15, Plate XXXIX.) the greater portion of the stem was
                    seen to be made up of cellular tissue, through which several fasciculi of
                    vessels were dispersed. The stem of the gourd has been examined with great
                    minuteness by Μ. Kieser, who has represented in several sections, both
                    transverse and longitudinal, its appearance in different parts at different
                    periods of its growth. The total number of fasciculi of vessels that exist in
                    the mature stem of this plant he <pb break="no" facs="nls:193096627"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0703-6627-0082"/>makes, with Hedwig, to be ten; but the number of
                    vessels in each fasciculus he shows to vary at different periods, and in
                    different parts of the same plant, according to their relative age. In fig. 28,
                    Plate XXXIX., is a piece of the stem of the gourd, cut horizontally near the
                    root, of its natural size and appearance, as represented by Kieser. The portion
                    <hi rend="italic">l’</hi> of this figure is represented in fig. 29, magnified
                    130 times: it comprehends only <hi rend="italic">one</hi> of the 10 fasciculi of
                    vessels that exist in the stem. In this magnified view the letters <hi
                    rend="italic">m'm’</hi> indicate the elongated cells of the bark; <hi
                    rend="italic">rid</hi> the larger cells, which form the parenchyma of the stem;
                    <hi rend="italic">d d</hi> the cells which surround the fasciculus of spiral
                    vessels; <hi rend="italic">p'</hi> /the fasciculus of spirals, containing 29
                    vessels, in part simple and in part punctuated spirals; <hi rend="italic"
                    >ι</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> j</hi><hi rend="italic">ι</hi> ’ the great
                    cells situated towards the centre of the stem: at <hi rend="italic">(į</hi> are
                    four spiral vessels of different sizes, filled more or less with small
                    punctuated vesicles, which spring from the walls of the vessel, and in two
                    instances nearly close up their cavities.</p>
                <p>The horizontal sections of the stem of the gourd exhibited above are taken from
                    the same plant as the vertical sections of the vessels in figures 13, 14, 15,
                    &amp;c., Plate XXXVIII. The number of fasciculi that exist in the stem of this
                    plant is 10; but the number of vessels in each fasciculus continuallyincreases
                    as the plant approaches maturity, and varies even in different parts with the
                    different stages of its growth. Thus, of six sections made of the stem, that
                    taken near the summit, and therefore of latest growth, exhibits only six or
                    seven vessels in each of the 10 fasciculi, corresponding in this respect with
                    the number found near the bottom in the earliest stage of growth. In the next
                    section, made through the internodial space below, the vessels in each
                    fasciculus have increased both in number and size; in the third section, the
                    vessels have still further increased in size, and in number amount to 19 in each
                    bundle; still lower down, in the fourth internode of the same stem, both the
                    number and size of the vessels go on augmenting. In the fifth section, taken at
                    the largest part of the stem, a still further increase in size is found, and the
                    number in each fasciculus amounts to 23 vessels. Again, the section made in the
                    stem of the same plant very near the root, and taken at a more advanced age in
                    autumn, exhibits vessels approaching in character to those of the ligneous part
                    of trees, and now amounting to 29 in each fasciculus. It is this last section
                    which we have copied above in fig. 28 and 29, where the vessels may be seen
                    smallest next the pith, and gradually increasing in size as they recede from the
                    centre towards the circumference. Lastly, in a section of the branch of the root
                    of the same plant, in place of 10 fasciculi of vessels met with in the stem and
                    in the principal root, there were only four, but each fasciculus contained 37
                    vessels: the cells of this part were smaller than in the stem, and the whole
                    construction was comparatively more vascular and compact.</p>
                <p>The general characters of these vessels, from the earliest period of their
                    development to the mature state of the plant, and the successive changes in
                    size, in form, and appearance which they undergo, have been already exhibited in
                    the series of figures 13, 14, 15, 16, 18, 19, of Plate XXXVIII., representing
                    vertical sections, corresponding to the horizontal ones just described. As the
                    plant increases in age the vessels augment in number, and in character they
                    approach to those of arborescent plants: their sides are thickened, their
                    transparency is almost lost, and the cavities of some are filled by vesicles.
                    The balance, also, in the different orders of vessels at mature age is nearly
                    the reverse of that which obtains in youth. In the young stem, says Kieser, the.
                    <hi rend="italic">simple</hi> spirals are to the punctuated variety as 17 to 6,.
                    while in the adult plant there are only 6 simple spirals to 23 of the
                    punctual-ed variety in the stem; and in the root the simple spirals, which at
                    first were equally visible, have altogether disap- <hi rend="superscript">
                    v</hi> peared. A metamorphosis of the simple' into the more complex varieties of
                    vessel must, therefore, during th <hi rend="subscript"> e</hi> progress of
                    growth, be deemed to take place.</p>
                <p>In the stem of the gourd, as thus described, we observe an arrangement of parts
                    in many respects agreeing with that of the sugar-cane. In both, the cells in
                    certain parts are large, and their figure is well preserved; and the vessels are
                    distributed in distinct fasciculi through the cellular tissue. In the gourd,
                    however, the fasciculi are fewer in number, and do not suffer that displacement
                    during the progress of vegetation which those of the cane experience. In neither
                    plant are the vessels so numerous, or so situate, as to compress the cellular
                    tissue into transverse partitions; nor is there in the transverse section of
                    either any ’ appearance of concentric layers. In neither stem is there any
                    proper pith, the central part of the sugar-cane being occupied by cells and
                    vessels, and that of the gourd being alike destitute of both.</p>
                <p>In the sections of various herbaceous stems represented by Grew and Malpighi, the
                    number of vessels and their disposition exhibit the greatest variety, and
                    approach more or less to the arrangement of parts that is found in shrubs and
                    trees. Thus, in holly-hock <hi rend="italic">(Alcea)</hi> Grew describes the
                    vessels of the bark as yielding a thin mucilage, and within them are the
                    sap-vessels, postured in short rays, which comprise twelve or sixteen vessels.
                    In <hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Scot-</hi><hi rend="italic">∑onera,</hi> the
                    “proper vessels” in the bark yield a milky fluid, and are postured in a radiated
                    manner with the sap and spiral vessels that extend to the pith, all of which
                    form parts of the same radiated lines. <hi rend="italic">(Anat. of Plants,</hi>
                    p. 103.) In endive, Malpighi describes the structure of the stem as approaching
                    in character to that of trees. Near the circumference the vessels, says he, are
                    disposed in lines directed towards the centre, and are separated by small ranges
                    of cellular tissue, which is compressed into a solid and dense form; and more
                    interiorly the vessels are larger, and extend a considerable way in rays through
                    the stem. <hi rend="italic">(Anat. Plantar,</hi> p. 25.) Where the vessels have
                    this radiated position, the cellular tissue between them assumes the form of
                    membranous partitions; but the greater portion of the stem of this plant is
                    occupied by cellular tissue, not thus compressed into a membranous form. We thus
                    clearly observe that, even in herbaceous stems, membranous partitions, extending
                    more or less completely through the stem, are formed, whenever the vessels are
                    disposed in radii, and are sufficiently numerous to compress, on either side,

                    Trees.</hi></p>
                <p> In shrubs and trees the several textures that compose the trunk are-commonly
                    distinct from each other; and some parts that are but imperfectly distinguished
                    in herbs become in them well defined. In the trunks of these plants, however,
                    though a general uniformity of structure is observed, yet particular
                    modifications of it exist in every species, and these are still further varied
                    by the peculiar nature of the individual plant, and the mode and circumstances
                    of its vegetation. Before descending to particular examples, it may be useful to
                    exhibit a concise view of the parts that compose the trunk, and the terms
                    employed to denote them.</p>
                <p>Externally in every tree we have the skin or cuticle, ' the structure of which
                    has been already described in a former section. In very young plants, and in
                    young <pb break="no" facs="nls:193096640" xml:id="kp-eb0703-6640-0083"
                    />branches, it is succulent, and its surface is entire; but in older trunks and
                    branches it is frequently dried and 'broken, and in some instances is thrown
                    off; so that the exterior covering of the plant appears to be formed by the
                    cellular tissue of the cortical texture.</p>
                <p>Beneath the skin is the bark, constructed, as we have seen, of cellular tissue,
                    and of vessels collected into fasciculi, which at first are straight, and run
                    parallel to each other; but, by the subsequent augmentation of the parts within,
                    are separated at certain places, and touch only at a few points, so as to form a
                    reticulated appearance. In the annual shoot only a single ring of vessels is
                    observed, and these, with the tissue in which they are placed, form the <hi
                    rend="italic">cortical layer,</hi> as it has been called, of that period. Within
                    this layer a new production of vessels and of cellular tissue takes place; and
                    this being annually repeated, constitutes the series of layers of which the bark
                    is ultimately composed. The new layer that is thus annually formed, and which
                    appears to exercise an active vegetative function, was more particularly
                    distinguished by the appellation of <hi rend="italic">liber</hi> by the
                    ancients, from its being the substance on which, before the invention of paper,
                    they were accustomed to write. Very frequently, instead of a ring, the vessels
                    of the bark are collected into distinct parcels or clusters, which, in the
                    progress of vegetation, assume very different shapes.</p>
                <p>Next to the bark is placed the wood, constructed, like the bark, of vessels and
                    cellular tissue. Like it, too, it consists, in the young plant and in the annual
                    shoot of the older one, of a single ring of vessels, which immediately surrounds
                    the pith. In the following year a new ring of vessels is formed around the
                    first, and in every succeeding year this process is repeated; so that the wood
                    consists at length of a series of rings inclosing each other, the number of
                    which denotes the age of the tree. The outer ring of newly formed vessels is
                    more succulent than those of older growth, and is generally of a whiter colour;
                    whence it has received the names of sap-wood or <hi rend="italic">alburnum.</hi>
                    By Du Hamel and most French writers it was named <hi rend="italic">aubier,</hi>
                    and by Hill it was called the <hi rend="italic">blea.</hi> In every annual shoot
                    the newly formed liber and alburnum are in contact, but in every succeeding year
                    they are separated more and more from each other by the interposition of new
                    matter between them; so that at length die first layer of bark and the first
                    ring of wood occupy respectively positions the most distant; those, namely, of
                    the centre and circumference of the tree.</p>
                <p>The vessels that are thus annually formed, and constitute the alburnum, are
                    disposed in <hi rend="italic">radii</hi> which extend more or less completely
                    from the circumference to the centre. In some trees the vessels are much more
                    numerous than in others; and, in the progress pf vegetation, they frequently
                    suffer great alterations in size and <hi rend="superscript"> i</hi> external
                    figure, as was before observed when treating of the vascular system. In the
                    alburnum die size of the vessels is very uniform, and so it continues ever after
                    in some trees; but in others it is very various, some being enlarged more than
                    others by a greater influx of sap. With this increase of size the vessels seem
                    to acquire the spiral character. They are also frequently closed up in the more
                    aged parts of trees, by the production of vesicles within their cavities; and,
                    in common with the smaller vessels and the cells, they are in some trees
                    ultimately filled with gummy or resinous matter. In other instances, where the
                    “proper juices” of the plant differ but little in quality from the common sap,
                    the vessels, when no longer employed inactive vegetation, become dry, and appear
                    in some plants hke empty capillary tubes; and in others, from the minuteness of
                    their size, no aperture is visible. In this state they have been regarded as
                    solid filaments, and denominated the <hi rend="italic">ligneous fibres</hi> of
                    the plant.</p>
                <p>From the disposition of the vessels in <hi rend="italic">radii</hi> more or less
                    regular, the cellular tissue by which they are surrounded will be more or less
                    compressed in the same direction, and form those transverse partitions between
                    the several rays of vessels which we have already so frequently noticed. In
                    addition to these fine partitions, described both by Grew and Malpighi, which
                    are thus interposed between every ray or line of vessels, larger portions of
                    cellular-tissue are observed at certain distances, which extend in the same
                    direction through the wood, and in some instances are continued through the bark
                    also. By the authors just mentioned these partitions were described as
                    stretching from the bark towards the pith, and were named <hi rend="italic"
                    >insertments</hi> by Grew, and <hi rend="italic">transverse utricular
                    ranges</hi> by Malpighi. Others have held them to proceed rather from the pith
                    to the bark, and have called them <hi rend="italic">medullary rays.</hi> We
                    shall venture to name them in future <hi rend="italic">transverse septa,</hi>
                    which appellation denotes simply their direction, and the fact of their forming
                    partitions between the vessels, without having any reference to their origin.
                    For similar reasons, the finer partitions of cellular tissue, pre-, viously
                    described, maybe denominated the <hi rend="italic">lesser transverse
                    septa.</hi></p>
                <p>Beside these transverse septa, there are sometimes portions of cellular tissue
                    intercepting the vessels in a longitudinal direction. This was remarked both by
                    Grew and Malpighi in the oak and several other trees: they appear sometimes to
                    be very short, and sometimes to form nearly a continuous ring around the trunk.
                    It is probable they are formed simply by the pressure of the vessels acting in a
                    direction opposite to that by which the transverse septa are produced: they may,
                    for distinction’s sake, be named the <hi rend="italic">longitudinal septa.</hi>
                    In many trees they are not to be observed, or, if they exist, are so thin as to
                    form only a sort of <hi rend="italic">fascia</hi> on the adjacent vessels. To
                    the cellular tissue promiscuously intermingled with the vessels some writers
                    give the name of <hi rend="italic">parenchyma</hi> of the wood: others term the
                    elongated cells of this part ligneous fibres.</p>
                <p>The only other part of the trunk that remains to be ’ mentioned is the pith. It
                    is situated at the centre, and is surrounded commonly by a ring of vessels, but
                    sometimes in part by thickened cellular tissue. Its proportion in shrubs is
                    usually much larger than in trees; and in the young shoots of trees it occupies
                    more space than in the older branches. At first in the young plant it is
                    succulent, but afterwards becomes dry; and in aged trees it frequently is
                    entirely obliterated, or at least rendered solid.</p>
                <p>In a description of the growth of the trunk in a young plant of chesnut, Malpighi
                    has given clear views of the gradual development of these several parts, and
                    exhibited the appearances successively displayed in the first years of growth.
                    <hi rend="italic">(Anat. Plantar,</hi> 'p. 35.) In the vine some of these parts
                    are very distinct. Fig.L Plate XL., represents a transverse section of the
                    annual shoot of this plant. The pith <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> in the centre, is
                    large, and composed of cells of different sizes. From the pith to the skin in
                    the vine, and, according to Grew, in the elm and some other trees, extend the
                    transverse septa <hi rend="italic">b.</hi> In some places the cellular structure
                    of these septa in the recent plant is still visible, as at c; but generally they
                    have the appearance of thickened membranes. Between every two septa two or
                    sometimes three lines or rays of sap-vessels are interposed, which from their
                    size are readily visible, and their place and disposition are indicated by the
                    dotted marks <hi rend="italic">di</hi> the circular ring that bounds these sap

                    to be formed of condensed cellular tissue, and exterior to it the “proper
                    vessels” are placed in the cellular tissue of the bark.</p>
                <p>In the next figure (fig. 2) is exhibited the transverse section of an
                    apple-branch of one year s growth, which, like the former, is considerably
                    magnified. The angulated figure and relative size of the pith at this period are
                    shown. From the pith to the bark proceed numerous very fine septa, possessing
                    somewhat of a curved direction; and between them innumerable black points,
                    indicating the sap-vessels, are seen. These vessels are disposed in radii, and
                    are bounded exteriorly by the thickened tissue of the bark: the bark is
                    proportionally large, and in die midst of its cellular tissue clusters of
                    “proper vessels,” e, are observed.,</p>
                <p>In a similar section of the apple-branch of two years growth, fig. 3, more highly
                    magnified, the pith/ is seen to have assumed a rounder form: from the pith
                    towards the bark the transverse septa extend, between which the vascular radii
                    are situate. The letter <hi rend="italic">g</hi> denotes the place of junction
                    of the two years’ growth; <hi rend="italic">h</hi> the newly formed alburnous
                    vessels, situate between the bark and the wood; and <hi rend="italic">i</hi> two
                    ranges of “proper vessels,” placed in the cellular tissue of the bark. Grew
                    gives a highly magnified view of a section of this same plant about the third
                    year of its growth, in the 25th table of his work, the appearances of which
                    correspond with those just related, except that the transverse septa, as in all
                    his figures, are made to represent straight lines, which, in the earlier periods
                    of vegetable growth, does not appear to be quite correct.: Proceeding next to
                    the plant of more mature age, we shall copy from Grew part of a section of the
                    oak, which in fig. 4 is exhibited on a reduced scale. The letter <hi
                    rend="italic">k</hi> denotes the bark, <hi rend="italic">I</hi> the alburnum,
                    <hi rend="italic">m</hi> the wood, and <hi rend="italic">n</hi> the pith. In
                    this section the larger transverse septa <hi rend="italic">o,</hi> and the
                    smaller ones <hi rend="italic">p,</hi> are very distinct, between which the
                    sap-vessels of different sizes, indicated by the dark points, are situate; the
                    letter <hi rend="italic">q</hi> points to the “proper vessels” of the bark, some
                    of which are collected into round parcels, and others form a ring.</p>
                <p>Beside the transverse septa that intersect the diameter of the tree, we observe,
                    in this figure, other lines, <hi rend="italic">r,</hi> placed at right angles to
                    them, and which appear to be interposed between each annual ring of wood. Grew
                    considered it probable that these lines were produced in the oak, and also in
                    the fig-tree and walnut, by a peculiar sort of sap-vessels that existed once in
                    the bark, as did the turpentine vessels distributed through the wood of the
                    pine. <hi rend="italic">(Anat. of Plants,</hi> p. 115.) Hill also calls them
                    sapvessels seated on the outer edge of each annual circle, which in the young
                    plant contain sometimes a limpid liquor, and at other times appear empty. He
                    notices also the existence of “proper vessels,” containing a thick juice in the
                    alburnum of this tree. <hi rend="italic">(On the Construction of Timber,</hi> p.
                    9.)</p>
                <p>An examination of this wood at an age still more advanced may contribute to throw
                    some further light on its structure. In fig. 5 is given the representation of a
                    transverse section of the central portion of a piece of the wood of very old
                    oak, of its natural size and appearance. The pith <hi rend="italic">s,</hi> at
                    the centre, was completely obstructed, and its cellular character obliterated;
                    the letters <hi rend="italic">t11</hi> denote the larger transverse septa,
                    rendered completely solid everywhere, and in some places partially obliterated;
                    and <hi rend="italic">u</hi> the white lines that extend in the opposite
                    direction, and mark the boundaries of each year’s growth. In the substance of
                    these concentric lines numerous traces of minute apertures were visible; and
                    from one line to another, small irregularly curved lines, as represented in the
                    drawing, were everywhere observed to extend. No vacuity was anywhere perceived
                    to exist, but the whole formed one compact and solid mass.</p>
                <p>A small and very thin slice of this wood, comprising a part of one of the larger
                    transverse septa, and small portions of two of the concentric lines above
                    mentioned, was submitted to a pretty highly magnifying power; and a delineation
                    of its appearance is given m fig. 6. In this figure the letters <hi
                    rend="italic">v v</hi> denote the two concentric lines; <hi rend="italic">w</hi>
                    one of the smaller irregular lines that frequently extend from <hi rend="italic"
                    >V</hi> to <hi rend="italic">V,</hi> but are often intercepted, and form
                    irregular spots or patches, as traced in several parts of the drawing; <hi
                    rend="italic">x</hi> the smaller transverse septa, situated at unequal distances
                    from each other; and <hi rend="italic">y</hi> the larger septum, the cellular
                    character of which is entirely obliterated. Several small irregular lines,
                    running in the same· direction with the larger concentric ones, are also
                    observed: these, at their junctions with the lesser transverse septa, produce a
                    number of little squares, the areae of which are filled up with a dotted or
                    punctuated membrane.</p>
                <p>This microscopical representation seems to confirm the opinion of Grew, that the
                    concentric lines <hi rend="italic">v v</hi> are chiefly composed of vessels; for
                    their apertures, now rendered visible, are of different sizes, and the canal of
                    many of the larger ones is filled up with a vesicular substance, often observed
                    in the vessels of aged plants. The substance that surrounds these vessels
                    appears to be condensed cellular tissue, rendered perfectly solid by the
                    resinous matter with which it is filled. The irregular thickened lines <hi
                    rend="italic">w</hi> that run transversely to the former are similarly composed
                    of vessels and condensed cellular tissue; and the smaller patches, we have
                    noticed, are made up of the same. Both the large and small transverse septa
                    consist of condensed cellular tissue alone; and such, too, appears to be the
                    matter of which the fine lines or longitudinal septa that intersect them are
                    composed. Some observations of Du Hamel on the formation of the ligneous layers
                    may aid our inquiries into the nature of these latter septa, and the minute
                    structure of the wood.</p>
                <p>In a transverse section of the trunk of the oak, the elm, or the fir, says this
                    very intelligent writer, the ligneous layers are distinctly visible, and it is
                    commonly believed that each of these layers is the product of one year’s growth.
                    If, however, we cut obliquely a piece of oak, each layer is then seen, with the
                    aid of a common lens, to be composed of a number of thinner layers, which
                    mutually cover each other. By macerating pieces of wood in water, he was able to
                    separate the annual layers into a great number of leaflets, thinner than the
                    finest paper; and these primary layers, as they may be called, he afterwards
                    ascertained by experiment to be formed successively during, the whole period of
                    active vegetation; so that the layer which is the product of one year’s growth
                    is itself formed of a number of layers exceedingly thin. <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Phys, des Arb.</hi> tome i. p. 31, and tome ii. p. 19.)</p>
                <p>Now it is probable that between each of these primary layers cellular tissue is
                    interposed; and this tissue, by its compression, gives origin to the minute
                    lines which in this tree have been noticed. In several trees, however, no
                    similar lines are visible, because in all probability they do not, like the oak,
                    afford secretions by which the tissue is thickened and rendered apparent. Even
                    in a very thin slice of oak, when viewed in the microscope by a strongly
                    reflected light, these lines almost entirely vanish, while those of the two
                    orders of proper transverse septa remain.</p>
                <p>M.Kieser examined the same wood in the transverse slice ∣ of a tree 100 years of
                    age: and his representation of its structure is copied in fig. 23, Plate XL. In
                    this figure, in <pb break="no" facs="nls:193096666" xml:id="kp-eb0703-6666-0085"

                    indicate the cellular tissue, or, as he calls it, the parenchyma 'of the wood.
                    At the top and bottom, the cells are obstructed and appear like obscure points
                    (as is the case also in fig. 6 of the same plate); but in the middle of the
                    figure the cavities of the cells are said to be still visible: the letters <hi
                    rend="italic">U U</hi> denote the apertures of enlarged spiral vessels, all of
                    which were filled with vesicles, but a few only are so represented, as in <hi
                    rend="italic">d</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi><hi rend="italic">d’</hi> indicates
                    the smaller vessels dispersed through the cellular tissue; <hi rend="italic"
                    >d</hi> a portion of one of the larger septa, and <hi rend="italic">f'</hi> the
                    smaller ones, which are often displaced by the augmentation in the size of the
                    vessels.*</p>
                <p>In this highly magnified representation by Kieser, there is no appearance of the
                    concentric lines or septa which intersect the transverse ones, as noticed by
                    Grew and Malpighi, and exhibited in fig. 5 and 6; but the two orders of
                    transverse septa remain. We before remarked, that in a slice of wood so very
                    thin as, when viewed by a strong light, to become translucent, these lines in a
                    great measure vanished; and in the figure of Μ. Kieser this evanescence is made
                    to extend even to the thickened portion that intercepts the annual layers. It is
                    therefore probable that all these appearances of concentric or longitudinal
                    septa are produced simply by the thickening and compression of the cellular
                    tissue in the oak, and such other trees as have viscid juices, and whose vessels
                    are subject to irregular enlargement; for in whatever position these thickenings
                    occur, numerous vessels are always to be observed. Hence in very thin slices
                    they entirely vanish, while die proper transverse septa, being formed by the
                    condensation of continuous portions of membrane, remain visible. In these
                    figures it may also be remarked, that the surface occupied by cellular tissue
                    seems equal nearly to that occupied by vessels; but it is probable that the
                    apertures of many minute vessels dispersed through the tissue have not been
                    distinguished from the cells. In a highly magnified representation, however, of
                    the wood of this tree by Grew <hi rend="italic">(Anat. of Plants,</hi> tab. 3,
                    fig. 7), the proportion of the vascular to what is deemed the cellular part is
                    still less.</p>
                <p>The vessels of the bark in the oak, as delineated by Grew, fig. 4, Plate XL., arc
                    represented as disposed partly in parcels and partly in a ring; and in all the
                    representations he has given of different trees, the greatest diversity in
                    regard to the position of these vessels is found to exist. From the difference
                    in the qualities of their juices, in the texture of the parts, and in the modes
                    and circumstances of their growth, this variation may be expected to occur. In
                    the oak, the pine, and many others, it seems certain also that a part of the
                    cortical texture, or at least vessels containing the “proper juices” of the
                    plant, are constantly mixed with those of the ligneous texture, and with them
                    contribute to form each annual layer of wood. For examples of the diversity of
                    structure exhibited in the trunk of a great many different trees, we may refer
                    to the plates of Grew.</p>

                    rend="smallcaps">Art.</hi> I.— <hi rend="italic">Of the Branch.</hi></p>
                <p>From the trunk springs the branch, which in structure resembles very exactly that
                    of the trunk itself; and hence the description of the one serves entirely for
                    that of the other.</p>
                <p>Branches, in common with leaves, originate from buds, of which we have
                    subsequently to treat, introductory to a description of leaves. At present we
                    shall describe only the mode of connection between the trunk and the
                    branch.’</p>
                <p>The branch, says Grew, springs not from the surface, but so deep as to take with
                    it not only the bark and the wood, but the pith also, making its way at the
                    parts where the vessels are separated by the transverse septa, and carrying with
                    it the skin, which is extended with it. <hi rend="italic">(Anat. of Plants,</hi>
                    p. 28.) The separation of the vessels of the trunk to form the branch is not
                    like the separation of a few filaments from a skein of thread; but they spring,
                    says Du Hamel, from a centre, and bear with them a part of each portion of the
                    tree. Hence, if a tree that is divided into two branches be cut a foot above the
                    bifurcation, the surface of the sections resembles that of two trunks cut
                    horizontally: if the section be made lower down, at the place where the branches
                    spring, the same appearances of two series of concentric circles are seen at the
                    axis of the trunk, but they are surrounded by other layers common to those which
                    belong to each of the branches; and still lower on the trunk the concentric
                    circles belonging to each branch diminish, and are finally lost in those which
                    form the trunk from which they sprang. <hi rend="italic">(Phys,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">des Arbres,</hi> tome i. p. 93.) These primary branches divide
                    into others, and these again into still smaller branches, which form angles with
                    each other, more or less great, according to the species of tree, and other
                    causes.</p>
                <p>The position of the branches on different trees is very various, but in the same
                    species it is generally uniform. From the measurements of Du Hamel, it appears
                    that in many trees the solid matter of the branches that go out from the trunk
                    exceeds that of the trunk itself in the proportion nearly of five to four. <hi
                    rend="italic">(Phys,</hi><hi rend="italic">des Arbres,</hi> tome i. p.96.)</p>
                <p>Some have supposed that the branches proceeded always from, and were nourished
                    by, the pith; but this opinion has been combated by Du Hamel and Hill. The
                    latter gives a longitudinal section of the trunk of a species of American
                    dog-wood (copied in fig. 7, Plate XL.), representing the origin of two buds <hi
                    rend="italic">g</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">g</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">,</hi> which
                    are seen in the state of pushing out on either side through the vessels of the
                    wood. In this trunk the pith is of a brown colour, the inmost ring of vessels
                    green, and the outer ones white. Through the white rings the inner green vessels
                    are seen to shoot, and the brown pith is left entire behind; though the new
                    branch at length obtains a pith for itself, which, however, has no connection
                    with that of the trunk. In a similar section of an older trunk (fig. 8), the
                    branches are seen to spring also from the inmost circle of wood; the pith <hi
                    rend="italic">Ji</hi> is not at all disturbed, but each branch is furnished with
                    its own pith <hi rend="italic">i</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">i'.</hi> In a section
                    of the vine (fig. 9), a similar origin of the branches, from the inmost circle
                    of wood, is observed; and not only is the pith <hi rend="italic">h</hi><hi
                    rend="italic superscript"> f</hi> of the branch distinct from that of the trunk,
                    but the pith of the trunk itself is intercepted by the shooting of a branch <hi
                    rend="italic">l’</hi> across it. <hi rend="italic">( On the Construction of
                    Timber,</hi> p. 35.) This latter fact of the interception of the pith by the
                    shooting of a branch across it was previously noticed by Grew in the vine and
                    some other plants. <hi rend="italic">(Anat. of Plants,</hi> tab. 19.)</p>
                <p>. When a bud thus protrudes to form a branch, the perpendicular vessels of the
                    trunk are compelled to separate; and they afterwards meet above, and pursue
                    their former direction. This is shown in fig. 11, Plate XL., copied from Du
                    Hamel, in which the bud <hi rend="italic">ni,</hi> in the act of sprouting, is
                    seen to push to either side the vessels of the trunk, which again meet above
                    it.</p>
                <p>The vessels both of the wood and bark, according to the same author, have their
                    direction determined chiefly <pb break="no" facs="nls:193096679"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0703-6679-0086"/>by the course of the sap. If the sap preserve a
                    perpendicular direction, as in trees that have no branches, the vessels arc
                    perpendicular also; but if it move to one side, these vessels then change their
                    direction. This is strikingly evinced in a tree that has been cut over above a
                    branch; for then all the sap being obliged to pass to the young branch, the
                    vessels all at once take the same direction; so that if a tree has been cut oyer
                    in winter, and at the end of the succeeding spring its branch below be examined,
                    the new vessels of the branch will be seen to cross those of the trunk, as
                    exhibited in fig. 12, <hi rend="italic">n',</hi> Plate XL. <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Phys,</hi><hi rend="italic">des Arbres,</hi> tome ii. p. 53.)</p>
                <p>In figures 7, 8, and 9, copied from Hill, the young branch, in every instance, is
                    seen to originate from the inmost ring of vessels that surrounds the pith; and
                    he was of opinion that all buds and branches sprang from this part alone. To
                    this vascular circle he gave the name of <hi rend="italic">corona,</hi> and held
                    it to be the most important part of the vegetable body,—-that it was like no
                    other part of the plant, but contained within itself the essence of them all.
                    <hi rend="italic">(On the Construction of Timber,</hi> p. 21.)</p>
                <p>It is however notorious, that trees in which not only this first circle, but
                    almost every other circle of vessels, has perished, produce leaves and shoots
                    from the trunk where the bark is entire, as this author himself admits, p. 44 of
                    his work. There does not appear, either in the anatomical character, or in the
                    functions of this circle, any thing that distinguishes it from the others,
                    except priority of formation, and its being in consequence the seat from which
                    the <hi rend="italic">first</hi> buds and branches spring.</p>
                <p>A much more correct idea of the origin of buds and branches was entertained by Du
                    Hamel, who illustrates it by the diagram fig. 10, Plate XL. Let us suppose .this
                    figure to represent a tree of four years’ growth, as indicated by the four
                    ligneous cones which at its base envelope each other. In the first year a bud o'
                    springs from the inmost ring, which by the fourth year is seen to consist of
                    four ligneous layers. In the second year a second bud fi springs from the ring
                    of that year, and consists only of three layers; the next year a bud <hi
                    rend="italic">cį</hi> is developed on the first bud <hi rend="italic">o',</hi>
                    and possesses only two layers; and the bud <hi rend="italic">τ</hi><hi
                    rend="italic superscript"> j</hi><hi rend="italic">,</hi> developed the fourth
                    year on the outmost ring of wood, is seen to consist only of one layer. <hi
                    rend="italic">(Phys, des</hi><hi rend="italic">Arbres,</hi> tome ii. p. 53.) In
                    this way every ligneous layer may be considered equally capable of giving origin
                    to buds and branches.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Art.</hi> II.— <hi rend="italic">Of Thorns.</hi></p>
                <p>Connected both in origin and in structure with branches are those appendages,
                    frequently observed upon them, called thorns. They are very conspicuous on the
                    hawthorn, and are constituted, says Grew, of the same parts as the bud itself,
                    and in a like proportion. They spring from the outer portion of the ligneous
                    texture, and may be considered as abortive buds. <hi rend="italic">(Anat. of
                    Plants,</hi> p. 33.) Malpighi describes them as being frequently produced in the
                    axils of leaves, and assuming for a time the form of a branch, but at length
                    degenerating into a thorn. He considers them to arise from defective nutrition,
                    and adds, that they disappear frequently under higher culture. <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Anat. Plantar,</hi> p. 138.)</p>
                <p>According to Willdenow, most species of our fruit-trees naturally possess thorns,
                    which disappear entirely and become branches under higher culture. Even in the
                    black-thorn the prickles diminish in number under improved culture, but do not
                    entirely disappear.</p>
                <p>Sometimes, however, instead of being produced from abortive buds, thorns owe
                    their origin to the degeneration of other organs; the petioles of some pinnate
                    leaves which are persistent become thorns, and the same thing is observed of the
                    peduncles of some flowers. Certain stipulae also, as those of Mimosa, are said
                    sometimes to change into thorns <hi rend="italic">(Principles of Botany,</hi> p.
                    270); and in the date, according to Μ. de Candolle, a lobe of the leaf has been
                    converted into a thorn. <hi rend="italic">(Théorie</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Element, de la</hi><hi rend="italic">Botanique,</hi> p. 344.) In other
                    instances, as in the holly, the leaf produces thorns round its entire margin,
                    which are formed by the vessels that bound it. (See fig. 11, Plate XLI.)</p>
                <p>When the bark is removed from a branch that possesses thorns, the thorns still
                    remain, by which they are distinguished from prickles that originate from the
                    bark. In fig. 20, Plate XLI., is a representation of a branch deprived of its
                    bark, in which thorns of different forms are seen to spring from the ligneous
                    texture; and in fig. 21 of the same plate is a longitudinal section of another
                    branch covered with its bark, in which the ligneous and cortical textures of the
                    thorn are displayed. For the descriptions of the varieties of thorns, and their
                    external appearance, we must refer to the writers on botany.</p>

                    Tendrils.</hi></p>
                <p>From the similarity in structure which these bodies exhibit to the branches from
                    which they spring, we have placed them as appendages to those members. As is
                    well known, they are met with only in certain plants, and their obvious use is
                    to attach the different parts of the plant to one another, for mutual support,
                    or to the objects in their neighbourhood. In a general manner they are
                    denominated <hi rend="italic">fulcra</hi><hi rend="italic">:</hi> the most
                    remarkable species are those which, like the claws of ivy, called <hi

                    those of the vine, named tendrils <hi rend="italic">(cirri'),</hi> which possess
                    a spiral conformation.</p>
                <p>According to Malpighi, the claws or claspers of ivy possess a roundish form, and
                    are covered with hairs, which yield a viscous humour, by which they are
                    agglutinated to stones or to walls and trees. Their forms are exhibited in fig.

                    figure, their origin and structure arc displayed. They are seen to spring from
                    the ligneous texture of the stem, and to possess a similar structure.</p>
                <p>The tendril is described by the same author as springing from knots between the
                    origins of leaves. It possesses a round stem, which is sometimes covered with
                    hairs; and this stem frequently divides into several branches. At first it is
                    very tender, but gradually acquires solidity, and assumes the spiral character;
                    its colour is green, and it is composed, like the trunk, of all common textures.
                    <hi rend="italic">(Anat. Plantar,</hi> p. 139.) By Willdenow it is regarded as
                    an abortive leaf, being simply a prolongation of the petiole, without the leafy
                    expansion. <hi rend="italic">(Principles of Botany,</hi> p. 272.) Its form, as
                    it occurs in the vine, is exhibited in fig. 23, Plate XLI.; but in this
                    particular it is subject to the greatest variation.</p>
                <p>The leaf itself, as well as the petiole, is said to be sometimes prolonged into a
                    tortuous appendage resembling the tendril; and similar transformations are
                    sometimes exhibited by the peduncle and petals of the flower. In öne species of
                    vine mentioned by Malpighi, the extremity of the tendril, which is at first
                    pointed, becomes gradually incurvated and reflected, and at length is formed
                    into a roundish body, which is furnished with small papillae, that yield a
                    viscous fluid, by means of which it attaches itself to walls or wood, so
                    strongly as not to be easily separated.</p>

                <p><hi rend="italic">Of the Structure of Roots.</hi></p>
                <p>Considered in relation to their general form, roots, says Μ. de Candolle, exhibit
                    two very distinct appearances. Some roots have a conical trunk, simple or
                    ramified, but springing always from a single base, and their radicle only
                    elongates or ramifies; others spring always in a bundle, more or less marked,
                    from a common base, which is so confounded with the neck of the plant that it is
                    sometimes taken for the base of the stem, and sometimes for the trunk of the
                    root The first form of root is met with in the greater number of exogenous
                    plants; the second occurs chiefly in the endogenous, and also in those exogenes
                    which have fascicular roots.</p>
                <p>Of the <hi rend="italic">conical</hi> roots, some ramify greatly, and have
                    numerous fibrous or capillary rootlets; others produce few or no branches, and
                    are furnished with few fibrous roots. In the former class, the principal
                    differences arise from the degree of ramification; in the latter, two varieties
                    of form are very distinct—that of the carrot, <hi rend="italic">named
                    fusiform,</hi> from its tapering to a point, like a spindle—and that named <hi
                    rend="italic">rapi-form</hi> by De Candolle, from the swollen form it assumes at
                    its origin, and sudden shrinking to a point below, as in the turnip.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">fascicular</hi> roots present also many varieties of form:
                    Is/, Those of the <hi rend="italic">Gramineae,</hi> in which each rootlet,
                    though distinct at its birth, ramifies so much that the divisions resemble the
                    fibrous productions of the preceding class: 2<hi rend="italic">dly,</hi> Those
                    of the hyacinth, in which many cylindrical rootlets spring from a common base,
                    and descend nearly parallel, or with a slight divergence: 2<hi rend="italic"
                    >dly,</hi> Those of the orchis, in which, besides cylindrical rootlets, there
                    are others swollen into tubercles: <hi rend="italic">⅛thly,</hi> Those of
                    Ranunculus, where all the fibres that spring from the base are more or less
                    swollen, so as to form a bundle of oblong tubercles. Between all these distinct
                    forms there are several intermediate varieties. Under the name of <hi
                    rend="italic">tuberous</hi> roots arc included all those which have swellings in
                    any part of their length, and that, too, whether they sprang originally from a
                    single or common base. It may, however, be observed, that many tubercles which
                    spring apparently from roots, are in reality productions from inferior branches
                    of the stem, concealed beneath the soil, as Μ. Dunal first proved to be the fact
                    in the potato. <hi rend="italic">(Organog. Végét.</hi> tome i. p. 252.)</p>
                <p>The root is held to consist of two parts; the main body with its branches, and
                    the fibrous productions called capillary rootlets. These parts are commonly hid
                    beneath the soil, but in some plants they are attached to rocks or stones, in
                    others they are fixed in other vegetables. Some plants, again, have no fixed
                    attachment, but float loosely on water; and others are considered to possess no
                    root at all.</p>
                <p>With respect to <hi rend="italic">structure,</hi> the body of the root of trees,
                    says Malpighi <hi rend="italic">(Anat. Plantar,</hi> p. 145), maybe regarded as
                    an elongation of the trunk beneath the soil, being constructed of the same
                    textures, disposed nearly in the same manner. In various herbaceous plants the
                    root has been examined wifh much minuteness by Grew. <hi rend="italic">(Anat. of
                    Plants,</hi> book ii.) The cuticle, says he, is of different colours in
                    different plants: sometimes its surface is smooth, at others rough; and its
                    texture is either thin and transparent, or thick and opaque. At an early period
                    the cuticle appears to be a continuation of that of the radicle, but afterwards
                    seems to be derived from the bark. It is composed chiefly of cellular tissue,
                    through which vessels are distributed in the direction of the length of the
                    root. The existence of these vessels, though scarcely visible by the microscope,
                    may be inferred from the fact that it is more difficult to tear the skin in a
                    longitudinal than transverse direction. If, also, the skin be cut transversely,
                    and then allowed to dry, all the parts where there are no vessels shrink below
                    the surface of the cut end; but where there are vessels there is no shrinking.
                    Or if, after making a transverse section of the root, the skin be pressed very
                    gently with the edge of the nail, sap will sometimes arise from the skin, as
                    from any other part where vessels are placed; which does not happen with fluids
                    contained in the cellular tissue, unless the cells be broken. <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Ibid.</hi> p. 62.)</p>
                <p>Beneath the cuticle lies the bark, which is found to differ very much, both in
                    colour and thickness, in different plants; scarcely in some instances exceeding
                    the skin in thickness, whilst in others it is thicker than the woody part of the
                    root. It is composed of vascular fasciculi and cellular tissue, the cells of
                    which are smaller than those in the trunk: these cells are generally of a
                    spherical form, or nearly so, often transparent, but not visibly pervious into
                    one another. In some roots the cellular tissue is disposed in rays extending
                    from the inner to the outward edge of the bark; in others it extends only in
                    part through the bark. The cells themselves are sometimes uniform, and sometimes
                    they differ both in size and figure. They are often filled with lymph, or other
                    matter. <hi rend="italic">(Ibid.</hi> p. 64.)</p>
                <p>In the cellular tissue vessels running lengthwise through the bark like small
                    threads are observed; and in a transverse section the sap is seen to exude from
                    them. They often form a net-work, and seem as if inosculated; but are only
                    contiguous, like the braces in a drum. They are never single, but form clusters
                    of 20 or more together: their form is cylindrical, and they are of the same size
                    through their whole course. Some vessels frequently separate from a cluster and
                    are transferred from place to place; but they never ramify so as to be
                    successively propagated one from another. Their position in the bark is very
                    various, forming sometimes a ring at its inner edge, and dispersed sometimes in
                    clusters through it, or disposed in the form of lines or rays. The fluid they
                    contain varies in colour and consistence in different plants, being sometimes
                    thin and clear, sometimes thick and mucilaginous, often milky or resinous.
                    Sometimes the fluids of the bark vary in the same root, which, when cut
                    transversely, will yield both a limpid and milky sap. <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Ibid.</hi> p. 67.)</p>
                <p>The woody part of the root, like that of the trunk, is made up of cellular tissue
                    and vessels. This tissue varies greatly in proportion in different roots, but is
                    less abundant in the root than in the stem. It is disposed sometimes in rings,
                    but oftener in lines and rays, like the transverse septa in the stem. Through
                    this tissue two kinds of vessels are distributed, one containing a lymph, and
                    the other being empty; whence they have been denominated by Grew the succiferous
                    and air-vessels. In some roots these vessels are disposed in clusters or
                    fasciculi; in others they form rings; and in others they have a radiated form.
                    Both kinds are much intermixed, and everywhere surrounded by cellular tissue.
                    The number of empty vessels is sometimes small and sometimes great; <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193096705" xml:id="kp-eb0703-6705-0088"/> and the same may
                    be said of their size, even in the same root. Malpighi, says Grew, has described
                    them as being constructed of a thin transparent zone, of a silvery colour,
                    having a spiral form; to which Grew adds, that the spiral zone is not a single
                    piece of a flat form, but consists of two or more round and true fibres, not
                    inosculated side to side, but knit together by other smaller fibres,—a
                    construction similar to that which Kieser has since demonstrated. Their
                    spiration, however, is better seen in the stem, and better m young parts than in
                    old ones. Though these spiral vessels seemed empty, or containing only air, yet,
                    says Grew, “whether these vessels may not, in some vegetables, and at some
                    times, contain liquor, is doubtful.” <hi rend="italic">(Ibid.</hi> p. 74.)</p>
                <p>In illustration of the structure above stated, Grew ex- • hibits, in twelve
                    successive tables of his work, the external forms and internal structure of
                    various roots. As a specimen of this structure, we have copied his
                    representations of the root of wormwood. In fig. 13, Plate XL., is a delineation
                    of a transverse section of this root, of its natural size; and in fig. 14 is a
                    magnified representation of a portion of the same section, here presented on a
                    reduced scale, in which A denotes the cuticle, B the bark, and C the wood. The
                    smaller letter <hi rend="italic">a</hi> indicates the ligneous rays formed by
                    the vessels, and <hi rend="italic">b</hi> the cellular tissue or transverse
                    septa continuous with that of the bark. The dark spots in the bark are described
                    by Grew as balsam vessels, intermingled with lymphaeducts; and those in wood as
                    the spiral or empty vessels. It will be seen that the vessels of the woody part
                    are smallest at the centre, and gradually augment in size as they approach the
                    circumference, as Kieser has since observed; and that, with the exception of a
                    few vessels said to convey lymph, all those of the wood are considered as
                    air-vessels, and therefore as possessing a spiral conformation. In his chapter
                    on roots, Malpighi also frequently describes tracheae as occurring in the
                    dissections made by him of the roots of various plants.</p>
                <p> In fig. 21, Plate XL., is exhibited a horizontal section of the root of the
                    gourd, of the natural size, as given by Kieser, representing four fasciculi of
                    vessels, intercepted by cellular tissue. One of these fasciculi, consisting of
                    37 vessels, is represented in fig. 22, magnified 130 times. Of these vessels,
                    the largest, as usual, are situated exteriorly, and they pretty regularly
                    diminish in size as they approach the centre. Two of these vessels are nearly
                    filled with vesicles, and the whole of them are generally of smaller, size than
                    those in the stem of the same plant. A vertical section of one of the largest
                    vessels near the circumference, and of two of the smallest at the centre of this
                    root, have been already exhibited in figure 19, Plate XXXVIII. They all belonged
                    to the variety of punctuated spirals; so that all the vessels in the root of
                    this plant, as well as in the stem, may be considered as possessing the spiral
                    conformation.</p>
                <p>To the testimony of Grew, Malpighi, and Kieser, as to the existence of <hi
                    rend="italic">spiral</hi> vessels in roots, we may add that of Du Hamel, who
                    says that if a young root, as that of the horserchesnut, be duly macerated in
                    boiling water, and its bark afterwards removed, the ligneous portion will be
                    found so tender as to be divisible into fine filaments; which filaments, when
                    viewed with a microscope, will be found to be spiral vessels or tracheae, which,
                    he adds, might lead one to think that all the ligneous fibres are really spiral
                    fibres, while they are yet tender. <hi rend="italic">(Phys, des Arb.</hi> tome
                    .ii. p. 13, 14.) Mirbel and some other writers, however, deny altogether the
                    existence of spiral vessels in the root; and Μ. de Candolle declares that one of
                    the chief differences in structure between the stem and the root consists in the
                    total absence of tracheae ⅛ the latter. <hi rend="italic">( Organog. Végét.</hi>
                    tome i. p. 242.) Yielding credence, however, to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >positive</hi> testimony of Grew, Malpighi, Du Hamel, and Kieser, rather than to
                    the <hi rend="italic">negative</hi> assertions of their opponents, we are
                    disposed to conclude, that all the vessels which convey the ascending sap in the
                    root possess, like those in the stem, a spiral structure.</p>
                <p>It cannot fail to be observed also, in the sections of roots just exhibited, that
                    the proportion of vessels to cells is much larger in the root than in the stem
                    of herbs, and that consequently the cells are smaller and more compressed. The
                    vessels occupy also the very centre of the root, to the exclusion of all
                    cellular tissue, in the form of pith, in exogenous plants; but in the
                    endogenous, the internal structure of the roots, as compared with that of the
                    stem, is said to present no sensible difference. In exogenous plants, also, the
                    diametral insertions, or septa, and the appearance of the bark, are as distinct
                    in the root as in the stem; while in the endogenous the vessels and cells are
                    intermingled through the entire root, as well a$ through the stem. In trees, the
                    structure of the root is more distinct than in herbs, and still more nearly
                    resembles that of the trunk.</p>
                <p>In treating of the evolution of seeds, we exhibited several examples of the
                    manner in which the fibrous or capillary rootlets spring from the trunk, or
                    larger branches of the root. These rootlets are more simple in structure than
                    buds, being made up chiefly of the ligneous portion of the plant. They are the
                    organs which absorb nutriment from the earth; and hence, as Du Hamel observed,
                    the earth is exhausted chiefly where these capillary rootlets are distributed,
                    and not in the neighbourhood of the larger roots. On examining the roots of
                    trees after severe winters, he often found the capillary rootlets dead; which
                    led him to suppose that trees lose in the earth their capillary rootlets nearly
                    as in the air they lose their leaves. He found, that even after slight frosts
                    many of these rootlets were dead; and that, when the temperature became milder,
                    new rootlets were developed, which abundantly replaced those destroyed. <hi
                    rend="italic">(Phys, des Arb.</hi> tomeì. p. 89.)</p>
                <p>All roots raised from seeds have a tap-root, that grows in length in proportion
                    as the earth is easily penetrable. The seeds of the oak, sown in a deep and rich
                    sand, have produced plants, says Du Hamel, the stems of which were only six
                    inches in height, while the root extended nearly to four feet. If, however, the
                    root meet below the surface with any obstacle that opposes its elongation, it
                    then continues short, and subdivides into many lateral branches. This result may
                    be also obtained by simply cutting the extremity of the root; for roots, as Du
                    Hamel first ascertained by experiment, do not elongate but by their extremity.
                    <hi rend="italic">(Phys, des Arb.</hi> tome i. p. 83.) Hence, when injured by
                    insects, or in any other way, so as to check its elongation, the root, by
                    throwing out lateral branches, will often derive more nutriment by these new
                    productions than it would have obtained by a single trunk.</p>
                <p>Roots arc provided through their whole extent with a quantity of germs, or a
                    capacity of producing them, when placed in favourable circumstances; and this
                    capacity ⅛ possessed also by the branch. If the branch of many trees be cut off
                    and planted in the earth, it emits rootlets from its sides beneath the soil. If
                    even the bark of a branch be removed so as to intercept the descending sap, and
                    the part be then surrounded with moist earth, the upper portion of the divided
                    bark will emit rootlets into the earth. The simple immersion of cuttings of the
                    willow in water is sufficient to cause the production of <hi rend="italic"
                    >ι</hi> ootlets, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193096718"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0703-6718-0089"/>which spring from the cutting, says Malpighi, just
                    at the 'surface of the water, not below it. They appear at first like small
                    tumours, and are composed of ligneous fibres and tracheae, which gradually force
                    their way through the bark. <hi rend="italic">(Anat. Plantar,</hi> p. 146.)</p>
                <p>In like manner, as a branch may thus be made to produce rootlets, so may a root
                    be made to produce branches. If a root be cut off, or an incision be made in its
                    bark, so as to intercept the descending sap, a swelling, or <hi rend="italic"
                    >bourrelet,</hi> will form around the upper extremity, from which new rootlets
                    will spring; or if this cut end be left exposed to the atmosphere, then, says Du
                    Hamel <hi rend="italic">(Phys, des Arb.</hi> tome i. p∙ lθ2), in place of
                    rootlets, new shoots or branch-lets will be developed. It is thus ∙ that many
                    plants, as mint, which spread their roots horizontally, produce new stems from
                    them when they happen to come sufficiently near to the surface. From the facts
                    above stated, Du Hamel maintains that the tumour or enlargement <hi
                    rend="italic">(bourrelet)</hi> formed either on the cut stem or the root of a
                    plant is'essentially the same; that in both it contains germs proper for
                    producing either branches or roots; and that the one or the other is developed,
                    according as the <hi rend="italic">bourrelet</hi> is exposed to the air or is
                    placed in the earth. <hi rend="italic">(Phys,</hi><hi rend="italic">des
                    Arbres,</hi> tome i. p. 102.)</p>
                <p>Others have maintained not only a perfect identity of structure between the root
                    and branch, but also between the bud that gives origin to the branch, and the
                    rootlet that springs from the root; and further, that they are convertible into
                    each other. In proof of this it is alleged, that if a willow plant be bent down
                    so that its head shall be fixed in the earth, it will soon push forth rootlets;
                    and that if, after these are developed, the trunk with its former roots be
                    raised so as to be exposed to the air, there will shortly be formed a new head,
                    furnished with leaves and branches. These facts, however, prove only a
                    substitution, and not a conversion, of these organs into one another; for the
                    young buds of the head die when placed under the soil, and the new roots spring
                    from points not previously occupied by buds; while, in like manner, all the
                    young rootlets developed beneath the soil perish in the air, and new buds arc
                    produced from the older trunks of the root. In some plants the stem seems to
                    perish, and the root in the following year produces a new stem; and from this it
                    has been inferred that the root alone preserves the vitality of the individual:
                    but the stem in these plants does not, says Μ. de Candolle, entirely perish; and
                    in the phenomena exhibited by cuttings the contrary takes place, for the stem
                    devclopes new roots. We ought therefore, says he, to regard the stem and the
                    root as of equal importance. Their union constitutes the body of the plant. <hi
                    rend="italic">(Organog. Végét.</hi> tome i. p. 249.)</p>
                <p>The knots or articulations in the stems of plants, by retarding the descent of
                    the juices, favour the production of new parts; and according as the stem may be
                    exposed to dryness or humidity, either branches or roots may be formed. Hence
                    stems that have many knots most easily propagate by slips and layers; and
                    fleshy'plants, as the <hi rend="italic">Cactus,</hi> which possess a thick and
                    moist cellular tissue, have a disposition to propagate roots even in the open
                    air. It is the same with roots possessing tubercles, which are a sort of
                    magazines of nutrient matter, and possess, therefore, a singular aptitude for
                    emitting new productions. <hi rend="italic">(Organog. Végét.</hi> tome i. p.
                    248.)</p>
                <p>We have already stated that roots grow in length, not by an extension of parts,
                    but only by the addition of new rpatter to theiŗ extremity. This power of growth
                    Du Hamel found to reside within two or three lines of the extremity, both in
                    ligneous and herbaceous roots. <hi rend="italic">(Phys.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >des Arb.</hi> tome i. p. 84.) It is chiefly by their extremities, also, that
                    they absorb fluids; for Senebier found, that if the extremity of a root, as that
                    of a carrot or radish, was immersed in water, the water was absorbed; whilst if
                    the whole root, with the exception of the extremity, was immersed, little
                    absorption took place ;—results which have been confirmed by the experiments of
                    Carradori. These facts have led Μ. de Candolle to consider the extremities of
                    roots, and of all fibrous rootlets, as furnished with a peculiar hygroscopic
                    power. This power he conceives to depend, as we Before remarked, on the
                    existence of a minute cellular structure at this part, to which structure he has
                    given the name of spongioles <hi rend="italic">(spongiolae).</hi> These
                    spongioles, according to him, are formed of a very compact cellular tissue,
                    composed of roundish cells. He distinguishes several varieties of these organs,
                    as the radical, the pistillary, and the seminal, according as they are seated at
                    the extremities of the radical fibres, of the pistil, or in the coats of seeds.
                    So great, he adds, is their absorbing power, that they absorb the colouring
                    molecules of liquids, though these molecules will not enter the ordinary pores,
                    which are infinitely greater in size. <hi rend="italic">( Organog. Végét.</hi>
                    tome i. chap. 7, p. 89.) In his 10th plate he exhibits the appearance of these
                    spongiolcs in the radicles of <hi rend="italic">pandanus odoratissimus,</hi>
                    where they are better seen than in any other plant examined by him.</p>
                <p>The nature and qualities of the soil exert a great influence on the form and size
                    of roots. If the soil be free and pervious, the root often descends to a great
                    depth in the form of a tap-root; but if it encounter obstacles which oppose its
                    descent, it then continues short and divides into lateral branches. Roots also
                    extend into the portions of soil that are richest, while the barren parts are
                    nearly destitute of roots. <hi rend="italic">(Phys,</hi><hi rend="italic">des

                <p><hi rend="italic">Of the Structure of Buds.</hi></p>
                <p>In the preceding chapter we have described the larger and more permanent members
                    of the plant. We have now to delineate the form and structure of organs, whose
                    existence is of shorter duration, and which present a more diversified
                    character. They may all be said either directly or indirectly to originate from
                    buds, with which therefore we shall commence our descriptions.</p>
                <p>A bud, according ,to Gaertner, is an organic body, sprouting from the surface of
                    a plant. In the beginning it is distinct from the proper and permanent members
                    of the plant, but after some time becomes a part of it; or, if separated, is
                    capable, by the increase of its own proper substance, of growing into a new
                    plant, perfectly similar to its parent. <hi rend="italic">(De Fructib.
                    Plantar,</hi> p. 3.)</p>
                <p>Buds may in general be easily distinguished from seeds; but in some of the lower
                    tribes of vegetables the conformity in external appearance and internal
                    structure is said to be so great as to render this a matter of much
                    difficulty.</p>
                <p>Gaertner enumerates four species of buds, two of which are leafless, and two are
                    provided with leaves or scales. The first, <hi rend="italic">propago,</hi> is
                    ’the most, simple species of bud; it is leafless, and possesses different forms:
                    sometimes it is entirely naked, and sometimes is inclosed in a bark-like case:
                    it at length separates spontaneously from its parent, and is dispersed like a
                    s’ced.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193096731" xml:id="kp-eb0703-6731-0090"/>
                <p>The second species is termed <hi rend="italic">gongylus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >:</hi> it is described as a perfectly simple, leafless, somewhat globular and
                    solid bud, concealed within the bark of the parent plant, and never separating
                    spontaneously till the bark decays by age. It has a great affinity to the tuber
                    of roots, but differs from it in not being a proper member of the plant, and in
                    not possessing the principle of multiplication which resides in the tuber.</p>
                <p>The third species of bud is a compound germen, and named <hi rend="italic"
                    >bulbus.</hi> Its figure is somewhat globular: it is nearly leafless, and formed
                    of a very short keel· <hi rend="italic">(carina)</hi> and thick succulent
                    scales, and at length separates spontaneously from its parent. Of this species
                    there are two varieties, the one <hi rend="italic">solid,</hi> constructed of a
                    solid fleshy body, and having generally the rudiments of the new plant fixed
                    outwardly upon it; the other <hi rend="italic">coated,</hi> being formed of
                    several concentric scales, in the centre of which the young plant is
                    cherished.</p>
                <p>The last species of bud, and that which is strictly so named, Gaertner
                    denominates <hi rend="italic">gemma.</hi> This is a bud composed of a subulate
                    keel, and distinct herbaceous leaflets: it resembles a branch in miniature, and
                    never separates spontaneously from its parent. It is named an <hi rend="italic"
                    >eye</hi><hi rend="italic">(oculus)</hi> when it puts forth flowers alone, or
                    flowers and leaves together; and simply a <hi rend="italic">gem (gemma)</hi>
                    when it is unfolded into leaves alone.</p>
                <p>Of these several species, the last, <hi rend="italic">gemma,</hi> is generally
                    considered as alone entitled to the appellation of a true bud by those who
                    consider scales and leaves as essential to its constitution; but this
                    definition, says Gaertner, would exclude even bulbs, and it is better to derive
                    our idea <hi rend="italic">of a</hi> bud from a general agreement in properties,
                    and particularly from similarity of origin in formation and evolution, than from
                    the ever-varying condition of external form. The two former species of buds
                    occur in the lower tribes of vegetables; the two latter are observed on the
                    stems and branches, and roots of various plants. On the present occasion we
                    shall notice the latter only.</p>
                <p>That variety of bud which is called a <hi rend="italic">bulb,</hi> and which
                    springs from, or is variously attached to, the roots of many plants, has already
                    been stated to exhibit considerable difference in structuré. It is sometimes
                    constructed of several thick scales or leaves enveloping each other, and is
                    sometimes formed of a more continuous and solid substance. To the first
                    description belongs the bulbous substance of the lily and tulip. Grew has given
                    a section of the latter, made in the month of September. It displays the
                    tunicated structure of the bulb, at the base and in the centre of which the
                    young flower, destined to appear in the following spring, is observed. (See his
                    <hi rend="italic">Anatomy of Plants,</hi> table 63.) Of the tunicated variety,
                    the common onion affords also a good example. The coats that compose its bulb
                    are to be regarded as fleshy leaves, and the true root, according to Du Hamel,
                    is the fleshy plate that supports the bulb, from which the rootlets spring. The
                    common potato affords an example of the solid bulb, on whose surface numerous
                    buds, all capable of producing entire plants, are seen. Botanists enumerate a
                    great many other varieties of bulbs, for which we must refer to their writings;
                    and to the works of Malpighi and Du Hamel for the anatomy of many of them.</p>
                <p>The true bud of the stem and branch was distinguished by the ancients into two
                    kinds, according as it produced either a leaf or a flower, and to it they
                    assigned different names. į <hi rend="italic superscript"> t(</hi><hi

                    and this,he distinguishes from the flower-bud, “<hi rend="italic">nam</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">gemma propriè fioris</hi><hi rend="italic">est.”</hi> By Grew the
                    term <hi rend="italic">germen,</hi> and by Malpighi the word <hi rend="italic"
                    >gemtna,</hi> is employéd’ to denote each variety of bud. By Linnaeus the term
                    <hi rend="italic">germen</hi> is used to denote, not the bud of a branch, but
                    the rudiment of a seed; and not the rudiment of the seed only, but the organ
                    also that contains it. The wordgem. <hi rend="italic">ma</hi> he uses to denote
                    a bud. Gaertner adopts the word <hi rend="italic">germen</hi> in a generic
                    sense, to express every species of bud; and, with Malpighi and Linnaeus, employs
                    the term <hi rend="italic">gemma</hi> as indicative of that species now under
                    consideration. This, therefore, as the most generally received appellation, we
                    shall in future employ.</p>
                <p>During summer, says Du Hamel, buds are gradually formed in the axils of the
                    leaves, viz. in the angle which the petiole forms with the branch. They are at
                    first exceedingly minute; are seen in winter chiefly on the young branches,
                    sometimes on the larger ones, and more rarely on the trunk. They exhibit
                    different forms, according to the kind of tree that bears them, and are attached
                    to it by ā very short pedicle. Their position on the branch was considered·* by
                    Μ. Bonnet to be reducible to five classes; sometimes they are situated on
                    opposite sides of the branch, but placed alternately, and sometimes they are
                    placed exactly opposite to each other. In other instances they form a kind of
                    ring round the branch. Sometimes they have a spiral disposition, and at others
                    constitute a sort of double spiral around the branch. In those cases where the
                    buds stand opposite on the branch, the extremity of the branch is frequently
                    terminated by three buds; but where the buds are only alternate, the young
                    branch is commonly terminated by a single bud. In the pine the true buds are
                    placed, not in the axils of the leaves, but at .the extremity of the branch
                    alone. Some buds stand out a considerable distance, from the branch; others are
                    placed in close contact with it; and these varieties occur sometimes on the same
                    branch in regard to the buds that issue from its sides and extremity. The shape
                    of buds is also very various—some being long and pointed, others short and
                    round; some again are hairy, others smooth; some very small, and others large.

                <p>Beside these varieties in position and form, which serve to distinguish the buds
                    of different genera and species,' there are also many sorts of buds to be
                    observed on the same tree, whose characters are discoverable by their form.
                    Those which are pointed usually produce leaves and branches, and from those
                    which are large and rounder commonly proceed flowers. The former are named leaf
                    or wood buds <hi rend="italic">(gemmae foliiferae),</hi> the latter flower or
                    fruit buds <hi rend="italic">(gemmae floriferae)</hi>: others which possess both
                    leaves and flowers have been called mixed buds <hi rend="italic">(gemmae
                    mixtae).</hi> In some trees, as those of the apple and pear, two varieties of
                    wood-buds occur, one of which is small, produces only a small bunch of leaves,
                    and in the end becomes a fruit-bud; the other is larger, and gives origin to a
                    branch.</p>
                <p>As the rudiments of the flower appear in the bulb of roots the season before they
                    are destined to bloom, so&lt; those of the leaf and the flower are
                    distinguishable at the same period in the bud of the branch. They are to be
                    perceived, says Du Hamel, in autumn, and continue to grow even during winter,
                    appearing to be clandestinely formed in that season, when the movements of the
                    sap seem to be suspended; and are thus prepared to shoot forth on the return of
                    spring. It is, however, only in perennial plants that these phenomena are
                    observed. Annual plants do not produce buds, and even those whose roots survive
                    the fall of the stem produce buds only on their roots. <hi rend="italic"

                <p>Climate appears to exert the greatest influence on the* formation and evolution
                    of buds. In cold regions, asweļ <pb break="no" facs="nls:193096744"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0703-6744-0091"/>have just observed, the budis formed many months
                    before 'it is destined to shoot into a leaf or branch; but in warmer regions
                    scarcely any interval occurs between the periods of formation and evolution. The
                    buds, in such climates, are said to unfold themselves immediately from the bark
                    into branches, without having remained in the. form of buds for any length of
                    time. Sometimes, in the milder seasons of our own climate, the evolution of buds
                    rapidly succeeds to their formation, and the vegetative process with us emulates
                    the productive powers of more favoured climes. In some examples, however, the
                    specific characters of particular plants overcome these general tendencies of
                    climate; and thus hot climates are said to possess some bud-bearing plants, and
                    in colder climates there are a few shrubs which are said never to bud.
                    (Willdenow’s <hi rend="italic">Principles of Botany,</hi> p. 273.) It seems,
                    however, more correct to consider all plants as bearing buds, from which the
                    branches, the leaves, and the flowers, successively proceed; and to say that in
                    warm climates in general no suspension of the vegetative process occurs, as in
                    cold ones, and no marked interval is observed, therefore, between the formation
                    and evolution of buds. The few exceptions that occur respectively in warm and
                    cold climates must be considered in reference to the specific characters of the
                    individual plants. The process by which buds are actually formed has been called
                    <hi rend="italic">Gemmation</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Gemmifi-cation.</hi></p>
                <p>Having made these few general remarks on the nature and formation of buds, we
                    have next to exhibit a few examples of their structure and evolution, confining
                    ourselves at present to a description of those which produce either branches or
                    leaves. The mature bud consists of two parts; one that forms the new branch or
                    leaf, and in the language of botanists may be termed <hi rend="italic"
                    >persistent</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> the other serving only a temporary
                    purpose, and falling when that purpose is accomplished. To the former may
                    properly be applied the term <hi rend="italic">germ</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >gem,</hi> and the latter, from its office, may be called <hi rend="italic"
                    >hybernaculum.</hi> In its leading characters the bud bears a near analogy to
                    the more perfect seed, for the germ very exactly resembles the plume; and the
                    hybernaculum, as we shall see, in structure, office, and duration, approaches
                    near to certain cotyledons.</p>
                <p>The leaves or scales which constitute the hybernaculum, and which in future we
                    shall denominate the <hi rend="italic">hybernacular leaves,</hi> vary much in
                    number, size, and figure, in different buds. Even in the same bud the inner ones
                    are thinner, and much more tender and succulent, than the outer, and are
                    besmeared with, a viscid humour which intimately unites them; while the outer
                    ones are commonly hard, hairy, and of a sealytexture. Like the cotyledonous
                    leaves of seeds, those of the hybernacle sometimes grow for a certain time with
                    the germ, and fall successively at periods more or less distant: they are also
                    not less distinct in figure from those of the germ, than the leaves of the
                    cotyledon are from those of the plume. This arises from the peculiarity in the
                    distribution of their vessels, which do not spring from one common central
                    trunk, as in ordinary leaves, but are derived from several distinct fasciculi at
                    the base, like those of the cotyledonous leaf, as seen in that of the gourd, d’,
                    fig. 13, Plate XXXIX. According to. the manner in which they are disposed or
                    folded up in the bud, botanists have assigned them different names, for an
                    account of which we must refer to their writings. In the opinion of Du Hamel,
                    they all derive their origin from the inner layer of the bark, of which they
                    seen^to be only a prolongation. <hi rend="italic">(Phys, des Arb.</hi></p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">germ</hi> of the bud, which is contained within and
                    protected by these enveloping leaves, is composed of one or more leaves
                    generally folded and curled, but in some instances open and expanded. At first;
                    they are. very small, and their form is indistinct, so that the pedicle alone is
                    distinctly visible; from which branch off tire vessels that form the middle rib,
                    and are afterwards expanded to construct the lobes of the leaf. From the figuré
                    which the germ possesses before its expansion being like that of a keel, its
                    vascular portion at this period has been named <hi rend="italic">carina,</hi>
                    and its softer part <hi rend="italic">medulla</hi> or pith.</p>
                <p>With respect to the particular portion of the branch from which the germ
                    internally derives its origin, opinions have much varied. Some have held that it
                    proceeded from the pith alone; others from the first circle of vessels that
                    immediately surrounds the pith; others from the tender wood alone; and others
                    from the pith, the wood, and the bark conjointly. Grew held this latter opinion.
                    <hi rend="italic">(Anat. of Plants,</hi> p. 28.) Malpighi describes the germ as
                    a tender, ligneous substance, formed of vessels and cellular tissue, and
                    surrounded by its proper cortical texture. <hi rend="italic">(Anat.
                    Plantar,</hi> p. 45.) According to Du Hamel, it originates from the ligneous
                    texture and the pith <hi rend="italic">(Phys, des</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Arbres,</hi> tome i. p. 103); and Hill considered it to spring from the first
                    circle of vessels alone, but not to carry with it any portion of the pith.</p>
                <p>As every germ is composed of the cortical and ligneous textures, it may be said
                    to originate in part from both, as all these writers seem to admit. Sometimes
                    also the pith of the germ is continuous with that of the <hi rend="subscript">
                    ι</hi> branch; but in other instances no such connection subsists, and there is
                    nothing in the character of the pith of the trunk that renders it at all
                    essential to the constitution of the germ. That in many instances, also, the
                    germ springs from the first circle of vessels, is most certain; but it is not
                    less certain that buds spring from trees long after this first circle of vessels
                    has lost its vegetative power, or has been entirely destroyed.</p>
                <p>In the oak Malpighi describes the entire bud as consisting of many scales
                    enveloping each other, and forming an oval body. When evolution commences, these
                    open and expand, and in part fall; but two generally remain and protect the
                    springing germ for a long time. In fig. 15, Plate XL., is represented one of the
                    hybernacular leaves <hi rend="italic">d</hi> of the oak-bud, at the base of
                    which the germ <hi rend="italic">e</hi> is placed. The leaf <hi rend="italic"
                    >d</hi> is described as possessing an oblong form, and is very evidently
                    vascular; the germ is exceedingly small, and is represented as possessing at
                    this period only one fasciculus of vessels. By degrees three fasciculi become
                    apparent, which are continued through the germ, and form three pointed
                    extremities, as in fig. 16. These parts augment, and the vascular fasciculi
                    separate, so as to produce successively the appearances in fig. 17 and 18. At
                    length the small Curled leaf/ fig. 19, rising between the two hybernacular
                    leaves <hi rend="italic">g g,</hi> is seen to resemble the plume of the seed,
                    and to possess a form altogether different from the enveloping leaves, which in
                    appearance resemble more the cotyledonous leaves of certain seeds. In fig. 20 is
                    given a vertical section of the germ, considerably magnified, in which <hi
                    rend="italic">h</hi> denotes the pith that occupies the centre: it is inclosed
                    by vascular fasciculi, <hi rend="italic">i,</hi> that send off through the bark
                    ramifications to the several little processes that compose the serrated border
                    of the leaf. <hi rend="italic">(Anat. Plantar,</hi> tab. 10 and 14.)</p>
                <p>But the method of nature in the evolution of buds, continues Malpighi, is not
                    always the same; for the hybema-cular leaves do not always waste and fall as
                    those of the germ increase. On the contrary, in many trees, these leaves,
                    especially those about the base of the bud, losing <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193096757" xml:id="kp-eb0703-6757-0092"/>their primary figure, assume
                    new forms, and are converted into the permanent leaves with which the branch is
                    adorned. Examples of this sort occur in laurel, in the apple-tree, the
                    almond-tree, and many others. In other instances, as in the rose, the permanent
                    leaves seem to be generated out of those of the hybernacle, from the apex of
                    which they emerge; and gradually the latter is changed into a sort of petiole,
                    to the sides of which two slender appendages, the remains of the former
                    hybernacular leaf, adhere. Similar transformations are said to occur in many
                    otìier plants.</p>
                <p>The buds, such as they have been described, pullulate variously from the sides of
                    stems and branches, and always above the insertion of the fallen leaves; but
                    they spring also from their extremities, and produce the annual elongation of
                    the branch or stem. The manner in which this takes place, and the appearance
                    which the parts exhibit, have been well illustrated by the observations and
                    dissections of Μ. du Hamel. In the evolution of the seed, the plume, as we have
                    seen, rises above the earth, and produces the stem, which puts forth leaves.
                    When these leaves fall in autumn, the stem continues, and is terminated by one
                    or more buds. The roots, as already remarked, do not increase in length but at
                    their extremity, and therefore never elongate after the smallest portion of
                    their extremity has been cut off. It is not the same with branches; for the
                    newly formed part of the young shoot actually elongates, especially at its
                    extremity, where it is most succulent and tender,—less in the parts lower down,
                    where it is harder,—and in its more ligneous parts not at all; as Du Hamel, by
                    very simple and decisive experiments, ascertained. <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Phys,</hi><hi rend="italic">des Arbres,</hi> tome ii. p. 14.)</p>
                <p>Tire appearance, structure, and evolution of a bud, at the extremity of a branch
                    of the horse-chesnut tree, are given by the same ingenious author, whose
                    candour, ability, and success in the prosecution of these curious researches
                    render him worthy to rank by the side of Malpighi and Grew. In fig 1, Plate
                    XLI., is represented part of the annual shoot of this tree, terminated by its
                    appropriate bud, formed in autumn, and which is the commencement of the next
                    year’s shoot. In fig. 2 a vertical section of the same bud is exhibited, in
                    which the number and disposition of the hybernacular leaves that envelope and
                    protect the germ in the centre are displayed. In the stem of the shoot the
                    letter <hi rend="italic">a</hi> denotes the pith, which is surrounded by the
                    wood <hi rend="italic">b b,</hi> and this again is covered by the bark <hi
                    rend="italic">cc.</hi> In fig. 3 is represented a section of part of the bud
                    detached from the woody part of the shoot, and a little magnified, to show that
                    the leaves of the <hi rend="italic">hy-bernaculum</hi> take their origin from
                    the inner portion of the bark.</p>
                <p>Proceeding next to the interior part of the bud, Du Hamel represents it as
                    composed of numerous small leaves (fig. 4), which are more and more minute as we
                    proceed inward, and are covered with fine hairs. In fig. 5 is a branch-bud of
                    the peach, as seen in February, after all the enveloping scales have been
                    removed. It is composed of greenish filaments, ranged nearly as they appear in
                    the figure. When some of these filaments were detached and viewed with the
                    microscope, they appeared toothed at the edges, as in fig. 6, and were covered
                    with hairs. All these filaments were afterwards detached in order to disclose, a
                    small body lodged within them, and which appeared to consist of two small
                    leaflets, folded and toothed at their edges, but not covered with hairs. It is
                    represented in fig. 7. -It occupied the centre of the shoot, and seemed to be
                    connected with the pith.</p>
                <p>In the next figure, 8, is represented the bud of the horse-chesnut in the state
                    of evolution. The letters <hi rend="italic">d d</hi> indicate the scales of the

                    a second bud. A vertical section of the same bud is shown in fig. 9, from which
                    all the sealyenvelopes have been removed It exhibits an entire shoot of one
                    year’s growth attached to part of one of two years. From <hi rend="italic"

                    germ <hi rend="italic">k</hi> in the centre, and the lateral leaves as in the

                    which marks the extent of the annual shoot, the pith is green and succulent, and
                    at <hi rend="italic">p p</hi> it is seen to be prolonged into the lateral
                    branches. The wood of two years’ growth, from <hi rend="italic">m</hi> to <hi
                    rend="italic">i,</hi> is white, and forms a continuous tube round the pith,
                    except where the branches go off. It is covered by another layer so thin as to
                    be scarcely visible, but which will in the end become wood; and this layer is
                    covered by the bark. The ligneous layer of the annual shoot appears to be a
                    prolongation of the new layer of the older one, and, like it, possesses at first
                    an herbaceous character. ∙ The cortical layer also seems to be a prolongation of
                    that of the older shoot. As to the pith, though in both shoots it is continuous,
                    it is to be observed that that of the older branch is white and dry, and that of
                    the young shoot green and succulent. <hi rend="italic">(Phys,</hi><hi

                <p>It is thus by the formation of a bud in autumn at the extremity of a branch, and
                    the shooting and growth of that bud in the succeeding spring and summer, that
                    the trunk of the tree and its branches are annually elongated. During the first
                    season the shoot retains in great part its herbaceous characters, but in the
                    second it becomes perfectly ligneous. In the axils of the permanent leaves of
                    the young shoot, the rudiments of new buds become apparent, even in the' first
                    season.</p>
                <p>It was before remarked that trees receive an additional circular layer every
                    year, and that from these new layers buds successively spring, so that the
                    earliest branches may contain as many ligneous layers as the trunk, and those of
                    later formation a smaller number, according to the year in which they shot
                    forth, and the circle of wood from which they sprang. Combining this growth in
                    breadth with that in length, it will appear, says Du Hamel, that at the base and
                    centre of a tree 100 years old there is wood of 100 years of age; whilst at the
                    exterior part of the same tree, and at the extremities of its branches, there is
                    wood of one year’s age only. As the latitudinal growth was before illustrated by
                    a diagram, a similar mode may be adopted to explain the longitudinal
                    increase.</p>
                <p>Let fig. 10, Plate XLI., represent in <hi rend="italic">q r</hi> the ligneous
                    portion of a tree that has proceeded from a seed in spring, and is observed in
                    autumn. The following spring a second shoot proceeds from the bud <hi
                    rend="italic">r,</hi> which reaches as far as <hi rend="italic">s';</hi> but at
                    the same time there is a second ligneous layer formed on the first shoot <hi
                    rend="italic">q r,</hi> by which its thickness is proportionally augmented; and
                    at the end of the second year the tree has the form and extent of the unshaded
                    portion of the figure <hi rend="italic">q s.</hi> The next spring the bud 5
                    opens and sends out another shoot to <hi rend="italic">t</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi> and ligneous layers are added as before to the two preceding shoots; and
                    thus the tree is extended from <hi rend="italic">q</hi> to <hi rend="italic"
                    >t.</hi> The fourth year the same processes are repeated, and the tree extends
                    from <hi rend="italic">q</hi> to <hi rend="italic">w</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi> and each annual shoot, from the base to the summit of the figure, is
                    seen to be composed successively of four, three, two, and lastly of one layer in
                    thickness. This figure, therefore, illustrates the mode in which trees increase
                    at the same time in height and breadth. The lig-neons<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193096770" xml:id="kp-eb0703-6770-0093"/> layers may be compared to a
                    series of cones which 'envelope each other, and which annually augment the
                    diameter of the tree by the two thicknesses of the layers. It shows also that
                    trees grow much more in height than in breadth, and that this growth is effected
                    by the successive formation and evolution of buds at the extremity of the stem,
                    precisely as the first shoot issues from the seed. <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Phys,</hi><hi rend="italic">des Arbres,</hi> tome ii. p. 50.)</p>
                <p>It is well known that if a bud be taken from one plant and inserted beneath the
                    bark of a kindred species, it will grow, and retain in its new situation its
                    original qualities and habits; or some buds, if directly planted in the earth
                    and protected from too rapid exhalation, will produce a tree similar to the
                    parent. Hence some writers, as Dr Darwin, have considered each bud as an
                    individual plant, and that a tree, properly speaking, is a family or swarm of
                    buds, which annually produce as many new plants. The bulbs produced beneath the
                    soil by the tulip and many other plants resemble, in this respect, the buds
                    produced in the atmosphere. Vegetables, therefore, are propagated by two
                    methods—the oviparous, as by seeds, and the viviparous, as by buds and bulbs;
                    and the individual plants, whether springing from seeds or from buds and bulbs,
                    are all annual productions. The reproduction of plants, therefore, appears to be
                    of two kinds, solitary and sexual; the former being accomplished by buds and
                    bulbs, the latter by seeds, or through the agency of sexual intercourse.</p>

                <p><hi rend="italic">Of the Structure of Leaves.</hi></p>
                <p>These are organs of great importance in the vegetable economy: they are not
                    however universal; for the <hi rend="italic">Cactus,</hi> some species of <hi
                    rend="italic">Sćhoenus,</hi> and a few other plants, are considered to be
                    destitute of leaves. Like other parts of the plant, they may be regarded with
                    reference either to their external form or their internal structure. The former
                    view belongs more especially to the botanist, who has very happily applied his
                    descriptive language to portray the almost infinite diversity of figure, size,
                    and character, which the leaves of different species of vegetables exhibit. On
                    this branch of the subject we shall but lightly touch, recalling simply to
                    notice the leading distinctions of the botanist, and such only of them as may
                    appear to be more immediately connected with the <hi rend="italic">structure
                    of</hi> these organs.</p>
                <p>The leaves <hi rend="italic">(folia)</hi> are distinguished and denominated
                    according as they are <hi rend="italic">simple</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >compound.</hi> Simple leaves are such as have only a single leaf on the stalk
                    or petiole that supports them, and where all the parts of the leaf are
                    continuous with one another. Compound leaves are those which are madc up of more
                    than one piece, or where the leaf is formed of parts or leaflets articulated
                    together. In regard to their place, situation, and insertion, leaves are said to
                    be <hi rend="italic">determinate.</hi> By the <hi rend="italic">place of</hi> a
                    leaf is meant the part of the plant to which it is attached. By <hi
                    rend="italic">situation</hi> is understood the disposition of the leaves on the
                    stem or branch, which corresponds to that of the buds. By <hi rend="italic"
                    >insertion</hi> is expressed the mode of connection between the leaf and the
                    stem or branch; and the <hi rend="italic">direction</hi> of leaves is considered
                    to bear reference to the position in which they stand to the stem.</p>
                <p>_ The foregoing observations apply to leaves considered in connection with other
                    members: when we regard them <hi rend="superscript"> sin</hi> g <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 1</hi> y, we remark several parts which are common to almost
                    all leaves, and to which particular names have, been assigned. The part at which
                    the leaf springs from the branch or <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> stem, ^whether,
                    directly, or by means, pf a petiole, is called the <hi rend="italic">base,</hi>
                    and the point opposed to this, the <hi rend="italic">apex,</hi> of the leaf. The
                    expanded portion is termed <hi rend="italic">limbus,</hi> which has its two
                    sides, faces, or surfaces, as they are indifferently called. The prominent lines
                    that appear on these surfaces were named riblets <hi rend="italic"
                    >(costuloe)</hi> by Malpighi, and have very improperly been called <hi
                    rend="italic">nerves</hi> by most writers; for the term <hi rend="italic"
                    >nerve</hi> denotes an organ of a totally different nature, of which not even
                    the existence has yet been demonstrated in any part of the vegetable system. To
                    the line that circumscribes and forms the boundary of the leaf the term <hi
                    rend="italic">margin</hi> or border is commonly applied.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">figure</hi> of leaves exhibits the greatest diversity, to
                    express which various terms are employed. Their <hi rend="italic">margin</hi>
                    also is either entire or variously fissured, notched, or toothed. Their <hi
                    rend="italic">surfaces</hi> are naked and smooth, or clothed with hairs and
                    studded with excrescences; sometimes they are plain and flat, at others furrowed
                    or plaited; and in all these particulars the opposite surfaces present also the
                    greatest diversity. In <hi rend="italic">size,</hi> leaves exhibit the most
                    remarkable differences; and, with respect to <hi rend="italic">substance,</hi>
                    some are exceedingly thin, and have a membranous texture, others very thick, and
                    of a fleshy nature. As to <hi rend="italic">colour,</hi> they exhibit every
                    shade of green, from the most gay and lively to the deepest and most obscure. In
                    some the tint of colour approaches to blue, in others to red; and previous to
                    their fall they all undergo those changes of colour which produce the
                    diversified beauties of an autumnal scene. The period, however, at which this
                    occurs is very different. Some leaves fall early, before the summer has passed,
                    and are termed <hi rend="italic">caducous</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> others
                    retain their place till autumn, and then fall, and are named <hi rend="italic"
                    >deciduous;</hi> others continue beyond the summer, and are styled <hi
                    rend="italic">persistent;</hi> and others, which have a still longer duration,
                    are denominated <hi rend="italic">perennial.</hi></p>
                <p>In the preceding section on the structure of buds we exhibited the form and
                    appearance of leaves in the earlier periods of their existence. They were shown
                    to possess a very minute size, and to be curiously folded up and concealed
                    within their various scales or coverings, which effectually protected them from
                    the rigour of the winter season. The germ of the bud, from which the leaves
                    originate, was stated to be composed of the same elementary parts as the stem
                    and branch from which it sprang. From the ligneous ring in the annual shoot it
                    derived its vessels, which, after having traversed obliquely the cortical
                    layers, were prolonged into the pedicle by which it remained attached to the
                    branch. This pedicle was continued to form the keel of the germ in its folded
                    state; and, in its more expanded forms, to constitute the vascular riblets of
                    the leaf. By subsequent growth it gradually extends and elongates, becomes more
                    ligneous, and is formed at length into the slender stalk or petiole by which the
                    leaf remains attached to the branch. <hi rend="italic">(Phys,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">des Arbres,</hi> tome i. p. 123.)</p>
                <p>The vessels which are given off from the branch to form the petiole are not
                    collected into one bundle, but constitute several fasciculi, which are disposed
                    in different ways about the centre of the stalk. In some stalks there are three,
                    in others five or six, and in others seven or more fasciculi, all placed, says
                    Grew, either in an angular or circular posture, and at a greater or less
                    distance from the centre. This centre is generally occupied by a pith, but
                    sometimes it is hollow or tubular. In table 49 of the <hi rend="italic">Anatomy
                    of Plants,</hi> several transverse sections of the petioles of the leaves of
                    different plants are given, exhibiting the different modes in which these
                    fasciculi are dispersed through the cellular tissue that forms the greater
                    portion of. the jstalk. In every instance the .pith and bark <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193096783" xml:id="kp-eb0703-6783-0094"/>of these petioles are
                    represented as forming one continuous substance. In some plants the fasciculi of
                    vessels that come off from the stem are not collected into a cylindrical figure,
                    but, after being variously implicated with each other, expand at once into a
                    leaf. Such leaves rise by a broad base, and, from being destitute of a petiole,
                    are termed <hi rend="italic">sessile,</hi> forming often a sort of sheath about
                    the stem, of which several varieties are enumerated by botanists.</p>
                <p>The petiole, as it springs from the branch, may be compared to a small stem,
                    which at the basis of the leaf expands into numerous branches. Frequently it is
                    continued through the centre of the leaf, forming its middle rib, and giving off
                    in its course numerous branches. At other times, on reaching the base of the
                    leaf, jt separates at once into three or more equal portions, which form as many
                    distinct leaves or parts of a leaf, supported by. their respective petioles. The
                    structure of the petiole is the same as that of the branch, being composed of
                    the ligneous and cortical textures, in which sap and “proper vessels” are
                    discoverable; and the whole is invested by the cuticle.</p>
                <p>Where the petiole terminates, the proper or expanded portion of the leaf <hi
                    rend="italic">(limbus')</hi> commences, the figure of which is determined by the
                    number and distribution of the vessels. These vessels divide and ramify in
                    various modes, till at their termination they form a finely reticulated
                    structure. In many recent leaves this structure is very visible; but when the
                    softer parts are removed by spontaneous decomposition, the vascular system of
                    the leaf remains nearly entire, and its extent and form are then more completely
                    exposed. In fig. 11, Plate XLI., this distribution of the vessels is exhibited
                    in <hi rend="italic">a</hi> leaf of holly. From the central fasciculus branches
                    are everywhere given off, which further subdivide, and form smaller
                    ramifications, that terminate at length in a minutely reticulated structure.
                    Around the margin of the leaf the vessels are continued, and at certain parts
                    are prolonged into the thorns that bound the circumference of this leaf.</p>
                <p>In this and similar instances the vessels appear to be ramified out of greater
                    into less; but, as already observed, this does not appear to be really the fact,
                    the vessels being all of the same size everywhere in the leaf, and all continued
                    through it, like so many distinct tubes. This structure Grew represents in a
                    highly magnified view of the leaf of borage, in table 50 of his work; part of
                    which is represented, on a reduced scale, in fig. 13, Plate XLI., designed to
                    show that the ramified vessels <hi rend="italic">o</hi> are all clusters of
                    tubes of the same size, which, though they separate continually, and come into
                    contact, are never produced or ramified one out of another. Neither do they ever
                    inosculate or anastomose with each other, until, according to Grew, they come to
                    their final distribution.</p>
                <p>The vessels thus distributed through the leaf belong chiefly to the order of
                    spiral vessels, as was shown by Grew in the leaf of the vine and many others;
                    and, from the observations of Malpighi, Darwin, and Knight, already related, it
                    appears that “proper vessels” are everywhere associated with them. It would
                    seem, from the observations of Darwin, that these two orders of vessels
                    communicate in the leaf by continuation of canal, as the arteries and veins do
                    in animal bodies. In the stalk he considered them to be disposed in two
                    concentric rings, the inner one of which carried out the sap to the leaves, and
                    by the outer one it was returned to the bark. <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Phytologia,</hi> p. 43 and 58.) In branches of the apple and horse-chesnut, Mr
                    Knight also observed coloured fluids to rise through the vascular fasciculi in
                    the petiole of the leaf. These fasciculi were surrounded by others free from
                    colour, which conveyed a different fluid, and, on being traced down the stalk,

                    the wood. The <hi rend="italic">returning</hi> vessels he describes as being
                    situated parallel to and surrounding those which carry up the sap. <hi

                <p>Beside the vascular system which, by its ramifica-∣ tions, forms the skeleton of
                    die leaf, there is another ∣ structure that requires to be noticed. We have seen
                    that' the vessels, in their ultimate distribution, form a net-work more or less
                    fine and minute in different leaves; so that a great number of intervascular
                    spaces are produced. These spaces or areae, says Malpighi, are occupied by
                    cellular tissue, which springs from the vessels themselves, and seems to depend
                    from them; and by its means the thickness of the leaf is formed. In the recent
                    part of the borage leaf, represented in fig. 13, Plate XLI., this cellular
                    structure, occupying the reticulated spaces formed by the vessels, is observed;
                    but it is most clearly seen in thick leaves, when the cuticle has been removed,
                    and the vessels in part dissected away. The cells or utricles which form this
                    <hi rend="italic">parenchyma,</hi> as it has been called, are of different
                    figures, and are mutually contiguous; they are composed of a membrane formed
                    into the shape of a little vesicle or bladder, from the middle of each of which
                    a little vascular production issues; they are all connected with each other, and
                    with the vascular system of the leaf. In fig. 12, Plate XLI., this cellular
                    structure is represented in the leaf of <hi rend="italic">Cactus</hi> by
                    Malpighi, in which the oblong cells arc described as proceeding from the central
                    vessel, and mutually communicating with each other. <hi rend="italic">(Anat.
                    Plantar,</hi> p. 52.) A similar idea of the formation of the cells seems to have
                    been entertained by De Saussure. In different leaves the cells possess very
                    different sizes and forms. In the experiments of Μ. de la Baisse, they are said
                    to have become tinged by coloured fluids conveyed from the vessels. Whether they
                    communicate with each other is not known; but analogy, derived from other
                    similar structures, would lead us to suppose that they communicate only with
                    vessels, as seems to be the case in the cotyledonous leaf of the seed.</p>
                <p>Μ. de Candolle describes the leaf as consisting of a' superior and inferior face,
                    between which is an interme- ’ diate part, of very various thickness in
                    different leaves, toļ which he gives the name of <hi rend="italic"
                    >mesophylle,</hi> answering to the parenchyma of preceding writers. The leaf is
                    formed, he says, by ramifications of the vessels, and by cellular tissue, which
                    fills up the intervals of these ramifications. It probably comprehends two
                    systems; one which, receiving the ascending sap, brings it into contact with the
                    air, and permits the exhalation of its superfluous parts; the other a system
                    which receives the elaborated sap, and reconducts it to the stem, whare it
                    serves for nutrition. Physiological phenomena, he adds, prove the existence of
                    these two functions in leaves; but anatomy has not yet distinguished the organs
                    by which they are accomplished. <hi rend="italic">(Organog. Végét.</hi> tome i.
                    p. 271, 273.) It has been before observed that Μ. de Candolle follows Kieser in
                    regarding the alleged spaces between the cells, called intercellular canals, as
                    the organs in which the vegetable fluids are conveyed; but the facts and
                    arguments already stated establish, we think, with sufficient certainty, that,
                    in the wood, the bark, and leaves, the sap is conveyed by appropriate vessels.
                    The consistence of the leaf, continues Μ. de Candolle, depends much on the
                    relative proportions of the cells and vessels that compose it. When the vessels
                    are numerous, the cellular tissue is small in quantity, and the leaf is fibrous,
                    firm, and thin; when, again, the vessels are few and distant, then <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193096796" xml:id="kp-eb0703-6796-0095"/> the cells are
                    more abundant, and the leaf is softer and 'more fleshy.</p>
                <p>s The two surfaces of this organ often differ much in appearance and structure.
                    On the upper surface the vessels are commonly but little prominent; it is
                    therefore smoother, has but few hairs or pores, and is sometimes destitute of
                    them. The lower surface, on the other hand, presents the vessels more prominent,
                    and is furnished with hairs and pores much more abundantly. These differences
                    are more particularly observed in the leaves of trees: in those of herbs the two
                    surfaces more nearly resemble each other. In aquatic plants, though the upper
                    surface is smooth and green, and the under one pale and rough, yet the former
                    only, as being exposed to the atmosphere, is furnished with pores. It is to be
                    remarked, however, that whether the two surfaces exhibit an aspect either very
                    different or very similar, each seems destined to enjoy a special function.
                    Hence, if the upper surface be turned downward, and the lower one upward, the
                    leaf tends to resume its natural position; and if it be retained by force in a
                    position not natural to it, it dies. <hi rend="italic">(Organog. Végét.</hi>

                <p>In the cellular tissue of herbaceous sterns, and of all leaves, are contained
                    small globules, which by the action of light are rendered green, and bestow on
                    the plant its verdure. In the elongated cells of <hi rend="italic">Conferva
                    reticulata</hi> they are represented by Kieser as small green globules. (See

                    and have been named <hi rend="italic">chlorophylle</hi> by chemists; but as a

                <p>In the substance of the leaf Malpighi describes small bags or follicles as
                    existing between the cells and vessels, and which, in most leaves, yield a
                    peculiar humour. They spring from the vessels, have a roundish or oblong form,
                    and the lip that bounds their orifice is often furnished with hairs. This
                    orifice points towards the upper surface of the leaf, or that which regards the
                    heavens. In different leaves the follicles have different forms; and they afford
                    a secretion which, adhering to the contiguous parts of the leaf, renders them
                    shining. They are numerous in the leaf of the fig, lemon, orange, &amp;c.; and
                    are rendered more visible as the cellular tissue of the leaf wastes and dries.

                <p>There are other small leaves called <hi rend="italic">stipules</hi> and <hi

                <p>The whole structure of vessels and cells that compose the leaf is covered by a

                    Flowers.</hi></p>
                <p>The flower is that assemblage of organs which, by the mutual action they exert on
                    each other, give origin to h'uits and seeds. All the parts hitherto described
                    contribute to the growth and perfection of the individual plant, and have been
                    named the Nutritive or Conservative ⅛ystem; but the organs composing the flower
                    are destined to continue the race, and from thence have been denominated the
                    Reproductive Organs. In a limited sense the bud, produced by the conservative
                    system, may be deemed a reproductive organ, since new individuals may
                    successively be propagated from it; but after a certain period, plants thus
                    produced seem to degenerate, and become incapable of producing fruit.
                    Reproduction without fecundation presents no organic apparatus which is proper
                    to it; but sexual reproduction, or that accomplished by fecundation, exhibits
                    numerous and varied organs, which merit all our attention, not only because they
                    exercise the principal functions of vegetation, but because, from the constancy
                    and symmetry of their forms in the same species, though varied infinitely in
                    different species, they afford the base on which Classification rests.</p>
                <p>In relation to the organs of reproduction, vegetables, as before remarked, have
                    been divided into two great classes: 1<hi rend="italic">st,</hi> such as have
                    flowers visible to the naked eye, and in which the sexual organs are distinct;
                    2<hi rend="italic">dly,</hi> such as have flo'wers (if there be any) which can
                    be rendered visible only by the microscope, and in which the sexual organs are
                    not distinct. The former class, named phaenogamous or phanerogamous, comprises
                    all exogenous, and the greater part of endogenous plants; the latter, or
                    cryptogamous division, comprehends some endogenous vascular plants, and all
                    those which possess a simple cellular structure. At present we shall treat only
                    of the first or flowering class.</p>
                <p>The flower is essentially constituted by the presence of one of the two sexual
                    organs, or of two re-united by a common support, with or without the exterior
                    envelope destined to protect them. In some instances the flower bears only a
                    male or female organ, and is then named unisexual; but more commonly these
                    organs are present in the same flower, and it is then called hermaphrodite.</p>
                <p>This unisexual flower, again, is simply male or female, according as it possesses
                    either stamens only, or pistil only. In some instances, though the same plant
                    bears both male and female organs, it is not hermaphrodite, since these organs
                    occur in different flowers; in others, again, the male and female flowers exist
                    only in different plants. Lastly, we sometimes find both male, female, and
                    hermaphrodite flowers mingled together, either on the same or on different
                    footstalks. The distinctions founded on this separation, re-union, and mixture
                    of the sexual organs, have served as the basis of certain classes in theLinnaean
                    system.</p>
                <p>•Sometimes the male or female organs alone, protected in a small scale,
                    constitute the flower; but in general they are surrounded and protected by
                    others, named the <hi rend="italic">corolla</hi> and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >calix.'</hi> All these parts are commonly borne on a stalk called the <hi
                    rend="italic">peduncle,</hi> which, expanding at its extremity, forms the <hi
                    rend="italic">receptacle,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">torus</hi> as it has been
                    called, upon which all the parts above mentioned are supported. In fig. 1, Plate
                    XLII., the sexual parts which constitute a perfect flower are exhibited. The
                    letter <hi rend="italic">a</hi> denotes the corolla, formed, in this flower, of
                    six leaves called petals; <hi rend="italic">b</hi> the stamens or male organs,
                    which surround the pistil or female organ <hi rend="italic">c</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> and <hi rend="italic">d</hi> indicates the peduncle of the
                    flower. In the next figure (fig. 2) the corolla has been removed, and the parts
                    within are then more clearly seen. They now consist only of the sexual organs
                    supported on the peduncle, and at their base are embraced by the calix <hi
                    rend="italic">e.</hi> The pistil, in the centre, is composed of three parts,
                    viz. the ovarium <hi rend="italic">f,</hi> the style <hi rend="italic">g,</hi>
                    and the stigma <hi rend="italic">h</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> while each
                    stamen consists only of two parts, the filament <hi rend="italic">i,</hi> and
                    the anther <hi rend="italic">h,</hi> which latter contains the prolific matter
                    named <hi rend="italic">pollen.</hi> Such an assemblage of organs constitutes' a
                    perfect or complete flower; but it often happens, that in flowers where the
                    sexual organs are present, one or other of the accessory organs is wanting;
                    thus, in the tulip only one of the protecting envelopes is present, and
                    botanists differ as to the name it should bear. Linnaeus considers . it as a
                    corolla, because it is coloured like ordinary petals; but Μ. Jussieu regards it
                    as a calix, from its analogy in structure arid use to that organ.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193096809" xml:id="kp-eb0703-6809-0096"/>
                <p>The flower is sometimes attached immediately to the branch by its base, when it
                    is termed <hi rend="italic">sessile;</hi> but in general it is borne on a
                    footstalk or peduncle. This peduncle of the flower, like the petiole of the
                    leaf, is sometimes single and sometimes ramified: in the latter case its
                    divisions take the name of pedicels.</p>
                <p>Around the base of the flower we often meet with small leaves which, in size,
                    colour, form, and consistence, differ from ordinary leaves. They are called <hi
                    rend="italic">bracteae,</hi> and from the axils they form with the stem or
                    branch the flower-buds often spring. From thus being the birth-place of the
                    flower, which draws from them a great part of the nutrient matter, the bracteae
                    are smaller and more membranous than the ordinary leaves of the plant, and
                    partake often of the colour of the flower. They must, however,be regarded as
                    leaves, modified by the circumstances in which they grow, as is demonstrated by
                    the fact, that examples frequently occur in which bracteae are changed into true
                    leaves. (De Candolle, <hi rend="italic">Or-ganog. Végét.</hi> tome i. p. 438-9.)
                    When these bracteae approximate so as to form a sort of envelope around the
                    flower, they take the name of <hi rend="italic">involucrum,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">—</hi> when this envelope becomes a sheath, it is named <hi
                    rend="italic">spatha,</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> in the <hi rend="italic"

                    modifications, to which botanists attach different names. The bracteae
                    approximate more or less in character to the calix, in proportion as they are
                    coloured or exhibit the form of whorls; and the transition of the organs of
                    vegetation into those of florescence is so gradual, says Μ. de Candolle, that
                    the more we study it, the better do we comprehend that unity of composition
                    which constitutes the base of philosophic organography. <hi rend="italic">(

                <p>The flower, as well as the leaf, originates from a bud, and in many respects the
                    buds of flowers resemble those of leaves. They are covered and protected in the
                    same manner, but they are generally larger, and have a more rounded form. They
                    consist of two parts, the gem or eye <hi rend="italic">(oculus),</hi> as it is
                    sometimes called, and the <hi rend="italic">hybernaculum,</hi> or protecting
                    envelope. In some trees they spring from the extremity of particular branches;
                    in others from the branches in common with the leaf-buds; and in others from the
                    axils of the leaves. In fig. 3, Plate XLII., is a portion of the branch of the
                    peach-tree, bearing two flower-buds <hi rend="italic">11,</hi> between which the

                    flower many months before it is destined to bloom. <hi rend="italic">(Anat. of
                    Plants,</hi> tables 63, 64.) Of this fact Du Hamel has also given several
                    examples. In fig. 4 is a longitudinal section of the flower-bud of the
                    peach-tree, made in the month of February, to show the complete formation of the
                    stamens and pistils within the surrounding envelope of the bud. In fig. 5 is
                    another representation of a similar bud, from which the enveloping scales have
                    been removed: it displays the calix, which at this period completely envelopes
                    the other parts of the flower. When the leaflets of the calix are separated, as
                    is done in fig. 6, then the stamens and pistils are fully disclosed: the petals
                    also of this flower were visible, but at this period were very small. Even the
                    anthers were found to contain a fine dust, but no rudiment of the future embryo
                    could be detected in the ovary. In the flowerbud of the pear, examined in
                    February, the parts of fructification were also visible, but indistinct; a month
                    later, all the parts were more advanced, and the stamens, petals, and pistils
                    were distinct, and towards the end of March, even the rudiments of future seeds
                    were visible in the base of the pistil. <hi rend="italic">(Phys,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">des Arbres,</hi> tome i. p. 200.) Thus it appears that through the
                    winter season the several parts of the flower are clandestinely formed, though
                    still extremely minute. As they enlarge, their position within the bud is very
                    various in different species: they gradually expand and form the perfect flower,
                    whose several parts we have next briefly to describe.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">peduncle</hi> of the flower, by which all the other parts
                    are connected with the stem or branch, is frequently single, but often divides
                    into several parts or <hi rend="italic">pedicels,</hi> as they are named, each
                    of which supports one or more flowers. The modes in which the flowers are
                    disposed on the pedicels have received different names from botanists, and to
                    the general circumstance they assign the term <hi rend="italic"
                    >inflorescence.</hi> The peduncle in structure resembles the stalk of the leaf,
                    being formed, like it, of the several common textures. In size, in length, and
                    other external characters, it exhibits all the varieties already noticed in the
                    petiole of the leaf.</p>
                <p>At the extremity of the peduncle is placed the flowercup or <hi rend="italic"
                    >calix,</hi> which has very different forms, and has received in consequence
                    different names. Even in its most common forms it exhibits great variety. It is
                    sometimes composed of a single piece, and has a tubular form; in others, of many
                    pieces called <hi rend="italic">sepals (sepala),</hi> which vary in number,
                    position, and size, and for an account of which we must refer to the writers on
                    botany. In some instances this organ falls when the fruit has set; in others it
                    continues till the fruit is mature; and in others the fruit is formed within it,
                    to which it becomes a permanent covering, and exercises the office of pericarp.
                    The colour of the calix is commonly green, but sometimes partly red, or white,
                    or yellow. In some flowers it is entirely wanting. From the dissections of Grew
                    and Malpighi it appears, like the leaves, to be constructed of a cuticle, a
                    pretty thick cellular tissue, and of vessels, all of which exist in the
                    peduncle, and are derived from the common textures of the plant.</p>
                <p>Above the calix, the <hi rend="italic">corolla,</hi> the chief ornament of
                    flowers, is borne. It is inclosed by the calix, but surrounds the interior parts
                    of the flower, and is of every colour but green. It consists of one piece, or of
                    several: these pieces are called <hi rend="italic">petals,</hi> and according to
                    the number of these pieces the corolla is variously denominated. The
                    monopetalous corolla, or that composed of one piece, is also distinguished into
                    several parts, expressive of form, position, or quality; and in the polypetalous
                    variety, which consists of several pieces, each petal has its claw <hi
                    rend="italic">(unguis)</hi> situated at the base, and by which it is attached to
                    the calix or receptacle, and its expanded part <hi rend="italic">(lamina),</hi>
                    which is of very various figure, size, and colour. At the base of the petal a
                    tuft of hairs is often observed, and its surface is frequently covered with a
                    fine down, or sometimes with jointed hairs bearing 'globulets, as occurs on
                    leaves. With regard to structure, Malpighi describes it as composed of the same
                    textures as the common leaf, as is distinctly visible in the thicker varieties
                    of it. Grew showed it to possess <hi rend="italic">spiral</hi> vessels,—a proof,
                    as Du Hamel observes, that it is partly derived from the ligneous texture, since
                    such vessels are not found in the bark. The odour these organs possess leads to
                    the belief that they contain also a peculiar juice. <hi rend="italic"

                <p>The organ next to be noticed is the nectary <hi rend="italic">(nectariumf</hi> In
                    a strict sense this term designates any excretory gland which is situated on any

                    and very similar in all known plants. In <hi rend="italic">regular</hi> 'flowers
                    the nectaries may occur on all the organs, symmetrically disposed. Their most
                    common seat is the receptacle or torus. In some flowers, however, they are
                    seated on the ovary, in others on the corolla, calix, stamens, &amp;c. They have
                    the form sometimes of distinct tubercles; but in different plants they exhibit
                    various other forms. In <hi rend="italic">irregular</hi> flowers the nectaries
                    are not thus symmetrically placed, but are found on one part and not on the
                    corresponding part of the same flower. Sometimes they supply the place of
                    abortive stamens or pistils. The juice they secrete is greedily sought by
                    insects. <hi rend="italic">( Organog. Végét.</hi> tome i. p∙ 535.)</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Art.</hi> II.— <hi rend="italic">Of the Sexual Organs of
                    Flowers.</hi></p>
                <p>Having exhibited this general view of the flower, we must now describe somewhat
                    more particularly the forms, characters, and structure of its most important
                    parts—the sexual organs.</p>
                <p>The male organ or stamen consists, as before remarked, of two parts,—the anther,
                    with the pollen it contains, and the filament on which the anther is borne. The
                    filament, though a common, is not an essential part, and is sometimes wanting,
                    when the stamen is said to be sessile: the perfection of the stamen resides,
                    therefore, in the anther, and especially in the pollen it contains.</p>
                <p>In regard to number, length, position, direction, <hi rend="italic">&amp;c.</hi>
                    the stamens exhibit great diversity in different plants. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >number of</hi> stamens in each flower varies from one to twenty or more; and on
                    this number, progressively increasing in flowers truly hermaphrodite, the first
                    ten classes in the Linnaean system are founded. In <hi rend="italic"
                    >length,</hi> the stamens are equal or unequal; and this disproportion is
                    sometimes symmetrical and sometimes not,—peculiarities which give rise to the
                    formation of other classes in the Linnaean arrangement, <hi rend="italic">Vx
                    position,</hi> the stamens are some? times opposed to the divisions of the
                    petals, and sometimes they alternate with them. Sometimes, from being shorter,
                    the stamens are wholly included within the corolla: in other instances they
                    protrude beyond it. Their <hi rend="italic">direction</hi> is erect, pendent, or
                    horizontal; and their summit is variously inclined to or reflected from the
                    centre of the flower, <hi rend="smallcaps">a</hi> In some flowers the stamens
                    are united by their filaments; in others by their anthers; and in others they
                    are joined to and almost confounded with the pistil, giving origin, in their
                    various módes and degrees of union, to the formation of other classes in the
                    Linnaean system.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">filament</hi> which bears the anther is most commonly
                    straight and filiform: sometimes, however, it is flattened or wedge-shaped, or
                    awl-shaped. It is sometimes as small as a hair, sometimes large and flat like a
                    petal, and its summit is either pointed or obtuse. To the summit the anther is
                    commonly attached; but in some flowers this part is prolonged beyond the
                    attachment of the anther. In structure, the filament resembles the corolla; and
                    it often happens that these organs, are transformed into one another. Thus the
                    rose, in its wild state, has only five petals and many stamens; but by
                    cultivation the stamens gradually degenerate into petals, and the flower becomes
                    sterile. Malpighi describes the filaments as originating from the ligneous
                    texture, being formed of spiral vessels and elongated cells; and as they are
                    sometimes produced from elongated floral leaves (petals), they must necessarily,

                    same parts. <hi rend="italic">(Anat. Plantar.</hi></p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">anther</hi> is that essential <hi rend="subscript"> l</hi>
                    part of the stamen that contains the fecundating matter. It is borne on the
                    summit of the filament, and is generally formed of two small membranous sacs,
                    attached immediately to each other, or ’ united by an intermediate connecting
                    body. Anthers,’ therefore, are generally bilocular; but in some plants there is
                    only one sac or loculament, and in others as many as four. The sacs are either
                    round, oval, or elongated: each sac commonly exhibits on one of its sides a
                    longitudinal furrow: this side is properly called the face, and the part opposed
                    to it the back, of the anther. The anther is attached to the summit of the
                    filament, sometimes by its face, sometimes by its back, &amp;c. In form, the
                    anther is subject to great variety; and the two sacs that compose .a bilocular
                    anther are joined together in very different modes. In discharging the pollen
                    the sacs open in different ways in different genera of plants, most commonly by
                    the longitudinal furrow that runs along the face of the anther; but in some
                    plants the opening, or dehiscence as it is called, is through two small holes or
                    pores situated at the summit of the two sacs; and sometimes it is by a sort of
                    little valves in some one or more parts of the anther. As the filaments of the
                    stamens sometimes cohere, so likewise do the anthers, in a manner to form a sort
                    of tube. In other plants the stamens, instead of being free or simply united
                    together, coalesce so as to make one body with the pistil. The colour of the
                    anther is often yellow, orange, violet, white, &amp;c., but never green or truly
                    blue.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">pollen,</hi> contained in the anthers, consists of numerous
                    regularly figured small particles, which possess a very different figure, size,
                    and colour in different plants. Many of their forms and sizes are delineated by
                    Grew in table 58 of his <hi rend="italic">Anatomy of Plants.</hi> In fig. 9, A,
                    Plate XLII., copied from Grew, one of the filaments, bearing its anther, as it
                    appears when detached from the pistil of the mallow, fig. 8, is exhibited. The
                    particles of pollen are considerably magnified, and still more highly in fig. 9,
                    B. In fig. 10 of the same plate, severalrepresentations of the forms of the
                    pollen, as given by Du Hamel, are also exhibited. The number of these particles
                    in each anther extends, it is said, from a few hundreds to many thousands. In
                    the cell of the anther they are said to float in a viscous liquid, and to be
                    nowhere attached to its sides, though it is probable they once were; and Μ.
                    Turpin has even designated a salient point in each cell as the part which
                    produced the pollen. (De Candolle’s <hi rend="italic">Organog. Végét.</hi> tome
                    i. p. 465.)</p>
                <p>In some flowers the pollen consists of transparent grains; in others they are of
                    à white, purple, blue or brown, and more frequently of a yellow colour. Their
                    surface is either smooth or rough, or covered sometimes with a viscous matter.
                    When examined under the microscope at the period of maturity, they may be seen
                    to burst, and yield a fluid, in which, according to Du Hamel, small granules are
                    seen to float. This fluid is described as being thin, or viscid, or oily. If a
                    grain of pollen be thrown on the surface of water, it may be seen to swell
                    insensibly, and finally burst. At this moment a minute quantity of fluid matter
                    escapes, which spreads on the surface of the water, and forms a sort of slight
                    cloudiness. It is to this liquid matter that the fecundating property of the
                    pollen has been attributed. <hi rend="italic">(Elemens</hi><hi rend="italic">de
                    Botanique,</hi> par Achille Richard, p. 199.) This fluid is said by Hedwig to be
                    discharged at once on the bursting of its containing capsule; but Koelreuter
                    considers it to be slowly transmitted through pores in the side, or hairs on the
                    surface of the capsule.</p>
                <p>Instead of being formed of distinct granules, the pollem is sometimes met with in
                    a solid mass. In many genera of the families <hi rend="italic">Apocyneae</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">0rehidece,fla</hi> the pollen contained in one sac is
                    united into one body, having the form of the containing sac; in other instances
                    it forms smaller <pb break="no" facs="nls:193096835"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0703-6835-0098"/>masses, and these are united by a sort of elastic
                    net-work; 'while in others the masses are granular. The pollen is very
                    inflammable, and in many plants its odour is said, to bear a striking
                    resemblance to the corresponding secretion in animals. <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Elemens</hi><hi rend="italic">de Botanique,</hi> par Achille Richard, p.
                    200.)</p>
                <p>It has lately been said by some,.that the particles contained in the grains of
                    pollen exhibit spontaneous motions, like the spermatic animalcules of animals;
                    others ascribe these motions to causes distinct from life; and others, though
                    they allow similar motions to be exhibited by the molecules of unorganized
                    matter, maintain, nevertheless, that in the granules of pollen they are
                    independent of physical causes, and resemble the less rapid motions of some of
                    the simplest animalcules of infusions.</p>
                <p>The parts of the flower hitherto described are constructed, says Malpighi, with
                    reference to the female organs, in which the seed, the last result sought by
                    nature, is curiously formed and matured. This organ, called the pistil <hi
                    rend="italic">(pistillum),</hi> consists of three parts. These are represented
                    in the pistil of the almond, fig. 11, Plate XLII., where the letter <hi
                    rend="italic">p</hi> indicates the stigma, <hi rend="italic">q</hi> the style,
                    and <hi rend="italic">r</hi> the ovary. To this latter organ Malpighi and Grew
                    gave the name of <hi rend="italic">uterus,</hi> Linnaeus that of <hi
                    rend="italic">germen,</hi> and Gaertner that of <hi rend="italic">ovarium.</hi>
                    In different plants the pistil exhibits great variety in form, size, number, and
                    mode of attachment; upon which many of the <hi rend="italic">orders</hi> in the
                    Linnaean system are founded.</p>
                <p>~ The <hi rend="italic">ovarium</hi> occupies almost always the inferior part of
                    the pistil. It is the organ in which the seed is produced. When cut open it
                    exhibits one or more cavities or cells, in which are contained the rudiments of
                    the seeds or ovula; and it is in it that the change of the ovula into perfect
                    seeds is accomplished. Its form is various, but most commonly ovoidal. It is
                    seated commonly on the receptacle, together with the stamens; but frequently it
                    is placed below the flower. Its cavity consists sometimes only of one cell or
                    loculament, in which one or more ovula are found. More frequently there are two
                    or more cells containing ovula: these are sometimes disposed in regular series,
                    sometimes they are scattered and without order, and sometimes they are united to
                    one another in a globular form. When these ovula are fecundated they become
                    seeds; but in some plants a certain number are constantly abortive.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">style</hi> is a prolongation from the summit of the
                    ovarium, and supports the stigma. It is commonly so situate in the flower as to
                    be surrounded by the stamens; but sometimes it is entirely wanting, and the
                    stigma is then said to be sessile. The ovary in different plants may be
                    surmounted by one or more styles; while in other plants there is but one style
                    to many ovaries. Most frequently the style occupies the summit of the ovary, but
                    sometimes it springs from its side, and very rarely from its base. The forms of
                    the style are numerous :—the most common is the filiform; but frequently it is
                    thick, angulated, or club-shaped. It is commonly a hollow tube which
                    communicates with the ovary: there is usually but one style to one ovary, but
                    sometimes more. In some instances the pistils correspond in number with the
                    loculaments into which the pvary is divided; in other instances every seed that
                    is formed has its distinct pistil, while in other examples only one pistil is
                    allotted to a great number of seeds. In some flowers the style is so connected
                    with the ovary that it falls after fecundation; in others it continues after
                    that event, and forms a part of the future fruit.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">stigma,</hi> which forms the summit of the pistil,
                    sometimes terminates the style by an open mouth. Sometimes it appears like a
                    small bud; in other instances it is variously divided or forked. Sometimes it is
                    smooth; and' is sometimes covered with hairs. The number of stigmata is
                    determined by that, of the styles, or divisions of the styles, and therefore
                    varies from one to six or more in different plants. Sometimes the stigma is
                    attached to the summit of the ovary, without the intervention of a style; but
                    most frequently it is seated on the summit of the style, or occasionally
                    attached to its side, or to that of the ovary.</p>
                <p>In consistence, the stigma is thick and fleshy, or thin and membranous, or formed
                    of small glandular bodies. In form, it varies exceedingly; and its surface is
                    smooth, pubescent, or plumons, &amp;c. In structure, it is ordinarily glandular;
                    and at the period of fecundation its surface is rendered moist by a peculiar
                    viscous matter. When the pollen falls on this matter, its grains burst, and the
                    granules, called by some <hi rend="italic">favilloe,</hi> are supposed to be
                    absorbed by the spongioles seated in this part, and conveyed to the ovula by the
                    vessels which form the pistillary cord, and thus accomplish their fecundation.
                    Μ. Bulliard is said to have traced coloured liquors, previously absorbed by the
                    stigma, along the vessels in the interior of the style, to the ovula contained
                    in the cells of the ovary. (De Candolle, tome i. p. 480.) In many plants,
                    however, either from the structure of the pistil, the nature of the pollen, or
                    the circumstances in which fecundation is effected, the pollen seems never to
                    come into contact with the ovula.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Section</hi> IV.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Of the Structure of Fruits and Formation of Seeds.</hi></p>
                <p>In the preceding section we described the structure of the flower antecedent to
                    fructification: we have now to exhibit as concisely as possible the changes of
                    form it undergoes after that event, and particularly as it regards the
                    production of the seed.</p>
                <p>After fecundation has been effected, the calix, corolla, stamens, and even style
                    of the pistil, commonly fade and fall; the ovary alone remains, and undergoes
                    very different changes of form in different plants. In the latter periods of its
                    enlargement it is usually called <hi rend="italic">pericarp (peri-carpìum),</hi>
                    a term which is understood by botanists to apply also in certain cases to the
                    calix, the corolla, or any other apparatus of organs that serves as a support
                    and defence to the seed.</p>
                <p>In its early state the ovary is described by Gaertner as possessing at first a
                    simple cellular structure, which at a <hi rend="superscript"> i</hi> later
                    period takes the form of distinct cavities or loculaments. Within these cavities
                    minute globules are after-’ wards seen, which are the rudiments of future seeds.
                    According to Mr R. Brown, the ovulum, in the unimpregnated ovarium, is attached
                    only to a part of the membrane that lines its cell or internal cavity; but soon
                    after fecundation in some cases, and still oftener during the growth of the
                    seed, this membrane coheres so closely with the proper coat of the seed as to be
                    no longer distinguishable or separable from it. In the ovarium of plants of the
                    family <hi rend="italic">Composite</hi> he observed two slender filiform cords,
                    which, originating from the base of the ovulum or its short footstalk, ran up,
                    and were more or less connected with the parietes of the ovarium, until they
                    united at the top of its cavity immediately under the style, between which and
                    the ovulum a connection was then formed. In some species of this family, as in
                    <hi rend="italic">tussilago odorata,</hi> these çords were easily separable from
                    the ovarium, and could be removed entire along with the ovulum. These cords he
                    regards rather as vessels conveying' nutrient matter, than as organs by which
                    impregnation was accomplished. A similar appearance of vascular cords con <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193096848" xml:id="kp-eb0703-6848-0099"/>necting the ovulum
                    with the style was observed in the family <hi rend="italic">Brunonia;</hi> and
                    in certain liliaceous plants the bulblike seeds, which separate from the plant
                    before the em-biyo becomes visible, are supplied with distinct spiral vessels,
                    which, entering at the umbilicus, ramify regularly through the fleshy mass, and
                    appear to have a relation to the central cavity, where the embryo is afterwards
                    formed. <hi rend="italic">(Linnaean Trans,</hi> vol. xii.) Thus, then, the
                    ovulum in the plant, like the egg in the animal, is, to a certain extent,
                    produced without fecundation; but if that function be not performed, it soon
                    degenerates and wastes. The progressive changes that occur in the ovary itself,
                    and in its contained <hi rend="italic">ovuia,</hi> subsequent to impregnation,
                    have been observed by Malpighi in several plants, whose observations, as they
                    relate to the almond, we shall briefly detail.</p>
                <p>In fig. 11, Plate XLII., is represented the pistil of the almond, as it appears
                    soon after fecundation, in which the ovary <hi rend="italic">r</hi> is seen to
                    be somewhat enlarged, and has an oval form. In the next figure (fig. 12) a
                    longitudinal section of the same pistil is exhibited, exposing the cavity of the
                    ovary <hi rend="italic">s,</hi> within which a small vesicle, <hi rend="italic"
                    >t,</hi> is placed. As the ovary (fig. 13) enlarges, it becomes rounder, and its
                    style is contorted and diminished in size. If in this stage it be laid open, as
                    in fig. 14, its vessels, which in the peduncle <hi rend="italic">w</hi> are
                    disposed cylindrically, are observed to be dilated at the place of the calix <hi
                    rend="italic">x,</hi> and to give off branches to the ovary itself, and to the
                    shell <hi rend="italic">y</hi> that now begins to be formed within it. In the
                    centre, the ovulum <hi rend="italic">z</hi> is now seen to be much increased in
                    size. All the parts continue to augment; the ovary (fig. 15) becomes rounder,
                    and the appearance of the style is obliterated. On exposing its cavity in this
                    stage, as in fig. 16, the ovulum <hi rend="italic">a!</hi> in the centre is
                    observed to be much increased, and the outer layer <hi rend="italic">b'</hi> of
                    the shelly covering that invests it now begins to harden. Such are the changes
                    of form and structure exhibited by the ovary: we have next to trace more
                    minutely those of the ovulum that is produced within it.</p>
                <p>The earlier appearances of this body have been exhibited in fig. 12 and 14. When
                    removed from its seat, a few days after fecundation has been accomplished, and
                    viewed by a moderately magnifying power, it exhibits the form and appearance
                    represented in fig. 17. Externally it is covered by a vascular tunic, c <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi>, derived from the inner coat of the ovarium, a part
                    of which coat adheres to it at <hi rend="italic">d’.</hi> If in this stage the
                    ovulum be laid open by a vertical section, as in fig. 18, it is seen to be
                    composed of two tunics or sacs, one within the other; the inner one is filled
                    with a cellular tissue, that contains a transparent juice. To this inner tunic
                    the term <hi rend="italic">chorion</hi> may be properly applied.</p>
                <p>At a period a little later, when the ovulum is examined, a tubular body (e', fig.
                    19) is observed to extend through the chorion or tunic last mentioned. Shortly
                    after, this tube expands at its apex, and is found to contain a small vesicle.
                    In fig. 20, which represents a section of the entire ovulum, the outer tunic,
                    the chorion, and the tube <hi rend="italic">f</hi> ’ expanded at its apex, are
                    exhibited. To it the appellation of <hi rend="italic">amnios</hi> may be given;
                    for it is the organ in which the <hi rend="italic">embryo,</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">corculum,</hi> as at this early period it has been called, is
                    first seen to emerge. Through several successive days the expanded portion of
                    this tube enlarges and forms a sort of sac, which is filled with cellular
                    tissue, and the summit of which, says Malpighi, the embryo is seen to occupy. In
                    fig. 21 this amnios is separated from the other tunics, and at its summit the
                    embryo <hi rend="italic">g</hi> ’ is observed. If removed from its seat, the
                    embryo presents the appearance <hi rend="italic">h'</hi> (fig. 22), and when
                    expanded, as m fig. 22, <hi rend="italic">i',</hi> is seen to consist of a body
                    and two little wings.</p>
                <p>Having thus viewed the several parts of which the ovulum is composed in their
                    separate state, let us next observe them in connection, and trace the series of
                    appearances they exhibit, and the effects they produce on each other. In figure
                    23 is given a vertical section of the entire ovulum in a more advanced state.
                    The outer coat <hi rend="italic">k'</hi> still envelopes the others; the embryo
                    <hi rend="italic">l’</hi> occupies the summit of the amnios <hi rend="italic"
                    >m',</hi> whose lower part, still tubular, is continued through the chorion <hi
                    rend="italic">n'.</hi> In the next figure (fig. 24), from which the outer coat
                    has been removed, the embryo <hi rend="italic">o'</hi> and the amnios <hi
                    rend="italic">p'</hi> are represented as enlarged; but the chorion <hi
                    rend="italic">q</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> r</hi> is partly exhausted of
                    its juice, and has fallen down in a collapsed state. At this period the embryo,
                    when separated from the amnios, has the form <hi rend="italic">r',</hi> fig. 25,
                    and in its expanded state is represented by the letter √ of the same figure. The
                    bulk of the embryo <hi rend="italic">t’,</hi> fig. 26, continually augments, and
                    encroaches on the capacity of the two tunics <hi rend="italic">v', x</hi> ’ <hi
                    rend="italic">,</hi> whose forms are constantly changing; and from being
                    successively emptied of their juices, with which the embryo becomes filled, they
                    are gradually pressed downward. At last the embryo <hi rend="italic">y</hi> ’
                    <hi rend="italic">,</hi> fig. 27, is so much augmented as to fill the cavity of
                    the outer tunic; and by this time the amnios and chorion, exhausted of their
                    fluids, exhibit the shrunk and corrugated forms in which they appear at the
                    bottom of the figure. According to this representation, the outer tunic <hi
                    rend="italic">k',</hi> fig. 23, derived from the ovary itself, and the fine
                    membrane that immediately invests the embryo, form the only permanent coverings
                    of the mature ovum or seed; for during the progress of formation the chorion and
                    amnios (which are successively produced subsequent to fecundation) are again
                    obliterated by the growth of the contained embryo. Malpighi describes the
                    process of formation in many other seeds to be nearly similar; for his
                    descriptions of which we must refer the reader to his work <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Anat. Plantar,</hi> p. 71).</p>
                <p>In the above descriptions of Malpighi, the several parts seem to be clearly
                    exhibited, except in one important particular, namely, the situation and course
                    of the <hi rend="italic">umbilical cord.</hi> In almost every instance he
                    designates the tube, which we have represented as the first form of the amnios,
                    as the umbilical vessel <hi rend="italic">(vasculum umbilicale),</hi> which the
                    subsequent appearances it exhibits show to be erroneous. In the descriptions of
                    Grew this deficiency in the representations of Malpighi is supplied. He has
                    particularly observed the formation of the seed in the aprico, which in many
                    respects resembles that of the almond; and we shall subjoin an abridged account
                    of his observations.</p>
                <p>In this fruit the pericarp that envelopes the seed is seen, in its mature state,
                    to be composed of the pulpy part <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> fig. 28, within which
                    is the osseous envelope <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> and at the centre the kernel
                    or true seed <hi rend="italic">c.</hi> At an early period both the pulp and
                    stone are observed to consist of cellular tissue; and through the stone the
                    vessels passing from the peduncle are continued. At the base of the figure the
                    letter <hi rend="italic">d</hi> denotes one fasciculus of vessels continued
                    through the stone, and turning inward, where it reaches the apex of the seed.
                    These vessels form the umbilical cord or seed-branch of Grew, while the
                    fasciculus <hi rend="italic">e</hi> that runs on the opposite side is continued
                    to the flower. In fig. 29 a vertical section of the ovulum, as well as pericarp,
                    is exhibited as it appears at a very early period; in which <hi rend="italic"
                    >f</hi> denotes the pulp, <hi rend="italic">g</hi> the stone through which the
                    umbilical vessels pass and enter the outer tunic <hi rend="italic">h</hi> of the
                    ovulum, around which they make a ring. Within this tunic is another, <hi
                    rend="italic">i,</hi> filled with cellular tissue; and through its axis a small
                    tube extends, at the apex of which the embryo <hi rend="italic">k</hi> is first
                    seen to emerge.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193096861" xml:id="kp-eb0703-6861-0100"/>
                <p>In fig. 30 these several parts of the ovulum are exhibited on a larger scale; the
                    letter <hi rend="italic">I</hi> denotes the outer tunic that immediately lines
                    the stone; <hi rend="italic">m</hi> the inner one, corresponding to the <hi
                    rend="italic">chorion</hi> of Malpighi; and <hi rend="italic">n</hi> the tube
                    answering to the <hi rend="italic">amnios of</hi> the same author. Through the
                    outer tunic Grew represents the umbilical vessels to pass and be continued to
                    the middle tunic, the cavity of which is occupied by large cells that contain a
                    pure lyitiph. At first this tunic is entire, but soon there appears in than a
                    hair, and is dilated at each extremity into an oval cavity that contains a pure
                    lymph. A few days after a soft node is seen to emerge in the upper cavity of
                    this tube. This node (o, fig. 31) is described to possess a conical figure, and
                    to be another tunic filled with very minute cells. It is at first entire, but
                    when about the size of a carraway-seed it becomes a little hollowed near its
                    apex, at which part the vessels enter and terminate in another very small node
                    (fig. 32), which is the first appearance of the embryo of the seed. This embryo,
                    when about one fifth part as big as a cheese-mite, begins to be distinguished by
                    a little fissure, which marks the division of the lobes, as in fig. 33. When the
                    lobes have increased, and are more fully formed, the node contracts at its base
                    (fig. 34), indicating the place of the umbilical cord, which subsequently
                    becomes the radicle of the seed. <hi rend="italic">(Anat. of Plants,</hi> p.

                <p>This description corresponds nearly with that of Malpighi, as far as regards the
                    situation and general form of the tunics, and the place in which the embryo is
                    seen first to emerge. It also displays the course of the vessels to form the
                    umbilical cord; but the growth of the embryo in this seed does not seem to
                    produce the obliteration of some of the tunics in the manner delineated by
                    Malpighi.</p>
                <p>An example of a different kind is observed in the pear. Its structure has been
                    described by Grew, and more minutely by Du Hamel. In its mature state it
                    consists of a pulpy matter, in the centre of which are five loculaments that
                    contain each two seeds. These appearances arc exhibited in the transverse
                    section, fig. 35; and in the longitudinal section, fig. 36, the seeds are
                    further shown to be attached by a small umbilical cord. The pulp of the fruit is
                    made up of a very fine cellular tissue, filled with the proper substance of the
                    fruit, and is everywhere furnished with vessels. Through this pulpy matter a
                    number of solid particles are met with, which are more particularly accumulated
                    at the top and about the core. They are formed of an assemblage of small
                    particles, of a stony consistence, with which a little knot of vessels (fig. 37)
                    is everywhere connected. In fig. 38 is a thin transverse slice, showing the
                    relative position of these stony particles, as indicated by the knots of vessels
                    with which they are associated. The stony matter is not observed at an early
                    period, but seems to be deposited from the juices in a more mature state.</p>
                <p>By long maceration in water the pulpy matter is dissolved, and the vascular
                    system is obtained separate. In the peduncle of the fruit fifteen principal
                    fasciculi of vessels arc contained. Ten of these are distributed to the seeds
                    and flower, and the five others are dispersed through the pulp. This vascular
                    structure is represented in fig. 39 after the removal of the pulpy part; the
                    larger vessels embrace the core, and, after variously ramifying, terminate in
                    the little vascular processes before described as connected with the stony
                    matter of the pulp. In fig. 40 is represented one of the loculaments of the
                    capsule, with the seed in it, receiving vessels from fasciculi continued from
                    the peduncle; and in fig. 41 an entire seed is represented, and also a section
                    of the same, in which the umbilical vessels that enter at the base are. shown,
                    as in other instances, to be continued beneath the tunic to the apex of the
                    seed. <hi rend="italic">(Phys,</hi><hi rend="italic">des Arbres,</hi> tome i. p.
                    242.)</p>
                <p>The last variety we shall notice in the formation of the seed is that of wheat
                    <hi rend="italic">(triticum),</hi> as given by Malpighi. In fig. 42 is
                    represented the pistil of the flower of this plant, consisting of the ovarium
                    <hi rend="italic">q,</hi> the two styles <hi rend="italic">r,</hi> and the
                    feathered parts that form the stigmata. Previous to fecundation, the ovarium is
                    found to contain a little vesicle, fig. 43, which is the rudiment of the future
                    ovulum. After fecundation the styles soon fall, and the ovarium acquires a more
                    pointed figure, as in fig. 44. If now it be opened, the little vesicle has
                    changed its appearance, and contains within it another smaller vesicle, <hi
                    rend="italic">u,</hi> fig. 45. The ovarium continues to alter its shape, and
                    assumes a more oblong form, ∙fig. 46, and the appearance of styles is now quite
                    obliterated. Gradually the little vesicle is formed into a small plantule,
                    convex anteriorly, fig. 47, but more hollowed within, fig. 48, and which is
                    situated at the base of the ovarium. The two portions thus described in figures
                    47 and 48 arc the minute germ and cotyledon of this seed, which are represented
                    in their appropriate place in fig. 49, in which the letter <hi rend="italic"
                    >x</hi> denotes the germ, resting in the concavity of the cotyledon; <hi
                    rend="italic">y</hi> the albumen that forms the chief bulk of the seed; and <hi
                    rend="italic">z</hi> the ovarium, which in this seed continues permanent, and
                    forms its outer tunic. <hi rend="italic">(Anat. Plantar,</hi> p. 73.)</p>

                    refers to the figures given by those authors as illustrative of them. The
                    liquor, however, in which the embryo is first seen, he confounds with the sac
                    that contains it, calling it the amnios; but the term amnios designates the
                    membrane or sac only, and not the fluid contained within it. Sometimes, he says,
                    there is no proper sac for this fluid, but it is contained in the chorion, or in
                    an appropriate cellular tissue. <hi rend="italic">(De</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    formation of the seed have likewise been observed by Mr Keith, whose account of
                    them agrees with that of Malpighi and Grew. <hi rend="italic">(System of
                    Physiological Botany,</hi> vol. ii. chap. 8.) Very recently, also, the same
                    subject has occupied the attention of several foreign writers, and particularly
                    of Μ. Mirbel, whose observations we shall briefly detail.</p>
                <p>According to Μ. Mirbel, little has been done to advance this part of physiology
                    since the days of Grew and Malpighi, till the late observations of Μ. Schmitz
                    and Mr R. Brown. The latter remarked that we ought not to judge of the structure
                    of the ovulum from that of the developed seed. Acting on this idea, Μ. Mirbel
                    applied himself to examine the ovarium, from the moment the ovulum begins to
                    appear, and followed its progressive changes of development in plants of the
                    same species. The ovulum at first he describes as a small pulpy excrescence of a
                    conical shape, attached to the containing cell, and which does not appear to
                    have any proper envelope or aperture of any kind. In plants whose ovaria produce
                    many seeds, the ovula exhibit different degrees of development, according as
                    they are nearer to or more distant from the vascular cords that supply
                    nutriment. Μ. Schmitz, it is said, first discovered in the apex of each ovulum a
                    small orifice or hole, which penetrates the two membranes or sacs, of which, at
                    this early period, the ovulum is composed. To these sacs, which are placed one
                    within the other, Μ. Mir-bel has given the names of <hi rend="italic"
                    >primine</hi> and <hi rend="italic">secondine.</hi> The orifices at their apex,
                    which at first form but one aperture <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> externally,
                    soon become more distinct from the enlargement of the parts within, and
                    gradually a third membrane is seen to protrude through them. No sooner has it
                    become visible in the form of a small pulp, than it begins, <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193096874" xml:id="kp-eb0703-6874-0101"/> in some species, to dilate
                    interiorly, so as to form a sac ' with very thin sides, which afterwards becomes
                    blended with the secondine: in other species it protrudes to a considerable
                    extent, and in a conical form, through the primine and secondine, which appear
                    to invest it as the cup of the acorn embraces the kernel. In this state it is
                    free at its apex, but is attached at its base to the secondine. To this sac the
                    name of <hi rend="italic">tercine</hi> has been given. These three tunics, it is
                    said, appear together as soon as the development of the ovulum begins; the
                    primine is never absent, and the same is probably the case with the tercine, nor
                    has he ever missed the secondine but in a very few instances.</p>
                <p>In addition to the three tunics or sacs just described, two others, named the <hi
                    rend="italic">quartine</hi> and <hi rend="italic">quintine,</hi> successively
                    appear. The former, says Μ. Mirbel, is not rare, but has escaped observation by
                    being confounded with the tercine, from which, however, it differs both in its
                    origin and mode of growth. On its first appearance it forms a cellular lining
                    over the inner surface of the cavity of the ovulum. By degrees it separates, and
                    continues attached only to the summit of that cavity. In this state it forms a
                    close sac, and so continues in the ovula of some plants; while in those of
                    others its cavity becomes filled with cellular tissue, and forms a pulpy
                    mass.</p>
                <p>The fifth envelope, or <hi rend="italic">quintine,</hi> is always developed
                    either within the tercine or quartine when they remain filled with cellular
                    tissue. It is first seen in the centre of the sac like a fine tube, and is
                    attached at one end to its summit, and at the other to its base. It begins to
                    enlarge at the summit, and the embryo is almost simultaneously visible in it. As
                    the enlargement proceeds downward, the quintine presses at all points on the sac
                    that surrounds it, so as often to push down and occupy the place of the tercine
                    or quartine. From the summit of the ovulum a very fine thread (Ze <hi
                    rend="italic">suspenseur)</hi> descends in the quintine, bearing at its
                    extremity a globule, which is the nascent embryo. This quintine, adds Μ. Mirbel,
                    answers to the vesicle called amnios by Malpighi.</p>
                <p>t The foregoing observations were made on the ovula of several plants, and in
                    their more important points will be seen to correspond nearly with the
                    descriptions of Malpighi and Grew. These latter authors have not so minutely
                    examined the ovulum and its envelopes antecedent to fecundation; but after that
                    event the chorion of Malpighi may be considered as answering to the tercine or
                    quartine of Mirbel; for in the centre of this chorion the tube e <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> (fig. 19, Plate XLII.) is seen to extend from the
                    summit to the base, as in the tercine of Mirbel. The subsequent expansion of
                    this tube at its summit (fig. 21), its gradual enlargement downwards, and the
                    appearance of the embryo at its apex as described to occur in the quintine of
                    Mirbel, are all exhibited in the amnios of Malpighi; as is also, in fig. 23, the
                    pressure which this amnios makes on the surrounding sac. In the representations
                    of these appearances given by Grew in figures 28 to 34 inclusive, Plate XLII., a
                    similar series of changes is exhibited; and in what relates to the vascular
                    connection of the ovum with the parent plant, he has anticipated most of the
                    observations of those who have followed him. Thus, in fig. 28, 29, Plate XLII.,
                    he exhibits the course the vessels take after quitting the peduncle, and shows
                    that they penetrate the several tunics to reach the point where the embryo, in
                    the form of a small globule (fig. 32), is first seen to emerge; and in fig. 33
                    and 34 of the same plate he delineates the thread by which it is suspended.</p>
                <p>According to Μ. Mirbel, the vessels which form the funiculus or cord enter the
                    ovulum at the point afterwards called <hi rend="italic">hilum</hi> in the mature
                    seed, and terminate at a point in the inner tunic or membrane, to which the term
                    <hi rend="italic">chalaza,</hi> or internal umbilicus, has been applied. This
                    point or chalaza in the inner tunic corresponds, he says, in the ovula of some
                    plants with that of the hilum in the outer; but sometimes the vessels after
                    their entrance are prolonged in the manner described by Grew, so that the place
                    of the chalaza is opposite to that of the hilum. Wherever the chalaza may be
                    situated, that part, Mirbel adds, is to be considered as the base of the seed.
