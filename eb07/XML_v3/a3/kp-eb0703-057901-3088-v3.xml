                    Army.</p></note> is “a collection of armed men obliged to obey one man.” This
                    definition, however, has little else than its brevity to recommend it. An army,
                    it is true, is “a collection of armed men,” and such a collection” is generally
                    “obliged to obey one man,” that is to say, it is commonly placed under the
                    exclusive control and direction of an individual chief or leader. But it does
                    not follow that “a collection of armed men obliged to obey one man” is the
                    distinguishing or principal characteristic of an army, since a gang of robbers
                    or banditti would equally answer this description. To be at all applicable,
                    therefore, the definition of army must be at once more comprehensive and more
                    precise; in other words, it must include the specification of those peculiar
                    circumstances or attributes, the aggregate of which constitutes the complex idea
                    sought to be resolved. Hence an army may, we think, be more accurately defined,
                    a certain portion of the community selected, raised, or assembled, for the
                    defence of the state, by means of conscription, voluntary enrolment, tenure of
                    military service, or otherwise; armed, disciplined, and organized, conformably
                    to a given system, which is considered best calculated for giving full
                    development and efficacy to its collective force; and commanded by a chief or
                    leader, with subordinate officers in regular gradation, to carry his orders into
                    effect, and move the living machine, thus constructed, as he shall think proper
                    to direct. It is an artificial or scientific combination of a great number of
                    powers, individually small or insignificant, so as, by their union and
                    concentration, to accomplish mighty and important deeds; a force which states
                    and nations create out of the elements of their strength, as mechanicians form
                    engines by taking advantage of and skilfully combining the action of the primary
                    mechanical powers; an instrument, in short, so contrived as, though originally
                    intended for the best, to be equally available for the worst purposes, being
                    alike fitted for defence or aggression, for protection or conquest, for
                    restraining and punishing the dishonest ambition of others, or affording the
                    means of gratifying our own. An army, therefore, may be considered a species of
                    movable engine, composed of a vast number of individual parts or powers, so
                    arranged and organized as not only to act in concert, but to exert their whole
                    aggregate force in any direction and upon any point which may be ordered or
                    required. At the present day this denomination is applied to any given number of
                    soldiers, consisting of artillery, infantry, and cavalry, of various
                    descriptions, all completely armed and provided with engineers, a train of
                    artillery, ammunition, magazines, commissariat, and other necessary adjuncts,
                    subject to the command of a general, having under him lieutenant-generals,
                    major-generals, brigadiergenerals, colonels, majors, captains, and
                    subalterns:<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>James’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Military Dictionary, wee</hi> Army.</p></note> And an army is now
                    composed of battalions or squadrons, regiments, brigades, divisions, and
                    sometimes corps d’armée; two or more battalions or squadrons forming a regiment,
                    two or more regiments a brigade, two or more brigades a division, and two or
                    more divisions a corps d’armée. So much for definition and description.</p>
                <p>Were we called upon to trace to its origin the history of war, we should find it
                    necessary to ascend through every form and gradation of society to the very
                    cradle of the human race. Admitted on all hands to be one of the greatest evils,
                    war is also, unhappily, one of the oldest. “II est triste d’imaginer,” says a
                    celebrated military writer, “que le premier art qu’aient inventé les hommes, ait
                    été celui de se nuire, et que, depuis le commencement des siècles, on ait
                    combiné plus de moyens pour détruire Thumanité que pour la rendre
                    heureuse.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    Tactique,</hi> par Guibert, vol. i. p. 59, <hi rend="italic">Disc. Prilim.</hi>
                    Paris, 1803.</p></note> This is a truth which cannot be disputed. The passions
                    of rivalry, jealousy, hatred, revenge, cupidity, thirst of power or ambition,
                    were born with the world; and these, in their turn, gave birth to war, which
                    again produced the desire of conquering or combating with success. But, in
                    proportion as this desire came to prevail, men would naturally be led to reflect
                    as to the means best fitted to insure its gratification: and as experience must
                    soon have convinced them that the battle was not always to the strong, nor the
                    race to the swift,—or, in other words, that mere brute force, openly applied,
                    was in many cases insufficient to secure the victory, and, in most, productive
                    of a loss that countervailed it,—they must early have discovered that some
                    degree of combination was requisite, and certain extrinsic qualities necessary,
                    to render it effectual; that violence might find an auxiliary in cunning, and
                    resistance be paralysed by stratagem and surprise. Such, accordingly, is the
                    state of things which generally obtains amongst savage tribes, however warlike
                    and enterprising. They seldom go down to battle openly and boldly; nor do they
                    consider victory, when dearly purchased, as either honourable or desirable.
                    Artifice is their main resource. The first principle of their simple tactics is
                    to steal unperceived upon the enemy, and overwhelm him, while unsuspicious of
                    attack and unprepared for resistance. In this and similar principles, however,
                    we discover the origin and primary development of the military art. Its source
                    is in the forest or the wilderness. But as war is the first art which men
                    invented, so it is also that which was soonest cultivated and improved. It kept
                    pace with the progress of society;—as mankind multiplied, and communities
                    extended themselves, it received a corresponding expansion ;—more means were
                    combined, and a greater number of men were assembled. This was the second stage
                    of the art, where it remained long stationary, and in nearly the same state in
                    which we find it at the present day among some of the Asiatic nations. Science
                    had not digested nor systematized the rude and shapeless mass of knowledge which
                    experience had supplied, or suggested new combinations of existing means. But
                    ambition at length gave a fresh stimulus to improvement, by opening up a new
                    theatre for its expansive energies; and successive conquerors contributed
                    largely to the cultivation of an art which became the instrument of their glory.
                    In their hands, accordingly, it determined the destiny of nations ;—it raised up
                    or destroyed empires ;—it produced mighty revolutions ;—it overthrew old
                    dynastics, and created new ones in their stead ;—and, amidst all the havoc and
                    desolation occasioned by the pursuit of false glory, it contributed, upon the
                    whole, to the cultivation of those sciences and arts which have a tendency to
                    mitigate the natural ferocity of man, and ultimately to render conquest itself
                    less destructive, and war less sanguinary.</p>

                <p>Results so vast leave no doubt whatever, that the art which was principally
                    instrumental in producing them, must have made considerable progress at a very
                    remote period of the world. It is in fact in the early and semibarbarous stage
                    of society that the military virtues are found in the greatest perfection. The
                    mind is then fierce, ardent, energetic, and daring; peculiarly accessible to the
                    illusion of warlike renown, and undistracted by any of those influences or
                    impressions which act so powerfully upon man in civilized life; while the body,
                    unpampered by luxury, unenfeebled by indulgence, is a fit companion for such a
                    spirit, and capable of enduring, without difficulty, the fatigues and privations
                    incident to war. Add to this that, at the period of which we speak, the only law
                    generally recognised and respected is the law of the strongest; that the
                    necessity of self-defence, of protecting person and property from violence and
                    spoliation, keeps men continually prepared to repel force by force, or to
                    retaliate one aggression by another; that, consequently, the disorders which
                    distract society re-act upon and foster the turbulent spirit in which they have
                    their origin; that war thus becomes a trade which all are either disposed or
                    compelled to pursue; that, to bold and adventurous spirits, it opens up the only
                    path which leads to fortune and to fame, and thus holds out irresistible
                    temptations to embark in military enterprises. At such a period all men are
                    soldiers, and war is their natural employment; in it they live and move and have
                    their being. But necessity is the parent of invention, and the mother of arts;
                    and to it the science of war was indebted for its first improvements. Armies are
                    unwieldy machines, which cannot be moved without some degree of organization,
                    nor supported without considerable care and foresight, nor led into action with
                    an enemy without a certain knowledge of tactical combinations. It is obvious,
                    therefore, that wherever we read of such masses of men having been assembled,
                    whether for purposes of aggression or defence, we may safely consider this fact
                    as of itself conclusive, that the military art had there reached the second
                    stage of its progress, or, in other words, had made considerable advances.
                    History may be silent as to the precise extent to which improvement had been
                    carried, and the records of the past may afford no clue to direct our inquiries
                    concerning the composition and organization of the armies of remote antiquity;
                    but if it be once admitted that such armies existed, and that they defended some
                    countries and overran or conquered others, this admission will imply no
                    inconsiderable knowledge of the art of war on the part of those by whom they
                    were organized and directed.</p>
                <p>Discipline of some kind or other is the bond which keeps together large bodies of
                    men: without it they are a mere mob or rabble, incapable alike of action or
                    direction, and formidable to none save the people of the country where they
                    happen to have congregated. Even the Tartar hordes of Genghis Khan and Timour
                    had an organization and discipline of their own, by means of which these
                    barbarian conquerors were enabled to impel their fierce and warlike masses
                    against the enfeebled and effeminate soldiery of countries advanced in wealth
                    and in civilization<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Timour or Tamerlane, of whom unfortunately we know so little, has left an
                    institutional or elementary treatise on war and the art of conducting armies,
                    each page of which affords proof of a natural genius for commanding men, as well
                    as of tact and skill in employing them to the best advantage. See <hi

                    Asiatic and Turkish armies of our own time. In a word, we may adopt with some
                    qualification the remark of Guibert, when speaking of the progress of the
                    military art: “II précéda,” says he, “chez tous les peuples, les arts et les
                    sciences, et y périt à mesure que celles-ci s’étendirent.”<note anchored="true"

                <p>The earliest military establishment of which history has preserved any record is
                    that of Egypt under the reign of Sesostris, or, as he is denominated in the
                    monumental sculptures of that wonderful country, Rhamses;<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>One of the difficulties which occur in our
                    inquiries concerning Sesostris arises from the different names by which he has
                    been designated by ancient writers. He has been variously called Sesostris,
                    Sesoosis, Sesochis, Sesonchosis, Sethosis, Sethos, Ramesses, Ranieses, Rhamses,
                    Ramestes,.Rampses, Vexores, and Aegyptus. But most of these appellations were
                    probably titular. Thus, <hi rend="italic">Sesostrìs</hi> may be <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Se-sios-t-re,</hi> which signifies, <hi rend="italic subscript"

                    possible to render ancient Egyptian names according to the grammatical rules
                    established in the Coptic language, and, therefore, such etymologies as those
                    now proposed are to be received as purely conjectural. The common designation of

                    unable to fix the precise date of the reign of Sesostris. Larcher, the
                    celebrated translator of Dionysius of Halicarnassus, adopts and defends with
                    much warmth the chronography of Herodotus; while others, rejecting the authority
                    of the father of history, endeavour to determine the era of the Egyptian monarch
                    from the scanty data furnished by Diodorus and Strabo. I he objections to the

                    unanswerable.</p></note> But Osiris was an ideal being, the offspring of
                    mythology, and the hero of fable, adored by the Egyptians sometimes as a deified
                    mortal, sometimes as a personification of the Nile, and sometimes as the
                    symbolical representative of the solar orb. Sesostris, on the contrary, is
                    claimed by history as a real personage; and although the accounts which have
                    been preserved of the reign of this prince, chiefly by the Greek historians, are
                    dashed with a considerable admixture of exaggeration and romance, we cannot
                    reasonably doubt the existence of the monarch, however we may be inclined to
                    question the exploits of the hero and the achievements of the conqueror. The
                    substance of these accounts, indeed, when considered in connection with the
                    corroborative evidence supplied by the Egyptian monuments, and the traces of his
                    expedition which remained even in the age of Herodotus, may be regarded as the
                    more deserving of credit thdt, while scepticism has little to oppose to them
                    except its own incredulity, the statements of the Greek historians are not only
                    consistent with one another, but in strict accordance with the uniform tradition
                    and belief, as well as with the records, of that country, the mother of arts and
                    civilization, which, under this renowned <pb break="no" facs="nls:193103114"

                    unprecedented height of military glory. _ _</p>
                <p>Sesostris, however, did not create the military spirit to which heappears
                    afterwards to have given such ample development. This was in a great measure the
                    work of his father, Amenophis HL, who, shortly after the birth of his son, is
                    said to have assembled all the male children born on the same day, and to have
                    given them the same education. No distinction was made between the young prince
                    and his companions. They were alike engaged in the same studies, trained to the
                    same exercises, inured to the same hardships, and instructed in the use of the
                    same arms. A rigid discipline prescribed unremitting exertion, while daily
                    privations and fatigue hardened and prepared them for the duties of war. In
                    establishing this military seminary, Amenophis appears to have intended placing
                    around his son a faithful band of soldiers, attached to him by the associations
                    of early friendship, and the ties of brotherhood in arms. Nor did the result
                    disappoint his expectations. Arrived at manhood, the prince and his companions
                    soon evinced how much they had profited by their education,—how well they
                    merited the confidence reposed in them. With bodies rendered vigorous and
                    athletic by labour and exercise, and with minds cultivated by the best studies,
                    they were already fitted to act both as soldiers and as generals, to serve with
                    energy, or to command with skill. Sent by his father at an early age to command
                    an expedition against the Arabians, the prince, accustomed, as well as his
                    companions, to suffer long both from hunger and from thirst, could meet upon
                    equal terms the wandering and yet unconquered tribes, who chiefly trusted for
                    their defence to the barrenness of their inhospitable deserts. Arabia was
                    subdued and annexed to the Egyptian monarchy. He afterwards directed his march
                    to the west, and his father lived to see the greater part of Libya conquered by
                    his victorious son. When Sesostris mounted the throne, therefore, his military
                    fame was established. The qualities of his mind, his dauntless courage, and his
                    daring ambition, seemed to be announced by his personal appearance; and the
                    people, no doubt, easily associated the character of the hero with the robust
                    frame and gigantic stature<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    their new monarch. But it is more material to state, that the success of his
                    arms, in his wars with the Arabians and Libyans, had inspired him with the hopes
                    of making yet more extensive conquests; and, if we may credit the Greek
                    historians, the perilous project of subjugating the world must have been already
                    familiar to the mind of Sesostris when he succeeded to the crown. Amidst the
                    burning sands of Libya, and in the depth of the Arabian deserts, the phantom of
                    universal empire showed itself, and he vowed to pursue it.<note anchored="true"

                <p>His resolution being thus taken, no time appears to have been lost by the new
                    sovereign in preparing his subjects for an enterprise, which could not be
                    undertaken but in defiance of all the counsels of prudence. He caused various
                    reports to be spread abroad, artfully attributing his project to other causes
                    than his own ambition. His daughter Athyrtis, famed for her wisdom, as a sort of
                    Egyptian Cassandra, proclaimed the facility with which her father would conquer
                    the earth: the success of the enterprise was prognosticated by omens, by
                    sortilege, and by divination: and the people were reminded that, at the birth of
                    Sesostris, Phtha had appeared to his father in a dream, and had predicted to
                    Amenophis that the newborn boy should one day become master of the world.<note

                    opinion in his favour by means of prophecies, prodigies, and visions. His
                    natural sense taught him that other and more rational precautions were
                    necessary; that a king who is not popular at 'home, should not think of making
                    conquests abroad. His first object, therefore, was to secure the affections of
                    the Egyptians: and for this purpose he employed all those arts which, exercised
                    by sovereigns, are so powerful in conciliating popular favour. Some he won by
                    his munificence, others by his clemency; the selfish were secured by his
                    liberality, the vain were flattered by his condescension and affability; even
                    traitors to the royal authority were allowed to escape with impunity, and public
                    debtors were liberated from the prisons in which they were confined.<note

                    his kingdom, and leave none behind him who either would or could attempt a
                    revolution in his absence, he made a partition of power among the chief men of
                    the nation, dividing the whole territory of Egypt into thirty-six nomes or
                    prefectures, over which he appointed as many governors, each of whom was charged
                    with the collection of the royal revenues, and the administration of the laws
                    within his own particular district. He at the same time elevated his brother
                    Armais to the rank of regent of the kingdom; and, except that this prince might
                    not wear the royal diadem, he was permitted to assume all the pomp of a monarch;
                    an indulgence which he so far abused as to usurp the crown in the king’s
                    absence, and to attempt his life on his return home from his long and perilous
                    expedition.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Drummond’s

                <p>Having completed these and other necessary arrangements, Sesostris next proceeded
                    to raise an army. The peace establishment of the kingdom, as previously
                    organized by this prince, appears to have consisted of a numerous militia,
                    divided into two classes, denominated <hi rend="italic">hala-sires</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">harmatopoii,</hi> and amounting, according to Herodotus, to
                    410,000 men, distributed throughout the different provinces as a species of
                    military colonists, each man being allowed a portion of land adequate to the
                    maintenance of himself and family. This formed the nucleus of the mighty force
                    which Sesostris now raised for the conquest of the world, consisting, if we may
                    believe Diodorus Siculus, of 600,000 infantry, 24,000 cavalry, and 27,000 war
                    chariots; a force certainly equal to the magnitude of the enterprise in which he
                    was about to engage, though it is difficult to conceive how the population of a
                    small country like Egypt, supposing it ever so dense, could have supplied so
                    vast a body of men, exceeding, by more than 200,000, the numerical strength of
                    the army with which the Emperor Napoleon invaded Russia, and which was by far
                    the largest ever assembled in modern times. No precise information has reached
                    us as to the composition, organization, and discipline of this expeditionary
                    army. We only learn, incidentally as it were, that the king chose as the leaders
                    of his less experienced troops, the companions of his youth, trained, like
                    himself, to the use of arms, and exceeding 1700 in number; that disgrace or
                    infamy was attached to disobedience of orders and neglect of duty, and that
                    meritorious or valorous deeds were liberally rewarded; circumstances which,
                    taken in connection with the particulars above stated, seem to warrant the
                    conclusion, that the military system of Egypt had reached no small degree of
                    improvement, and that the science of war, in all its branches, had made
                    considerable advances. With <pb break="no" facs="nls:193103127"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0703-3127-0582"/>a view to the ulterior objects of the expedition,
                    Sesostris also collected or fitted out a fleet of 400 sail; and the ships are
                    said to have been of large dimensions, adapted to the purposes both of war and
                    transport.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                <p>With these immense preparations the warlike monarch at length commenced his
                    perilous enterprise. He invaded Ethiopia, and compelled the inhabitants to pay
                    him a tribute in ebony, gold, and ivory. Even the ferocious Troglodytes yielded
                    to the conqueror. Advancing farther to the southward, he passed the frontiers of
                    Ethiopia, and entered the country extending beyond Sennaar to the Mountains of
                    the Moon, where he left various monuments both of his power and of his piety. In
                    the Straits of Dira or Babelmandeb he joined his fleet, consisting, as above
                    stated, of 400 sail, which had already compelled the inhabitants of the islands
                    in the Erythrean Sea, and of the adjacent continent, to acknowledge his
                    authority. The victorious monarch next proceeded to India, which he completely
                    overran, extending his conquests beyond the Ganges, and subduing some of the
                    countries which lie between that river and the Eastern Ocean. He then directed
                    his course towards the country of the five rivers or Punjab; crossed the immense
                    reticulation of streams, which ultimately unite their waters with the Indus; and
                    ascended the table-land of central Asia. Nor were the Scythian nations able to
                    resist the torrent as it rolled westward through Tartary, behind the mountains
                    of Imaus, and north of the Caspian, to the river Tanais and the Palus Moeotis.
                    Having entered Europe, Sesostris passed through Sarmatia, Dacia, and Moesia, nor
                    halted until he arrived in Thrace, where he erected columns to perpetuate the
                    memory of his victories, and to prove the extent of his conquests. From Thrace
                    he crossed over into Asia Minor, and advanced into the plains of Colchis
                    (rendered so famous in Grecian story by the expedition of the Argonauts and the
                    fable of the golden fleece), where he founded a colony on the banks of the
                    Phasis, and erected monuments, some of which were in existence in the age of
                    Herodotus. He then marched against the Assyrian empire, which he conquered, and
                    thus seated himself on the throne which had been occupied by Ninus and
                    Semiramis. Finally, surrounded with the trophies of victory, and enriched with
                    the spoils of nations, Sesostris returned to Egypt in triumph, after having been
                    thirty years engaged in an expedition, undertaken in defiance of all the
                    dictates of prudence, yet, if we believe the concurrent testimony of historians,
                    terminated without a single reverse of fortune.<note anchored="true"

                    some of the elder Egyptian priests, relative to this monarch, and the military
                    establishment he had created, is thus recorded by Tacitus in the second book of
                    his Annals: “Mox (Germanicus^ visit veterum Thebarum magna vestigia; et manebant
                    structis molibus litterae Aegyptiae. priorem opulentiam com-plexae; jussusque e

                    The strength of the army of Sesostris, as here stated, very nearly coincides
                    with the amount given in the text, on the authority of Diodorus. According to
                    the latter, this army consisted of G00,000 infantry, 24,000 horse, and 27,000
                    armed chariots; which, as at least <hi rend="italic">three</hi> men fought in
                    <hi rend="italic">one</hi> chariot, would make a total of 695,000 men, or only
                    5000 less than the number reported by the priests to Germanicus on the faith of
                    the monuments.</p></note> That it involves many improbabilities is obvious; but
                    what portion of ancient history is free of them? Mankind, in every age of the
                    world, have taken delight in the marvellous; and if the ancients appear to have
                    been pleased with reading romances in history, the moderns seem equally disposed
                    to read history in romances. The great difficulty in forming an accurate
                    judgment as to the story of the Egyptian monarch arises from the total want of
                    details. We hear nothing of the generals to whom he was opposed, of the cities
                    which he besieged, nor even of the battles which he fought. Historians relate
                    his triumphs, but are silent respecting the skill which obtained them. At the
                    same time, it cannot reasonably be doubted, we think, that there is a large
                    substratum of truth in the narratives which have reached us respecting this
                    extraordinary personage. By the concurrent testimony of the ancient authors,
                    confirmed by the evidence derived from the Egyptian monuments, he is represented
                    as a great warrior and conqueror; as the first, and, we may almost add, the

                    glory in distant expeditions: nor are there wanting circumstances which warrant
                    the conclusion, that he overran some countries, conquered others, and left
                    traces of his progress in many parts both of Asia and Europe. That he
                    established a regular army, and provided a fleet to co-operate with it in his
                    expedition against the countries of the East, are facts which seem to be as well
                    attested as any in ancient history.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    traditions of ages, to the records of history, and to the authority of
                    monuments, that Sesostris must have been one of the greatest princes that ever
                    lived; while we may fairly confess our doubts of the extent of his conquests,
                    and acknowledge that we cannot ascertain at what period he flourished, lhe
                    existence of the monarch we may consider as certain; and some of the
                    achievements of the conqueror we may admit to be probable, though ŵe. cannot
                    fail to perceive, that the number of his triumphs has been amplified by
                    exaggeration, and the history of his reign crowded with fictions. It is known
                    that the great Ramesses or Ramestt⅛ created at least one obelisk, on which he
                    announced himse to be loved and gifted by all the gods of Kgypt; but it may be
                    questioned whether he had a right to call himself the master of the whole
                    habitable world. We may believe that Sesostris obtained many victories, and
                    subdued many regions; while we may still avow that we are unable to tell when
                    this mighty monarch reigned, where were the limits of his empire, what humbled
                    nations bowed down before his throne, or what captive kings were yoked to his
                    triumphal car.”</p></note></p>

                    mort de Cyrus, le luxe lui fit quitter la Perse, et il passa chez les

                    remark, however, must be taken with some important qualifications. As a general
                    proposition, it , is doubtless true that the military art first assumed
                    consistence among the Asiatic nations, particularly the Persians; for the
                    warlike spirit of Egypt seems to have expired with its first and only conqueror.
                    But it is utterly absurd to maintain that the death of Cyrus was productive of
                    any change in the military system of Persia, or that this event led to the
                    transference which Guibert has so gratuitously supposed. Cyrus, in as far as we

                    like those of Sesostris, have been so exaggerated by historians, and embellished
                    by fabulists, that almost every grain of truth has to be separated from a bushel
                    of fiction. The Cyropaedia is merely a philosophical romance, with no more of
                    truth or fact in it than is sufficient to give verisimilitude to the
                    story.</p></note> while the victories achieved by the Persians under his
                    command, contrasted with the fatal reverses which they afterwards ex-erienced,
                    may induce superficial observers to imagine that the knowledge of the art
                    declined after the hero’s death. No opinion, however, can possibly be more
                    erroneous; except, indeed, it be that which represents the Greek tactics as
                    having been primarily derived from the Persian, to which, as will appear in the
                    sequel, they bore not the slightest resemblance. The qualities of the Persian
                    troops may, perhaps, have deteriorated, and, under the influence of luxury and
                    refinement, the military character of the nation may have declined; but the
                    system of organising armies and making war continued, in a great measure,
                    unchanged: nor, as far as the military art is concerned, would it be easy to
                    discover any material difference between the tactics of Cyrus, who was uniformly
                    victorious, and those of Xerxes, Mardonius, and Darius, who experienced the most
                    disastrous defeats. It should also be remembered, that the former led Asiatics
                    against Asiatics, and that the nations he subdued were among the most effeminate
                    and voluptuous of the ancient world: whilst the latter were called to contend
                    with the Greeks in their best days, when their bodies were robust, their hearts
                    strong, and their discipline admirable; and when their armies were commanded by
                    men fired alike with the love of liberty and of glory, and not only conversant
                    with the science of war, theoretically considered, but eminently skilful in all
                    those resources which neutralize superiority of numbers, and enable handfuls of
                    men to snatch the victory from masses apparently overwhelming and
                    invincible.</p>
                <p>The strength of the Persian army consisted in its cavalry, which was always of
                    excellent quality, and capable of achieving great things had it been properly
                    commanded. This was emphatically evinced at the passage of the Granicus, where
                    its gallant conduct attracted the admiration of every officer in the Macedonian
                    army, from the king to the humblest dilochite in the ranks·<note anchored="true"

                    The ground on which it was posted sloped gradually towards the bank of the

                    sustain it, this cavalry bravely disputed the passage; drove Ptolemy, who
                    commanded the vanguard of the Macedonian army, back into the river; charged the
                    heads of the columns as they successively ascended the bank in order to deploy,
                    with the utmost impetuosity; and maintained the combat until it was attacked by
                    the formidable phalanx in front, and by the light infantry on both flanks, when
                    it was at length forced to retire.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    Persian infantry had none of the qualities for which the cavalry was
                    distinguished, and seems, in fact, to have been little better than a military
                    mob, without coherence or solidity; while the vast numbers of this arm which
                    were commonly brought into the field impeded the action of the cavalry, which
                    they were incapable of supporting, and served only to create confusion, and
                    supply food for the slaughter, when opposed to disciplined armies commanded by
                    men conversant with military combinations. Marathon, Plataea, and Mycale, all
                    bear witness to the truth of this observation. The war-chariots formed another
                    source of disorder and weakness. Their number, like that of the infantry, was
                    excessive; and as these vehicles could only act upon level ground, they were
                    altogether useless and unavailing in a broken country, or against a skilful
                    commander. With regard to the numerical strength of the Persian armies, we have
                    no precise information, and can only form a conjecture from the statements,
                    almost always exaggerated, of the Greek historians as to the numbers actually
                    brought into the field. Xerxes, who had taken by descent a hereditary hatred of
                    the Greeks, invaded Europe, it is said, and entered Greece at the head of an
                    army, which, with its retinue of servants, eunuchs, and women, amounted to
                    upwards of 5,000,000 of souls; a statement which, if true, would imply that the
                    Persian nation had risen <hi rend="italic">en</hi><hi rend="italic">masse</hi>
                    to overrun the countries of the West. Yet this vast multitude, or rather horde,
                    was arrested in its progress by 300 Spartans at the pass of Thermopylae; and
                    that mountain gorge would have become the scene of its total defeat and
                    destruction, had not a base Trachinian betrayed this devoted band of heroes, and
                    enabled the Persians to attack it at once in the front, the flank, and the rear.
                    At Marathon, Datis and Artaphernes, lieutenants of the Great King, brought into
                    the field 100,000 foot and 10,000 horse,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    infantry and 1000 Plataean auxiliaries, commanded by Miltiades. At Plataea, the
                    Persian force, consisting in all of 300,000 men, was again defeated with great
                    loss by a handful of Lacedaemoniâns and Athenians under Pausanias. And at the
                    battle of Mycale, fought on the same day with that of Plataea (22d September 479
                    B. c.), 100,000 men, the wrecks of that portion of the army more immediately
                    under the command of Xerxes, which had just returned from the unsuccessful
                    expedition to Greece, were completely overthrown and dispersed by a small body
                    of Greeks, who stormed their entrenched camp, slaughtered several thousands, and
                    carried off an immense booty. On comparing these various numbers, and making due
                    allowance for casualties, it would appear that the Persian monarch must have
                    entered Greece with about 600,000 fighting men; an enormous force numerically
                    considered, but not too great to provoke incredulity, when we reflect on the
                    mode in which the eastern nations have always made war, and further take into
                    account the circumstance, that nearly the whole of one reign and part of another
                    were consumed in making preparations for this ill-fated expedition.</p>
                <p>Of the state of the Persian army in the reign of Alexander, Arrian has furnished
                    us with many important particulars, especially in his account of the battle of
                    Arbela, which is the more interesting, as it gives us some insight respecting
                    the Persian tactics under the last Darius. According to this writer, who had
                    consulted the memoirs of Ptolemy, one of Alexander’s generals, but who,
                    nevertheless, seems to have possessed the Greek talent for exaggerating numbers,
                    the army which Darius brought into <pb break="no" facs="nls:193103153"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0703-3153-0584"/>the field on this occasion consisted of 1,000,000
                    infantry, 40,000 cavalry, 200 chariots armed with scythes, and 15 elephants; a
                    statement which appears equally incredible, whether we regard the absolute
                    amount here assigned, or attend to the glaring disproportion between the
                    relative numerical strength of the different arms. Quintus Curtius, who reduces
                    the infantry to 600,000, and raises the cavalry to 145,000, exaggerates at least
                    with method, and thus avoids an objection fatal to the numerical accuracy of the
                    military historian. The disposition of this enormous force, as described by
                    Arrian, shows the incongruous elements of which it was composed. According to
                    the custom of the Persians, the king placed himself in the centre, having around
                    him his relations and the officers of his court, with his ordinary guards, foot
                    and horse, which sometimes amounted to 15,000 men. These he supported by a body
                    of Greeks in his pay, upon whom he placed great reliance, and by other <hi
                    rend="italic">corps d’élite</hi> furnished by the native army. The Persians, the
                    Susians, and the Candu-sians composed the left; on the right were the Syrians,
                    the Assyrians, and other nations, subjects or allies of Persia; and the whole
                    was formed into squares or masses of prodigious depth, evidently with the
                    intention of resisting the compact formation of the Macedonian phalanx, of which
                    the Persians had already had woeful experience. These different nations were
                    variously armed, some with missile weapons, others with pikes, hatchets, maces,
                    &amp;c.; and cavalry were stationed in the intervals between the squares. The
                    reserve was composed of those for whom no place could be found in the first
                    line; and being drawn up too close to it, served only to augment the confusion.
                    The infantry of the left was flanked by the main body of the Persian cavalry,
                    and part of that of the Bactrians; together with two corps, one Scythian and the
                    other Bactrian, a little in advance. On the right, the Armenian and the
                    Cappadocian cavalry were posted in a similar manner, though not in equal force.
                    Two hundred armed chariots were drawn up before the left, and fifty before the
                    right of the infantry, while the elephants and fifty more chariots were placed
                    in advance of the centre.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    of Darius on this memorable and decisive day. It was doubtless bad in many
                    respects, particularly in the disproportionate crowding of all arms on the
                    centre and left, while the right was left comparatively weak and uncovered; but
                    its greatest defect, inseparable, perhaps, from the heterogeneous composition of
                    the army, consisted in this, that the defeat of any one part of the line was
                    certain to throw the whole into irretrievable disorder, and to end in a complete
                    rout. Still it showed very considerable knowledge of the military art; while the
                    battle which followed, and which was bravely contested, is even yet considered a
                    study for tacticians.</p>
                <p>From the earliest times, the genius of the Greeks, adventurous and free, inclined
                    them to war. This, at first a consequence of their position, became in time an
                    attribute of the national character, and gave rise to institutions which, in
                    their turn, served to diffuse and confirm the spirit in which they had
                    originated. Divided into a number of petty states, which were separated often by
                    imaginary boundaries, and naturally jealous of one another, Greece was a scene
                    of never-ending contention, and the theatre of almost continual war. New causes
                    of difference, in the shape of injuries, encroachments, or insults, real or
                    imaginary, were incessantly arising; and as each state was alike proud of
                    itself, suspicious of its neighbours or rivals, and, above all, watchful of its
                    independence, the wrong done, or believed to have been done, was promptly
                    followed by retaliation, which again provoked a repetition of the offence, and
                    thus led ultimately to war. Such a state of things naturally fostered a warlike
                    spirit, and gave birth to military institutions; while the necessity of
                    self-defence, still more than the love of conquest or of glory, rendered it
                    imperative that every citizen capable of bearing arms should be ready to appear
                    in the field at the call of his country. But experience soon taught the
                    important lesson that numbers did not constitute strength, and that <hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi> small body of men prepared by early training for the duties
                    of war, and subjected to a system of regular discipline, were capable of
                    contending, on equal terms, with great numerical pdds. When this discovery was
                    first made, we have no means of ascertaining precisely; but it is one which must
                    early have occurred to the rulers and governors of small states like those of
                    Greece, the scanty population of which imposed upon them the necessity of
                    devising the best means for rendering its disposable strength effective and
                    available. Hence we find, that one great object of the early statesmen and
                    legislators of this country was to organize a system of physical and moral
                    education adapted to its peculiar position and circumstances; to engraft the
                    military spirit on those institutions which were destined to form the general
                    character of their countrymen; and, amidst the pursuits of peace, to prepare the
                    minds and bodies of their citizens for encountering the fatigues, privations,
                    and perils of war. Nor did their labours prove fruitless or vain; for the
                    institutions thus prepared being suited alike to the genius and condition of the
                    people, soon struck their roots, as it were, into the soil, and ere long
                    produced those fruits which have for ages been the wonder and admiration of
                    mankind. But less perhaps of this wonder and admiration is due to the bravery of
                    the Greeks, eminent as it always was, than to their discipline, organization,
                    and conduct in the field. Among them all the branches of the military art were
                    simultaneously cultivated, and received the most important improvements. Their
                    formation was rendered compact and formidable; combining solidity and the power
                    of resistance, with a mobility which made these qualities available on different
                    points, even in action. Their tactics were singularly adapted to the peculiar
                    character of their troops, and were founded on the most certain principles of
                    the art.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Guibert, in his

                    development which no other nation, ancient or modern, has yet been able to
                    surpass. Lastly, we may observe, that until the reign of Philip, the father of
                    Alexander the Great, Greece had no standing army. Her strength consisted in her
                    militia; and to this description of force she was indebted for the imperishable
                    glories of Marathon, Plataea, and Mycale, when the myriads of the Persian
                    invader were successively overthrown. But, from the causes above indicated, and
                    the incessant contests in which the different states were engaged with each
                    other, this militia had acquired the principal characteristics of a regular
                    force, both as regards <pb break="no" facs="nls:193103166"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0703-3166-0585"/>organization and discipline, and consequently was
                    of nearly equal avail against an enemy in the field.</p>
                <p>To the institutions of Lycurgus Sparta was indebted for her military prc-eminence
                    among the states of Greece. To exclude all refinement and luxury, to cultivate
                    the sterner virtues of abstinence and self-denial, to inure the body to
                    hardships and the mind to suffering, to inculcate self-sacrificing patriotism,
                    and to form great characters, appear to have been the principal objects of this
                    iron» hearted legislator; who accordingly laid the foundations of his
                    institutions in a system of primary education, intended and calculated to
                    convert the free male population of the state into a military community, and to
                    develope to the utmost all those physical and moral qualities which render men
                    invincible in war. Nor did the results disappoint the calculations upon which
                    this system had been founded. Trained from their earliest years to suffer the
                    extremes of heat and cold, hunger and thirst, to endure pain with unflinching
                    fortitude, and to despise danger and death; habituated to the most implicit and
                    unquestioning obedience to all placed in authority over them; and continually
                    exercised in running, wrestling, swimming, ball-playing, and martial games of
                    all sorts, as well as in stratagems, surprises, and ambuscades; the Spartan
                    youth, when called to take the field, were prepared at once to enter upon the
                    duties of war with alacrity and vigour, and to regard with indifference all the
                    privations and fatigues of the severest campaign. Nor were their discipline and
                    organization inferior to their military qualities. The Spartan phalanx, which
                    formed the basis of the Macedonian, consisted of eight files in depth.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>There is some confusion among
                    the ancient writers on the subject of the division of the Spartan force.
                    Thucydides, describing the arrangement and proportions of the Spartan army at
                    Manincia, informs us that a battalion or <hi rend="italic">lochos</hi> consisted
                    of four <hi rend="italic">penteecstìes</hi> or companies, a pentecostie of four
                    <hi rend="italic">enomoties</hi> or platoons, and each <hi rend="italic"
                    >enomotìe</hi> of 32 men; thus making the whole strength of the battalion 512
                    men. But he makes no mention of the number of battalions in a regiment, and
                    indeed acknowledges that the subject was obscure, and his information imperfect.
                    According to Xenophon, the Spartan <hi rend="italic">mora</hi> or regiment
                    consisted of four <hi rend="italic">lochì,</hi> the lochos of two <hi
                    rend="italic">pentecostìes,</hi> and the pentecostie of two <hi rend="italic"
                    >enomoties.</hi> The number included in the last denomination is not given; but,
                    if we assume that it consisted of 32 men, as stated by the historian first
                    named, the regiment of Xenophon would amount to 5Ĵ2 men, or 50 more than the
                    battalion of Thucydides. How are these discrepancies to be reconciled? It is
                    scarcely probable that the division of the Spartan force underwent any change in
                    the interval between the time of Thucydides and that of Xenophon; but it is very
                    probable that neither may be correct, considering that the Spartans studiously
                    concealed from the observation of foreigners the internal organization and
                    strength of their armies.</p></note> The files were placed at intervals of six
                    feet from one another when disposed in open order; in close order the distance
                    was three feet; in locked order one foot and a half; the intervals being thus
                    diminished one-half at each approximation. The open order was that observed on
                    the march, and in evolutions or manoeuvres; the close order was for the attack;
                    and the locked order was that in which an attack was received. The front rank
                    consisted of picked men; the rear rank was also select; while those upon whom
                    least dependence could be placed had their station in the centre, in order to
                    give impetus and momentum to the column by their weight and physical power. The
                    different parts of the phalanx were classed according to a regular system, and,
                    in particular, the covering file was matched in quality as nearly as possible
                    with the file in front; so that if the whole or any part of the front rank
                    failed, the vacancies were supplied by the second files, without disordering the
                    line. The arms, offensive and defensive, of the soldier, consisted of a spear or
                    pike, a short sword or dagger, and a shield or buckler of an oval form, which
                    was fastened round the neck and at the left shoulder by means of straps. But
                    latterly Cleomenes changed this clumsy encumbrance for the Macedonian shield,
                    originally invented by the Carians, which was fastened on the left arm by a ring
                    or belt, so as to leave the soldier free to employ both hands in giving force
                    and direction to the pike. The Spartans were also familiar with the most
                    approved evolutions, which they performed with equal celerity and precision. The
                    rear of the phalanx became the front, or the front the rear, by the shortest and
                    simplest operation; while, by redoubling its formation, it became a solid
                    square, bristling on every side with pikes, and, in locked order, wholly
                    impenetrable to attack, except upon broken ground. Rapid changes of front even
                    in the presence of an enemy, refusing or advancing a wing at a critical moment,
                    turning an enemy’s flank, and many other manoeuvres, which are still considered
                    equally delicate and difficult, were frequently executed with the most complete
                    success by the commanders of these formidable columns. In a word, the Spartans
                    may be regarded as the founders and first improvers of that military system,
                    which attained its perfection under Alexander, and placed the crowns of Asia at
                    his feet.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The Spartan
                    phalanx advanced to meet the enemy’s at a regular step, in accord with the
                    cadence of military music, and, even when beaten, generally retired from the
                    field in perfect order, however reduced in number. After battle, every soldier
                    was obliged to produce his shield, as a proof that he had fought, or retired, as
                    a soldier ought to do, bravely and steadily. If he had lost or thrown away his
                    shield he was disgraced for ever; the brand of indelible infamy was fixed upon
                    him. But this was of rare occurrence; for the love of military glory was the
                    only passion which the Spartan people were allowed to cherish; and both
                    education and discipline had combined to eradicate fear from their bosoms. It
                    was a word unknown in their vocabulary. In this singular country all passions
                    merged in one. The Spartan mother and the Spartan wife rejoiced when a son or a
                    husband had fallen honourably in the field of battle, and sometimes refused to
                    recognise as of kindred with themselves such of their relatives as had survived
                    a defeat. The only mourners on account of the disaster at Leuctra were those
                    whose friends and kinsmen had escaped the slaughter of that bloody
                    day.</p></note></p>
                <p>The Athenian military force consisted of three classes; first, the heavy troops,
                    ⅛λ∕rα∕, armed with a spear, a dagger, a cuirass or corslet, and an oval shield,
                    and reserved for the phalanx or main battle; secondly, the light troops,
                    wiarαtfraz, armed with a light spear, a javelin, and a target, and destined for
                    skirmishing, seizing or maintaining positions, and covering the movements of the
                    phalanx; thirdly, irregular troops, <hi rend="italic">γυμνηται,</hi> without
                    defensive armour, but provided with missile weapons, such as javelins, bows and
                    arrows, and slings, for harassing an enemy on his march, or performing the
                    duties of light troops in the field.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>These classes may be considered as analogous, the first to
                    the grenadiers, the second to the light infantry, and the third to the riflemen
                    or sharpshooters of modern armies. Their armour, however, was different at
                    different times; for the Greeks, like the Romans, made several changes in this
                    respect; and hence the apparent discrepancies which we meet with in the accounts
                    of historians. For example, when Arrian mentions the militia of the ancient
                    Greeks, he speaks of the times which preceded the constitution and organization
                    which Philip and Alexander the Great gave to their troops. The oval buckler,
                    larger than common, and the long pike or <hi rend="italic">saríssa,</hi> were
                    introduced by these sovereigns, and found to add incalculably both to the
                    defensive and offensive power of the phalanx. Some of the Greeks, however,
                    piqued themselves on not adopting the changes of Alexander; but Philopoemen at
                    length persuaded the Achaeans to lay aside their ancient arms, and assume those
                    of the Macedonians.</p></note> The phalanx or main battle consisted entirely <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193103179" xml:id="kp-eb0703-3179-0586"/> of natives of
                    Attica, and was drawn up according to tribes or communities, probably with the
                    view of exciting a generous rivalry in deeds of arms. The light armed troops
                    were partly native and partly foreign; the slingers and archers were wholly
                    foreign. The cavalry, like the heavy-armed infantry, consisted of natives alone,
                    and were of a good description, being remarkably alert, intelligent, and
                    enterprising. Thus composed, the Athenian army was prepared for every species of
                    warfare, and equal to the most arduous achievements. The intelligence, activity,
                    quick perception, and daring spirit of enterprise for which the native of
                    Attica, the Frenchman of Greece, was distinguished, rendered him formidable in
                    desultory warfare, alert in his moverńents, and prompt in taking advantage of
                    every favourable circumstance; insomuch that the Athenian light troops foiled,
                    and on some occasions even discomfited, the renowned Spartan phalanx. The
                    Athenian phalanx was less compact than that of Sparta, and, owing to the
                    character of the people, as much perhaps as to its formation, less adapted to
                    receive and repel an attack; but in the charge it was perfectly irresistible.
                    Its onset was terrible, and overthrew all before it. The cause of this must be
                    sought in the difference of national character. The Spartan was chiefly
                    celebrated for his passive, the Athenian for his active courage. Hence the one
                    was powerful in resistance; the other formidable in attack. The Spartan was
                    steady, devoted, and firm; the Athenian bold, enterprising, intelligent, and
                    full of address and dexterity. If the one was less capable of resistance, the
                    other was more ardent and impetuous; their military qualities were as opposite
                    as their natural characters, but both were admirable of their kind; and if it
                    had been possible to combine them together in equal proportions, perfect
                    soldiers might have been formed, and a perfect army organized. The Athenians, we
                    may observe, were the first of the Greeks who advanced upon the enemy at an
                    accelerated pace corresponding to what is now called double-quick time. This
                    innovation was first introduced by Miltiades at Marathon, in order to give
                    increased momentum to the charge which he directed against the Persian masses;
                    and it was consecrated in Athenian tactics by the glorious result of that
                    ever-memorable day.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>It
                    is very much to be regretted that no military or scientific description has been
                    preserved of the battle of Marathon. The accounts which have reached us, being
                    written by men ignorant of military affairs, are meagre, confused, and
                    unsatisfactory; containing details, indeed, of the numbers engaged, and the
                    amount of the slain, but giving little or no information respecting the
                    combinations and manoeuvres which decided the fortune of the day. One thing only
                    is certain, the victory was the result of consummate generalship on the part of
                    the commander, and of heroic valour on that of the soldier.</p></note></p>
                <p>But the very principles which had saved the states of Greece from foreign
                    invasion, and enabled them to maintain their independence, were destined to form
                    the basis of a military establishment, more formidable, because more complete in
                    all its parts, than any which that or other countries had yet produced, and
                    organized for the express purpose of serving as an instrument for subverting
                    Grecian liberty. We allude of course to the Macedonian army in the reigns of
                    Philip and his son Alexander the Great. The founder of this establishment,
                    Philip of Macedon, was a man of unquestionable talents, of convenient
                    principles, and of boundless ambition. Having improved his natural parts by
                    associating with the scholars, statesmen, and philosophers of his age; and
                    having been initiated into the scientific principles of the art of war under
                    Epaminondas, the most celebrated master of the time; he was early fired with a
                    love of military glory, and a lust of conquest and dominion. But although the
                    brilliant period in the annals of the Greek states was past when Philip made his
                    appearance, and these communities had already begun to show symptoms of decline,
                    enough of the ancient spirit still remained to convince him, that, without
                    creating new means, and organizing a force different from any which had yet
                    existed, he could never hope to realise his ambitious projects, by rendering
                    himself the master of Greece. The sagacity of Philip was fully on a level with
                    his ambition. He saw that in the rude shepherds and hunters of Macedonia might
                    be found the raw material of an army; that discipline and organization were
                    alone wanting to convert this material into an invincible force; and that to
                    render a military force completely effective, or, in other words, to derive from
                    it the utmost benefit it was capable of affording, it was indispensably
                    necessary to depart from the militia system which had hitherto prevailed, and to
                    start from the principle that no army could be good which was not permanent. He
                    was thus the first who fully comprehended the importance of a standing army,
                    both as regards the efficiency of a military body itself, and also with
                    reference to projects of conquest or ambition; and he may further claim the
                    distinction of having been the first to organize a permanent force. In
                    prosecuting this design he showed a skill, and a knowledge of the principles of
                    military organization, equal to the sagacity evinced by its conception. Adopting
                    the Spartan phalanx as the basis of his system, he gave it greater depth and
                    solidity, so as to render it irresistible in the attack, and impenetrable when
                    drawn up in position. He changed or improved its armour both for offence and
                    defence; and, in particular, introduced the large oblong buckler, and the <hi
                    rend="italic">sarissa</hi> or Macedonian pike, the most formidable weapon of
                    ancient times. The light-armed troops were also placed on a better footing than
                    they had ever before been among the Greeks, being formed in demi-phalanges,
                    which, without materially lessening their mobility, rendered them capable of
                    combining their efforts in an effective manner with those of the heavy-armed
                    infantry. The equipments, arms, and discipline of his cavalry were in like
                    manner improved, and their organization perfected, with the utmost care and
                    diligence. In a word, all that was excellent in the different Greek systems was
                    combined in the Macedonian; while their defects were avoided, and improvements
                    introduced wherever these seemed to be either expedient or necessary. Such was
                    the general character of the military establishment which Philip created for
                    enabling him to trample on the liberties of Greece, and which Alexander employed
                    in subjugating the world. We shall now speak of its different parts in
                    detail.</p>
                <p>The phalanx was composed of files of a certain depth, and of regular combinations
                    of those files. The <hi rend="italic">lochos</hi> or file was a number of
                    soldiers ranged in line, one behind the other, from the head to the <hi
                    rend="italic">serrefile</hi> or <hi rend="italic">ouragos.</hi> The file
                    consisted at different times of different numbers of men, as eight, ten, twelve,
                    and sixteen. Alexander chose the last, because it formed the best proportion
                    relative to the extent and depth of the phalanx; nor did it prevent the archers
                    and slingers, stationed behind, from launching their missiles at the enemy, over
                    the heads of the phalangites. If the phalanx was doubled to form a solid column,
                    or reduced to one half in order to extend its front, the respective depths of 32
                    and 8 still remained proportional; but if the original depth of the file had
                    been only 8, as in the Spartan phalanx, the latter evolution<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193103192" xml:id="kp-eb0703-3192-0587"/> ćould not have been
                    performed with safety, because it would have reduced the depth to 4, and thus
                    deprived the formation of its peculiar characteristic of solidity. The
                    preference given to the number 16, therefore, was on account of its
                    divisibility, and its admitting of evolutions consistently with the nature of
                    the phalanx, which could not have been attempted with files composed of any
                    other number, greater or less. The best man was chosen as the head of the file,
                    and named <hi rend="italic">lochagos</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >protostate</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> the second was called <hi rend="italic"
                    >epistate</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> the third bore the same name as the
                    first, the fourth the same as the second, and so on to the last; so that each
                    file was composed of <hi rend="italic">protostates</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >epistates,</hi> ranged alternately from the <hi rend="italic">lochagos</hi> to
                    the <hi rend="italic">οuragos,</hi> who was also a picked man.<note

                    apply the latter epithet seem to suppose that it consisted of ten men, which is
                    not true as respects the Macedonian file. We have followed, in the text, the
                    nomenclature of Arrian, whose authority on this subject is decisive. With regard
                    to the term <hi rend="italic">enornotiβ,</hi> which has so much puzzled
                    commentators, we have already shown that it means something different from a
                    file, or part of a file. It was a term peculiar to the military system of
                    Sparta, whence it passed into the other systems of Greece, including the
                    Macedonian; but no data have been given from which its precise import can be
                    ascertained.</p></note> The junction of two or more files was denominated <hi

                    >protostates</hi> and <hi rend="italic">epistates</hi> of the one exactly
                    opposite the <hi rend="italic">protostates</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >epistates</hi> of the other; and one man, considered in reference to his
                    juxtaposition with another, was called <hi rend="italic">parastate.</hi> The
                    junction of all the files formed the phalanx; of which, therefore, the <hi
                    rend="italic">lochagi,</hi> or heads of files, constituted the front rank, and
                    the remaining <hi rend="italic">parastates</hi> in alignement, as far as the <hi
                    rend="italic">ou-rαgi</hi> or <hi rend="italic">serre-jiles,</hi> the depth.</p>
                <p>The phalanx, thus composed, was divided into two equal parts; one called the
                    right wing or head, and the other the left wing or rear. The point of separation
                    or division was variously denominated the navel, the mouth, and the jointure of
                    the phalanx. And as the principle of this formation was, that every combination
                    should be divisible into two equal parts, so the phalanx, as finally constituted
                    by Alexander, was composed of 16,384 heavy-armed men, the half of which number
                    was considered sufficient for light troops, and the half of that again, or the
                    fourth of 16,384, sufficient for cavalry; while the divisibility into equal
                    parts afforded great facility for executing with precision all manner of
                    evolutions, and extending or diminishing at pleasure the front of an army. The
                    total number of the phalanx being, as already stated, 16,384, and each file
                    consisting of 16 men, it follows that there were in all 1024 files. But each
                    combination of files had its peculiar and appropriate denomination. Two files
                    united formed a <hi rend="italic">dilochie,</hi> under <hi rend="italic"

                    phalanx, which thus consisted of two wings or diphalangarchies, four phalanges,
                    eight merarchies, 16 chiliarchies, 32 pentecosiarchies, 64 syntagmata, 128
                    taxiarchies, 256 tetrarchies, 512 dilochies, 1024 files, and 16,384 men. The
                    front might be extended by simply augmenting the distance between the files; the
                    phalanx was closed by lessening the distances between the ranks and the files,
                    and thus diminishing both its front and its depth. Its locked order was called
                    <hi rend="italic">synapism,</hi> in which the ranks and files were so closely
                    approximated that the soldier could not turn.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>It was to this locked order that Epaminondas
                    was indebted for the victories which he gained over the Lacedaemonians at
                    Leuctra and at Manincia. The Theban army was formed in columns of attack, upon a
                    front considerably less than the depth. The shock,· therefore, proved too much
                    for the Spartan phalanx, which was only eight deep. Xenophon compares it to that
                    of a heavy vessel striking a light one amidships with her bow, and dashing her
                    to pieces by the collision.</p></note> In this formation the men at the exterior
                    of the mass held their bucklers before them; the next rank raised their bucklers
                    over the heads of those immediately in front of them; the third rank held their
                    bucklers over the heads of the second, and so on; thus forming a sort of roof,
                    over which the archers in the rear sometimes passed to the front, and which,
                    from the bucklers being joined like the scales of a crocodile, resisted and
                    threw off the heaviest missiles discharged by the enemy. As every thing depended
                    on the steadiness of the heads of files and their <hi rend="italic"
                    >epistates</hi> of the second rank, both were <hi rend="italic">gens
                    d’élite</hi> or picked men. When the phalanx was closed for action, each man
                    occupied only three feet of ground in rank and file. The pikes or <hi
                    rend="italic">sarissae</hi> were 24 feet in length, 6 feet being behind and 18
                    feet before the grasp; consequently (as the ranks were three feet separate), the
                    second rank advanced the pike 15 feet, the third 12, the fourth 9, the fifth 6,
                    and the sixth 3 feet; thus presenting an array of points such as never bristled
                    along the front of any other military mass or column. The soldiers of the other
                    ranks, as they could not employ their pikes, pushed on those before them, and,
                    by their weight, served to augment the violence of the shock.<note

                    complement of ranks and files. The effective diminution fell, not upon the ranks
                    and files, but upon the number of the sections, which were retrenched in

                    Macedonian phalanx,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The
                    Macedonian phalanx, says Arrian, was as formidable in appearance as it was in
                    reality; and Paulus Aemilius confesses, that, when he saw, for the first time,
                    this imposing mass,’with its front bristling with the terrible <hi rend="italic"
                    >sarissae,</hi> he was struck with consternation. Guischardt alleges that it was
                    “plus terrible à l’aspect que dans l’effet and adds that Paulus “ne laissa pas
                    que de la battre avec ses Romains épars et distribués en plusieurs pelotons.”
                    But if Alexander had commanded it, the Roman would have told a different tale.
                    Guischardt has himself demonstrated that the loss of the battle of Cynocephale
                    was mainly, if not exclusively, owing to the stupidity of Philip in committing
                    the phalanx upon broken ground, where its flanks were uncovered, and the
                    principal advantages of its formation lost.</p></note> which was destined to

                    It yielded to superior tactics and greater mobility.</p>
                <p>The light-armed infantry were drawn up in different ways, according to the nature
                    of the ground and the disposition<pb break="no" facs="nls:193103205"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0703-3205-0588"/> of the enemy; sometimes before the phalanx,
                    sometimes behind it, sometimes on both wings, sometimes only on one. Their
                    formation was in all respects similar to that of the phalanx, and their files,
                    eight deep, were combined upon analogous principles. The Macedonian cavalry was
                    of various descriptions, as <hi rend="italic">hataphracti,</hi> light horse, and
                    <hi rend="italic">acrobolistoe.</hi> The <hi rend="italic">hatapliracti</hi> or
                    cuirassiers were completely covered with defensive armour; the man with a
                    cuirass and cuisses of iron scales, the horse with a frontlet and mail. Their
                    offensive arm was the Macedonian pike. The light cavalry, unencumbered with
                    heavy armour, carried lances and missile weapons. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >acrobo-listae</hi> had no lances, and, like the Armenian or Turkish cavalry,
                    used only the bow and arrow. They were a species of Cossacks or irregular horse,
                    and performed the duties of such. The usual formation of the regular cavalry for
                    attack was the cuneiform, which had been introduced by Philip, from an idea that
                    it was the order best calculated to pierce an enemy’s line; but they were
                    sometimes drawn up in squares, sometimes in the form of a rhombus, and sometimes
                    also in a line.</p>
                <p>The numerical strength of the Macedonian, like that of other ancient armies, can
                    only be conjectured from the numbers actually brought into the field. In the
                    time of Philip it probably never exceeded a grand phalanx, with its proportional
                    complements of light troops and cavalry, 28,603 in all, and a few thousands of
                    auxiliary troops. At the passage of the Ģranicus, Alexander’s army consisted of
                    above 30,000 infantry and 5000 cavalry; from which we may conclude that it was
                    composed of one grand phalanx, with its proportional complements of light troops
                    and cavalry, and about 6000 auxiliaries. But it was afterwards powerfully
                    reinforced; for Alexander paid great attention to recruiting, especially in
                    Greece, and had always generals detached from the army for the purpose of
                    raising new levies in that country. Accordingly we find that, at the battle of
                    Arbela, the Macedonian army consisted of two grand phalanges, or 32,768 heavy
                    armed infantry, two corps of <hi rend="italic">peltasrae</hi><note

                    54,000 regular and 6000 irregular troops.</p>
                <p>It has been supposed by some that this army, like that of Carthage, was
                    heterogeneous in its composition; that men of all nations were to be found in
                    its ranks; and that a stern, unrelaxing discipline constituted the only <hi
                    rend="italic">vinculum</hi> or tie by which the naturally discordant mass was
                    held together. There cannot possibly be a greater mistake. The Macedonians, it
                    is true, formed but the nucleus, as it were, of the army; and, both in the
                    reigns of Philip and Alexander, recruits were obtained in considerable numbers
                    from the neighbouring states of Greece. But whatever shades of difference might
                    have been produced by local circumstances and diversity of institutions, the
                    inhabitants of all these states Were essentially one and the same people;
                    identical in origin, distinguished by like peculiarities physical and moral, and
                    possessing a general national character. In what respects, then, can the
                    Macedonian army be considered heterogeneous? None but Greeks were admitted into
                    the ranks of the phalanx, or those of the light infantry and cavalry; no
                    barbarians were received even as auxiliaries. It was composed exclusively of
                    people of the same country and the same general character, who all spoke
                    dialects of the same language, shared a common temperament, and were
                    distinguished by their physical configuration, no less than by their
                    intellectual and moral attributes, from the inhabitants of the surrounding
                    nations. If ever there was an army, therefore, which discipline could render
                    more completely homogeneous than another, it was that of Macedon during the
                    reigns of Philip and Alexander; nor do we know of any modern army to which this
                    epithet can with equal justice be applied. The British army is composed of
                    English, Scotch, Irish, Welch, and Highlanders; the French, of Bretons, Normans,
                    Gascons, Alsatians, Savoyards, and many other tribes; the Austrian, of
                    Hungarians, Bohemians, Transylvanians, Croatians, and Germans; the Prussian, of
                    Silesians, Saxons, Poles, Pomeranians, and Brandenburgians; and the Russian, of
                    Muscovites, Poles, Sclavonians, Tartars, Circassians, Armenians, and
                    inny-merable other races; yet all these are considered national armies, and have
                    each, in fact, a national character. But if such assemblages are to be regarded
                    as homogeneous, we know not upon what principle the Macedonian army, composed
                    exclusively of Greeks, can possibly be viewed in a different light, or supposed
                    to have had no other bond of union than what was created by discipline
                    alone.</p>
                <p>The only other Greek armies which seem to require notice are those of the Thebans
                    and of the Achaean League. The Thcban army, like Theban independence, may be
                    said to have been created by Epaminondas, and to have expired when that great
                    captain fell in the arms of victory upon the field of Manincia. Still it is a
                    striking example of what genius and discipline may effect, even when called to
                    work upon the most unpromising materials. Epaminondas found it a rabble, and he
                    left it the most formidable military force which Greece had ever yet known. He
                    gave it that organization which rendered it. victorious at Leuctra and Manincia,
                    and which shook to the very foundation the power of the Lacedaemonians. Aware
                    that the Spartan phalanx was invincible by any similar formation, and that he
                    could only hope to prevail by bringing against it a greater concentration of
                    physical energy, he organized the Theban army in columns upon a front less than
                    their depth, so as to enable him to direct the whole or any part against a given
                    point of the enemy’s line, and to bear it down by an irresistible superiority of
                    force; and he adapted his tactics to this organization. At the battle of
                    Leuctra, accordingly, Epaminondas, observing the Lacedaemonians advance their
                    two wings before the centre, so as to form the order which the Greeks called the
                    half-moon, instantly attacked the centre of one of these wings, and, having
                    penetrated it, soon succeeded in throwing the whole into irretrievable
                    confusion. Here the onset was made by one wing in column against another in
                    comparatively open formation; and hence the Theban order of attack became the
                    oblique, which is erroneously supposed to be a discovery of modern times. At
                    Manincia the Lacedaemonians carefully avoided the blunder for which they had
                    paid so dear at Leuctra, and kept their forces more concentrated; but
                    Epaminondas, forming the whole of his infantry in a single column, precipitated
                    it upon a part of the enemy’s line, overthrew it, and thus decided the fortune
                    of the day. The Theban army, immediately after the battle of Leuctra, is said to
                    have amounted to 50,000 men. This, however, is probably an exaggeration.—With
                    regard to the army of the Achaean League, it continued insignificant for <pb

                    of a century after that celebrated confederacy was entered into. Aratus was the
                    first who placed it on a respectable footing, and taught it to conquer at
                    Ca-phyae; and he was succeeded by Philopoemen, incomparably the most scientific
                    commander of ancient times, who completed its organization, and led it to
                    victory at the second battle of Manincia, where the Spartans, under Macha-nidas,
                    were completely defeated, and the tyrant himself slain by the hand of the
                    Achaean chief. This victory was exclusively owing to the superior tactics and
                    dispositions of Philopoemen; who, instructed by the successes of the Romans, had
                    contrived, with infinite skill, to combine, in the formation and arrangement of
                    his troops, the advantages of the legionary order with those of the phalanx. The
                    invaluable fragment of Polybius, containing a description of the battle of
                    Manincia, gives no account of the numbers engaged. We learn, however, that
                    Philopoemen having assembled the troops of the League, spent eight months in
                    perfecting their discipline and organization before he ventured to commit them
                    in the field against so experienced and warlike an enemy as the Spartans.<note

                    all the parts are combined and adjusted together so as to insure the most
                    complete concert and unity of operation; and discipline is the mean by which
                    this important result is produced. It is in fact the art of creating a new
                    power; and so great is its efficacy that it sometimes developes in men those
                    qualities which it only professes to direct and regulate.</p>
                <p>This remark is strikingly exemplified in the history of the Carthaginian army.
                    That army was almost entirely composed of mercenaries, or at least of levies
                    drawn from countries differing in language, in manners, in customs, and in
                    character. In its ranks were to be found Africans, Spaniards, Gauls, Boians,
                    Insubrians, Etruscans, and various other races; yet such are the fusing effects
                    of discipline, that this apparently heterogeneous mass vanquished the Romans on
                    the Ticino; overthrew their legions in three pitched battles, at Trebia,
                    Thrasymenus, and Cannae; and, if Hannibal had known how to profit by victory,
                    might have planted the Carthaginian standards amidst the ruins of Rome. The
                    advantages of a truly national army are great, especially in reverses: it may be
                    beaten, but cannot easily be destroyed: and even its disasters may teach it that
                    experience which will ultimately conduct it to victory; as happened to the
                    Romans in ancient, and to the Russians under Peter the Great, in modern times.
                    But, on the other hand, many instances might be produced to show, that the most
                    effective armies may be organized out of the most discordant and unpromising
                    materials; and that, while nothing can supply the want of discipline, discipline
                    can almost atone for and remedy every thing. With an army composed as we have
                    already described, Hannibal maintained, during sixteen years, the war against
                    the Romans in Italy, without sustaining any serious reverse; nor did he
                    withdraw, until his presence was rendered necessary for the defence of his
                    country; which the successive defeats of the other Carthaginian commanders, both
                    by sea and land, had uncovered, and exposed in its turn to the attacks of an
                    invader. Finally, he was vanquished at Zama from the same cause which had
                    rendered him so often victorious—namely, superiority of discipline: for although
                    his military genius never shone forth more transcendently than in his last
                    field, and although his dispositions were in all respects worthy of his high
                    reputation, yet the raw and undisciplined levies which formed the strength, or
                    rather the weakness, of his army, were in no condition to contend with the Roman
                    legions, whom sixteen years of incessant warfare had improved both in discipline
                    and experience.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>We must

                    been alike incapable of comprehending the narrative of Polybius, or the
                    dispositions of Hannibal.</p></note> In reflecting upon the issue of this
                    decisive conflict, which terminated the long and sanguinary struggle between the
                    rival republics of Carthage and Rome; and, above all, in considering the
                    precarious nature of that power which is built on the uncertain foundation of
                    military glory; the mind insensibly passes from the contemplation of the fate of
                    the Carthaginian chief to that of a still greater commander, which in some
                    measure resembles it—from the days when these warlike republics contended for
                    the empire of the world, to our own times, when, in a new field of Zama, another
                    Scipio conquered another Hannibal.</p>
                <p>With regard to the numerical strength of the Carthaginian army, it appears to
                    have varied at different times. The force with which Xantippus defeated Regulus,
                    and made him prisoner, did not probably exceed 20,000 men; and we learn
                    incidentally that the heavy-armed infantry which the Lacedaemonian had formed in
                    phalanx, conformably to the tactics of his country, amounted to between 8000 and
                    9000 men, and were all native troops. But when the Carthaginians afterwards
                    invaded Spain, they recruited their armies from the population of the country,
                    and that of the neighbouring provinces of Gaul, until the total numerical
                    strength of these must have considerably exceeded 100,000 men. Livy assures us
                    that Hannibal set out on his expedition to Italy at the head of 100,000 foot and
                    10,000 horse, but that he lost 30,000 men in crossing the Alps; so that,
                    according to the Roman historian, he must have entered Italy with about 80,000
                    men. But the numbers actually brought into the field completely disprove this
                    statement: for it is admitted by Livy himself that, at Trebia, Hannibal had only
                    30,000 infantry and 10,000 cavalry, and that he vanquished at Cannae with 40,000
                    foot and 10,000 horse. We shall be nearer the truth, therefore, if we suppose
                    that the invasion of Italy was undertaken with, little more than half the number
                    of troops mentioned by Livy; and that the losses sustained in crossing the Alps
                    were, in a great measure, repaired by the recruits which Hannibal drew from the
                    Boians, Insubrians, and his other allies; a supposition which seems completely
                    borne out by the authority of Polybius. But when the Carthaginian general set
                    out from New Carthage for Italy he left two other armies in Spain; and, if we
                    assume these to have been each about 30,000 strong, while the force under his
                    own command exceeded 50,000, it will follow that, at this time, the
                    Carthaginians had considerably more than 100,000 men of all arms in the field.—
                    Let us now attend to the composition and organization of that strictly national
                    force with which these well-disciplined condottieri w ere called to contend, and
                    by which, after sustaining many reverses, they were ultimately overthrown.</p>
                <p>The army of Rome, in the days of her conquests, was perhaps the most perfect,
                    certainly the most formidable, which the world had yet seen; and the superiority
                    which it ultimately obtained over the military force of every nation to which it
                    was opposed, seems to have been exclusively owing to the pre-eminent excellence
                    of its discipline and organization. “Nulla enim alia rc videmus populum Romanum
                    orbem subegisse terrarum,” says Vegetius, “nisi armorum exercitio, disciplina

                    that which could be most effectually trained to the exercises and formed to the

                    most severe description, and had for their object not merely to instruct the
                    soldier in the use of arms, in marching, and in evolutions, but to develope and
                    improve to the utmost his physical powers; to inure him to labour, fatigue, and
                    hardships of all kinds; to qualify him for surmounting with ease the various
                    obstacles and difficulties incident to a state of active warfare; to give
                    precision and rapidity to his movements; and, above all, to create that
                    confidence in himself, and that unbounded reliance upon the efficacy of order,
                    subordination, and combined action, which nourish audacity, yet temper it with
                    coolness and steadiness. Besides the use of arms, of which we shall hereafter
                    speak, the young soldier was, accordingly, trained to the exercises of running,
                    leaping, vaulting, wrestling, and swimming, armed as well as unarmed: he was
                    required to perform long and frequent marches, at the rate of four miles an
                    hour, carrying a load of sixty pounds weight: he was carefully instructed in the
                    use of the tools necessary for throwing up all manner of field-works,
                    particularly fortifying the camp: and, even after he had been found qualified to
                    join the legion, he was constantly employed, while in camp, either in the
                    practice of these manly exercises, or in acquiring greater dexterity and
                    precision in the use of his weapons. The Roman soldier knew no intervals of
                    idleness, and was not allowed time to indulge in dissipation. The camp was his
                    home: war was his business: its exercises formed his amusement: its success
                    constituted his glory. In the legion to which he belonged were concentred all
                    his hopes, all his thoughts, and all his affections.</p>

                    whom they considered best fitted for the military service. The consul or the
                    praetor assembled in the Campus Martius, or in the Capitol, all the citizens,
                    who were bound to concur in the formation of the legions, raised every year,
                    conformably to a decree of the senate; and this obligation included all Romans
                    within the age above specified, who had not served twenty campaigns as foot
                    soldiers, or ten campaigns as horsemen or knights; with the exception, however,
                    of the lowest class, which was exempted from military service on account of its
                    poverty. The number of legions commonly raised was four;<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>A consular army consisted of two legions, and
                    of a certain number of troops furnished by the <hi rend="italic">socii</hi> or
                    allies of Rome. The infantry of the allies, according to Polybius, did not
                    surpass in number the legionary infantry in a consular army, but their cavalry
                    was double the number of the knights. The fifth part of their infantry and the
                    third part of their cavalry formed a <hi rend="italic">corps</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">d’élite,</hi> called <hi rend="italic">extraordinary</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">elect,</hi> under the immediate orders of the consul; while the
                    remainder of the social troops were divided into two corps, one called the right
                    and the other the left wing. Hence a consular army consisted, in Roman troops,
                    of GOOD legionaries of the line, 2400 <hi rend="italic">oelites,</hi> and G00
                    knights; in social troops, of G700 infantry of the wings, 1700 extraordinary
                    infantry, 800 cavalry of the wings, and 400 extraordinary cavalry; making a
                    total of 18,G00 men. But when Rome had a difficult war to carry on, two consular
                    armies were raised, and both the consuls took the field; which, in fact,
                    happened almost every year. Lastly, when urgent circumstances required it, the
                    consular armies were doubled and united in order to contend with a formidable
                    enemy. Thus the Romans assembi at Cannae four consular armies, oř nearly 80,000
                    men, to try the fortune of arms against Hannibal; and, in the heat of the second
                    Punic war, they raised as many as twenty-three legions, or considerably more
                    than 100,000 men. “Alors,” says Rogniat, “le≡ <hi rend="superscript"> ar</hi> '
                    mées se multiplièrent en raison de ce grand nombre de legions; les deux consuls
                    choisissaient celles qui leur convenaient, et le commandement des autres était
                    confié à des préteurs, à des proconsuls, et à des propréteurs.” <hi
                    rend="italic">{Considérations sur l’Art de la Guerre,</hi></p></note> and the
                    first step consisted in the appointment, either by the people or the consuls, of
                    six tribunes to each legion. The conscripts being classed according to their
                    tribes, the magistrate, charged with the levies, then elected four successively
                    from each tribe. Of every four thus designed the tribunes of each legion in
                    their turn chose one, whose name was immediately inscribed in its muster roll;
                    and this operation, which established a perfect equality in the composition of
                    the legions, was repeated until they had received their proper complement of
                    men. On the termination of the election each legionary individually took the <hi
                    rend="italic">sacramentum</hi> or military oath; swearing to be obedient to his
                    general, and to execute his commands in all things to the utmost of his power
                    and ability. Nor was this a vain ceremony; for the Romans, trained up in the
                    fear of the gods, had a peculiar reverence for the sanctity of an oath. Roman
                    citizens alone were admitted into the legions, until the time when the civil
                    wars led to the subversion of the republic, and the violation of all established
                    rules. Those, however, who had completed the prescribed period of service, or
                    had attained their fiftieth year, were no longer obliged to take arms in defence
                    of the state, and were only liable to be called out in the event of the city
                    being threatened with some imminent danger. But these brave veterans, habituated
                    to a military life, frequently inscribed themselves as volunteers, and thus
                    served both as models and examples to the young legionaries, who seldom failed
                    to profit by their experience, and generally showed an ambition to come up to
                    their standard.</p>
                <p>As soon as the military oath had been administered, the tribunes dismissed the
                    legionaries, having first indicated the time and place where they were
                    afterwards to assemble in order to be embodied. At the general muster, on the
                    day fixed for this purpose, the youngest and poorest in each legion were
                    selected as <hi rend="italic">velites</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> the next in

                    oldest and richest citizens elected to serve in the legions; the different
                    classes being thus arranged according to their arms, their fortune, and their
                    age. The legion was commonly composed of 1200 <hi rend="italic">hastati,</hi>
                    1200 <hi rend="italic">principes,</hi> 1200 <hi rend="italic">velites,</hi> 600
                    <hi rend="italic">triarii,</hi> and 300 cavalry or knights; thus making its

                    4500 men. The tribunes, in concert with the centurions, divided the three
                    classes of <hi rend="italic">hastati, principes, triarii,</hi> into ten <hi
                    rend="italic">ranks,</hi><hi rend="italic">manipules,</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >companies</hi> each: the t√½jwere distributed in equal portions among these
                    thirty manipules: and the cavalry were divided into ten parts, called <hi
                    rend="italic">turmae</hi> or troops. Such is the account given by Polybius, who,
                    doubtless, describes the legion as it was constituted in his time.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">hastati,</hi> so called from the <hi rend="italic"
                    >hasta</hi> or spear with which they were originally armed, commonly formed the
                    first line in the order of battle; the <hi rend="italic">principes</hi> were
                    placed in the second line; whilst the oldest and best legionaries, classed under
                    the name of <hi rend="italic">triarii,</hi> constituted a reserve in the third
                    line. The <hi rend="italic">triarii</hi> were originally the only troops armed
                    with the <hi rend="italic">pilum,</hi> a species of heavy javelin, which will be
                    described hereafter; and hence they are sometimes designated by the ancient
                    historians under the name of <hi rend="italic">pilani,</hi> while the <hi
                    rend="italic">principes</hi> and <hi rend="italic">hastati</hi> are denominated
                    <hi rend="italic">antepilani</hi><hi rend="italic">:</hi> but these
                    denominations necessarily ceased when the three lines adopted the same arms. The
                    <hi rend="italic">velites,</hi> distributed among the manipules, as already
                    mentioned, were the light infantry of the legion, of which they formed about a
                    fourth part; and known at first under the name of <hi rend="italic">rorarii</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">accensi,</hi> they were afterwards called <hi
                    rend="italic">velites,</hi> and ultimately <hi rend="italic">ferentarii</hi> But
                    the reader must be careful not to confound these light troops, which always
                    formed part of the legion, with the cohorts of archers and slingers attached to
                    the armies in the time of Caesar; since the latter were merely auxiliary troops,
                    and had nothing whatsoever in common with the legion. The legionary cavalry,
                    composed of a body of 300 horse, denominated the <hi rend="italic">ala</hi> or
                    wing, and forming about the twentieth part of the legion, was divided into ten
                    <hi rend="italic">turmae,</hi> of thirty horsemen each; while the <hi
                    rend="italic">turma</hi> was again subdivided into three <hi rend="italic"
                    >decuriae,</hi> of ten cavaliers each; and the whole was chosen from among the
                    <hi rend="italic">equites</hi> or knights, who formed one of the first orders at
                    Rome.</p>
                <p>When the classification had been completed, the tribunes of each legion proceeded
                    to the appointment of centurions. They commenced by naming ten <hi rend="italic"
                    >first centurions</hi> in each class, except that of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >velites;</hi> after which they proceeded to the nomination of an equal number
                    of <hi rend="italic">second centurions</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and the
                    legionary infantry being divided into ten manipules of <hi rend="italic"
                    >hastati,</hi> ten of <hi rend="italic">principes,</hi> and ten of <hi
                    rend="italic">triarii,</hi> among which the <hi rend="italic">velites</hi> were
                    equally distributed, they assigned a first and a second centurion to each
                    manipule; the first commanding the right, and the second the left of the
                    manipule, under the orders of the first, whose place he supplied in the case of
                    absence or death. The tribunes also named three decurions in each of the ten <hi
                    rend="italic">turmae</hi> of horse; but the decurion first named had the sole
                    command, and the two others were only his lieutenants. Thus a legion had sixty
                    centurions or officers of infantry, thirty decurions or officers of cavalry, and
                    six tribunes or officers of the staff. The tribunes commanded the legion each in
                    his turn during two months; and this continued to be the practice until the
                    epoch of the civil wars, when, for reasons sufficiently obvious, the command was
                    intrusted to a <hi rend="italic">legatus</hi> or lieutenant-general. The
                    tribunes on service superintended the establishment and fortification of the
                    camp, disposed the guards necessary for insuring its safety, transmitted to the
                    centurions the orders of the general, took care that these were duly executed,
                    and attended to the discipline and exercise of the troops; whilst the others
                    were placed by the <hi rend="italic">legatus</hi> or the consul at the head of
                    detachments, reconnoissances, or foraging parties, and intrusted with the
                    command of posts, or employed en particular missions, for raising contributions
                    of money, provisions, clothing, and arms in the conquered countries; in a word,
                    they were staff officers disposable for all kinds of service. The centurions
                    were divided into several grades. Besides the distinction of first and second,
                    established with reference to the manipule, they took precedence among
                    themselves according to the relative distribution of the classes to which they
                    belonged; so that a centurion of the <hi rend="italic">triarii</hi> ranked above
                    a centurion of the <hi rend="italic">principes,</hi> and a centurion of the <hi
                    rend="italic">principes</hi> above a centurion of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >hastati</hi> And the first centurion of each class, that is, the <hi
                    rend="italic">primi hastati centurio,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">primus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">princeps,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">primipilus</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">primipili centurio,</hi> commanded the whole of his class, or one
                    of the lines of battle of the legion; which accounts for the high consideration
                    that these three superior officers enjoyed among the Romans. They were commonly
                    admitted to the council of the general, along with the tribunes; and the <hi
                    rend="italic">primipilus,</hi> the chief of all the centurions, by reason of the
                    pre-eminence of his class, commanded the whole legion in the absence of the
                    tribunes. Further, each centurion and decurion chose for himself, or received
                    from the tribunes, a sub-officer to aid him in the details of the service; and
                    we learn from Vegetius, that there was moreover placed at the head of each squad
                    or tent of ten soldiers a <hi rend="italic">decanus</hi> or corporal, who
                    performed the duties of that humble rank.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>Such was the constitution of the legion in the time of Polybius, the friend and
                    contemporary of the second Scipio. But an important, we might almost say a
                    radical, change in its organization was afterwards introduced; a change which
                    has been ascribed to Marius, and which appears to have commenced at the epoch of
                    the wars against Jugurtha. The legions then ceased to be ranged in lines of <hi
                    rend="italic">hastati, principes,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">triarii</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> for the last order of battle, according to the ancient
                    formation, of which historians give any account, is that of Metellus against
                    Jugurtha, as described by Sallust. From this period we always find the legions
                    ranged by cohorts, without distinction of classes, in a double or a triple line.
                    The clas sification which had been originally occasioned by difference of arms
                    no longer served any purpose, after all the troops of the line were armed in the
                    same manner; except to divide the legion into three large bodies of about 1600
                    each, including the <hi rend="italic">velites,</hi> which formed part of them.
                    But experience proving that such bodies were too numerous to be easily directed
                    by a single commander, and too heavy and lumbering for the exigencies of Roman
                    taetics, their place was supplied by a number of smaller and more manageable
                    bodies, and the legion, consequently, divided into ten cohorts, each consisting
                    of three manipules, under six officers, who preserved their denomination and
                    command in their respective manipules. The force of the cohort was raised from
                    400 to 600 men, thus making the total strength of the legionary infantry 6000;
                    and the first cohort was composed of picked men, who were intrusted with the
                    eagle, under the orders of the <hi rend="italic">primipilus.</hi> A new order of
                    battle was also adopted, the legions being commonly drawn up in two lines of
                    five cohorts each, leaving small intervals between each cohort. But Caesar,
                    justly considering these <hi rend="italic">lacunae</hi> dangerous, and thinking
                    the new formation deficient in solidity, preferred a continuous alignement, and
                    recurred to the ancient formation in three lines, placing four cohorts of each
                    legion in the first, three in the second, and three in the third line.</p>

                <p>The civil troubles which led to the subversion of the republic produced still
                    further changes. For a time the legionary cavalry entirely disappeared, and
                    their place was supplied by auxiliary horse: strangers, and even slaves, were
                    admitted into the legions, the force of which varied from 4000 to 6000 men: and
                    the social troops disappeared by the admission of all the natives of Italy to
                    the rank of citizens. In the imperial times, as we learn from Vegetius, the
                    legion consisted of 6100 infantry and 726 cavalry. The decimal division of the
                    infantry into cohorts remained the same. “The cavalry,” says Gibbon, speaking of
                    that attached to an imperial legion, “without which the force of the legion
                    would have remained imperfect, was divided into ten troops or squadrons; the
                    first, as the companion of the first cohort, consisted of 132 men, whilst each
                    of the other nine amounted only to 66: the entire establishment formed a
                    regiment, if we may use the modern expression, of 726 horse, naturally connected
                    with its respective legion, but occasionally separated to act in the line; and
                    to compose a part of the wings of an army.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    >turmae</hi> was proportionally increased; and that no such inequality as that
                    mentioned by Gibbon existed between the <hi rend="italic">turma</hi> attending
                    the first cohort and those attached to the others. In fact the <hi rend="italic"
                    >turma</hi> or squadron, at this period, consisted of 32, or, including the
                    decurion, 33 men; and as the total number of cavalry belonging to the imperial
                    legion was 726, it follows that there were in all twenty-two <hi rend="italic"
                    >turmoe,</hi> of which four, or 132 men, were attached to the first cohort, and
                    two, or 66 men, to each of the remaining nine. The result in both cases,
                    however, is the same; while Gibbon’s statement may perhaps be preferred as
                    proceeding upon the more ancient division.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    have fancied that, in describing the formation of the infantry of the legion,
                    Vegetius was speaking of the cavalry.</p></note></p>
                <p>The armour of the Roman infantry consisted of the demi-cylindrical buckler or
                    shield, the cuirass or pectoral, the casque or helmet, and the ocrea or greave.
                    The demi-cylindrical buckler or shield, four feet in length by two feet and a
                    half in breadth, and constructed in the form of a tile, was composed of two or
                    three pieces of timber fashioned and secured together in the manner of staves,
                    covered with leather, strengthened at each extremity by a band of iron, and
                    provided in the middle with an <hi rend="italic">umbo</hi> or boss of metal, for
                    the purpose of turning aside the missilesand ' pikes of the enemy. The casque,
                    helmet, or head-piece of brass was variously formed, but generally fitted with
                    projections at the base for protecting the neck and shoulders, and attached
                    under the chin by <hi rend="italic">mxmionnieres,</hi> covered with scales of
                    brass. The cuirass or pectoral was a hollow plate of brass about a foot square,
                    adapted to the form of the chest, and fastened with thongs of leather protected
                    by metallic scales; but the centurions and foremost legionaries rendered
                    themselves still more impenetrable to the steel of the enemy by using chain
                    armour covered with brass scales. Lastly, the ocrea was a species of boot or
                    greave, fortified with iron, and worn on the right leg, which the soldier
                    advanced in striking his adversary.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    its origin. An unknown writer, quoted by Suidas, says that “the Celtiberians
                    excelled all others in the manufacture of swords, strongly-pointed and
                    double-edged; wherefore the Romans, laying aside the swords which had been in
                    use among their ancestors, replaced them, in the time of Hannibal, with the
                    Spanish blades. But (he adds) although they assumed the form, they were unable
                    to imitate the temper of the steel and the beauty of the workmanship.” Josephus
                    says that, in his time, the Romans had two swords—one of considerable length,
                    which hung at the left side, and another about a foot long, which they carried
                    on the light thigh; in other words, a sword and a dirk, like the Scotish
                    Highlanders. Similar changes in the arms of the soldiery may be remarked every

                    belonged exclusively to the light infantry or <hi rend="italic">vdites.</hi> It
                    was a species of dart, with a round shaft about three feet in length and an inch
                    in diameter, shod at one extremity with iron about four inches in length, and
                    tapering to a very sharp point. In the day of battle the light troops had each
                    seven of these weapons, which they launched at the enemy with much dexterity and
                    precision. When it became necessary to have recourse to the sword before the
                    whole or any part of the javelins were thrown, the soldier passed them to his
                    left hand, which remained free in consequence of the buckler being attached to
                    the left arm. The light troops were also provided with bows and arrows, and
                    slings, which they used in skirmishing at a distance. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >pilum</hi> or heavy dart, intended to serve principally as a missile, was
                    originally borne by the <hi rend="italic">triarii</hi> alone, whence the name of
                    <hi rend="italic">ρilam,</hi> but was afterwards appropriated to the <hi

                    was of such a thickness as to be easily grasped by the hand;<note

                    the length of the weapon, and the weight of its iron, would have rendered it an
                    impracticable arm. Dionysius of Halicarnassus confirms this opinion by

                    seven feet in length. The iron, however, was of the same length as the wood,
                    extending to the middle of the shaft, which was firmly inserted in it, and made
                    fast by nails driven transversely; and it was of a square form, of an inch <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193103270" xml:id="kp-eb0703-3270-0593"/> and a half at its
                    greatest thickness, but its diameter gradually diminished to the point, which
                    was exceedingly sharp, and near to which was placed a hook or barb, that served
                    to retain the weapon wherever it penetrated. Besides this arm, which was
                    necessarily heavy, the soldiers were sometimes provided with another of the same
                    kind, but less massive both in the wood and the iron, which they held in the
                    left hand, and discharged immediately after the former. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >pilum</hi> was a weapon peculiar to the Romans. *As soon as they came within a
                    proper distance of the enemy, they began the combat by launching these heavy
                    darts, with a force which, from their weight and the temper of the steel points,
                    caused them frequently to penetrate both buckler and cuirass, so as to inflict
                    the most hideous and desperate wounds. Having discharged these missiles, the
                    legionaries instantly drew their swords and rushed upon the enemy with the
                    utmost impetuosity, before he could recover from the effects of the volley of
                    <hi rend="italic">pila,</hi> by which his first ranks were generally
                    overthrown.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>For a

                    arm “ne permettoit pas de le darder de loin,” as Guischardt says. It was the
                    business of the <hi rend="italic">velites</hi> to harass the enemy with their
                    javelins and other missiles before the action became general. As the hostile
                    lines approached, the light troops retired through the intervals or by the
                    flanks, where they generally took their station; and when the former were within
                    a short distance of each other, the <hi rend="italic">hastati</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">principes</hi> darted their <hi rend="italic">pila,</hi> and then
                    rushed on, sword in hand, to close combat. Hence the proverb employed by
                    Vegetius to describe the proximity of two armies: <hi rend="italic">Ad</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">pila et spathas ventum</hi><hi rend="italic">est.</hi></p></note>
                    The pike of the <hi rend="italic">triarii,</hi> a weapon equally adapted for
                    attack or defence, onset or resistance, was longer, less thick, and consequently
                    more manageable, than <hi rend="italic">Úiepilurn,</hi> which was of little use
                    except at the moment of commencing battle. Armed with this weapon, the veteran
                    reserve of the legion often awaited, <hi rend="italic">de piedferme,</hi> the
                    shock of cavalry as well as infantry; and Livy assures us that they seldom or
                    never quitted their pikes in battle. “The <hi rend="italic">triarii,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">''</hi> says he, speaking of a particular occasion, “disfigured
                    the faces of the Latins with their pikes, the points of which had been blunted
                    in the combat.” These <hi rend="italic">troupes d’elite,</hi> therefore, may be
                    considered as the pikemen of the legion; although instances are to be found
                    where they abandoned the pike and had recourse to the sword, which was always
                    the weapon hi which the Romans placed the greatest confidence, and with which,
                    indeed, their most celebrated feats in arms were achieved. It may be proper to
                    add, that, although this description principally applies to the legion as
                    constituted in the time of Polybius, and although great changes were
                    subsequently introduced, yet the arms, offensive as well as defensive, of the
                    legionaries, remained nearly the same; with this exception, however, that all
                    the troops of the line were at length armed in precisely the same manner,
                    namely, with the Spanish sword and the <hi rend="italic">pilum.</hi></p>
                <p>The horse had very nearly the same armour as the foot, and they were latterly
                    provided with offensive arms similar to those used by the cavalry of the Greeks;
                    namely, with a lance, having a shaft resembling two cones joined together at
                    their bases, and pointed at both extremities, and a long, large sword, suspended
                    by a shoulder-belt at the right side. There was a time, indeed, when they had
                    only slender lances, pointed at one extremity, and wore no cuirass; but
                    experience soon showed the necessity of adopting the Greek arms and equipments.
                    The Roman cavalry was generally composed of a superior description of men,
                    denominated knights, who on all occasions displayed the greatest valour; but
                    they seldom mustered in force sufficient to produce great results, and their
                    organization appears to have been in many respects defective.</p>
                <p>It is evident, that a man placed on the back of a horse, without a saddle, or
                    stirrups to serve as a fulcrum for reaction, can never exert half his proper
                    force, nor combine it effectively with the momentum acquired from the velocity
                    and weight of his horse. “Ces cavaliers,” says Rogniat, “ne 'pouvaient être
                    choisis que parmi les chevaliers, qui formaient un des premiers ordres à Rome.
                    L’état leur fournissait ordinairement des chevaux; mais, peu habitués à
                    l’équitation, ou persuadés qu’on cst plus fort à pied qu’à cheval, ils mettaient
                    souvent pied à terre, pour prendre one part plus décisive aux combats sérieux.
                    Telle était (he adds) l’opinion des Romains, de la supériorité de l’infanterie
                    sur la cavalerie, que, non content de n’avoir qu’un petit nombre de cavaliers,
                    ils les transformaient encore en fantassins dans les occasions critiques.”<note

                <p>The Roman generals, even in the time of the consuls, do not seem to have followed
                    any particular order of battle,but to have changed it according to
                    circumstances, or the nature otthe enemy they had to contend with. This is
                    evinced by the various dispositions which were made at the battles of Tunis, of
                    Cannae, of Zama, and many others that might be mentioned. But still the chequer
                    order or <hi rend="italic">quincunx</hi> was that most frequently employed in
                    the earlier times of the republic; owing, doubtless, to the facility it afforded
                    of forming line or column at pleasure. Leaving the <hi rend="italic"
                    >velites</hi> or light troops out of view, as constituting no part of the main
                    battle, the reader will observe that the manipules of the first line, or the <hi
                    rend="italic">hastati,</hi> were formed upon a front varying according to the
                    depth, which was generally ten, but not unfrequently six; and that the interval
                    between each manipule was exactly equal to its front. Thus, supposing the legion
                    5000 strong, a manipule of 140 men would be ranged ten deep upon a front of
                    fourteen; and as each soldier occupied three feet,<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The ranks of the manipule being also drawn up
                    at the distance of three feet from one another, the whole space occupied by the
                    Roman soldier was consequently nine square feet of ground; and this open order
                    was seldom departed from, even in the charge. It is to be observed, however,
                    that the second rank of the manipule was so disposed as to cover the intervals
                    of the first, the third to cover those of the second, the fourth to cover those
                    of the third, and so on to the last; in other words, the arrangement of each
                    manipule individually was a precise type of their collective disposition in
                    order of battle.</p></note> the extent of front presented by a manipule would
                    accordingly be fourteen yards. Since the first line, therefore, consisted of ten
                    manipules, it contained of course nine intervals of fourteen yards each; exactly
                    opposite to which, but at a considerable distance in the rear, were stationed
                    nine of the ten manipules of the second line, or <hi rend="italic"
                    >principes,</hi> drawn up in the same manner as those of the first, upon fronts
                    of equal extent; the tenth manipule of the latter outflanking by the whole
                    length of its front the right or the left wing, as it might be, of the first
                    line. The <hi rend="italic">triarii,</hi> of less depth than the <hi
                    rend="italic">hastati</hi> and <hi rend="italic">principes,</hi> but for the
                    most part in continuous formation, occupied the third line. Now, it must be
                    obvious at the first glance, that this order of battle presented several
                    important advantages. By advancing the manipules of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >principes</hi> through the above-mentioned intervals,until they dressed with
                    those of the <hi rend="italic">hastati,</hi> line was at once formed: again, by
                    moving them fourteen yards either to the right or left, the depth of the
                    formation was doubled; while, by placing the manipules of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >triarii</hi> exactly behind those of the <hi rend="italic">principes,</hi> as
                    was done when the legions were menaced by elephants, the whole was formed into
                    columns, separated into intervals equal to their respective fronts, through
                    which these animals, pursued and goaded by the <hi rend="italic">velites,</hi>
                    might be driven to the rear, without doing <pb break="no" facs="nls:193103283"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0703-3283-0594"/>any mischief. Lastly, if it was desired to form
                    the legion in three continuous lines, this was instantly effected by simply
                    closing up the intervals between the manipules of the first and second lines;
                    the <hi rend="italic">triarii</hi> or reserve being, as we have already said,
                    drawn up in a continuous formation, except when it became necessary to open a
                    passage for elephants. And all these various evolutions were performed with a
                    rapidity and precision which have seldom been equalled and never surpassed by
                    the troops of any other nation.</p>
                <p>At a later period, however, the Roman tacticians employed a different order of
                    battle, distinguished for its greater compactness and solidity, as well as for
                    the facility and rapidity with which it might be formed from the order of march,
                    even in presence of the enemy. According to this method each manipule of the
                    legion formed only a single rank in its order of battle; consequently the two
                    classes of <hi rend="italic">hastati</hi><hi rend="italic">and</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">principes,</hi> ranged each upon its first manipule as a front,
                    formed two lines ten deep. But as each man occupied three feet every way, and as
                    the lines were separated by an interval equal to half the extent of their front,
                    it is obvious that each line occupied a front of 120 yards, by from ten to
                    twelve yards in depth; and that they were separated from each other by an
                    interval of about 60 yards. Again, at an equal distance in rear of the <hi
                    rend="italic">principes,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">triarii</hi> formed the
                    reserve of the legion in the third line; and the whole, ranged in this manner in
                    three lines, constituted a square order, as deep as it was broad; while the <hi
                    rend="italic">turmoe</hi> of the cavalry covered the flanks of the lines, and
                    the eagle or standard of the legion was intrusted to the keeping of <hi
                    rend="italic">Úte</hi><hi rend="italic">primipilus</hi> on the right of the line
                    of the <hi rend="italic">triarii.</hi> This order, usually denominated <hi
                    rend="italic">legio quadrata,</hi> was that adopted by all skilful generals when
                    in presence of an enemy. But the different legions composing an army were ranged
                    upon the same principle, with reference to one another, as the different ranks
                    of the same legion; in other words, they were formed <hi rend="italic"
                    >en</hi><hi rend="italic">echelon</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> each legionary
                    line thus making one of the sections of the column, and the baggage occupying
                    the intervals, while the <hi rend="italic">velites</hi> covered the flanks. In
                    this order of march, if the enemy threatened an attack on the front, each legion
                    in succession formed line with that at the head of the column; the second almost
                    in an instant, the third somewhat later, and the fourth, or the most remote, in
                    about seven minutes, which were accounted sufficient for developing the order of
                    battle on the front. But the order of battle on the flank was of still more
                    rapid formation. For, the baggage withdrawing from between the sections, and
                    assembling on the side opposite to the enemy, each legion executed what is
                    technically called a <hi rend="italic">quart de conversion</hi> on its <hi
                    rend="italic">hastati,</hi> and the whole army immediately found itself in order
                    of battle; two minutes being sufficient for the performance of this simple
                    evolution. It seems evident, then, that the celebrated <hi rend="italic"
                    >quadratum agmen</hi> of the Romans, which has hitherto been so often treated
                    of, and so little understood, consisted of a certain number of <hi rend="italic"
                    >legiones</hi><hi rend="italic">quadratae</hi> disposed <hi rend="italic"
                    >en</hi><hi rend="italic">echelon,</hi> or at least in column, as we have just
                    described: and, from the advantages of this order of march, particularly its
                    rapid convertibility into an order of battle either on the front or the flank,
                    it is easy to understand the reason why the Roman historians have censured so
                    severely the generals who neglected to adopt it in presence of the enemy. So
                    much, then, for Roman tactics, as connected with the elementary formation of
                    those brigades or divisions which constituted the units of Roman armies.</p>
                <p>The distinguishing characteristic of the legion consisted in its astonishing
                    mobility, united with its power of preserving its order of battle undisturbed,
                    and of constantly rallying when forced to give way. It possessed a sort of
                    flexibility which enabled it to adapt itself to every change and variety of
                    circumstances; and no other military body, perhaps, ever executed so numerous
                    evolutions in the presence of an enemy. Its attack was impetuous and formidable;
                    but if that failed, it then displayed its most characteristic excellence, by
                    fighting in retreat. In this way it vanquished the phalanx, although it was
                    unable to withstand the direct shock of that dense body in the open field. At
                    the battle where Flaminius defeated Philip in Thessaly, the Macedonian phalanx
                    gained considerable ground on the legions; but the Romans, although forced to
                    give way, preserved their order,—returned repeatedly to the charge,—and, even
                    while in the act of retiring, extended their line so as to gain the flank of the
                    Greeks. Philip durst neither accelerate his march, nor send out any detachment
                    in pursuit; so that twenty manipules had time to turn his flank and fall upon
                    his rear, which speedily decided the fate of the battle. As the phalanx acted
                    with long pikes, and in close order, the least derangement caused by the. ardour
                    of the soldier in pursuit, or by inequality of ground in its march, necessarily
                    exposed it to the legion; which, dividing itself into a number of separate corps
                    with the same facility that it formed one corps and one line, possessed the
                    power of attacking it on two or more sides at the same time. “La legion doit
                    done,” says Guischardt, “être envisagée sous deux faces. Comme infanterie en
                    bataille contre one autre infanterie, elle cut son ordonnance particulière à
                    rangs et files ouverts, conformément à ses armes; et alors elle n’cut rien de
                    commun avec la phalange. Lorsqu’elle a eu de la cavalerie en tête, elle cessa
                    d’avoir son ordonnance particulière.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    peculiarly formidable, durst not attack the legions commanded by Marc Antony,
                    and confined itself to harassing them from a distance with its arrows. At the
                    battle of Nicoolis, a single legion of the army of Domitius defeated and put to
                    flight the whole cavalry of king Pharnaces; and, with a handful of infantry and
                    some horse, Pompey defied the numerous cavalry of king Oroses.</p></note> but
                    neither as infantry against infantry, nor as infantry prepared to resist
                    cavalry, which duty was principally performed by the <hi rend="italic"
                    >triarii,</hi> until all distinction of classes and arms merged in a homogeneous
                    formation, had it any thing in common with the phalanx; for its victories, no
                    less than its reverses, had demonstrated the inutility of deep formations, and
                    showed that its real power depended on its distributive rather than its
                    concentrative energies,—on its mobility and flexibility rather than on its
                    weight or impulsion. Hence, on the day of Pharsalia, it was remarked, as an
                    extraordinary circumstance, that Pompey had formed his legions ten deep; a
                    novelty which, as every schoolboy knows, served no other purpose, on that
                    occasion, except to add to the carnage.</p>
                <p>In following the Romans in their wars under the emperors, we find their
                    discipline and their tactics declining from age to age, in the same manner as
                    they had advanced and improved. The spirit of change, though productive of some
                    ameliorations, proved ultimately fatal to the legion. As long as the Romans
                    continued faithful to the precepts and rules of the ancient masters, their
                    infantry maintained its superiority: in proportion as these were departed from
                    it declined; until at length, having lost all its distinctive qualities, it was
                    constantly beaten and overthrown by the numerous cavalry of the barbarians. To
                    ascribe the gradual declension and ultimate fall of this infantry to luxury,
                    refinement, love of ease, corruption of <pb break="no" facs="nls:193103296"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0703-3296-0595"/>manners, or other analogous causes, is merely to
                    indite silly common-places, displaying the most profound ignorance of history
                    and of human nature. Its catastrophe was occasioned by the decay of discipline
                    alone. For experience shows that hardy and effective soldiers may be formed in
                    the most polished as well as in the rudest and most uncivilized periods of
                    society; and that nothing more is necessary to produce this result than an
                    uncompromising system of discipline. Accordingly, under Vespasian, and Titus,
                    and Trajan, and Hadrian, and Aurelian, ancí other warlike emperors, who enforced
                    the precepts of the ancient masters, and restored the ancient discipline, the
                    Roman infantry regained its reputation, and proved itself as formidable as it
                    had ever been in the best times of the republic. The corruption was not in the
                    soldiers, but in the men by whom they were organized; in those whom the
                    experience of so many ages, and the conquest of the world, had failed to impress
                    with a due conviction of the value of that system of discipline by which such
                    prodigies had been performed. “On ne peut voir sans indignation,” says
                    Guischardt, “la mauvaise ordonnance que les Romains autems de Végece avoient
                    substituée aux anciens modèles. Ils étoient rangés sur six de hauteur, et même
                    quelquefois sur trois. Chaque rang avoit des armes différentes, dont la plupart
                    étoient des armes de jet, comme des arcs et des frondes. D’un rang à l’autre il
                    y’avait six pieds d’intervalle, et dans les files on avoit retranché les trois
                    pied de distance, pareequ’on ne se battoit plus avec l’epée: on avoit même
                    oublié le véritable usage du <hi rend="italic">pilum.</hi> Le troisième et le
                    quatrième rangs dévoient de teins en tems se détacher, et charger à la tête de
                    la ligne, et revenir ensuite à leur poste. On ne sauroit rien imaginer de plus
                    pitoyable. Ces deux chapitres de Végece marquent bien clairement l’ignorance de
                    l’auteur, et la décadence de la bonne discipline chez les Romains.”<note

                    others still more absurd which succeeded them, what results could be anticipated
                    except those which history has recorded; namely, disgraceful defeats, calamitous
                    reverses and, at length, the final overthrow of the Roman power itself? The
                    legions, degenerated into a feeble militia, sold the empire which they were
                    incapable of defending; and having neither the courage which sometimes supplies
                    the place of discipline, nor the discipline which supplies that of mere courage,
                    they fell an easy prey to the swarms of Goths, Huns, and Vandals, by whom it was
                    successively overrun, and at last completely destroyed.</p>
                <p>The fall of the Western Empire, like that of a colossal structure, was succeeded
                    by a thick cloud, which overspread Europe, covering it with darkness and
                    desolation. All that remained of science or of art perished in its ruins, and
                    the only relic of the catastrophe was the shadow of a mighty name. But the
                    barbarians who had subverted the Roman power appear to have brought with them,
                    from their forests and wildernesses, the elements of a system which was destined
                    to thicken the darkness in which it originated; to bind Europe for ages in the
                    fetters of the most abject thraldom; nay, even to maintain a long and fierce
                    struggle against the reviving energies of the human mind, and the regenerative
                    powers of society. Its foundations were laid in their peculiar character and
                    habits, as affected by their position and their wants; and, as they had fought
                    neither from the love of glory, to which they were insensible, nor from a thirst
                    of vengeance, which nothing had contributed to stimulate, the only fruits they
                    dreamt of reaping from victory were the spoils of the vanquished. The countries
                    which all had conquered were considered the property of all, and each claimed a
                    share proportionate to his services and the number of his retainers. Subsisting
                    rights or possessions weighed as nothing in the estimation of these wild hordes,
                    who sought for establishments in genial climates and fertile regions. They
                    demanded a territorial division and apportionment, which was accordingly made
                    upon some rude principle of equalization. But, as these lands were the reward of
                    military service, so they were to be held by that tenure alone. The common
                    interest and the common defence required that this condition should be annexed
                    to the allotment, or, as it was afterwards called, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >feu.</hi> Each great vassal of the liege lord was bound to have in constant
                    readiness to take the field, a certain number of men, clothed, armed, and
                    equipped at his own expense. Hence arose <hi rend="italic">tine feudal
                    system,</hi> which, founded on military rather than civil principles, was an
                    aggregation of petty sovereigns and petty principalities, under a nominal head,
                    to whom all swore fealty, but few or none owned obedience; a military
                    aristocracy, in short, under the mask of a monarchy. But this system, however
                    well calculated to keep alive a spirit of ferocity, seemed to oppose a
                    formidable barrier to the revival of the military art. Its maxims, necessarily
                    hostile to the establishment of a standing army, by which the great barons might
                    have been coerced, limited the force of the state to the contingents of feudal
                    militia, which the crown vassals could bring into the field; a tumultuary mass,
                    without coherence, which the first victory or the first reverse generally
                    dispersed. During this period, accordingly, the wars of Europe were desultory
                    and indecisive. An incursion constituted a campaign, and a foray an expedition.
                    Armies were everywhere without order and without science; battles were gained by
                    accident or by valour, never by discipline; while conquests, rapid as torrents,
                    were generally as destructive and as transitory. The love of military glory was
                    extinguished; petty wars, occasioned by baronial feuds, raged fiercely, preying
                    upon the vitals of society; and the fruits of organized barbarism were general
                    misery and desolation. The people were abject serfs, the barons ferocious
                    brutes, the sovereign an absolute cipher. Anarchy, tyranny, ignorance, and
                    spiritual thraldom, formed the characteristics of the first ages of
                    feudalism.</p>
                <p>At length, in the eleventh century, arose a monk, called Peter the Hermit, who
                    preached with all the fervour, and more than all the success, of any known
                    apostle, the duty of recovering the Holy Sepulchre from the infidels; and as the
                    church lent her powerful aid to second the efforts of Peter’s enthusiasm, the
                    contagion soon spread throughout every part of Europe, and thousands of all
                    countries rushed forward to enlist under the banner of the cross. The history of
                    mankind affords no parallel to the madness that was thus produced, either as
                    regards its universality or its duration. It affected all Christendom in nearly
                    an equal degree; and, during two centuries, army after army marched for
                    Palestine, to melt away under the sultry sun of Syria, or to be mowed down by
                    the swords of the Saracens. But it agitated the minds of men by a new and
                    powerful impulse; and although its essence consisted in the wildest fanaticism
                    which had ever taken possession of the species, yet that inexplicable frenzy,
                    combining with a spirit of enterprise and adventure, gave birth to institutions
                    which were destined to exert a powerful influence upon the whole frame of
                    society, and which have left a marked impression even on the manners, customs,
                    and feelings of modern times. Viewed in a military light, the armies of the
                    crusaders were mere <pb break="no" facs="nls:193103309"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0703-3309-0596"/>tumultuary masses, impelled by fanaticism to deeds
                    of heroic valour, but as destitute of order and discipline as their leaders and
                    chiefs were ignorant of military science; nor had all the reverses they
                    sustained the effect of inculcating the simplest principles of the art of war,
                    or teaching the necessity of adopting some kind of organization. Every thing was
                    trusted to numbers without combination, and to individual bravery exerted as
                    chance or impulse happened to direct. And so deeply engrained in men’s minds was
                    the spirit of feudalism, and so incompatible did that spirit show itself with
                    the slightest advancement in the military art, that the mailed chivalry of the
                    ages immediately succeeding the crusades, although offering the finest elements
                    that ever existed for the organization of an invincible force, appears at no
                    time to have had any principle of effective combination, or to have been capable
                    of acting with unity and concert in any grand operation. Yet the principal
                    strength of armies in the middle ages consisted in their cavalry; which,
                    composed of men of superior grade, and formidable from its bravery no less than
                    from the armour of proof in which it was encased, easily proved itself superior
                    to infantry without formation, and with no other discipline than that which
                    instinct dictates even to the most barbarous tribes.</p>
                <p>But a new epoch approached. Gunpowder was invented, or at least improved, by
                    Berthold Schwartz, a Franciscan monk of Cologne, and was first employed in
                    warlike operations in the early part of the fourteenth century. This discovery,
                    as Guibert justly remarks, did not lead to any <hi rend="italic">immediate</hi>
                    improvement in the art of .war: indeed a century and a half was necessary in
                    order to make the use of fire-arms general; but it is nevertheless to be
                    considered as the real cause of the complete reform which was at last effected
                    in the constitution of armies, as well as in their discipline and tactics. Since
                    the first employment of gunpowder, there have been <hi rend="italic">seven
                    principal periods</hi> in the history of the military art.</p>
                <p>The first begins with the employment of cannon, and extends to Charles VIII.’s
                    campaign in Italy; or from the early part of the fourteenth until towards the
                    end of the fifteenth century. This period, during which the art of war began to
                    revive from the state of barbarism into which it had sunk since the downfall of
                    the Roman empire, includes the wars of the Spaniards against the Moors, of the
                    English against the French, and finally, of the Italian republics against each
                    other. The cavalry, composed of the nobility and gentry, still constituted the
                    flower of armies, and formed the chief support of princes and their kingdoms. At
                    the storming of fortresses, or when important posts were to be occupied and
                    defended, and a bold, determined soldiery was required, the knights dismounted
                    and fought on foot. They were the dragoons of that age. Each knight was attended
                    by his esquire; and, besides these there were also archers, generally the
                    vassals of the knights, who, being more lightly armed, and riding smaller
                    horses, served as a kind of light horsemen. At the beginning of the fourteenth
                    century, indeed, the distinction of heavy and light horse was common in European
                    armies. The former, consisting of tenants <hi rend="italic">in</hi><hi

                    war-horses, which, like their riders, were covered either with chain or plate
                    armour, or with both; and these men of iron carried a long and powerful lance
                    armed with an iron head, a long sword, a short sword, a dagger, and a mace or
                    battle-axe.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Meyrick’s

                    man to man; each armed knight singling out his opponent, and riding against him
                    with his couched lance, in order to throw him out of his saddle, or to make him
                    prisoner. The esquires, or armour-bearers, followed as a second rank, or at
                    least acted as seconds to the knights, whom they assisted in battle, bringing
                    them fresh arms and horses when required, and seeking opportunities of
                    distinguishing themselves in order to obtain the honour of knighthood. Nothing,
                    however, was known of scientific movements, until Charles the Bold compiled an
                    exercise book in 1473, instructing cavalry how to attack in close and extended
                    order, or to link the horses and fight on foot. An engagement was generally
                    commenced by single knights riding forward and challenging opponents from the
                    hostile army; and the result of these single combats sometimes determined the
                    fate of the day.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The

                    general of the Hussites.</p></note></p>
                <p>The second period, from the campaign of Charles VIII. in Italy to the beginning
                    of the wars in the Netherlands, or from the end of the fifteenth to the middle
                    of the sixteenth centuries, comprises the wars of the French, Spaniards, and
                    Germans, in Italy. During this period chivalry gradually declined, and war began
                    to assume a new aspect. At the close of the contest with England in 1445,
                    Charles VII. of France established the first standing army, consisting of 16,000
                    infantry and 9000 cavalry, divided into fifteen <hi rend="italic"

                    he appropriated funds for the payment of these troops, and appointed officers to
                    discipline and command them; and, although apprehensive at first as to the
                    success of the experiment, he at length succeeded in organizing a force, which
                    enabled his successor to repress the turbulent spirit of the feudal aristocracy,
                    to strengthen the power of the crown, and to carry on foreign operations with a
                    consistency and vigour hitherto unknown. The Italian campaign of Charles VIII.
                    proved the superiority of a standing army over an assemblage of feudal militia,
                    and consequently established its reputation. With a force of about 20,000 men,
                    he overran the whole of Italy; and, had his ambition been equal to his success,
                    or rather had he known how to reap the fruits of victory, he might have rendered
                    himself permanent master of that country. Ot,her nations imitated the example of
                    France: a change took place in the military system of Europe: the practice of
                    calling out knights ceased of itself: and mercenary, or at least paid troops,
                    regularly disciplined and organized, became the only force that was trusted or
                    employed. The characteristic of this period was dec/ formation, both in the
                    cavalry and the infantry.</p>
                <p>The third period comprehends the great war of independence, carried on by the
                    Netherlander, in order to emancipate themselves from the yoke of Spain; and it
                    extends from 1568 to the general suspension of hostilities in 1609. Here fought,
                    on one side, art, and an army formed by the experience of more than half a
                    century of war, under Charles V. and his son Philip II.; on the other, the
                    inhabitants of the Low Countries, living only by trade and the arts of peace. A
                    people, consisting chiefly of manufacturers and merchants, inhabiting a country
                    of small extent, and already much exhausted by a long-continued exercise of

                    more contrary to what the parties had reason to anticipate. But the struggle was
                    protracted; and in proportion as the Netherlanders were formed to war, the
                    bravery and discipline of the Spaniards relaxed. Under the skilful tuition and
                    able conduct of Nassau, the foe which had at first appeared so contemptible to
                    the haughty Spaniards, tore the laurels from their brows, and at length drove
                    them, defeated and disgraced, from the country which had suffered so long under
                    their grinding oppression and their insolent misrule. This war was followed by
                    great changes, both in the organization and tactics of armies. The cavalry was
                    divided into cuirassiers and light horse; the use of the lance was
                    discontinued,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>La lance,”

                    the present day; for experience has shown, that cavalry can never make any
                    serious impression by means of fire-, arms, while, with swords alone, they are

                    were now trained to execute a variety of movements and manoeuvres at full speed.
                    The infantry was also placed upon a better footing, both in respect to
                    discipline and formation; although the prejudice in favour of columns or masses
                    seems still to have continued, notwithstanding frequent experience of their
                    inutility, as well as of the destruction to which they were exposed from the
                    concentric fire of artillery.</p>
                <p>The fourth period comprises the Thirty Years War, the pretext forwhich, according
                    to Bulow, was the happiness of heaven, but the motive the goods of the earth: it
                    extends from 1618 to 1648. The peace which had terminated the struggle for
                    independence in the Low Countries, after a [&gt;rotracted contest of above half
                    a century in duration, asted only nine years; when a new war broke out, which
                    can only be considered a continuation of the former. The hero of this war was
                    Gustavus Adolphus; and he, like Prince Maurice of Nassau,<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Bismark’s <hi rend="italic">Cavalry
                    Tactics,</hi> p. 307; Guibert, <hi rend="italic">Essai Général de Tactique,</hi>
                    p. 68.</p></note> was the creator of new tactics. This warlike monarch departed
                    from the dense formation of his predecessors, and drew up his infantry six deep;
                    which was considered an innovation that nothing but his success could justify.
                    His opponents, Tilly and Wallenstein, formed their infantry in solid masses
                    thirty deep; which, nevertheless, proved unable to contend with the linear
                    formation of the Swedish troops. Until about the middle of this war, it still
                    continued the practice to form cavalry in from four to eight ranks. But Gustavus
                    also departed from this rule, and formed it in three ranks; although it appears
                    from Harte, that, at the battle of Leipsic, it was drawn up four deep, probably
                    on account of the dense formation of the imperial cavalry, which was formed in
                    eight ranks. In the intervals he stationed platoons of infantry, fifty and
                    upwards strong, as well as light guns; doubtless from a conviction that cavalry,
                    unless supported, were unable to contend with infantry. His great object appears
                    to have been, to give greater mobility to the two principal arms of a military
                    force, and thus to gain in celerity of movement what he had lost in weight or
                    impulsion. He knew that the momentum would remain the same, if the motion was
                    increased proportionally to the diminution in weight.</p>
                <p>The fifth period comprehends the wars of the French in Italy, in Germany, and in
                    the Netherlands, as well as the northern and Turkish wars, and embraces a period
                    of ninety years; namely, from 1648 to 1738. The peace of Westphalia put a period
                    to nearly a century of war. The results of this conflict were the secularization
                    of ecclesiastical property, the complete establishment of the Protestant
                    religion, the recognition of mental freedom, the decay of the Papal power
                    throughout Europe, and the triumph of national independence. But during the
                    longcontinued struggle in Germany, two hereditary enemies appeared,—the Turks
                    and the French, The former were expelled in a single campaign, and never again
                    attempted any serious invasion. The latter entered upon a series of wars of
                    which we have not yet probably seen the termination. The ambition of Louis XIV.,
                    however, and the wars to which it gave rise, rapidly developed the art of
                    carrying on military operations, and formed generals whose names adorn military
                    history. Opposed to a French Turenne, Luxembourg, and Condé, stand Montecuculi,
                    Marlborough, and Eugene of Savoy: Louis of Baden may rank with Catinat or
                    Vendôme; and many other generals of eminence illustrate this period, which was
                    less remarkable for changes in the constitution and organization of armies than
                    for the talents displayed in conducting their operations in the field. It was
                    the era of great commanders. In the north the Swedes, Poles, Brandenburgians,
                    and Muscovites, fought alternately on the plains of Poland and the steppes of
                    the Ukraine. Under Charles XII. the Swedish infantry attained a high degree of
                    perfection, and proved uniformly successful until it was so rashly committed at
                    Pultowa; while the cavalry, without defensive armour, which the chivalrous

                    love of fighting for its own sake; and it was probably this peculiarity of
                    temperament, as much as any calculation of results, which gave to his movements
                    that impetuosity, which neither natural nor artificial obstacles could check or
                    resist.</p></note> The principal improvements of this period, however, are
                    chiefly due to the French, who made rapid advances in all the branches of
                    military science.</p>
                <p>The sixth period includes the three Silesian wars; namely, from the beginning of
                    the first Silesian war in 1740, to the breaking out of the French revolutionary
                    war in 1792. For a century previous to this, Prussia appears to have been
                    chiefly employed in preparing herself for the brilliant part which she acted
                    under Frederick II. To the celebrated elector, Frederick William, the Prussian
                    military power in a great measure owed its origin. This prince grew up, as it
                    were, in a camp, and. even in his boyish days, was present at the sieges of
                    Breda and the Schen-kenschantze. Arrived at the government, he endeavoured to
                    infuse a new spirit into the army; and so well did he succeed, that, in 1672, he
                    was enabled to promise the republic of Holland an auxiliary force of 20,000 men.
                    At the period of his death the elector left behind him a well-organized army of
                    30,000. When Frederick the Great (or, as he <pb break="no" facs="nls:193103335"

                    Einzige,</hi> the Unequalled) ascended the throne, he found the army about
                    80,000 strong, and drilled to a precision of movement, as well as a rapidity in
                    firing, until then unknown. This was owing to the exertions of Prince Leopold of
                    Dessau, who may be considered the founder of the modern system of tactics,
                    having invented the iron ramrod and the equal step,— reduced the formation of
                    the infantry from four to three ranks, thereby increasing the effect of musket
                    fire,—and, in short, laid the foundation of the system which Frederick
                    afterwards improved, by giving to infantry-movements greater lightness and
                    facility. With an army thus prepared for action, Frederick took the field in
                    1740. But the first two wars passed quickly by; and the intervals of peace were
                    employed in reforming whatever experience had shown to be defective in his
                    system,—in practising a vast variety of deployments,—and, above all, in
                    introducing that celerity of movement which had become so essential in modern
                    armies, with reference both to their numbers and the extent of their front. When
                    the third Silesian or Seven Years War broke out, Frederick, forsaken by his
                    allies, and menaced on all sides by powerful enemies, seemed on the very verge
                    of destruction. But if he stood alone, he stood unmoved, like the oak, braving
                    the storm, and conscious of the power to weather it. Nor was he without some
                    peculiar and decided advantages. On the one hand, his natural <hi rend="italic"

                    of his troops to remain firm in all situations, and to execute every movement
                    with precision, even in the very tumult of battle; the never-shaken confidence
                    in their leader, and the enthusiasm with which he was regarded by them: and, on
                    the other, the division, weakness, and want of system or connection in the
                    enemy’s plans of operation; their partial and lukewarm mode of execution;
                    together with the inferiority of their troops in organization, and of their
                    commanders in genius :—these were the causes which enabled Frederick to retire
                    from this bloody seven years conflict with a prodigious increase of fame, and
                    without the loss of an acre of territory.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    pas vu tant d’armées en campagne et réunies contre un seul prince. Sa science et
                    leurs fautes furent le contrepoids de tant de forces. Jamais guerre ne fut plus
                    instructive, et plus féconde en événemens. Il s’y fit des actions dignes des

                    such the military genius of the great monarch by whom it was commanded. Mere
                    tactical details are foreign to the object of this article, and therefore we
                    abstain from entering into them, excepting in as far as they may seem necessary
                    to throw light upon the constitution and composition of armies. That of Prussia
                    was long considered a model for imitation. Under Generals Siedlitz and Ziethen
                    its cavalry attained a degree of perfection unequalled either before or since.
                    “There was but one Seidlitz,” says Count von Bismark. In playing the mighty game
                    of war, its infantry was also superior to any other of that age; and if
                    subsequent events somewhat tarnished its reputation, it has never ceased to be
                    one of the best organized and most completely equipped bodies of foot in Europe.
                    The Austrians, as their wont is, only improved on compulsion, and when fairly
                    beaten out of their old system of masses and deep formations.</p>
                <p>The armies and the science of this period, however, were destined to be far
                    outnumbered and surpassed in <hi rend="subscript"> i</hi> the seventh and last,
                    which embraces the military sys-* terns and establishments of our own times.
                    These, accordingly, we shall now proceed to describe in detail; confining our
                    accounts principally, if not exclusively, to their actual rather than to their
                    former condition and strength; and commencing with the army of France, which has
                    not only played a most conspicuous part since the commencement of the
                    revolutionary wars, but has latterly served as a sort of model on which the
                    other armies of Europe have been more or less formed.</p>
                <p>From time immemorial, the Gauls were inhabited by a race of men distinguished for
                    their bravery. Hardy and enterprising under the two Brenni, obstinate and
                    persevering in their attacks against Caesar, we find them cutting a conspicuous
                    figure as auxiliaries in all the wars of ancient Rome. They passed through the
                    middle ages with equal distinction; and if they were forced to yield to the
                    irruption of the Franks, the amalgamation of the two nations had only the effect
                    of adding to their energy. The wars of Charlemagne and the crusades; the
                    successive invasions of Italy by Louis XII., Charles VIII., and Francis I.; and,
                    lastly, the struggles maintained against all Europe by Louis XIV., showed what
                    might be expected from French armies when properly commanded. But the fatal
                    results of the Seven Years War, the wretched intrigues of the court of Louis
                    XV., and still more the spirit of infatuation which appears to have become
                    endemic after the disgraceful Hanoverian expeditions, eclipsed, in an instant,
                    ages of glory, and rendered the army of France an object of ridicule to Europe.
                    After the peace of 1762, some measures were taken with the view, as was
                    pretended, of remedying the supposed defects in the constitution of the army,
                    and restoring its character. But the French ministry of that day, ignorant of
                    the real circumstances which had led to its successive defeats, and incapable of
                    comprehending the dispositions and strategical movements by which success in war
                    is attained, contented themselves with searching into the most minute details of
                    discipline and instruction for the causes of failures which were solely
                    attributable to a bad choice of generals, and a faulty direction of great
                    operations. They imagined that the armies of Frederick had triumphed in
                    consequence of oblique marches, the particular cut of their uniforms, and a
                    thousand other absurdities which it would be impossible to credit, were not the
                    amusing discussions of that period embodied in public documents of
                    unquestionable authenticity; they disputed about ployments and deployments <hi

                    these mischievous fooleries, and revived the spirit of emulation, which is the
                    source of the most brilliant feats in war; while the expeditions to Grenada and
                    St Eustatius, together with the campaigns of Lafayette, Saint-Simon, and
                    Rocham-beau, in a great measure restored the reputation of the French arms, and
                    prepared the way for still more important achievements. The staff, the
                    government, and the <hi rend="italic">faiseurs</hi> were still divided between
                    different systems. But while the chiefs were perplexing themselves with
                    theories, the troops improved both in discipline and manoeuvres; and had it not
                    been for the repeated shocks which their organization experienced in consequence
                    of frequent changes of ministry, and the introduction of certain radical
                    innovations, which completely broke up the old battalions in order to amalgamate
                    them with new levies, Louis XVI. would have possessed an army capable of
                    defending the monarchy, and might have been able to restrain and resist that
                    revolutionary frenzy to which he was destined soon to become a victim. In
                    consequence of the disorganization thus introduced, the regiments of the line
                    were in a wretched condition at the breaking out of the war in 1792. But a
                    single measure saved them from destruction. The nomination officers taken from
                    the <hi rend="italic">tiers-état</hi> filled the ranks with an ambitious and
                    warlike youth, burning to distinguish itself; while emulation, the chances of
                    preferment, and the love of country, supplied for a time the want of discipline,
                    and formed powerful motives for stimulating improvement.</p>
                <p>At the end of the year 1791, the French infantry consisted of 105 regiments of
                    two battalions each, 14 battalions of light troops, and 170 battalions of
                    national volunteers; or 394 battalions in all. By the decree of the 5th May
                    1792, the number of the volunteer battalions was raised to 200, and the strength
                    of each was increased from 226 to 800 men. The cavalry was composed of two
                    regiments of carabineers, consisting of four squadrons each; 24 regiments of
                    heavy cavalry of three squadrons each; 18 regiments of dragoons of three
                    squadrons each; 12 regiments of chasseurs of four squadrons each; and 6
                    regiments of hussars of three squadrons each; in all 206 squadrons. So that the
                    total strength of the French army at this period didnot exceed 160,000
                    infantry,35,000 cavalry, and 10,000 artillery; while 20,000 men were still
                    wantingto bring the different regiments to their full complements. But this
                    deficit was soon supplied by the multitude of volunteers who flocked to the
                    national standards when the duke of Brunswick invaded France at the head of the
                    Prussian army.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    had not yet developed its energies; nor had the world as yet any suspicion of
                    the prodigies which the system of terror, afterwards organized, was destined to
                    achieve. In 1795, France presented the formidable aspect of a vast camp. The
                    decrees of the 23d August and the 5th September 1794 had hurried the whole youth
                    to the frontiers. Nearly 1,200,000 men were in the pay of the republic; and,
                    after deducting those employed in accessory services, and in the navy, the
                    number of combatants in the field cannot have amounted to less than about
                    700,000. The official state of the force of the French armies, as at the 5th
                    April 1794, presents an aggregate of 794,334 men, including garrisons, but
                    exclusive of the army of the interior, whose head-quarters were at Paris; which,
                    allowing one fifth for those in the depots and for the sick, would give an
                    effective force, present under arms, of at least 650,000 men; the most
                    formidable which Europe had ever seen assembled in the field, “Ce dévelopement
                    de forces, sans exemple dans les annales modernes,” says Jomini, “tenait
                    d’autant plus du prodige, que la nation se trouvait livrée à tous les
                    déchiremens d’une guerre civile, et aux persécutions d’un gouvernement odieux.
                    Mais ce ne fut pas aux levées sculement que ces efforts se bornèrent: tout ce
                    qui compose les élémens de la puissance nationale, avoit été porté à un degré de
                    tension inconnu dans les siècles modernes.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Ibid.</hi> tom. V. p. 20.</p></note> Nor
                    did the “prodigy” stop here. In the month of March 1795, France had ten armies
                    in the field, the active force of which amounted to 449,930 combatants, besides
                    120,850 in garrisons, and 388,450 sick, prisoners, or detached; in all 959,190
                    soldiers. But the active force, or number present under arms, did not form the
                    half of the effective, and scarcely a third of the complete military strength of
                    France at that period; for, as 200,000 men were still wanting to bring the
                    effective force up to the full establishment, and as the most active measures
                    were in progress to make up the deficit, the total number of Frenchmen under
                    arms in 1795 cannot have fallen much short of 1,100,000 men. It will not be
                    denied, therefore, that the <hi rend="italic">Comité du Salut Publique</hi>
                    possessed extraordinary energy, and that terrorism proved the salvation of
                    France.</p>
                <p>But this state of exertion was too violent to be of long continuance; and neither
                    the population of the country, nor its exhausted resources, were sufficient to
                    maintain so enormous a force in the field. Accordingly, in the succeeding years
                    of the republic, the aggregate of the different armies seldom exceeded 480,000
                    effective men, and generally fell short of this number. But when Napoleon had
                    mounted the throne, and had organized the system of conscription, he obtained an
                    unlimited command over the whole of that part of the population capable of
                    bearing arms; and as he acted upon the principle, first recommended by Cato, of
                    making war support itself, he was not only able to repair the losses sustained
                    in his various campaigns, but, on most occasions, to take the field with a
                    predominating superiority of numbers. The establishment of the French army, in
                    1805, amounted to 341,412 infantry of the line, 100,130 light infantry, 77,488
                    cavalry, 46,489 artillery, and 5445 engineers; making a total of 650,964 men,'
                    or a force equal to that organized by the terrorists in 1794 and 1795. But this
                    establishment was afterwards greatly increased; and it is calculated that, at
                    the time of the Russian campaign, there were in the depots, in the hospitals,
                    and in the field, not less than 1,200,000 men, of whom about 850,000 might be
                    considered as effective. Hence, we are enabled to account for the extraordinary
                    phenomenon of Napoleon’s appearance in Germany at the head of a new and
                    formidable army, within a few months after the annihilation of his veteran
                    masses amidst the steppes, snows, and frosts of Russia, and making head for more
                    than a year afterwards against the utmost efforts of the allied powers.</p>
                <p>One of the first cares of the Bourbons, on their second restoration in 1815, was
                    to re-model the army, and place it on a footing adapted to the new order of
                    things. The most obvious maxims of policy recommended a proceeding which alone
                    could give stability to the restored dynasty. But such changes are necessarily
                    the work of time; and we need not therefore wonder that nearly ten years should
                    have elapsed before this important object was accomplished. The French army was
                    re-organized, augmented, and placed on nearly the same footing on which it now
                    stands, in virtue of three royal ordonnances, dated the 27th February 1825; the
                    first of which relates <pb break="no" facs="nls:193103361"

                    containing particulars of the modifications and changes subsequently
                    introduced.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">infantry</hi> is composed of 6 regiments of the guards and
                    64 of the line, 20 regiments of light infantry, and 7 foreign regiments; in all
                    97 regiments. Each regiment consists of a staff and three battalions, and each
                    battalion of eight companies, viz. one of grenadiers or carabineers, another of
                    voltigeurs, and six of fusileers or chasseurs. The peace establishment of a
                    battalion was fixed by the ordonnance of the 27th February 1825 at 600, and the
                    war establishment at 900 men; nor has any very material change since taken
                    place. The staff of all the regiments of the guard and of the line consists, in
                    time of war as well as peace, of a colonel, a lieutenant-colonel, three <hi
                    rend="italic">chefs-de-ba-taillon,</hi> a major, three adjutant-majors, a
                    paymaster, a superintendent of clothing, a standard-bearer, a chaplain, a
                    surgeon-major and two assistants; in all 16 officers. The officers of companies,
                    72 in number, consist of 6 captains of the first class, 18 of the second, 12
                    lieutenants of the first class, 12 of the second, and 24 sub-lieutenants or
                    ensigns. The total of non-commissioned officers in a regiment of the guards
                    amounts to 380, in one of the line to 259; while the entire strength of both,
                    including officers, non-commissioned officers, and soldiers, is very nearly the
                    same.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">cavalry</hi> is composed of 2 regiments of grenadiers, 2 of
                    cuirassiers, 1 of dragoons, 1 of chasseurs, 1 of lancers, and 1 of hussars,
                    forming the two divisions of the royal guard; and of 2 regiments of carabineers,
                    10 of cuirassiers, 12 of dragoons, 18 of chasseurs, and 6 of hussars of the
                    line. Each of the regiments of cavalry of the guard and of the line is composed
                    of a staff and six squadrons. The staff consists of the colonel, a
                    lieutenant-colonel, <hi rend="italic">chefs d’escadron,</hi> major,
                    instructor-in-chief, adjutant-majors, paymaster, superintendent of clothing,

                    65 in all. The non-commissioned officers amount to 167 for war, and 163 for
                    peace; and the entire strength of a regiment of the guards is 940 and 748, of a
                    regiment of the heavy cavalry 926 and 734, of a regiment of light cavalry 1022
                    and 734, for war and peace respectively.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">royal corps of artillery</hi> is composed of an appropriate
                    staff, of artillery troops attached to the royal guard, and of artillery troops
                    of the line. The staff consists of 390 officers, including the general officers,
                    inspectors of this arm, who also form part of the general staff of the army,—and
                    of 560 <hi rend="italic">employes.</hi> The officers composing the staff are, 1

                    lieutenants-general; 16 major-generals; 36 colonels, directors of artillery,

                    them, adjuncts to the central depot and to the ministry, commanding the
                    artillery in places of strength, and aides-de-camps; 60 in fixed residence; and
                    50 sub-lieutenants, pupils. The <hi rend="italic">employes</hi> consist of 1
                    examinator of artillery; ' 10 professors of mathematics, and 10 tutors in the
                    same branch; 11 professors of design; 15 master artificers; 290 artillery
                    guards, viz. 16 of the first class, 64 of the second, and 210 of the third; 103
                    workmen; 31 controllers of the manufacture of arms, and 38 of management; 36
                    accountants; 3 controllers of the founderies, with 3 assistants; and 3
                    controllers of the forges, with 3 assistants. The troops of the artillery of the
                    guard form a brigade under the orders of a major-general of the corps, who is
                    permanent inspector; and this brigade is composed of one regiment of foot, one
                    of horse-artillery, and one of the train. A regiment of foot-artillery is
                    composed of a staff, of eight companies of cannoneers, and of a detachment of
                    workmen; amounting in all to 916 and 668 for war and peace respectively. A
                    regiment of the horse-artillery is composed of a staff and 4 companies of
                    cannoneers, or 454 and 382 respectively as above. A regiment of the train of
                    artillery is composed of a staff, with 12 companies in time of war and 6 in time
                    of peace, or 1474 and 524 respectively. Eight <hi rend="italic">employés</hi>
                    are specially attached to the artillery of the guard for the service of the
                    school and the direction of the materiel, viz. a professor and a teacher of
                    mathematics, a master artificer, three guards, and one principal workman. The
                    artillery of the line is composed of 8 regiments of foot, 4 regiments of
                    horse-artillery, 1 battalion of a pontoon-train, 12 companies of workmen, 1 of
                    armourers, and 8 of the train. Each of the 8 regiments of foot-artillery
                    consists of a staff and 20 companies; each of the regiments of horse-artillery
                    ®f a staff and 8 companies. The pontoon-train is divided in 12 companies; and
                    each of the 8 squadrons of the train is composed of a staff with 16 companies in
                    time of war, and 8 in time of peace.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">corps of engineers</hi> consists of three regiments, each
                    composed of a staff and three battalions, with a skeleton company as a depot,
                    while each battalion is formed of 8 companies, 2 of which are miners and 6
                    sappers. The regimental staff of each regiment of engineers consists of 1
                    colonel, 1 lieutenant-colonel, 4 <hi rend="italic">chefs-ded)ataillon,</hi> one
                    of which is commandant of the regimental school, 3 adjutant-majors, 1 paymaster,
                    1 superintendent of clothing, 1 standard-bearer, 1 chaplain, 1 surgeon-major, 2
                    assistants, and 3 professors attached to the regimental school; in all 16
                    officers. The sub-officers and workmen are 23 in number; the strength of a
                    company of sappers or miners is 102 in peace and 150 in war; while that of a
                    regiment, including the <hi rend="italic">cadre de la compagnie</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">de depot,</hi> is 2604 and 3756 respectively.</p>
                <p>It follows, then, taking the totals of the different corps d’armée conformably to
                    this analysis, that the peace establishment of the French army is fixed at
                    280,270 infantry and 57,057 cavalry; and the war establishment at 395,500
                    infantry and 105,347 cavalry. In point of fact, however, the effective force of
                    1826 consisted of no more than 227,667 infantry and 47,834 cavalry.<note

                    1200 men. This may at first sight appear a considerable reduction; but if we
                    take into account the numerous battalions of national guards which have been
                    organized since the expulsion of the elder branch of the Bourbons, we shall find
                    that the reduction is more apparent than real.</p>
                <p>The French army is at present recruited partly by voluntary enrolment for a term
                    of years, and partly by requisitions; in other words, on nearly the same
                    principle which obtained before the revolution of 1790. The system of
                    requisition is of course subsidiary or supplementary to that of voluntary
                    enlistment; but, in the event of another war, it would unquestionably become the
                    principal, if not the only, resource of the army. And this applies to other
                    nations as well as to France. Modern manners, customs, habits, and pursuits, are
                    primarily adverse to the military service; and this opposition can only be
                    overcome by a conscription of one kind or other. Napoleon laid it down as a
                    principle, “que la conscription est le mode de recrutement le plus juste, le
                    plus doux, le plus avantageux au peuple.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Napoleon having established “qu’un million d’âmes fournit
                    chaque année 7000 à 8000 conscrits, et que les besoins de l’administration et
                    des divers états n’en réclaimait que moitié,” he therefore concluded, “qu’une
                    levée annuelle de 3500 hommes n’of frait, deduction faite des morts, que 30,000
                    hommes en dix ans,” or abouta 33d part of the entire population. (See Rogniat,
                    <hi rend="italic">Réponse aux Notes Critiques de</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Napoleon.</hi> Paris 1823.) But the draughts ou the population of France ivere
                    never carried’to the full extent of the principle, and seldom exceeded one in 43
                    or 44.</p></note> But without being prepared to go this length, it may be
                    admitted that it is equal in its operation; that its results are certain; and
                    that the supplies it furnishes are of the best quality: whilst voluntary
                    enlistment is at best a precarious resource, and sends to the ranks little else
                    than the scum and dregs of the people. At the same time, the French army, as at
                    present constituted, bears a much smaller proportion to "the entire population
                    of the country, and is consequently less burdensome, than that of any other
                    nation of Europe, England only excepted. Russia, for example, requires one man
                    in 97 for her peace establishment, and one in 57 for war: Austria takes one in
                    60 during peace, and one in 40 during war: Prussia, maintaining a war
                    establishment in peace, withdraws one man in 22 for the service of her army:
                    whilst France requires only one in 137 for peace, and one in 80 for war.<note

                    Britain presses even more lightly upon the general mass of the population; but,
                    in the event of a war, the proportion would, all in probability, become as
                    unfavourable for the people as that of the French conscription under Napoleon,
                    namely, one in 33 or 34. Such, at least, was the case during the greater part of
                    the last war, particularly after the rupture of the short-lived peace of
                    Amiens.</p>
                <p>The national character of every people is commonly developed in a very striking
                    manner by its army. “The Frenchman,” says Count Bismark, “courageous, impetuous,
                    nay, even terrible in attack, does not possess that coldblooded, quiet
                    circumspection and endurance which is so indispensable in a defensive war and

                    Beamish delivers a similar opinion. “The French,” says this officer, “have, with
                    much judgment, generally endeavoured to become the <hi rend="italic"
                    >attacking</hi> party. They thus not only derived the usual advantage of that
                    system, but adopted the mode of warfare which was peculiarly suited to their
                    national character. The French soldiers are impetuous; but their courage
                    requires excitement, to which <hi rend="italic">motion</hi> so much contributes.
                    Abstract motion, however, is not sufficient to impel the French soldier into
                    action: he must be first excited by the example of his officer; and were it not
                    for the extreme and universal gallantry displayed by the officers of the French
                    army, few instances of impetuous courage would be recorded on the part of the
                    men. It has been said that <hi rend="superscript"> i</hi> the French officers
                    will always lead, if the men will follow and there have been instances where the
                    former have nobly sacrificed their lives to produce this effect”<note

                    at such variance with the better points of his character, says that “to
                    Frenchmen you must always speak,” and that “the intoxication of the French is
                    gay, sparkling, and daring; a foretaste to them of the battle and the
                    victory.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    opinions. “Le Français, naturellement brave, actif, et impétueux,” says Baron

                    Dès qu’il cesse de marcher en avant, one sorte de dégoût s’empare de lui; il est
                    difficile de le contenir. Depuis la révolution, surtout, cette disposition
                    s’était accrue de plus en plus: les liens de la discipline ne retenant plus le
                    soldat, il était devenu mutin, raisonneur, et indocile.”<note anchored="true"

                    discriminates the respective characteristics of the troops engaged on that
                    occasion. The onset of the French was truly terrible, and at one moment had very

                    many splendid victories, and sustained so many disgraceful defeats, as the

                    the most brilliant successes and the most calamitous reverses, of triumphant
                    ascendancy and abject humiliation. “Aucune nation,” says Guibert, “n’a perdu de

                <p>The Spanish army, which, under Charles V., Pescaira, the Duke of Alba, and the
                    Constable of Bourbon, had <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> proved itself so
                    formidable—extending the theatre of its exploits from the Pyrenees to the Po and
                    the Adige on the one hand, and to the Elbe, the Meuse, and the Waal on the
                    other—degenerated rapidly under the disastrous reigns of the last princes of the
                    House of Austria. When Philip V. ascended the throne at the beginning of the
                    last century, it scarcely amounted to 15,000 men. By that prince and his
                    successors, however, it was gradually increased, until, in the year 1792, its
                    establishment amounted to 116,000 infantry, 12,200 cavalry, with upwards of
                    10,000 artillery, and its effective force to about 120,000 men of <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193103387" xml:id="kp-eb0703-3387-0602"/>all arms. At present its
                    effective amounts to 90,000, and its disposable force to 75,000 combatants. It
                    is composed of the general active staff, of the staff of the fortresses, of the
                    household troops and royal guard, of the infantry and cavalry of the line, with
                    artillery, engineers, and veterans. Its staff consists of 6 captain-generals, 77
                    lieutenant-generals, 122 major-generals, 350 brigadier-generals, with inferior
                    officers in proportion. There are 15 captaincies, viz. 12 territorial and 3
                    colonial. In Spain, and its possessions contiguous to the Peninsula, there are
                    150 fortresses, posts, forts, citadels, or open towns where troops are in
                    garrison. The household troops consist of six squadrons of the body guard and a
                    company of halberdiers: of these four squadrons are Spanish, and two foreign,
                    called Saxons, in honour of the queen. The royal guard is organized like that of
                    France, and consists of two divisions of infantry, one division of cavalry, and
                    three companies of artillery, one of which is horse-artillery. The first
                    division consists of four regiments of grenadiers, each composed of two
                    battalions, divided into eight companies of 120 men each; and the second of two
                    regiments of the élite of the provincial militia, divided into three battalions
                    of four companies each. The cavalry forms a division of two brigades; and the
                    artillery consists of three companies of 100 men, each serving a battery of six
                    pieces mounted. The infantry of the line consists, first, of 10 regiments of
                    three battalions each; secondly, of the Swiss regiment Wimpffen, one battalion
                    only; thirdly, of a regiment, fixed at Ceuta, composed of four companies of 100
                    men each, the refuse of the army. Seven regiments, of two battalions each, of
                    the same number and composition as those of the line, form the light infantry.
                    The militia consists of 42 regiments of one battalion each, which is divided
                    into eight companies. The cavalry consists of 13 regiments, of which 5 are of
                    the line, and 8 light horse, each of four squadrons, composed like those of the
                    royal guard; together with two companies of cuirassiers at Ceuta, one formed of
                    native Spaniards, and the other of Moors. The royal corps of artillery is
                    divided into the theoretical and practical. The troops of this arm consist,
                    first, of 6 battalions of foot artillery, in garrison at Barcelona, Carthagena,
                    Seville, Corunna, and Valladolid; secondly, of 4 companies of horse-artillery,
                    in garrison at Carthagena and Seville; thirdly, of 5 companies of artificers;
                    fourthly, of 5 battalions of the train; fifthly, of 3 brigades and 15 companies
                    fixed in garrison, but exclusive of the <hi rend="italic">personnel</hi> in
                    America. This arm has a splendid museum at Madrid, besides a theoretical and
                    practical school, directed by a brigadier-general or colonel,' in the principal
                    town or place of each province. The engineers are a corps of officers not
                    regimented or brigaded, consisting of an engineer-general, 10 directors
                    sub-inspectors, 17 colonels, 20 lieutenant-colonels, 34 captains, and 56
                    lieutenants; together with a regiment of sappers, consisting of 2 battalions of
                    8 companies each, viz. 5 of sappers, 1 of miners, 1 of pontoneers, and 1 of
                    workmen. The establishments of this arm are, a topographical depot-general, or
                    collection of maps, plans, and military memoirs; a museum, containing
                    representations in relief of the fortresses, and different models of
                    fortifications; and an academy for the instruction of young officers intending
                    to enter this branch of the service, after they have passed through the primary
                    school of Segovia. All these establislunents are situated in the capital.</p>
                <p>The Spanish army is recruited by voluntary enrolment and, in case of
                    insufficiency, by ballot or conscription. The term of service is eight years for
                    the first enrolment or ballot, and two or four for the second, when the soldier
                    becomes entitled to an increase of pay. Before the war of independence no one
                    could attain the rank of officer without having been a cadet; and each cadet was
                    bound to prove his nobility. But since the return of Ferdinand these proofs have
                    been dispensed with, and serjeants now obtain a third of the sub-lieutenancies;
                    the other two thirds being reserved for the <hi rend="italic">élèves</hi> of the
                    military school of Segovia, who have passed the customary examinations at the
                    end of their course of study. The dress and equipment of the Spanish army are in
                    the worst state; the pay of the troops is exceedingly irregular; and their
                    discipline is, in consequence, as bad as it is possible to imagine, or rather,
                    there is scarcely such a thing known.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>After the general peace of 1814, when all the powers of Europe had reduced their
                    military establishment, Portugal alone did not follow their example, but fixed
                    the peace establishment of its permanent army at 49,268 infantry and 5230
                    cavalry; which, with the militia, made a force of 59,325 men, or about 22
                    soldiers for every 100 inhabitants. Such a state of things, however, was much
                    too violent to be durable. Accordingly, one of the first cares of the
                    constitutional government of 1821 was to reform a military system so
                    disproportionate to the population and the financial resources of the kingdom.
                    The armed force since that period has therefore consisted exclusively of the
                    permanent army and the militia. The permanent army is composed of a general
                    staff, an engineer corps, 24 infantry regiments of the line of one battalion
                    each, 6 regiments of <hi rend="italic">chasseurs a pied,</hi> and 12 regiments
                    of <hi rend="italic">chasseurs</hi><hi rend="italic">à cheval</hi> of 3
                    squadrons each, 4 regiments of artillery, a battalion of engineer artificers, a
                    company of soldiers of the train, a police guard, and 30 companies of veterans.
                    The general staff consists of an indeterminate number of lieutenant-generals, 16
                    major-generals, 24 brigadier-generals, 6 superior officers, 6 subalterns, 12
                    aides-de-camp, 12 secretaries, 10 employes, and a veterinary surgeon-in-chief;
                    in all 100. The engineer corps <hi rend="italic">(corpo de engenheiros)</hi> is
                    composed of 4 colonels, 4 lieutenant-colonels, 8 majors, 12 captains, 12
                    lieutenants of the first class, and 12 of the second; in all 64. Each regiment
                    of infantry of the line and of light troops consists of 44 officers and 780
                    noncommissioned officers and soldiers. The effective strength of a regiment of
                    artillery is 551 men, including 33 officers. The corps of the train of artillery
                    <hi rend="italic">(ctrtillιeros</hi><hi rend="italic">conductores),</hi> reduced
                    to a single company by the organization of 1821, is composed of 12 officers, 30
                    soldiers, and 70 mules <hi rend="italic">(l&gt;estas muares).</hi> The battalion
                    of engineer artificers consists of <pb break="no" facs="nls:193103400"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0703-3400-0603"/>201 men, including 12 officers. Each of the 30
                    companies ∕ of veterans is from 70 to 80 strong, including 2 officers. The
                    police guard of Lisbon consists of a battalion of infantry of 8 companies and
                    980 men, including officers; together with a battalion of <hi rend="italic">gens
                    d’armexìe</hi><hi rend="italic">a cheval</hi> 238 strong, divided into 4
                    companies. The effective force of the permanent army on the peace establishment
                    is therefore 29,645 foot, and 4411 horse. But the events of which Portugal has
                    since 1821 been the theatre, and the circumstance of six battalions having been
                    sent to Brazil, render it probable that, at the period of the insurrection of
                    the Marquis de Chaves, the regular army did not exceed 24,000 or at most 25,000
                    men. The militia form 48 regiments of infantry, of the same strength and
                    composition as those of the line; together with six separate corps, of which
                    three are infantry, two cavalry, and one artillery; amounting in all to 38,542
                    men, and, with the army of the line, making the total of land forces 68,187 men
                    of all kinds and arms. The <hi rend="italic">ordinenzas,</hi> which formed 441
                    legions or <hi rend="italic">capitanea mores,</hi> were abolished by the Cortez
                    in 1822, to the great satisfaction of the nation, which justly regarded this
                    institution as a most grievous scourge. They were <hi rend="italic">a</hi> sort

                    in the militia, might be called upon to join at the shortest notice. The army,
                    which is indebted for its organization to marshal Beresford, is well disciplined

                <p>At the period when the emperor of Germany engaged in war with revolutionary
                    France, the Austrian army was on a very effective footing, both in regard to
                    organization and numbers. The infantry, it is true, though well trained and
                    disciplined, wanted vivacity, and its physical was superior to its moral force.
                    But the cavalry, which was composed of admirable materials, rivalled the
                    Prussian squadrons in instruction, and surpassed them in other particulars. The
                    artillery and engineers were also good, although the <hi rend="italic"
                    >matériel,</hi> less perfect than that of the French, was either too heavy for
                    pieces in position, or too light for efficient service in the field. Nor was the
                    staff’ deficient either in erudition or in talents; but its theories were
                    antiquated and vague, resting partly upon the system of cordons attributed to
                    Lascy, and partly also upon certain hypotheses, which it was gravely proposed to
                    put to the test of experiment in the field. At the commencement of the war with
                    France, the imperial army consisted of 232 battalions of infantry and 220
                    squadrons of cavalry; and as the battalions were very strong, being raised by
                    means of reserves to 1200 men and upwards each, the whole of the Austrian force
                    at this period may be estimated at 240,000 foot, 35,000 horse, and 10,000
                    artillery.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Jomini, <hi

                    adherence to a vicious system, and the exigencies of the long and protracted
                    struggle with republican and imperial France, led to successive augmentations of
                    the effective force, until at one time it considerably exceeded 700,000 men of
                    all arms. At the general peace of 1814, however, Austria, exhausted by a war of
                    five-and-twenty years, reduced her military establishments nearly one half;
                    adjusting the scale of peace so as to render it commensurate with that which, it
                    was conceived, France would adopt as soon as the Bourbons felt themselves in a
                    condition to re-organize a permanent force. Several changes, indeed, have since
                    been made; but the account which follows, derived from the most authentic

                <p>The <hi rend="italic">infantry,</hi> exclusive of the 17 regiments of the
                    frontiers, is composed of 58 regiments of the line, 1 regiment of chasseurs, 12
                    battalions of chasseurs, and 5 garrison battalions; besides, in time of war, the
                    infantry of the staff and the landwehr. Of these, 3 are recruited in Lower and 2
                    in Upper Austria, 5 in the interior and in the Illyrian provinces, 9 in Bohemia,
                    5 in Moravia, 11 in Gallicia, 4 in the Venetian States, 4 in Lombardy, 12 in
                    Hungary, and 3 in Transylvania. The different regiments are designated
                    respectively by the names of their provinces, and those of the officers who are
                    proprietors therein <hi rend="italic">(inhaber).</hi> A regiment of the line
                    consists, in time of peace, of a staff, 2 companies of grenadiers, and 18 of
                    fusileers. The companies of fusileers form 3 battalions, each of 6 companies;
                    and 2 companies make a division. In time of war a fourth battalion is organized,
                    called that of the depot, and is composed of 4 companies. The companies of
                    grenadiers form separate battalions, commonly consisting of three divisions or
                    six companies; but there are at present two battalions which have only four
                    companies. The Hungarian and Transylvanian regiments consist, in time of war, of
                    4 battalions of 6 companies each; and the company contains 200 men. The force of
                    the infantry of the line amounts, therefore, on the peace establishment, to 1044
                    companies of fusileers and 116 of grenadiers, or 174 battalions of fusileers and
                    20 of grenadiers; and, during war, to 1134 companies of fusileers, or 189
                    battalions, and the same number of companies or battalions of grenadiers. By the
                    <hi rend="italic">military frontiers</hi> are understood the provinces and
                    districts conterminous with Turkey, to the east and south of the empire; which,
                    by reason of the military service, internal as well as external, that their male
                    population is subject to, have an organization entirely military; some districts
                    of Transylvania alone excepted. These military provinces furnisfi 17 regiments
                    of national infantry, a battalion of <hi rend="italic">tschaihists</hi> or
                    watermen of the Danube, and a regiment of hussars <hi rend="italic"
                    >(szekler),</hi> who, in as much as they are liable to be called to join the
                    army, really form part of it, but who, in respect of their particular
                    organization, may be considered, in time of peace, as constituting a distinct
                    force. Military Croatia comprehends six districts, each of them furnishing a
                    regiment, which bears the name of the chief place of the district, and consists
                    of 12 companies. The service of these regiments in time of peace is confined to
                    guarding the cordon. The light infantry is composed of the imperial regiment of
                    Tyrolese chasseurs, consisting of 4 battalions of 4 companies each; and of 12
                    battalions of chasseurs, 4 companies each in time of peace, and 6, with a depot
                    company, in time of war. A company of chasseurs consists of 195 men, including
                    officers. The garrison battalions, composed of a sort of demi-invalids, unfit
                    for the service of the line, are stationed, 1 in Buckowina, 1 in Esclavonia, 1
                    in Hungary, 1 in Dalmatia, and 1 in Lombardy, <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193103413" xml:id="kp-eb0703-3413-0604"/>arid consist each of six
                    companies, with the same complementof officers and non-commissioned officers as
                    the companies of the line. The divisions of infantry of the staff <hi
                    rend="italic">{stabs-infanterie-division),</hi> are composed in the same manner,
                    and organized, in time of war, for the purpose of guarding the head-quarters and
                    the magazines of the army, and of removing the wounded from the field of battle
                    to the nearest hospitals. The number of battalions of the landwehr is seventy.
                    In each district of country (Hungary, Transylvania, and Italy excepted) assigned
                    for the recruitment of a regiment, two battalions of landwehr are raised and
                    attached to such regiment; the one containing the men who are the least
                    necessary to their families, and the most proper for the service, and the other,
                    the surplus of those who are obliged to form part of the landwehr. The first
                    battalion is exercised fifteen days in the year, the second only eight hours.
                    The commandants receive their orders from the colonel of the regiment of the
                    line to which their battalions are respectively attached. The landwehr is
                    principally destined for the service of the interior; but it may also be sent to
                    an active army. In either case it is paid the same as the troops of the
                    line.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">cavalry</hi> consists of 8 regiments of cuirassiers, 6 of
                    dragoons, 7 of light horse, 11 of hussars (exclusive of the frontier regiment),
                    and 4 of hulans; together with, in time of war, the dragoons of the staff <hi
                    rend="italic">{stabs-dragonner)</hi>; all raised, like the infantry, in
                    different provinces, viz. 3 regiments of cuirassiers in Bohemia, 3 in Moravia, 1
                    in Lower Austria, and 1 in Central Austria; 3 regiments of dragoons in Moravia,
                    1 in Upper and Lower Austria, and 1 in Lower and Central Austria; 1 regiment of
                    light horse in Moravia, 4 in Bohemia, 1 in Gallicia, and 1 in Italy. The hussars
                    of the 11 regiments are all either Hungarians or Transylvanians. The regiments
                    of hulans consist of inhabitants of Gallicia and volunteers. In time of peace,
                    the regiments of cuirassiers and dragoons consist of 6 squadrons, and the other
                    regiments of 8; making in all 260 squadrons. Two squadrons make a division; and,
                    in regiments which have 8 squadrons or 4 divisions, 2 are commanded by the
                    majors. The dragoons of the staff, of which there are several divisions in time
                    of war, have the same destination as the infantry attached to it, and are
                    besides employed in repressing disorders committed by marauders, and in other
                    like services.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Jomini
                    has particularly remarked the superior composition, organization, and discipline
                    of the Austrian cavalry, which has proved its excellence in many bloody
                    encounters, and, when led with talent, has never failed to distinguish itself.
                    At the battle of Würtz-burg, 3d September 1796, AVartensleben passed the Maine
                    with twenty-four squadrons of cuirassiers, attacked the French cavalry under
                    Bonneau, overthrew it, and thus decided the victory. “This brave veteran,” says
                    the Archduke Charles, “impressed with the importance of the order which he had
                    received, dashed into the Maine at the head of his cavalry, and swam across.”
                    “This manoeuvre,” he adds, “was completely successful: the French cavalry, which
                    had awaited the charge without stirring, was overthrown.” At the battle of
                    Leipsic, the Austrian cuirassiers, commanded by Nosti tz, “covered themselves
                    with glory.” On the 16th October, at one. o’clock in the afternoon, Nostitz,
                    having scarcely passed the Pleisse at Gröbern, attacked the lancers and dragoons
                    of the French imperial guard, overthrew them, and then broke several squares of
                    infantry. Other instances of a similar kind might be mentioned.</p></note></p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">artillery</hi> is divided into three parts, or distinct
                    corps, viz. the field artillery <hi rend="italic">{feld-artillerie)</hi>; the
                    artillery of the arsenals and magasins <hi rend="italic">{feld-zeugamr)</hi>;
                    and garrison artillery <hi rend="italic">{garnison artillerie).</hi> The <hi
                    rend="italic">field artillery</hi> consists of a corps of bombardiers, 5
                    regiments of field artillery, and a corps of fire-masters. The corps of
                    bombardiers has a staff, and õ companies of 204 men each, including officers. It
                    is recruited by corporals of artillery, and performs the most difficult as well
                    as important service to the army. A regiment of field artillery is composed of a
                    staff and 4 battalions, one of 6 companies and three others of 4 companies each;
                    making in all 18 companies. A company serves three or four batteries of 6
                    pieces; and each battery is commanded by a lieutenant or major-firemaster. The
                    train of the army furnishes the horsing of the batteries, which is under the
                    command of officers of that corps, and generally independent of the chiefs of
                    batteries, but subordinate to them in this particular service. The corps of
                    firemasters is established at Neustadt, near Vienna, where it is at present
                    occupied in attempting to fabricate Congreve rockets, we know not with what
                    success. The <hi rend="italic">artillery of the arsenals and magazins,</hi>
                    consisting of a staff and <hi rend="italic">personnel of</hi> the necessary
                    workmen, furnishes the field artillery, and the equipages of war, with the
                    requisite arms and munitions, and it guards them when in magazine. The <hi
                    rend="italic">garrison artillery,</hi> charged with the service in fortresses,
                    is divided into fourteen districts, determined by the provinces, and
                    proportioned in numbers to these districts. The district of garrison artillery
                    of Vienna comprehends an arsenal, containing all the equipage of sieges; and
                    attached to it are a foundery, an establishment for boring cannon, and
                    manufactories of saltpetre and gunpowder.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">engineer department</hi> comprehends a corps of engineers,
                    with the sappers and miners. The pontoon train is attached to the staff, and is
                    under∙ the direction of an <hi rend="italic">oberst-schiffamt</hi> or chief of
                    boats. The train or corps of military equipages <hi rend="italic"
                    >(militar-fuhrwesens-corps)</hi> is wholly independent. The engineer corps is
                    composed of 4 generals, 6 colonels, 9 lieutenant-colonels, 18 majors, 42
                    captains, 30 captains <hi rend="italic">en</hi><hi rend="italic">second,</hi> 30
                    lieutenants, 30 sub-lieutenants, and 12 cadets. Each command or military
                    division embraces a district of fortification; consequently there are fourteen
                    such districts, to each of which is attached a director, who is taken from the
                    generals or officers of the engineer staff. In each place there is also an
                    engineer-in-chief, who is an officer of the staff or a captain of engineers; but
                    in Vienna, Milan, Peterwaradin, and Venice, the director performs the functions
                    of chief engineer. The corps of miners is composed of a staff, five companies,
                    and a garrison detachment; and the corps of sappers, of a staff like that of the
                    miners, six companies, and a garrison detachment. The pontoon corps consists of
                    a staff and 2 battalions of 4 companies each. In time of war the number of
                    battalions is three, two of which have 6 companies and one 4; besides a company
                    in depot. The train or corps of military equipages consists, in time of peace,
                    of 12 divisions of transport <hi rend="italic">{transports-division),</hi> and
                    20 sets of horses for field batteries <hi rend="italic"
                    >{exercier-batterie-bespannung).</hi> Each division is provided with 90 horses;
                    and all the detachments of the corps stationed in a province are under the
                    orders of a commandant. In time of war the military equipage train consists of
                    seven principal divisions, viz.: 1. the artillery transport division; 2. that of
                    pontoons; 3. that of flying bridges; 4. that of baking; 5. that of health for
                    the transport of the wounded; 6. that of victualling; and, 7. that of general
                    transport.</p>
                <p>Two regiments of the same or different arms form a brigade, which is under the
                    orders of a major-general; and two or three brigades form a division, which is
                    commanded by a field-marshal-lieutenant. In time of war, corps d’armée are
                    organized, each consisting of several divisions, and under the orders of a
                    general of cavalry or artillery, or of the oldest field-marshal-lieutenant. In
                    the Austrian army there are at present 10 field-marshals, 18 generals of <pb

                    artillery, 67 field-marshal-lieutenants, and 118 major-generals, in actual

                    92 major-generals, unemployed. The guards form no part of the army. They are
                    divided into the noble body guard of arquebusiers, the Hungarian body guard, the
                    guard called <hi rend="italic">tra-bans,</hi> and the civic guard. The military
                    institutions of the first order consist of the company of cadets at Olmutz, that
                    of Gratz, the military academy for cadets at Vienna, the five regimental schools
                    of artillery, the school of bombardiers, and the academy of engineers. The total
                    of the peace establishment of this army is 270,000 infantry and 50,000 cavalry,
                    with a reserve of 250,000; while its war establishment, which can be organized
                    in four months, may be estimated at 750,000 infantry and from 70,000 to 75,000
                    cavalry.</p>
                <p>At the death of Frederick the Great, the army of the Prussian monarchy, amounting
                    to about 200,000 combatants, was accounted the best of Europe. Proud of a
                    struggle without example in modern annals, and of the superiority of the genius
                    of their king, the victors of Leuthen, Rosbach, and Torgau added to this force
                    of opinion an instruction in great manoeuvres, which the troops of no other
                    nation approached, much less rivalled.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    Frederick, to whom this superb army descended, though possessed neither of his
                    genius nor his ambition, was at great pains to maintain the reputation which it
                    had acquired; and some laurels that had been easily gathered in the Low
                    Countries seem to have inspired him with the notion that it was still capable of
                    equalling, perhaps surpassing, the brilliant achievements which had established
                    its renown. In this spirit, and, doubtless, believing that the French nation
                    might be reduced with the same facility as the insurrection in Holland, the
                    Prussian monarch put himself at the head of the confederacy formed to crush a
                    people who had risen in arms to assert their liberties and preserve the
                    integrity of their territory. But the issue proved how much he was at fault in
                    his calculation. For a mercenary and mechanical army, however perfect its
                    discipline and instruction may be, can never triumph over a generous people,
                    inspired by patriotism, endowed with high military qualities, and resolved to
                    conquer or to die in defence of their liberties. Besides, the Prussian army of

                    chief, nor excited by any feeling calculated to improve its moral force:
                    discipline formed the only tie by which it was held together. Nor was it long
                    ere its inferiority was proved, and its pride severely humbled. The affair of
                    Valmy opened the king’s eyes; and henceforth, more docile to the suggestions of
                    prudence, he negociated for permission to withdraw to the right bank of the
                    Rhine the wrecks of that army the glory of which had just been eclipsed in the
                    plains of Champagne by battalions of youthful volunteers. He had been taught a
                    lesson by which he did not fail to profit; and after the unsuccessful campaigns
                    on the Rhine, he sneaked ingloriously out of the contest which he had been so
                    eager to commence; leaving the empire and Austria to the undivided resentment of
                    the conquerors. But he re-established his army, while his late ally was
                    maintaining a deathstruggle. The parades and manoeuvres of Potzdam were resumed
                    with their wonted éclat; confidence revived; and Frederick began to flatter
                    himself that he alone could re-adjust the disturbed equilibrium of Europe. He
                    failed, however, to observe the prodigious development which the military art
                    had received in the course of the revolutionary war; or at least he neglected to
                    profit by the discoveries to which it had given birth: and, as he had formerly
                    deserted his ally at the beginning of the contest, so now he took the field just
                    at the moment when that same ally was being overthrown at Austerlitz, and
                    compelled to accept the terms dictated by the conqueror. And at Jena as at
                    Auerstadt, at Halle as at Lubec, he paid the price of his procrastinating folly.
                    But misfortune, a rough school-mistress, had inculcated some useful lessons. The
                    military constitution of Prussia was changed; foreign recruitment ceased; a
                    national army was formed; the privileges of the nobles were abridged; old
                    institutions were reformed; discipline was improved by being simplified; the
                    arming and equipment of the army were improved in all their branches; the best
                    parts of the French military system were adopted; the patriotism of the nation
                    was roused; in short, during five years, Prussia was silently but
                    actively-employed in preparing those elements of strength which, in. 1812,
                    delivered the monarchy from the yoke of the stranger, and re-established her at
                    the head of the second-rate powers of Europe.</p>
                <p>The armed force of the Prussian monarchy is composed, first, of a permanent army;
                    secondly, of a war reserve or <hi rend="italic">landwehr</hi> in two bans;
                    thirdly, of a <hi rend="italic">landsturm,</hi> or sedentary national guard. The
                    permanent army is composed of young men of family who are destined to the
                    profession of arms, and are named officers after undergoing certain
                    examinations; of volunteers who clothe, equip, and support themselves for a year
                    at their own charge; of persons between the ages of 17 and 40 who enlist
                    voluntarily and receive regular pay; of a part of the youth from 20 to 25 years
                    of age, raised by means of requisition; and, lastly, of veterans or soldiers who
                    consent to remain in the service beyond the term prescribed by the law. The <hi

                    regiments of 2 battalions, besides six battalions of chasseurs and carabineers,
                    forming in all 132 battalions; the <hi rend="italic">cavalry,</hi> of 38

                    time of peace, remain at home, pursuing their ordinary avocations. But, in the
                    event of war, the first ban is destined to reinforce the permanent army; and the
                    second, to form the garrisons of strong places, and even, in case of need, to
                    send detachments to the army in the field. The <hi rend="italic">landwehr,</hi>
                    like the permanent army, is composed of infantry, cavairy, and artillery. In the
                    year 1827, the infantry of the first ban consisted of 116 battalions, and the
                    cavalry of 104 squadrons. Hence, if we include 54 garrison companies, and 18 of
                    invalids at Berlin, Stolpen, and Rybnik, the total of the peace establishment of
                    the Prussian army will amount to 122,000 men, while that of war would not be
                    less than 250,000 men of all arms: and such is the admirable military
                    organization of the country, that two months only are necessary to raise the
                    array to the full complement of the war establishment. In Prussia the cavalry is
                    a preponderating arm. Of the 122,000 men composing the peace establishment,
                    37,000 belong to this branch of the service. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >landsturm</hi> is a levy <hi rend="italic">en</hi><hi rend="italic">masse</hi>
                    of men from the age of 17 to that of 50, and, in cases of imminent danger, it is
                    called out by a royal ordonnance. It is formed into urban and rural companies,
                    and, like the French national guard, performs, if necessary, the duties of the
                    interior; thus leaving the whole of the permanent army and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >landwehr</hi> available for the service of the field. The actual constitution
                    of the Prussian army is strictly economical in all its parts, and the number of
                    military functionaries is reduced to the lowest possible scale consistent with
                    the efficiency of the service. In Prussia every man who wears a uniform works
                    hard for his money.</p>
                <p>All Prussians, from the age of 20 to 50, are held liable to military service, but
                    they only serve regularly from 20 to 26. The duration of service is consequently
                    fixed at five years; but, in time of peace, the requisitionary youth remain only
                    the first three years under their colours, after which they return to their
                    homes, and are not called out again, except for a few weeks towards the expiry
                    of the fifth year, when they are inscribed in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >landwehr</hi> of the first ban. The population of Prussia being 11,500,000
                    souls, about 98,000 males will annually attain the twentieth year of their age.
                    Hence, if we deduct 38,000 for such as are excepted from military service on
                    account of their age or their status in society, the total number of disposable
                    persons, between the age of 20 and 25, will amount to 395,000. And if to this we
                    add that portion of the male population from 25 to 32 years of age who are
                    eventually called to the service, it will follow that Prussia, without having
                    recourse to the second ban of the <hi rend="italic">landwehr,</hi> could raise
                    900,000 men trained to the use of arms; while France, even since 1824, when the
                    re-organization of her army commenced, could scarcely bring into the field more
                    than 480,000 men, of which the one half would be nearly uninstructed in the use
                    of arms. The annual renewal of this army by thirds renders it necessary to push,
                    with the utmost activity, the instruction of both infantry and cavalry, and to
                    pay little regard to that martinet precision which formerly characterized the
                    Prussian tactics, but which is of so small use in the presence of an enemy. The
                    showy on parade has consequently been sacrificed to the useful in the field; and
                    the mere foppery of war has given place to movements and evolutions, which are
                    recommended alike by their simplicity, and by the testimony which experience,
                    the best of all instructors, has borne in their favour. So long ago as the year
                    1808, the degrading discipline, introduced by the father of Frederick the Great,
                    was abolished by the <hi rend="italic">kriegs∙artihel</hi> or the martial law;
                    and military punishments are now principally confined to hard drills,
                    confinement of various degrees, retrogradation in rank, and some others of a
                    still milder description. Finally, the first grades are the reward of merit
                    established by examination and as such open to all; while, from the rank of
                    sub-lieutenant to that of general, and even beyond it, seniority, that
                    conservative law of acquired rights, regulates the advancement of officers, and
                    ultimately insures the veteran his reward. Thus, after sustaining the greatest
                    disasters, the Prussian army has survived its dispersion in 1807, and risen, as
                    it were out of its ashes, stronger and better constituted than at the period
                    when it was so rashly opposed to the undivided pow er of France, wielded by the
                    masterhand of the greatest warrior of modern times. “Heureux les gouvernemens,”
                    says a French military writer, “auxquels les malheurs servent de leçons !” Nor
                    would their “happiness” have been much diminished had such governments
                    remembered in victory the promises made to the people in misfortune, and shown
                    but half as much zeal to improve <hi rend="italic">their</hi> condition as to
                    rectify the defects of their military systems.</p>
                <p>At the period of the emperor Alexander’s death, the distribution of the Russian
                    and Polish forces was that of <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> an army ranged in
                    order of battle, with its front facing the west. 1. The advanced guard of this
                    army was formed by the Polish army and the corps d’armée of Lithuania;
                    presenting a mass of 80,000 combatants, under the command of the grand duke
                    Constantine. In point of mechanical instruction, no army in Europe could be
                    compared to it. Disposed in cantonments of about 150 leagues in length, from
                    Lowicz to Minsk, and 146 in breadth, between Kowno and Dubno, it could be
                    concentrated, at Warsaw or at Brzecs-Littowsky, in less than three weeks. 2. The
                    army of the right was composed of the corps d’armée, cantoned in Courland and
                    Livonia, of the corps of the guard, and of the first corps of the cavalry of
                    reserve; which, united, formed also a mass of 80,000 combatants. These were
                    perhaps the only troops which, in point of mechanical perfection, rivalled the
                    army of the advanced guard under Constantine. Their cantonments extended from
                    Polangen to Pleskof, about 132 leagues, and from Revel to Wilkomirsz; and
                    eighteen days at the most were sufficient for assembling them on the Niemen. 3.
                    The army of the left, denominated the second army, was equally formed of a mass
                    of 80,000 combatants, cantoned in the Chersonesian governments. The greatest
                    depth of its quarters, from Choczym on the Pruth to Czerkasy on the Dnieper, was
                    about 106 leagues; and the greatest breadth 180 leagues, between Machnowka, near
                    the southern frontier of Volhynia and Simpherapol in the Crimea. Three weeks
                    were necessary for concentrating it on the Pruth. 4. The army of the centre,
                    called also the first or grand army, formed a mass equal to the three preceding
                    armies, and consequently consisted of 240,000 combatants. Its cantonments
                    extended on one side to more than 234 leagues, or from Kaszin, on the frontier
                    of the government of Tver and of Jaroslaf, as far as Saratow; and, on the other,
                    to upwards of 320 leagues, from Ostrog to Moroum, on the frontier of the
                    government of Vladimir and of Nijei-Novogorod. It required six weeks at least
                    for concentrating itself in the province of Volhynia. 5. Besides these four
                    armies, consisting of 480,000 men, Russia had also several corps, of various
                    descriptions, amounting to more than 267,000 men; viz. the corps of Finland, of
                    Orenburg, and of Siberia, 45,000 strong; the corps of the Caucasus, 85,000; the
                    military colonies, 67,000; and the troops in garrison, 70,000; thus making a
                    grand total of 747,000 men, exclusive of the Kirgishes, Baschkirs, and other
                    Tartar hordes, of whom from 250,000 to 300,000 may in case of exigency be
                    brought into the field. The whole military<pb break="no" facs="nls:193103452"

                    therefore, be estimated at about a million of men, or a forty-ninth part of the
                    entire population; while the country, as we have just seen, was organized into
                    one vast camp, arranged upon strategic principles, so as to render the
                    transition from a state of peace to a state of war easy and expeditious, and,
                    with formidable means of aggression, to combine defensive resources of almost

                <p>The contest with Turkey in 1828 and 1829 produced no sensible derangement of this
                    system, and only altered for a time the relative proportions in the numbers of
                    the four principal armies, according as troops were moved upon the various
                    strategic points in the theatre of war. But the <hi rend="italic">laeunae</hi>
                    created by the casualties of the two campaigns in Moldavia, Bulgaria, and
                    Rumelia, have been already filled up; and ponseqnently the above account of the
                    military organization and force of the Russian empire is as applicable in 1831
                    as it was from the death of Alexander in 1826 to the commencement of the Turkish
                    war in 1828. A fact, however, is mentioned by M∙ Tolstoy, lately an officer of
                    the Russian staff, which shows the utter groundlessness of the fears generally
                    entertained of the aggressive powers of Russia at the commencement of the late
                    contest with Turkey. From a variety of data, derived from authentic sources,
                    that officer exhibits the situation and force of the Russian army at different
                    periods of the campaign of 1828, and proves, we think to demonstration, that it
                    never had more than 88,000 men in its first line;<note anchored="true"

                    calculated, certainly, to excite any very great degree of alarm in the minds of
                    other nations. M. Tolstoy, it is true, alleges that political reasons prevented
                    the employment of a greater force; and that if the Russians only brought forward
                    88,000 men in the first campaign, “c’était qu’ils ne voulaient point effrayer
                    l’Europe et réveiller des jalousies qui sommeillaient.” But doser observers will
                    perhaps see reason to believe that the real cause why the campaign was
                    undertaken with a force comparatively so small, did not consist in any
                    particular respect for the“slumbering jealousies” of other nations, but in the
                    inability of Russia to take the field with a larger army; that her physical
                    means are out of all proportion greater than her financial resources or power of
                    developing them in a foreign war; and that, however formidable or invincible she
                    might prove to an enemy invading her own territory, a long period must yet
                    elapse before she can be in a condition to occasion any serious uneasiness to
                    the nations of the south and west of Europe. Even in die campaign of 1829, when
                    so many losses were to be repaired, and the reputation of the Russian arms, if
                    possible, freed from the tarnish they had contracted in the course of the
                    preceding one, Count Diebitsch was compelled to attempt the passage of the
                    Balkan with no more than 30,000 men; and, in point of fact, he appears to have
                    arrived at Adrianople in the month of October, with less than the third of that
                    small force; a miracle of fortune, certainly, but, at the same time, a
                    Conclusive proof of the exhausted state of the Russian finances, and of the
                    inability of the czar to carry on a distant and protracted war. Diebitsch owed
                    his success to two causes: the powerful co-operation of the fleet, and the
                    despairing fatalism, or rather infatuation, of the Turks. But the fortunate
                    result of the enterprise cannot blind the world as to the circumstances under
                    which it was undertaken, nor conceal the weakness which preternatural folly, on
                    the part of the Osmanlees, at length gilded with victory.</p>
                <p>The Russian <hi rend="italic">infantry</hi> regiments consist of3000 men each,
                    under a <hi rend="italic">pulkovnick</hi> or colonel, and are divided into three
                    battalions of four companies, each under a <hi rend="italic"
                    >chef-de-bataillon.</hi> The company consists of 200 men, exclusive of officers,
                    sub-officers, and other persons attached to it, so that four companies make up a
                    battalion of 1000 men; and it is under the command of a <hi rend="italic"
                    >Capitan,</hi> a <hi rend="italic">parooschwlι</hi> or lieutenant, a <hi
                    rend="italic">putparooschick</hi> or sub-lieutenant, and <hi rend="italic"
                    >apraperchick</hi> or ensign. Four officers may appear a small allowance for a
                    company: but, in the first place, Russian soldiers arc much more easily managed
                    than our dare-devil fellows, in whose blood the wild spirit of freedom revels so
                    fiercely; and, secondly, the fundamental principle upon which the army of the
                    czar is organized is that of economy in every branch of the service,
                    particularly in the number of officers. Hence, for an effective regular force of
                    747,000 men, there are no more than 14,224 officers, or one for every 52 men; a
                    proportion, we believe, considerably lower than that which obtains in any other
                    European army, except perhaps that of Prussia. This reduced number, however, has
                    been found to answer well enough in practice; and, indeed, a multitude of
                    officers is only necessary for armies like that of France, which require to be
                    encouraged and stimulated by the example, the voice, and the gestures of its
                    officers, when in presence of an army. Every company has a small green <hi
                    rend="italic">yaschich</hi> or waggon attached to it, containing sixty rounds of
                    ball cartridge for each man, in addition to those he carries in his pouch,
                    besides the company’s books and cash-chest. To each battalion there is attached
                    one standard, beside which is kept a.drum for assembling the men. There is only
                    one band for the three battalions composing a regiment. The imperial guard,
                    consisting of the élite of the three arms of infantry, cavalry, and artillery,
                    amounts in all to forty thousand men.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Captain Alexander’s <hi rend="italic">Travels,</hi> i.
                    100.</p></note></p>
                <p>The Russian <hi rend="italic">regular cavalry</hi> consists of 8 regiments of the
                    guard, 4 of which are cuirassiers and 4 light horse; and 79 regiments of the
                    line, 9 of which are cuirassiers, 17 dragoons, 12 hussars, and 22 hulans.
                    Supposing each regiment, therefore, to consist of 900 men, as stated by Captain
                    Alexander, the total number of the Russian regular cavalry would amount to
                    78,000. The <hi rend="italic">irregular cavalry</hi> is composed of more than
                    20,000 Cossacks, who are only called out during time of war, and on the return
                    of peace arc sent back to their steppes to resume their nomadic course of life.
                    Alt the regiments of the regular cavalry which are not colonized have 6 active
                    squadrons and one in depot; the colonized regiments, though composed of 12
                    squadrons, have only 6 disposable. The depot squadron may be considered the
                    nursery of the regiment to which it belongs. The cavalry is organized upon the
                    same principle as the infantry. It forms, including that of the guard, nine
                    corps d’armée, of 2 divisions each; and as each division consists of 2 brigades,
                    each brigade of 2 regiments, and each regiment of 6 squadrons, every corps
                    d’armée of cavalry consists of 8 regiments or 48 squadrons. Two batteries of
                    horse-artillery are attached to each division, or 48 pieces to a corps d’ärmée.
                    The light division of the guard is composed of a regiment of dragoons, one of
                    hulans, one of hussars, and one of chasseurs. The division of heavy cavalry of
                    the guard consists of the regiment of chevaliers-guards, of the regiment of
                    horse guards, and of the cuirassiers of the emperor and empress. The two last
                    regiments, as well as the chasseurs <pb break="no" facs="nls:193103465"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0703-3465-0608"/>of the light division, belong to the young guard.
                    The guard is recruited in the regiments of the line from which it draws all the
                    finest men, and to which it never fails to send back every one who has given the
                    slightest cause for dissatisfaction. The clothing and equipments are superb; and
                    the greatest attention is paid to the appearance of the troops, which has of
                    late years been much improved. Equitation is also anxiously cultivated, and vast
                    pains have been taken to improve the men in this art. But the system pursued in
                    Russia is considered bad, inasmuch as the ambling pace introduced into the
                    schools is apt to spoil the horses, and to produce any thing rather than bold
                    riders.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                <p>The Russian, like the French, <hi rend="italic">artillery,</hi> is divided into
                    horse and foot. The horse-artillery is divided into brigades or battalions, of
                    two divisions or squadrons, each serving 12 light pieces. The foot artillery is
                    divided into brigades or regiments, each commanded by four superior officers,
                    and divided into two companies of battery, and two light companies. The two
                    former are destined each to serve 12 pieces in battery; the two latter, 12 light
                    pieces each. A brigade of foot-artillery with 48 pieces of cannon is attached to
                    each division of infantry of 6 regiments; while each division of cavalry,
                    composed of 4 regiments, has a brigade of horse-artillery of 24 pieces. There is
                    also in each corps d’armée a general of artillery, who receives the orders of
                    the inspector-general of artillery. The <hi rend="italic">personnel</hi> of the
                    companies is determined and organized according to the service which the
                    different kinds of artillery require; so that the <hi rend="italic"
                    >personnel</hi> of the battery companies is considerably stronger than that of
                    the light companies. The train is well organized, and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >attelages</hi> of the different batteries and pieces are ample. The <hi

                    inferior in science to those of the other great military nations. The Russians
                    have never been remarkable for skill in fortification, but their field-works
                    have in general been judiciously executed.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>The system of recruiting in Russia is exceedingly autocratical. When new levies
                    are wanted, orders are issued to the headmen of villages; each of which is
                    required to furnish a certain number, according to the amount of its population.
                    The selection is made by the headman, who is perfectly absolute in the matter;
                    and Jews are now obliged either to serve or to pay for substitutes, who are not
                    easily procured in a country like Russia, where so few of the lower class are
                    their own masters. Formerly, it was very difficult to prevent the men from
                    deserting on the road to the depots; since the circumstance of being selected as
                    a soldier was considered as tantamount to perpetual banishment from family and
                    friends. Hence, it was no uncommon spectacle to see numbers of these wretched
                    serfs fastened together like a cordon of felons going to the hulks, or tied on
                    telegas or carts, and thus conveyed to the depot. But since leave has been given
                    to soldiers to visit, at intervals, their native villages, and the period of
                    service has been limited to twenty years, the dislike to the army has begun to
                    abate, and recruits show less disposition to desert, although the military
                    profession is still sufficiently unpopular. When the recruit, or rather
                    conscript, arrives at the depot, he is immediately stripped, washed, and shaved:
                    if he wishes to retain any article of the dress which he brought with him, he is
                    obliged to purchase it back. The only thing he is allowed to retain, without
                    paying for it, is the cross of silver or brass which he wears round his neck.
                    This, superstition spares him as the only consolation of his miserable
                    existence; and because, however passive in other respects, the most abject serf
                    would become dangerous, if deprived of an emblem which had probably been handed
                    down from father to son for many generations, and the loss of which is
                    considered the greatest misfortune.</p>
                <p>The Russian soldier is docile, submissive, and brave: like all slaves, he is
                    supple, subservient, and cunning: like all natives of the northern regions, he
                    is hardy, patient, and enduring. He has no other thought than to do implicitly
                    as he is desired; and there is a pertinacity in his nature which inclines him to
                    persevere, or to stand firm, as the case may be, without troubling himself about
                    consequences. His courage is the result of insensibility rather than of moral
                    force of character; and hence it is commonly more of a passive than of an active
                    character. But there is, nevertheless, an element of indomitable ferocity in his
                    composition: amidst all the apparatus and parade of civilization he is still
                    three parts a barbarian. Hence his most brilliant achievements have been
                    performed under men upon whom the force of civilization had made as little
                    impression as on himself, and whom the instinct of sympathy had taught to
                    develope his natural barbarism. The Italian campaign of Suwaroff affords a
                    striking illustration of this rens ark. When that “hero, buffoon,” arrived in
                    Italy at the head of his 20,000 Russians, to take the command-in-chief of the
                    allied forces, General Chas-teler, head of the staff of the army, proposed to
                    him to make a reconnaissance of the French, who had retired behind the Oglio.
                    “Des reconnaissances !” exclaimed the Muscovite chief, “je n’en veux pas; elles
                    ne servent qu’aux gens timides, et pour avertir l’ennemi qu'on arrive; on trouve
                    toujours l’ennemi quand on veut. Des colonnes, la baïonnette, l’arme blanche,
                    attaquer, enfoncer,—voilà mes reconnaissances !” At Novi, at the Trebbia, and
                    during his extraordinary campaign in the mountains of Switzerland, this
                    wonderful barbarian, who had the instinct of genius, and a <hi rend="italic"
                    >coup d’oeil</hi> which has never been surpassed, proved that these were not
                    empty words. By a kind of rude but infallible inspiration he discerned
                    intuitively the true strategic points on which to move; and by the spell of his
                    barbaric genius he rendered the Muscovite soldier invincible. Again, in the
                    campaign of 1812, we discover another, though less striking, illustration of
                    this peculiar characteristic of the Russian troops. Barclay de Tolly, a German
                    and a foreigner, commanded in the early part of it; displaying a watchfulness, a
                    prudence, and a sagacity in divining the intentions of his adversary, which
                    proved him a great master in the art of war, and, beyond all question, saved the
                    Russian empire. But still the army was discouraged; and Alexander felt it
                    necessary to place at its head, as well as second in command, two of the ancient
                    companions in arms of the conqueror of Italy. Its courage instantly revived; and
                    the bloody day of Borodino attests how well it repaid this compliance with its
                    wishes. Ιhe Russians have a strongly marked national character, which foreigners
                    can never duly appreciate; nor will its best energies be displayed in war,
                    except under the command of men who feel its influence as powerfully as the
                    meanest soldier in its ranks. The moral force of their army consists in a
                    certain nondescript fanatical ferocity, which such men as Suwaroff, Bagration,
                    and Kutusoff can alone fully develope.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    discrimination of military character, and makes several observations which
                    appear to us equally striking and original. “L’opinion généralement accréditée
                    en Europe,” says he, “que le paysan Russe, ne possédant rien, gagne beaucoup à
                    devenir soldat, est denuée de fondement. Un grand nombre d’entre eux, outre les
                    champs de ses maitres, cultive des fruits, des légumes, travaille et trafique à
                    son compte. Beaucoup sont à leur aise; et la vie du soldat dans l’interieur du
                    pays, ne leur porte pas envie au point de la désirer. Mais quand ce paysan est
                    sous les drapeaux, il s’y attache comme à one seconde patrie Elevé de la manière
                    la plus rude, sous un climat terrible, il est le plus robuste de l’Europe, le
                    plus capable de soutenir les fatigues et les privations. Il ne connait rien de
                    plus sacré que ses devoirs; soumis à l’ordonnance comme aux précepts de sa
                    réligion, aucune fatigue, aucune intempérie, ne peut lui faire negliger les
                    obligations qu’elle impose. On voit dans toutes les marches et durant une
                    campagne entière, le cannonier près de sa pièce, au poste qui lui est assigné
                    par le réglement, et à moins d’être frappé par le for ennemi ou autorisé par son
                    chef, il ne la quitterait pour rien au monde. Le soldat du train cire son
                    harnais au bivouac par 15 degrés de froid et au jours fixés, comme il le ferait
                    dans un bon cantonnement pour aller à one parade. Cet esprit admirable d’ordre
                    et de précision, joint à l’instinct naturel que le soldat a de se pelotonner au
                    lieu de fuir quand il est enfoncé, rend les défaites extrêmement rares. Sans
                    doute, one telle troupe est moins facile à rallier sur le terrain qu’une armée
                    Française, où l’intelligence du soldat supplée souvent au défaut d’ordre; mais
                    elle est aussi plus difficile à rompre Cet instinct qu’aucune des troupes de
                    l’Europe ne possède au même degré, s’est fortifié chez les Russes par les
                    guerres contre les Tures. Là, tout fuyard est sabré par les nuées de cavaliers
                    qui se répandent sur les flancs et les derrières de l’armée. Ce n’est qu’en
                    restant fermes et réunies qu’on échappe à one destruction inévitable. This is a
                    tolerably good reason for the “instinct” of which the gallant author speaks. He
                    adds, “La plus parfaite égalité règne dans l’armée, car one fois dans la
                    carrière des armes, aucun obstacle n’empéche de la parcourir. Pour s’en
                    convaincre, on n’a qu’à voir les noms des généraux distingués dans Thistoire
                    militaire de Russie; on y trouvera autant de plébéians, ou de bas-officiers
                    parvenus par leur mérite, que dans tout autre pays.” <hi rend="italic">(Guerres

                <p>In Sweden, union and confidence have always subsisted between the soldier and the
                    citizen; and hence the desire of military service is so common among all classes
                    of the nation, that sending a man to the army is not there, as elsewhere, a
                    punishment. In 1811, when the peasantry broke out in insurrection against the
                    conscription by ballot, they offered to take arms without exception in the event
                    of war, to submit to be drilled together in time of peace, and to equip
                    themselves at their own charge, provided the obnoxious innovation was abolished;
                    tenders which were wisely accepted on the part of the government. The present
                    military establishment of Sweden is considerably below what a nation
                    constitutionally warlike might be supposed to maintain; but as the aim of the
                    government is to husband the public money, and, if possible, to relieve the
                    country from the pecuniary difficulties entailed upon it by the folly and
                    extravagance of the ex-king, all the departments of the public service have been
                    placed on the most economical footing. The actual standing army, accordingly,
                    does not exceed 35,000 men of all arms. The militia, however, is more numerous;
                    and, from the peculiar aptitude of the Swedes for military exercises, it
                    exhibits a very soldier-like appearance, though only trained for a few weeks
                    annually. Like the regular army, it is composed both of horse and foot, and must
                    afford a ready resource in the event of war. The organization of the whole is
                    excellent. The regiments of the line are recruited neither by voluntary
                    enrolment nor by conscription, but by a kind of intermediate system; every
                    landed proprietor furnishing a certain number of soldiers, to each of whom a
                    house and a portion of land are allotted for his maintenance. The Swedes have
                    been long and justly celebrated for their martial qualities; and no modern
                    nation of so small extent has made so conspicuous a figure in history. They are
                    brave, hardy, and naturally heroic men; of superior physical and corresponding
                    moral power; and, as soldiers, equal to any in the world.<note anchored="true"

                <p>The Danish army consists of rather more than 30,000 men, with a reserve of about
                    14,000. Of this force 2157 are divided throughout the kingdom of Denmark, and
                    9655 stationed in the duchies; while the remainder are employed in garrison, or
                    occupy cantonments in the vicinity of the capital. The whole is composed of a
                    staff of 23 officers; a corps of engineers of 32; an artillery corps of 3202
                    men, divided into 22 companies; 6126 cavalry, divided into ten regiments, one of
                    which is a regiment of guards; 13,412 infantry, divided into thirteen regiments
                    of two battalions each, one of which is also a regiment of guards; 2753
                    chasseurs, divided into five battalions of four companies each; and, lastly, a
                    rocket corps, amounting to 156 men. The two regiments of guards are composed of
                    very fine men, and have a noble appearance. In 1828 the artillery was
                    re-organized, and placed upon a more effective footing, both as to the <hi
                    rend="italic">materiel</hi> and <hi rend="italic">personnel.</hi> It now
                    consists of eighteen batteries of eight pieces each; besides a company of
                    sappers and miners, one of pontoon men and pioneers, with a detachment of
                    artificers, and a laboratory establishment. These eighteen batteries are divided
                    into two brigades of nine batteries and 72 guns each. In time of war the
                    battalions of reserve furnish other two brigades, one Danish and the other
                    Holstein; consisting in all of 2640 men, including officers, with a proportional
                    allotment of guns. The Danes are naturally brave, but they have been more
                    distinguished as seamen than as soldiers, in which capacity they have gathered
                    few laurels.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                <p>The electorate of Saxony, with a superficies of 717 square miles, a population of
                    2,104,336 souls, and a revenue of about 780,000 thalers, maintained in 1792 an
                    army of about 32,000 men, being a 66th part of the population; and on this
                    footing it remained till 1800, when it was increased to 38,000 men, being a 56th
                    part of the population. But Saxony having in 1802 gained a small increase of
                    territory in consequence of the treaty of Luneville, though, at the same time,
                    it lost about 1,778,000 thalers of revenue, the army was reduced to 31,000 men,
                    of which 22,000 were infantry and 6700 cavalry. This state of things continued
                    until 1806, when the military force was raised to 36,000; Saxony having then a
                    population of 2,276,000. souls. In the year 1809 she furnisheda contingent to
                    France of 16,000 men, who, under the command of Bernadotte, the present king of
                    Sweden, took part in the memorable campaign of that year, and fought at the
                    battle of Wagram; but the emperor Napoleon was so little satisfied, either with
                    the conduct of these troops, or that of their leader, on this occasion, that he
                    was with difficulty prevented from stigmatising both in the orders of the day.
                    After the peace of Vienna in 1810, the Saxon army was re-organized upon the
                    model of the French, and its contingent of 16,000 men formed the seventh corps
                    of the grand army which invaded Russia in 1812. It was commanded by General
                    Reynier. On the disastrous termination of the Russian campaign, its wrecks,
                    re-organized from the troops remaining in Saxony, entered into line in 1813,
                    after the battle of Lutzen; and on the conclusion of the armistice with the
                    Hessian corps and that of General Durutte, it formed again the seventh division.
                    The defection of the Saxon divisions at Leipsig, <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193103491" xml:id="kp-eb0703-3491-0610"/>on the 18th of October 1813,
                    is known to every body. The king of Saxony having lost his liberty in
                    consequence of the result of that disastrous day, his army was dissolved and
                    replaced by a landwehr of from 10,000 to 12,000 men, which followed in the train
                    of the allied armies when they invaded France. In 1815, however, the army was
                    reconstituted to the extent of a third of its former strength; and underwent
                    various changes until 1824, when it was finally placed on the footing on which
                    it now stands. The <hi rend="italic">infantry</hi> at present consists of two
                    companies of grenadier guards of 100 men each, four regiments of infantry of
                    three battalions each, two battalions of light infantry, one battalion of
                    carabineers and one of chasseurs; in all sixteen battalions, of four companies
                    each, or 9984 men. The <hi rend="italic">cavalry·,</hi> which formerly consisted
                    of horse guards, cuirassiers, hulans, and hussars, has been transformed into
                    four regiments of light horse, consisting of four squadrons of two companies
                    each, or 467 men, on the footing of peace; in all 1872. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >artillery</hi> consists of one regiment making twelve companies, two of which
                    are horse, amounting to 1060 sub-officers and soldiers, together with a train of
                    189 men and as many horses. A dozen officers without troops, and a company of
                    sappers 67 strong, compose the <hi rend="italic">engineer</hi> department. The
                    institutions connected with the army are a school for cadets, and a military
                    academy, both at Dresden. The reputation of the Saxon infantry is low; but the
                    cavalry is better than the infantry, and is well qualified for the service of
                    the advanced posts, which was its usual destination under Napoleon.<note

                <p>The composition of the Hanoverian army was fixed by a royal decree of the 14th
                    July 1820. The <hi rend="italic">infantry</hi> consists of twelve regiments of
                    two battalions each, and the battalion is divided into four companies. There are
                    two of these regiments guards; and the whole are divided into three brigades,
                    the first consisting of five regiments, the second of four, and the third of
                    three. Each regiment consists of 42 officers and 1284 men. There are eight
                    regiments of <hi rend="italic">cavalry,</hi> two of cuirassiers of the guard,
                    four of hussars, and two of hulans; and each regiment is composed of four
                    squadrons, 48 officers, 433 men, and 403 horses. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >artillery</hi> consists of one regiment of two battalions, each divided into
                    three companies, one of which is horse, and contains 70 officers, 1158 men, and
                    210 horses. The corps of <hi rend="italic">engineers</hi> and artificers
                    consists of 19 officers and 46 men. The artillery is of the English model and
                    calibre, and its batteries, both horse and foot, consist of six pieces and a
                    howitzer each. The total strength of the army, therefore, including th.e staff,
                    amounts to 825 officers, 20,091 men, and 3431 horse. The period of service in
                    the infantry of the guard is four years only, but in all the other corps six
                    years. The cavalry and artillery are recruited as much as possible from
                    volunteers. The Hanoverians make excellent, soldiers; and it is well known that,
                    during the Peninsular campaigns, no part of the Duke of Wellington’s army more
                    frequently distinguished itself than the King’s German Legion, which was almost
                    exclusively composed of Hanoverian volunteers.<note anchored="true"

                <p>The Bavarian is one of the largest of the third rate armies. Its <hi

                    three battalions, of 16 regiments of the line in two, and of two battalions of
                    chasseurs; presenting an effective force of 37 battalions, or 43,561 men. Its
                    <hi rend="italic">cavalry</hi> is composed of a regiment of <hi rend="italic"
                    >gardes du corps,</hi> two regiments of cuirassiers in four squadrons each, and
                    six regiments of light horse in six squadrons; forming a total of 48 squadrons,
                    or 9549 men, and 6000 horse. The <hi rend="italic">artillery corps,</hi>
                    commanded by a lieutenant-general, consists of one regiment of cannoneers of
                    four battalions, one battalion of train in four divisions, and four companies of
                    artificers, pontoneers, sappers, and miners. Each battalion of artillery is
                    divided into six companies, one of which consists of light troops; and the
                    companies of pontoneers, miners, and sappers, have each an effective force of
                    100 men, including officers. The <hi rend="italic">engineer corps</hi> is
                    composed of a general, a colonel, a lieutenant-colonel, two majors, two
                    captains, eight lieutenants of the first class, eight of the second, and six
                    conductors, and is divided among the five directions of Munich, Augsburg,
                    Nuremberg, Wiirtz-burg, and Lindau. The Bavarian army, therefore, consists of
                    43,561 infantry, 9547 cavalry, 3515 artillery, 1464 train, and 150 artificers;
                    in all 56,919 men, with 6420 horse. Every Bavarian, the clergy only excepted, is
                    obliged to bear arms in defence of his country; but, in practice, students and
                    persons necessary to their families are usually exempted; and permission is
                    likewise granted to serve by substitute. The method of recruitment is
                    conscription. Besides the permanent army, there is a reserve destined to
                    reinforce it; and, in the event of war, the landwehr may be equally called upon
                    to support the army, when reinforced by the battalions of the reserve, but only
                    in the interior. The <hi rend="italic">landwehr</hi> is divided into two
                    classes, one of which comprehends those who are least capable of performing
                    active service, and who cannot in any case be employed beyond the limits of
                    their district. In time of peace it co-operates in the maintenance of public
                    tranquillity, when put in requisition for that purpose, and when the troops of
                    the line are deemed insufficient. The Bavarian army is well organized, and has
                    always maintained a respectable character for discipline and bravery. The
                    cavalry is considered superior to the infantry.<note anchored="true"

                    3 foot, besides a garrison company: but it has no engineer corps distinct from
                    that of the artillery. Its peace establishment is composed of 368 officers, 1504
                    sub-officers, and 5184 soldiers; or 6996 combatants, and 1806 horse: on a war
                    footing it would amount to 520 officers, 2302 sub-officers, and 14,508 soldiers,
                    or 17,330 combatants, and 5228 horse. The Wurtemberg army is recruited by
                    voluntary enrolment and forced levies. The military age is from 18 to 30 for
                    enrolment, and from 20 to 25 for levies; and, in both cases, the élite of the
                    population only is taken. This little army is well-officered, and enjoys some
                    consideration. Count Bismark, the able author of <hi rend="italic">Lectures on

                <p>The organic law of the military constitution of the Ger- ’ manic confederation,
                    adopted on the 9th April 1821, in the fifteenth full sitting of the diet, and
                    forming the basis on which the federal army has been organized, is exceedingly
                    ’complex, and altogether unsusceptible of analysis within die space which the
                    limits of this article afford. Its leading provisions, however, may be shortly
                    stated, and are as follow :—The army of the confederation is composed of the
                    contingents of all the states members thereof, raised according to the formation
                    of their particular <hi rend="italic">matricule</hi> or computation in the diet.
                    The proportion of the different arms is regulated conformably to the principles
                    of the new tactics. The federal army is formed of corps d’armée of a single
                    nation or of combined corps, and both are subdivided into divisions, brigades,
                    and regiments. No state of the confederation, whose contingent forms one or more
                    corps d’armée, can combine contingents of other states with its own in the same
                    division; and the states which have corps or divisions combined, concert
                    together the manner of forming and organizing them, and in case of dispute the
                    diet decides. In the organization of the federal army regard is had to the
                    interest resulting from the particular relations of different states, in as far
                    as can be done consistently with the general object of the confederation; and as
                    the rights and duties of all the confederate states are the same, it is
                    specially provided that every appearance of supremacy on the part of one state
                    over another is to be avoided. The contingent of each state must always be
                    completely equipped and ready to take the field as soon as it shall be called to
                    do so; but the force and assembling of the army to be raised, as well as of the
                    reserve, are regulated by particular dispositions of the diet. 1. The ordinary
                    contingent of each state is one hundredth part of its population, conformably to
                    a table prepared and rectified from time to time by the diet. 2. The proportion
                    of the cavalry of the federal army is fixed at one seventh of the total of the
                    troops; and two field-pieces are required for every 2000 men of the contingent,
                    besides one for every 1000 of the reserve in arsenal. 3. The federal army
                    consists of 10 corps d’armée, 7 simple and 3 combined, designed in the order of
                    the digits or primary numbers; and every corps has at least 2 divisions, each
                    division at least 2 brigades, each brigade at least 2 regiments, each regiment
                    of infantry at least 2 battalions of 800 men each, and each regiment of cavalry
                    at least <hi rend="italic">4</hi> squadrons of 140 men each. The <hi
                    rend="italic">minimum</hi> of a contingent of cavalry is 300 horse, of infantry
                    400 men, and of artillery a battery of six or eight pieces. 4. As the contingent
                    of each state must be ready to take the field in a month after it is called
                    upon, all the <hi rend="italic">materiel</hi> of armament and provisions
                    necessary for the contingent must be deposited in the arsenals of each state,
                    and all the contingents of the army must be kept up to their full complement
                    even in time of peace. 5. The generalissimo of die confederation is chosen by
                    the diet in ordinary assembly, and his functions cease when the federal army is
                    dissolved. 6. The commanders of the corps of every nation or state have the
                    rights which the sovereign whose troops they command may think proper to confer
                    upon them, without deviating from the principles upon which the military
                    constitution is founded. There is a great number of other dispositions and
                    regulations, touching a variety of matters; but those above specified are the
                    principal, and may serve to convey an idea of the military constitution of this
                    great confederacy, organized in imitation of that which, while it seemed to
                    strengthen the hands of Napoleon, proved eventually, by the defection of its
                    members, one of the chief causes of accelerating his fall.<note anchored="true"

                <p>The military power of the United Provinces dates its commencement from the middle
                    of the fifteenth century, when, after a long and sanguinary struggle, they
                    succeeded in emancipating themselves from the yoke of Spain; and, in the
                    following century it received considerable development in consequence of the
                    wars which they had to maintain against Louis XIV. In 1702 they had in their pay
                    upwards of 100,000 men, exclusive of 30,000 who were in the service of the Dutch
                    East India Company. But this period may be regarded as the highest condition of
                    the army of Holland, which subsequently declined both in number and reputation;
                    so that in 1775 it did not exceed 30,000 men, fully one third of whom were
                    foreigners. In 1789, Holland, with a population of 2,340,000 souls, inhabiting a
                    country of 625 square miles, supported an army of 36,000 men, consisting of40
                    regiments of infan try and 10 of cavalry; and with this force it joined the
                    first coalition against the French republic. In 1792 the Dutch army had been
                    increased to 39,000 infantry, 3450 cavalry, 1560 artillery, and 260 miners and
                    pontoneers; making a total of 44,270 combatants. But in the campaigns of 1793
                    and 1794 they afforded the Prince of Orange occasion for displaying considerable
                    military talents, put his army to a decisive test, and impressed all with a
                    conviction that its degeneracy in moral force was equalled only by the radical
                    defects of its organization. The conquest of Holland by the French, however, was
                    followed, in 1795, by the reorganization of the army on new bases; and so great
                    was the effect of the changes thus introduced, that the Batavian troops, led by
                    Dumonceau and Daendels, rivalled the French, by whose side they fought, both in
                    discipline and valour, and at Alkmaër, on the Rednitz, and on the Danube,
                    bravely upheld the ancient reputation of the Dutch arms. At the peace of 1815,
                    Belgium having been united to Holland in order to form a constitutional
                    monarchy, and England having restored the greater part of the Dutch colonies
                    which had fallen into its hands during the republican and imperial regime, the
                    new kingdom of the Netherlands at once, and as it were <hi rend="italic"
                    >per</hi><hi rend="italic">saltum,</hi> took its place among states of the
                    second order, with a continental superficies of 1165 square miles, and a
                    population of 6,166,854; and lost no time in organizing a military system suited
                    to its position and rank among the nations of Europe. This system rests on a
                    permanent army of about 50,000 men on the footing of peace, and 82,000 on that
                    of war; with an eventual army of national guards estimated at 40,000 during
                    peace, and 124,000 on a war establishment. The kingdom is divided into 6 great
                    and 17 provincial commands, 6 directions of artillery and engineers, and 50
                    cantons for the levy of the militia and the organization of the national guard.
                    The great commands are confided to lieutenant-generals, the provincial commands
                    to major-generals, the directions of artillery and engineers to general
                    officers, and the militia cantons to old officers of a superior grade. The <hi
                    rend="italic">infantry</hi> consists of 18 divisions of 4 battalions from 3 to 6
                    companies each, with a depot company; the <hi rend="italic">cavalry,</hi> of 9
                    regiments 4 squadrons each, of which 4 are cuirassiers, 2 light dragoons, 2
                    hussars, and 1 lancers; the <hi rend="italic">artillery,</hi> of 10 battalions,
                    4 of the line and 6 of the militia, each of 6 companies, a corps of light
                    artillery, and a battalion of the train; and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >engineers,</hi> of a battalion of miners, sappers, and pontoneers. There is
                    also included in the army a colonial depot, to which are attached 2 correctional
                    divisions, 5 garrison companies one of them artillery, and 9 companies of <hi
                    rend="italic">maréchaussée,</hi> stationed in the southern provinces of the
                    kingdom. The army of the Netherlands is recruited exclusively from the natives
                    of the country, first, by voluntary enrolments; <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193103517" xml:id="kp-eb0703-3517-0612"/>secondly, by engagements and
                    re-engagements for two, four, and six years, with a bounty; thirdly, by calling
                    out the whole or part of the militia; and, lastly, by the rccal of men absent on
                    leave, or by having recourse to the reserve. The militia is composed of youth
                    between the ages of 19 and 23, and draughts are made every year in the month of
                    March, in the presence of the commissaries of militia and the local authorities.
                    Advancement is principally regulated by seniority; but every soldier
                    distinguished for intelligence and good conduct may aspire to the rank of
                    officer. The army of the Netherlands has still a character to make for itself.
                    As a national force it has never as yet been put to the test. But it has been
                    organized with great care, and unless political dissensions interfere to destroy
                    its <hi rend="italic">morale,</hi> there can be little doubt that it will
                    conduct itself respectably when called to serve in the field. The Belgian
                    troops, it is true, behaved ill at Waterloo; but they were evidently disaffected
                    to the cause for which they were called to fight.<note anchored="true"

                    militia. The permanent army consists of the household troops, the royal guard,
                    the troops of the line, and the carabineers. The household troops consist of
                    four companies of horseguards, called the Savoyard, the Piedmontese, the
                    Sardinian, and the Genoese. The royal guard is composed of a brigade of
                    grenadiers, and a regiment of chasseurs <hi rend="italic">a pied,</hi> of the
                    same composition and force as a regiment of the line. The <hi rend="italic"

                    squadrons or 4 divisions. The carabineers amount to 3100 men, including officers
                    and 100 élèves, and form a sort of nursery for the army. Since the 3d January
                    1823, the corps of <hi rend="italic">artillery</hi> has consisted of 4
                    battalions, of which 2 are of the line, 1 light artillery, and 1 partly garrison

                    the Sardinian army amounted to 30,000 infantry, 3600 cavalry, and upwards of
                    2000 artillery and engineers. In the year 1815, its total force, exclusive of
                    the royal guard, was not less than 70,000 men. “La Piémontais,” says Jomini,

                    is scarcely deserving of notice, either in a political or military point of
                    view; for, next to the soldiers of his Holiness the Pope, those of Naples are
                    beyond all dispute the worst in Europe. In 1792 the Neapolitan army amounted to
                    30,000 troops of the line, as they were called, and 15,000 militia; a force
                    which was increased, in 1799, to 60,000 men of all arms; 40,000 of whom invaded
                    the Roman states during the campaign of that year, and conducted themselves
                    rather like banditti than a regular army. Formidable only to its allies, and to
                    the country which it serves to retain in abject servitude, this army has since
                    experienced the most violent mutations; but its number at present may be
                    estimated at from 35,000 to 40,000 men of all arms.</p>
                <p>At the period when the Ottomans first became formidable to Europe, they may be
                    said to have composed one immense army. Every Osmanlee was a soldier, and from
                    the age of sixteen to sixty held himself at the disposal of the state; whilst
                    all were animated with a martial fanaticism, which in fact constituted the main
                    sinew of their strength. They were brave, ardent, enterprising; and if their
                    services in the common cause (which they could not withhold as long as they were
                    able to bear arms) remained unpaid, they were not unrequited. A third of the
                    conquered land was distributed amongst them, and held on the tenure of military
                    service; the peasantry cultivated the fields thus ceded to the soldiery, and
                    paid the rents to their military landlords; and the holders of the <hi
                    rend="italic">ziarnets</hi> and <hi rend="italic">timars,</hi> or greater and
                    lesser grants, received from the fund of conquest rewards proportioned to their
                    services. But this system, although it placed a large numerical force at the
                    disposal of the chief, was nevertheless attended with serious inconveniences. It
                    created a sort of feudal militia, but was incompatible with the existence of a
                    permanent force; it supplied means for a short expedition or campaign, but a
                    continued series of operations was constantly liable to be paralyzed by the
                    soldiers returning to their homes while these were still in progress. To obviate
                    this evil, it was resolved to raise a body of mercenaries, whose services should
                    be at all times available. Accordingly, sultan Amurath, at the suggestion of his
                    vizier, claimed as his right the fifth part of the Christian youth captured in
                    Bulgaria, Albania, Servia, and Bosnia; who, being instructed in the law of the
                    prophet, and inured to arms, formed a body of soldiers totally distinct from
                    those liable to serve in virtue of their military holdings, and unconnected with
                    the rest of the empire by the ties either of birth or of kindred. Such was the
                    origin of the janissaries. Organized into a regular force, at a time when the
                    armies of Christian powers consisted of a disorderly militia, and uniting
                    courage and enthusiasm with a species of discipline, and a blind obedience to
                    the will of their commanders, this powerful body swept all before them, and
                    spread far and wide the terror of the Ottoman arms. Nor did the splendour <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193103530" xml:id="kp-eb0703-3530-0613"/> of their
                    achievements suffer any eclipse as long as Christian captives could be obtained
                    to fill the vacancies in their ranks. But when the janissaries ceased to form a
                    class distinct from the great mass of the nation; when they were allowed to
                    marry and enrol their children; and when the <hi rend="italic">odas</hi> or
                    regiments became encumbered with men who preferred inglorious ease in the bosom
                    of their families to the toilsand dangers of the battle-field; they at the same
                    time ceased to be formidable to their enemies, and, like the praetorian cohorts
                    of ancient Rome, were dreaded only by their emperors. They could raise an
                    insurrection in the capital, demand the head of an obnoxious vizier, and depose
                    or murder an unpopular sultan; but “the yellow-haired Giaours” had learned to
                    despise them in the field; and, in their degeneracy, they seemed destined to
                    accelerate the ruin of that empire which, in their better days, they had
                    contributed so largely to extend and consolidate.</p>
                <p>On this class of men, however, did the Porte, until recently, depend in a great
                    measure for defence against her enemies; and although their inefficiency was
                    daily becoming more apparent, and reform more necessary, every attempt to effect
                    a change of system, and regenerate these Osmanlee praetorians, had proved either
                    abortive or disastrous. In vain did Selim try to remodel them, and restore
                    discipline. The attempt cost him his life. In vain did Mahmoud, on his
                    accession, manifest an intention to enforce the regulations of Suleiman the
                    Magnificent. An insurrection was the consequence. During three days the streets
                    of the capital ran with blood; and the sultan, in order to save his own life,
                    was obliged to command the execution of his brother. But Mahmoud was not of a
                    disposition to be daunted by this failure, although it induced him to change his
                    mode of proceeding. He now saw that nothing less than the complete destruction
                    of the janissaries would enable him to improve the condition of his empire, by
                    carrying through the reforms which he already meditated; and he waited patiently
                    until he could strike the blow with a certainty of success. In 1826, the
                    janissaries, who perceived the storm gathering, again mutinied. But it was now
                    too late. They found the sultan prepared for them; and, in raising the cry of
                    insurrection, they only gave the signal for their own destruction. The
                    artillery-men and other troops, faithful to Mahmoud, surrounded them in the
                    Etmeidan: they attempted to defend themselves, but without success: 20,000
                    perished in the conflict; and the janissaries as a body were from that moment
                    annihilated. This achievement, though accomplished at a terrible sacrifice of
                    life, was in reality an act of humanity as well as of sound policy; and, viewed
                    in its proper light, it reflects equal honour on the wisdom and firmness of the
                    sultan, who planned so judiciously and executed so vigorously a measure full of
                    peril in itself, yet absolutely indispensable as a preliminary step to
                    improvement of any kind.</p>
                <p>The suppression of the corps of janissaries having left Mahmoud at liberty to
                    remodel his army conformably to the principles of European science and tactics,
                    he hastened to supply the void occasioned by the destruction of the force to
                    which the country had hitherto trusted for its defence; and orders were
                    immediately issued directing the enrolment of a certain number of men in every
                    province of the empire, excepting Albania, Bosnia, and the African states. But
                    the sultan experienced greater difficulty in raising new troops than he had
                    probably anticipated; for, although the law which places the services of every
                    Moslemin at the disposal of the sultan existed in full force, it applied only to
                    a state of war; and on no previous occasion had such a system of enrolment been
                    resorted to during time of peace; a circumstance which rendered it exceedingly
                    obnoxious to the populace. Another obstacle to the speedy reconstruction of the
                    army consisted in the necessity of excluding from the new corps all persons
                    suspected of what may be called <hi rend="italic">janissarism;</hi> and as it
                    had been customary for every Moslemin, on attaining the age of manhood, to
                    inscribe his name in some oda or regiment of janissaries, the only method by
                    which Mahmoud could hope to secure his troops from the contamination of that
                    proscribed sect was by enrolling none but boys in his army. But the adoption of
                    such a plan necessarily created a proportionate difficulty in filling the ranks;
                    while, to add to the embarrassments of the Ottoman reformer, the new system had
                    scarcely been twelve months in operation when Russia declared war against the
                    Porte. That this was a politic proceeding on the part of the Muscovite
                    government, no one can doubt. Mahmoud was caught in the very act of transition
                    from a bad system to a better one; the regiments of the Ottoman army were still
                    incomplete; and the unpopularity of the contest, with a dread of the Russian
                    arms, acted as an additional check to enlistment, and thus aggravated the evils
                    with which the sultan had to contend. The new troops were, however, brought into
                    action. They were as yet too ignorant of the advantages of discipline to benefit
                    by the instructions they had received; their manoeuvres served but to confuse
                    them; the officers were superior to the men only in name, and the generals were
                    equally destitute of talent; the interior organization of the army was
                    lamentably defective; and the troops had but little confidence either in their
                    officers or in themselves. Ye∙, with all these disadvantages, the first campaign
                    terminated favourably for the Turks; and it cannot reasonably be doubted that
                    the second one (that of 1829), would have had a similar result, if the Osmanlees
                    had been commanded by a man possessed even of ordinary military talents and
                    enterprise. The grand vizier was unquestionably a brave man; and, unlike Yusuff
                    Pasha, he was faithful as well as brave. But, with 40,000 regular troops,
                    superior to any that the Porte had ever sent into the field, he allowed himself
                    to be surprised at Kiulewtscha or Kuleftscha, and, having lost more than the
                    half of his force, was compelled to retire to Shumla with the remainder. The
                    succeeding events of the campaign were the natural corollaries of this
                    disastrous battle: But without dwelling upon these, which are foreign to the
                    objects of the present article, we shall proceed to give some account of the
                    Ottoman army as it is at present constituted.<note anchored="true"

                    which it could have been wished that Captain Trant had been somewhat more
                    specific; but on a subject where exact information was not easily attainable,

                <p>The Ottoman army is composed of regular and irregular infantry and cavalry, a

                    whom 10,000 compose the imperial guard, quartered in and around Constantinople.
                    They are recruited from the mass of the people without distinction; and although
                    Mahmoud did not oblige the children of his nobility to enter into the service,
                    yet, at the beginning of the late war, many enlisted voluntarily, and even some
                    of the Ulemas, or expounders of the law, forsook their peaceful profession and
                    enrolled themselves. The black and white <pb break="no" facs="nls:193103543"

                    white-visaged inhabitant of Rumelia. <hi rend="italic"/><note anchored="true"

                    martial qualities are not necessarily connected with colour; and discipline, if
                    rigorously enforced, will in time mould even these variegated elements into a

                    enrolled, a soldier is obliged to serve for life; but it frequently happens that
                    discharges are granted. The regular troops are organized on the model of the
                    French army, and are divided into corps d’armĕe, divisions, brigades, and
                    regiments. The corps d’ armée is commanded by a seraskier, the division by a
                    pasha of three tails, the brigade by a pasha of two tails, the regiment by a
                    miri-alaÿ or colonel, and the battalion by a bimbashee or chef de bataillon. A
                    regiment consists of a regimental staff (including the miri-alaÿ or colonel, the
                    caimacan miri-alaÿ or lieutenant-colonel, and the alaÿ-eminy or major) and three
                    battalions, each composed of one bimbashee or chef de bataillon, one
                    sagh-col-aghassy or adjutant-major, one sol-col-aghassy or adjutant, 8
                    yuzbashees or captains, 16 mulazims or lieutenants, 32 tchiaoucłies or
                    Serjeants, 48 on-bashees or corporals, and 720 men; making a total of 2484
                    officers and soldiers, exclusive of a drum-major, an imaum or chaplain, and a
                    kiatip or clerk. The inveterate prejudices of the Moslemins against the
                    employment of European officers in the service have prevented Mahmoud from
                    placing any foreigners in command of his troops; and these have hitherto been
                    disciplined, partly by officers who had served under Selim in the Nizam Djedid,
                    partly by persons sent from the Egyptian army. The only footing on which the
                    Turks will consent to tolerate an European officer is as an instructor; and in
                    this capacity Signor Calosso, a ci-devant captain of dragoons in the Italian
                    army of prince Eugene Beauharnois, has been employed by the sultan to
                    superintend the discipline of his cavalry. But the infantry have not been
                    equally fortunate, and are consequently labouring under very great
                    disadvantages. The officers, taken from the same class of society with the
                    common soldiers, differ from them in nothing but rank and name: in the Turkish
                    army there is no one to look up to, no natural aristocracy created by
                    superiority of condition and of knowledge: the same ignorance and the same
                    prejudices pervade all ranks: and, having the benefit neither of examples nor of
                    models, their progress in discipline has been necessarily slow. The Turks seem
                    to think that performing the manual and platoon exercises with tolerable
                    precision, marching in companies instead of independently, and wearing a
                    peculiar uniform, is sufficient to class them with disciplined troops. But, in
                    their anxiety to attain the end desired, they have overlooked some of the most
                    essential means. The soldier, for example, is placed in the ranks before he
                    knows how to march; and provided he goes through the manual and platoon
                    exercises, it matters not whether his carriage be steady or the reverse. When in
                    the ranks, the men talk and laugh without restraint, and even address themselves
                    to their officers; whilst the latter, instead of checking, encourage these
                    improprieties, by joining in or retorting the rude ribaldry of the troops.
                    Field-officers are indeed treated with the most obsequious respect by their
                    inferiors; but the line which has been drawn betwixt the privates and subaltern
                    officers is by no means sufficiently distinct; and it is easy to perceive
                    throughout, that the hand of a master is wanting to combine all the elements of
                    discipline, which are now but imperfectly understood, and to impress upon the
                    higher ranks the necessity of studying their profession, in order to qualify
                    them for discharging the duties of command, as well as to ensure the respect and
                    obedience of the troops.</p>
                <p>The Turkish <hi rend="italic">cavalry</hi> had so long been celebrated for its
                    gallantry and enterprise, that the policy of remodelling it seems exceedingly
                    questionable. This, however, has been attempted, though, as it appears, with
                    very indifferent success. Four squadrons of dragoons are attached to the guard,
                    and compose the only regular cavalry in the empire. These are mounted and
                    equipped in the European fashion; but the horses are small in size,
                    ill-conditioned, and badly groomed;<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>This may seem singular, considering the ideas generally
                    entertained of Turkish horses: but, in the first place, these are very much
                    exaggerated; and, secondly, the government were obliged to purchase horses
                    wherever they could be found—in Asia, 1tumelia, and Wallachia. The best horses
                    belong to the irregular cavalry.</p></note> and the men find so great difficulty
                    in accommodating themselves to the European method of riding with long stirrups,
                    that their seat is loose and ungraceful, and they are not unſrequently thrown
                    from their saddles, to their own infinite mortification. The scimitar, so
                    effective in the hand of a Turk when mounted in the fashion of his country, has
                    also been exchanged for the French light dragoon sabre; a weapon so differently
                    balanced from that which the Osmanlees have long been accustomed to handle, that
                    they are not likely soon to acquire much dexterity in the use of it. These
                    changes, in fact, seem the very wantonness of innovation; for whilst they have
                    destroyed all that is national or characteristic in this description of force,
                    they have substituted nothing effective in its stead; and Mahmoud will probably
                    find to his cost that he has sacrificed a superb light cavalry for wretched
                    dragoons. His policy should have been, to leave to the Turks their national
                    horsemanship and their national weapons, and to direct his attention exclusively
                    to field tactics and manoeuvres, in order to give unity and effect to those
                    daring charges which they are so admirably fitted to execute effectively in
                    their own way. Without firmness in their saddles or confidence in their weapons,
                    the new troops may make a tolerable appearance on parade; but if sent into the
                    field, they will, in all probability, be found unable to contend with the worst
                    description of horse to which they may be opposed.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">artillery</hi> is of two kinds, viz. foot and horse. The
                    topejees or foot artillery are said to be at present 6500 strong; and although
                    their new organization has not taken place, it is understood to be the intention
                    of the sultan to form them as soon as possible into regiments. The
                    horseartillery, though in a very inefficient state compared with ours, has made
                    considerable progress in discipline. It is divided into two regiments of four
                    troops each; and every troop consists of one captain, three subalterns, 180 men,
                    180 horse, and 10 guns; thus making the total effective strength of a regiment
                    786 men, 720 horses, and 40 guns, which are commonly nine-pounders and
                    five-and-a-half-inch howitzers. The officers are supplied with horses by the
                    government; and the forage allowed to each horse is nine pounds of barley and
                    twelve pounds of chopped straw <hi rend="italic">per diem.</hi> The corps of
                    bombardiers and miners amounts to about 2000 men; but they are still quite
                    undisciplined, and as ignorant of the scientific as they are negligent of the
                    practical part of their profession; their gun carriages, platforms, and
                    ammunition waggons, being in a shameful state, and totally unfit for service.
                    The education of artillery officers has hitherto been entirely neglected; but a
                    college has recently been established for their instruction in the theory and
                    practice of gunnery.</p>
                <p>The irregular army may be said to comprise the whole <pb break="no"

                    Ottoman empire; since, as already stated, every Moslemin, if required, is
                    obliged to join the army during time of war. The irregular cavalry is raised by
                    the Znaims andTimariots, who hold feudal grants from the Porte on tenure of
                    military service. The irregular infantry is assembled by the pashas and inferior
                    officers in the provinces. Sixty years ago, the irregular cavalry constituted by
                    far the most formidable and effective force belonging to Turkey; but the country
                    whence it was derived having been wrested from the Porte by Catherine II., her
                    enemies now use it with great effect against her.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>During the last campaign the Turks had
                    generally bad information, frequently none at all, respecting the movements of

                    communications which gave Diebitsch so great a superiority during the latter
                    part of the campaign, and enabled him to surprise the vizier at Kiulewtscha, to
                    mask the celebrated march by which he turned the barrier of the Haemus, and to
                    acquire for himself the well-merited distinction of Zabalkansky, or Passer of
                    the Balkan. The troops sent to intercept him in the mountain gorges arrived too
                    late, and Zabalkansky was thus enabled, with a handful of troops, to dictate
                    peace in the ancient capital of the empire.</p></note> The Khans of the Crimea
                    were most useful tributaries of the Porte, and were at all times ready to take
                    the field with from 40,000 to 50,000 horse of the very best description,
                    considered as irregular troops. Brave, hardy, accustomed to support fatigue and
                    privation, inured to riding from their infancy, and obedient to their leaders,
                    the Crim Tartars formed the main strength of the Turkish armies; and, superior
                    to the Timariots, who had become enervated by peaceful habits, were prepared for
                    all kinds of service, nay even to encounter the best regular cavalry that could
                    be brought against them. The loss of the Crimea, therefore, and of the
                    enterprising troops it supplied, inflicted a severe, if not an irreparable,
                    injury on the military resources of Turkey. The irregular cavalry.is now
                    principally drawn from the Asiatic provinces; but as the Mahommedan population
                    has much decreased, this force is consequently less numerous than formerly. The
                    irregular infantry, called Seimens, is furnished by the pashas, ayans,
                    mous-selims, and voivodes; and, during the last war, some regiments so raised
                    received pay from the Porte. The men were drawn from Rumelia and Asia; and it is
                    not a little remarkable, that of those who distinguished themselves most in the
                    field, the majority had belonged to the proscribed corps of janissaries, many of
                    whom are still to be met with in all parts of the empire, notwithstanding the
                    severe measures adopted for their extermination. The spirit of janissarism,
                    indeed, is still latent in a large portion of the population. The sultan has
                    scotched the snake, not killed it; and the utmost vigilance will be necessary on
                    his part to prevent its resuscitation.</p>
                <p>The military establishments of Turkey have yet, in a great measure, to be
                    created; but the sultan is indefatigable in urging on improvement to the utmost
                    extent of his crippled means. The only founderies for casting cannon are in
                    Constantinople. They are three in number: one of two furnaces, attached to the
                    military arsenal at Tophana; another, also of two furnaces, near the naval
                    arsenal; and a third of one furnace at Hassquiou, the bombardier barracks. In
                    one of these establishments sufficient metal can be melted to cast from five to
                    seven guns at a time; but in all, the tools are of the coarsest description, and
                    every thing is effected by manual labour, without the aid of machinery. The
                    workmen are Turks and Armenians. The military arsenal at Toph ana contains a
                    large stock of artillery of various calibres, and some of extraordinary
                    length.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Near the
                    seraglio are several enormous guns carrying stone balls like those fired at our
                    fleet when passing the Dardanelles in 1808. But cannon of this description can
                    only be discharged with effect when the object passes their line of fire, as
                    they are not mounted upon carriages, but built in a wall. Some of the guns at
                    the Dardanelles carry balls twenty-six inches and a half in diameter.</p></note>
                    The field-pieces are in tolerable order, but the guns have neither sights nor
                    scales. -A manufactory of muskets has existed for some years; but although as
                    many as 120 can be made daily, the supply is found insufficient, and the troops
                    are mostly armed with French muskets purchased at Marseilles. There are eight
                    handsome barracks in and near Constantinople, viz. Daoud Pasha, Ramah Chiflic,
                    the Seraskiers, Tophana, Scutari, Hassquiou, and the two Pera barracks, which
                    have been erected either by Selim or Mahmoud, and are said to be capable of
                    containing 72,000 men, although this is most probably an exaggeration. They are
                    by far the most splendid edifices in Constantinople, and are considered equal to
                    any structures of the kind in Europe. Schools or colleges of medicine, of the
                    marine, of music, and of military instruction, have been recently established at
                    Constantinople. The medical school contains about 100 students, and the number
                    will probably be soon increased, as each regiment is to have both a physician
                    and surgeon attached to it.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>There was nothing in Turkey which stood more in need of reform than the
                    healing or rather the killing art. With all their predestinarian prejudices, the
                    Osmanlees place unbounded faith in the skill and knowledge of physicians; and
                    although they have been at all times ready to acknowledge the superiority of
                    Europeans in the science of medicine, they have nevertheless for the most part
                    been obliged to intrust the welfare of their bodies to empirical adventurers,
                    whose knowledge had been acquired much in the same manner as that of the learned
                    hakim Yacoob, so admirably described in “Anastasius.” Mahmoud’s medical school,
                    if it prosper, may in time have the effect of putting down those pernicious
                    quacks.</p></note> Between three and four hundred young men are instructed at
                    the military school, which is under the superintendence of the chief bombardier,
                    in mathematics and the principles of fortification and gunnery; and some few
                    French works upon military subjects have been translated into Turkish for the
                    benefit of the students. Sultan Mahmoud has also established a kind of
                    commissariat department, under the control of the Asker Nazirÿ, or
                    superintendent of the troops; but the establishment is yet in its infancy, and
                    the arrangements are very imperfect. Greater progress has, however, been made in
                    reforming the pay department, in which enormous abuses formerly prevailed; the
                    troops and the sultan having been alike plundered by the knaves intrusted with
                    this important branch of the public service. But since the management of the
                    finance, commissariat, and general organization of the army has been vested in
                    the Asker Nazirÿ, conjointly with the seraskier and other high official persons,
                    matters have been placed on a much better footing, and the soldiers have now
                    little to complain of. The new military code has been modelled upon that issued
                    by Sultan Suleiman, when he reformed the corps of janissaries, and restored
                    their ancient discipline; and although it is still in many respects imperfect
                    and defective, it seems, upon the whole, calculated to ameliorate the moral
                    condition of the Ottoman soldier.</p>
                <p>The reforms effected by Sultan Mahmoud in the military organization of the Turks
                    rendered it expedient for the Greeks to attempt to form regular corps, in order
                    to keep on a level with their enemy in point of discipline and tactics.
                    Accordingly, on the 27th February 1827, the president ordered a military force
                    to be organized in regiments <hi rend="italic">(chiliarchies)</hi> of two

                    October ordains the formation of a battalion of artillery of six companies, with
                    a suitable cortege of officers; and embodies in it a sort of provisional code of
                    military law. But little or no progress has as yet been made in the organization
                    of a standing force; for the battle of Navarin and the war between Russia and
                    Turkey removed the immediate stimulus of fear, which alone can make the Greeks
                    carry through any thing; whilst the favourable turn which affairs have since
                    taken, and the certain establishment of Greek independence, have rendered the
                    measure in some degree unnecessary. We may add, that the decrees are drawn up in
                    a very crude manner, and make no mention whatsoever of the number of
                    chiliarchies or regiments which it was intended to raise.<note anchored="true"

                <p>The American armies require only a very cursory notice. That of the United
                    States, exclusive of militia, does not amount to 10,000 men. It consists of
                    seven regiments of infantry, four of artillery, some engineers, and a sort of
                    general staff; and it is formed into three divisions, each under the command of
                    a general officer. That called the eastern, under the orders of major-general
                    Gaines, is composed of 53 companies, consisting of 233 officers, and 2662
                    non-commissioned officers and privates. The western division, commanded by
                    Brigadier-General Atkinson, is also composed of 53 companies, amounting in all
                    to 2463 men, including 178 officers. The third division, which has no relative
                    territorial denomination, consists solely of recruits enlisted for the regular
                    service in different parts of the union, and does not exceed 2500 men. The
                    republicans of the west have a great aversion to a standing army, and only
                    maintain a sort of skeleton, to be filled up, in case of need, from the militia
                    force. The troops of the United States excel in bush-fighting; but they have
                    neither organization nor discipline, and on any other soil than their own would
                    be any thing but formidable.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    the infantry and artillery of the line. The guard, which ranks at the head of
                    the army, consists of two regiments of infantry, one grenadiers and the other
                    chasseurs, and three regiments of cavalry, one of carabineers, one of
                    grenadiers, and one of chasseurs. There are 33 regiments of infantry of two

                    80 strong, one of chasseurs 50, and four of fusileers 44 men each. Attached to
                    this infantry, and distinct from the guard, are two regiments of dragoons of two

                <p>From time immemorial the inhabitants of the British Islands have been
                    distinguished for a determined bravery, united with a degree of physical power,
                    which belongs to the people of no other nation; and hence, as soldiers, they
                    have never yet, when properly commanded, found their match in the field of
                    battle. “L’Angleterre,” says Count Turpin, in his commentaries on Montecuculi’s
                    <hi rend="italic">Mémoires,</hi> “est elle peut-être la nation où la bravoure se
                    soutient depuis le plus long temps.” “Our nation,” observes Dr Johnson, “may
                    boast, beyond any other people in the world, of a kind of epidemic bravery,
                    diffused equally through all its ranks; we can show a peasantry of heroes, and
                    fill our armies with clowns whose courage may vie with that of the general.” The
                    valour of a Briton is innate. It is a national instinct, co-existent with and
                    inseparable from the man himself, and requiring no artificial excitement to
                    bring it into action; and it is as powerful at the present moment as it was in
                    the chivalrous days of Cressy, Poictiers, and Agincourt. Hence, although the
                    fortune of our arms may have varied, the character of the soldier has always
                    remained the same; and at Waterloo as at Blenheim, and Ramifies, and Malplaquet,
                    he established his superiority in all those high military qualities which render
                    a nation invincible. But, from various causes, the reputation of the British
                    army, which the campaigns of Marlborough had raised to the highest pitch, and
                    which the various actions of the Seven Years War had gloriously sustained, began
                    subsequently to decline; while the disastrous results of American revolutionary
                    war created an opinion, which succeeding events appeared to confirm, of its
                    total unfitness for prosecuting a lengthened series of operations, or contending
                    with any prospect of success against the armies of other nations, particularly
                    those of the Continent. It was conceived to be little better than a body of
                    marines, well qualified to co-operate with the navy in partial expeditions, or
                    in making descents on the seacoasts of any country with which Great Britain
                    happened to be at war, but incapable of maintaining itself in the field, or of
                    engaging in regular campaigns; and, to say the truth, there were not wanting
                    plausible reasons which might be alleged in support of such an opinion. For, as
                    if they had been determined, not merely to countenance this impression, but
                    really to render the army as inefficient and as utterly destitute of consistence
                    and energy <pb break="no" facs="nls:193103582" xml:id="kp-eb0703-3582-0617"/>as
                    it was generally believed to be, the British ministry persisted for a series of
                    years in wasting its strength in paltry expeditions, or in effecting partial
                    descents upon this or that country, instead of combining one great effort
                    calculated to influence the general result of the contest. Yet, in 1795, the
                    regular army, including the force under the Duke of York in North Holland,
                    exhibited a total of 119,000 men, besides about 42,000 employed in the colonies,
                    in Corsica, in Gibraltar, and in Portugal; a force which, directed with skill
                    and judgment, might have saved the country from many humiliations, prevented an
                    enormous accumulation of debt, and accelerated the termination of a sanguinary
                    and ruinous contest, from the effects of which the nation is still suffering.
                    The campaign of Egypt, i∏ 1801, showed, it is true, some small degree of energy,
                    and, above all, afforded the army an opportunity of proving its undiminished
                    excellence. But, unfortunately, on the renewal of the war in 1803, the old
                    system was resorted to, and all the prejudices which had previously existed
                    against the army were revived with tenfold force ;— prejudices which outlasted
                    the first successes of the Peninsular campaigns, and which were only at length
                    overcome by an unexampled series of victories, obtained over the ablest generals
                    and the best troops of which France could boast.</p>
                <p>“The French army,” says Colonel Napier, “was undoubtedly very formidable from
                    numbers, discipline, skill, and bravery; but, contrary to the general opinion,
                    the British army was inferior to it in none of these points save the first, and
                    in discipline it was superior, because a national army will always bear a
                    sterner code than a mixed force will suffer. With the latter the military, not
                    the moral crimes, can be punished; men will submit to death for a breach of
                    great regulations which they know by experience to be useful, but the constant
                    restraints of petty though unwholesome rules they will escape from by desertion,
                    or resist by mutiny, when the ties of custom and country are removed; for the
                    disgrace of bad conduct attaches not to them, but to the nation under whose
                    colours they serve. Great, indeed, is that genius that can keep men of different
                    nations firm to their colours, and preserve a rigid discipline at the same time.
                    Napoleon’s military system was, from this cause, inferior to the British, which,
                    if it be purely administered, combines the solidity of the Germans with the
                    rapidity of the French, excluding the mechanical dulness of the one, and the
                    dangerous vivacity of the other; yet, before the campaign in the Peninsula had
                    proved its excellence in every branch of war, the English army was absurdly
                    underrated in foreign countries, and absolutely despised in its own. It was
                    reasonable to suppose that it did not possess that facility of moving in large
                    bodies which long practice had given to the French; but the individual soldier
                    was (and is stilD most falsely stigmatised as deficient in intelligence and
                    activity, the officers ridiculed, and the idea that a British could cope with a
                    French army, even for a single campaign, considered chimerical. The English are
                    a people very subject to receive and to cherish false impressions. Proud of
                    their credulity, as if it were a virtue, the majority will adopt any fallacy,
                    and cling to it with a tenacity proportioned to its grossness. Thus an ignorant
                    contempt for the British soldiery had been long entertained before the ill
                    success of the expeditions in 1794 and 1799 appeared to justify the general
                    prejudice. The true cause of those failures was not traced, and the excellent
                    discipline afterwards introduced and perfected by the Duke of York was despised.
                    England, both at home and abroad, was, in 1808, scorned as a military power,
                    when she possessed, without a frontier to swallow up large armies in expensive
                    fortresses, at least two hundred thousand<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>At the period in question the British army consisted of
                    30,000 cavalry, 6000 foot-guards, 170,000 infantry of the line, and 14,000
                    artillery; in all 220,000 men. Of these between 50,000 and 60,000 were employed
                    in the colonies and in India; but the remainder were disposable, because from
                    80,000 to 100,000 militia, differing from the regular troops in nothing but the
                    name, were sufficient for the home duties. If to this force we add 30,000
                    marines, the military power of Great Britain, at the time referred to, must have
                    exceeded 400,000 men, exclusive of local militia and volunteers.</p></note> of

                    an immense recruiting establishment, and, through the medium of the militia, the
                    power of drawing upon the population without limit. It is true, that of this
                    number many were necessarily employed in the defence of the colonies; but enough
                    remained to compose a disposable force greater than that with which Napoleon won
                    the battle of Austerlitz, and double that with which he conquered Italy. In all
                    the materials of war, the superior ingenuity and skill of the English mechanics
                    were visible; and that intellectual power that distinguishes Great Britain
                    amongst the nations, in science, arts, and literature, was not wanting to her
                    generals in the hour of danger.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    disproved the calumnious prognostications of its contemners and revilers; how
                    gloriously it established, in seven campaigns and more than twenty pitched

                    of a hundred victories, and accounted invincible till called to contend with the
                    men of our soil. Let us now direct our attention to its composition and
                    organization.</p>
                <p>By the constitution of this country the king is the supreme head and
                    captain-general of the army, which can receive no orders except such as emanate
                    from him, and is bound to obey all his orders, unless at variance with the
                    fundamental laws of the land; in which case submission to his authority would be
                    declared rebellion against the constitution of the state, and the nation at
                    large. To him belongs the power of declaring war and concluding peace, of
                    granting subsidies to his allies and indemnities to his enemies: but no treaty
                    is valid or binding unless it be signed by a responsible minister; and without
                    the authority of parliament he cannot touch a sixpence of his subjects’ money
                    for this or any other purpose. Further, it is expressly declared in .the bill of
                    rights, and annually repeated in the preamble to the mutiny-act, which forms the
                    martial law of the British army, “that the raising or keeping a standing army in
                    time of peace, unless it be with the consent of parliament, <hi rend="italic">is
                    against law</hi> in other-words, no military force can be raised or maintained
                    in this country, except with the consent of the three estates composing the
                    legislature, by which, in their collective capacity, the sovereign power of the
                    state is exercised. But in regard to the existing army, all measures and all
                    acts deemed necessary for its regulation, direction, and employment, are decided
                    upon by the king in council; and it is the duty of the commander-in-chief of the
                    forces for the time being to direct the execution of such measures or acts, in
                    all those operations which are executed within the united kingdom, as well as to
                    superintend the organization, instruction, and discipline of the troops
                    belonging to the different branches of the service.</p>

                <p>The secretary at war is, by the terms of his commission or appointment, bound to
                    give effect to the orders of the commander-in-chief, issued with the approbation
                    and consent of the sovereign; excepting in as far as these shall appear to be
                    contrary to the rules of the service, or to make any alteration in the
                    expenditure of the army: in which cases it is his duty to make reference to the
                    lords of the treasury, and to act in strict conformity to their instructions.
                    This minister, in fact, who is not a member of the cabinet, is specially charged
                    with the administration of the war department in all its branches. He is the
                    organ of communication between government and the army on the one hand, and
                    between the army and the government on the other; and he acts as a check upon
                    the commander-in-chief, while he is in his turn restrained by his responsibility
                    to parliament, to the country, and to the laws.</p>
                <p>The departments exclusively military are those of the adjutant-general, the
                    quarter-master general, the barrackmaster-general, the commissary-general, the
                    paymastergeneral, and the board of ordnance.</p>
                <p>The adjutant-general’s department consists of the adjutant-general himself, the
                    deputy-adjutant-general, the assistant-adjutant-general, and the
                    deputy-assistant-adjutant-general, with ten or eleven clerks, three messengers,
                    and a keeper. The adjutant-general belongs to the personal staff of the king,
                    and accompanies his majesty and the commander-in-chief in all their reviews and
                    military inspections. He is named directly by the king, on the recommendation of
                    the commander-in-chief, and has the rank of lieutenant-general, though for the
                    most part only a major-general. The deputy-adjutant-general is also appointed by
                    his majesty; but the secondary offices of the department are filled by persons
                    nominated by the adjutant-general himself. This officer may be considered as the
                    director of the <hi rend="italic">personnel</hi> of the British army. Every
                    thing relating to the effective or non-effective state of the troops; to
                    formation, instruction, and discipline; to the direction and inspection of the
                    clothing and accoutrements of the army; to recruitment, leaves of absence, or
                    bounties to soldiers; to the employment of officers of the staff; and to
                    ordinary or extraordinary and official returns relative to these different
                    matters, whether required by his majesty, by the ministry, by the secretary at
                    war, or by parliament; falls within the province of the department over which
                    the adjutant-general presides. He is the regular channel through which
                    commanders of corps communicate with the commander-in-chief; and all orders,
                    special instructions, and general regulations issued by the commander-in-chief,
                    relative to the organization, discipline, or instruction of the army, are
                    prepared, addressed to the commanders of corps, and published by the
                    adjutant-general, conformably to the direction of the commander-in-chief of the
                    forces, acting in the name and on behalf of his majesty. The troops stationed in
                    Scotland, however, instead of communicating directly with the adjutant-general’s
                    office in London, address themselves to the deputyadjutant-general who resides
                    at Edinburgh; and Ireland has an adjutant-general of its own. It is also the
                    duty of the adjutant-general to prepare, weekly, for the commander-in-chief and
                    the king, returns of the troops stationed in Great Britain and Ireland; and,
                    monthly, for the commander-in-chief, the ministers, and the king, a general
                    statement of all the forces both at home and abroad.<note anchored="true"

                <p>The quarter-master-general holds the same rank, and is appointed in the same
                    manner, as the adjutant-general. His principal duties are to prescribe routes
                    and marches, to regulate the embarkation and disembarkation of troops, to
                    provide quarters for them, to mark out ground proper for encampment, to execute
                    military surveys, and to prepare plans and arrange dispositions for the defence
                    of a territory, whether such defence is to be operated by the troops alone or by
                    means of field-works. Every British army on service has a
                    quarter-master-general, with deputies and assistants, who perform functions
                    altogether analogous to those which are discharged in the department of
                    quarter-mastergeneral of the British forces; and it is admitted on all hands
                    that, during the Peninsular campaigns, this branch of service was, under the
                    very able direction of Sir Georθ ’ e Murray, carried to a high degree of
                    perfection. Whenever the army, established for the time in any position
                    whatever, had to move in advance and in a given direction, all the officers of
                    the quarter-master-general’s staff, charged with the reconnaissances,
                    immediately set out and spread themselves over the ground, each individual
                    taking the direction indicated to him, and pushing his reconnaissance to the
                    extent of a day’s march of the army. About five in the afternoon these officers
                    returned to head-quarters; and by combining their different partial sketches, a
                    general plan was prepared, according to which the quarter-master-general and the
                    commander-in-chief traced the routes to be followed, and the positions to be
                    taken up, by the troops who were to march on the morrow. This was the duty of
                    every day while the army was in motion; and no better evidence can be produced
                    of the ability with which it was performed, than the circumstance that, during
                    the whole of the Peninsular campaigns, the army never once took up a position in
                    which it could be assailed by the enemy, however superior in numbers, with the
                    remotest chance of success. Attached to the office of quarter-master-general of
                    the forces is a board of topography, with a depot of maps, plans, and military
                    memoirs, and a library containing the best military works that have been
                    published in different countries.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>The barrack-master-general’s department is a numerous one, consisting of ninety
                    functionaries in London, and eight in Edinburgh, exclusive of barrack-masters,
                    store-keepers, hospital-store-keepers, barrack-sergeants, and clerks. His
                    principal duty is to provide barracks, permanent as well as temporary, for the
                    reception of the troops; to superintend their construction or repair; and,
                    generally, to take care that the troops are properly accommodated, both as to
                    room and otherwise. Subordinate to him, of course, are all the local
                    barrack-masters, whose duty it is to furnish bedding and other necessaries for
                    the troops in their respective barracks. Ever since 1805, Great Britain has had
                    84 barracks built of stones or bricks, 12 constructed of timber, 75 temporary
                    barracks, and 48 hired for rent, in all 212; which, it is calculated, are
                    sufficient for affording accommodation to 100,000 infantry and 15,000
                    cavalry.</p>
                <p>The commissariat department, when complete, consists of a commissary-general, a
                    deputy-commissary-general, an assistant-commissary-general, and a
                    deputy-assistantcommissary-general, with upwards of two hundred subordinate
                    functionaries. The head of the department is the commissary-general, who resides
                    in London, and directs the whole of this branch of the service, whether at home
                    or abroad. Subordinate to the treasury in as far as regards financial matters,
                    he is at the same time under the control and direction of the war-office in
                    reference to military operations. His duties, which have been greatly increased
                    since the report of the special committee of finance in the year 1797, consist
                    in supplying provisions, forage, and camp as well as barrack equipage, to the
                    troops; <pb break="no" facs="nls:193103608" xml:id="kp-eb0703-3608-0619"/>in
                    providing the materials of the medical department of the service; and,
                    generally, in directing and superintending all those furnishings which usually
                    enter into the army extraordinaries of the year, of which he prepares a monthly
                    account for the treasury, and an annual return to be laid before parliament.
                    Three months after the close of every year, he also lays before the auditors of
                    public accounts a financial statement of the receipts and disbursements of the
                    preceding year; before the comptrollers of the army, a general view of the
                    receipt, deliverance, and consumption of supplies furnished by his department;
                    and before the lords of the treasury, a detailed account of the various items of
                    expenditure, of the pay and half-pay of persons attached to the commissariat, as
                    well as of the expense of field-works and signals. All the furnishings of
                    provisions, forage, &amp;c. made to the troops stationed in Great Britain arc
                    supplied by army contractors; but, for other articles, the commissariat finds it
                    more advantageous to pass a contract at the moment of need, and for the quantity
                    required, than to enter into any permanent engagement beforehand for the supply
                    of particular articles. The accounts of the contractors, after being compared
                    with the regimental receipts, as certified by the commanders of corps, are then
                    transmitted to the war-office to be again compared, by the superintendent of
                    army accounts, with the effective force and distribution of the different corps,
                    as well as with the regimental returns; and the concordance of these different
                    verifications serves in the first instance as a guarantee to the ministry. The
                    commissary-general has neither the custody nor the delivery of any supplies or
                    materials whatever; nor does he keep any account of disbursements made out of
                    Great Britain.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Dupin,

                    Commissary-General.</p></note> Every army in active service has its own
                    commissariat, under the orders of a commissary-general, who is responsible, in
                    the first instance, to the general-in-chief, for the regular supply of the
                    troops under his command. In Portugal and in Spain, the provisioning of the army
                    was effected by all the means to which recourse could be had in countries so
                    poor and exhausted; but the greater part of the necessary supplies was obtained
                    by purchases effected by commissaries stationed at different places or attached
                    to brigades, and paid from funds supplied by the commissary-general of the army,
                    consisting partly in cash, and partly in bills or debentures on the English
                    government. Immense abuses appeared to have prevailed in the commissariat
                    department during the early part of the peninsular campaigns. This is evident
                    from the repeated orders of the day issued by the Duke of Wellington against
                    malversations on the part of subordinates in this department; and not less so
                    from the fact that, notwithstanding all the care and vigilance exercised by his
                    Grace, many of these functionaries managed to realise fortunes.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>La trésorerie (says Μ. Dupin)
                    faisait toutes les avances de fonds à l’armée d’Espagne sur les estimations

                    par lui transmises (comme <hi rend="italic">duplicatum)</hi> au sécrétaire
                    d’état de la guerre et des colonies. Ensuite le commissariat payait moitié en

                    From the ignorance of the Spaniards, however, or rather perhaps from their
                    experience of the faithlessness of their own government, these “obligations” or
                    bills became speedily depreciated to the extent of 26 or 30 per cent., and were
                    purchased from the peasantry and farmers at this discount by the commissaries,
                    who, of course, realized an enormous profit on these transactions. At one period
                    of the Peninsular war the depreciation exceeded 50 per cent.; but the avidity of
                    the commissaries to purchase the debentures increased the confidence of the
                    people in their validity, and thus reduced the depreciation to the amount above
                    stated.</p></note></p>
                <p>The paymaster-general is 'the head of the army payoffice, whence the issues for
                    the payment of every description of military service are made. This office
                    consists of the paymaster-general himself, two deputies, an accountant-general,
                    a cashier, book-keepers, clerks, and other subordinates; and there are several
                    deputy-paymasters abroad subordinate to the general department at home. The
                    paymaster-general has no active control over the expenditure of the public
                    money. His duty is merely to make payments ministerially and without discretion,
                    in pursuance of the warrants directed to him by the secretary at war, the
                    treasury, or both, as the case may be; or in honour of the drafts of the
                    deputy-paymasters abroad, for the ordinary services of the army. The pay-office
                    must therefore be looked upon as an office of account merely, and as affecting
                    the public expenditure only in as far as it performs the duties of an office of
                    accounts with regularity and expedition. The materials and documents, which
                    compose a considerable part of the account of the paymastergeneral, originate
                    with persons over whose conduct he exercises no manner of control. Indeed there
                    is a regular succession in preparing them, from the regimental paymaster to the
                    agent, and from the agent to the secretary at war, who finally delivers them at
                    the pay-office. Different classes of accounts and documents are delivered in at
                    certain periods prescribed by the pay-office act. But large balances of the
                    public money are not now, as formerly, allowed to remain in the hands of the
                    paymaster-general, or at his credit in the bank; nor can he derive any profit
                    from the custody of the public money, the balances being confined within the
                    narrowest possible limits. The establishment of a regiment, with the king’s
                    regulations and warrants, is in fact the instrument which regulates the pay of
                    the army, and is consequently the basis of all the documents which enter or go
                    out of the pay-office under that head of the service.<note anchored="true"

                    exercise any part of his authority, the board in like manner officiates in his
                    stead. The ordnance has a special paymaster or treasurer, who advances the fιmds
                    necessary for the department, on orders or drafts, signed by at least three
                    members of the council. Almost all the officers of the board are at the same

                <p>The sums voted for the support of this department proceed upon estimates of the
                    ordinary and extraordinary service, and of services unprovided for. The ordinary
                    service comprehends the provision for the ordinary establishment, civil and
                    military, for the year ensuing; the extraordinary includes every service known
                    beforehand, of a temporary and contingent nature, during the currency of the
                    year; and the services unprovided for consist of services which have either been
                    actually paid for in the course of the past year, or which are supposed to have
                    been paid, but which were not foreseen when the estimates of the preceding year
                    were prepared. Among these unforeseen expenses are included various exceedings
                    which may have occurred in the individual services voted in the ordnance
                    estimates of the previous year; to which are commonly added such sums as may be
                    considered necessary to make up the deficiency of the sum allotted to the
                    ordnance for the use of the naval service. So much for the military
                    departments.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Dupin, 1.
                    V. c. 1, p. 175.</p></note> Let us now attend to the composition of the army
                    itself.</p>
                <p>The British army consists at present of 8818 cavalry and 95,786 infantry; but of
                    this force 2804 cavalry and 17,312 infantry are employed in the East India
                    Company’s territories; leaving an available force provided for in the estimates
                    of the year 1830 of 6014 cavalry and 78,474 infantry, or 89,284 men of all arms,
                    including officers. This force is divided into cavalry, infantry, artillery,
                    engineers, and some corps immediately connected with the two latter branches of
                    the service, as the royal artificers, the artillery-drivers, and the royal
                    waggon train.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Estimates
                    of Army Services for the year 1830 (Parliamentary paper).</p></note></p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">cavalry</hi> on home service consists of the first and
                    second regiments of life-guards, and the royal regiment of horse-guards (blue),
                    each of 344 rank and file and 274 horses, with nineteen other regiments of
                    dragoon-guards and dragoons; namely, seven of dragoon-guards, three of dragoons,
                    and nine of light-dragoons, including lancers and hussars, amounting to 5897
                    rank and file, with 4892 horses; or, including the regiments of life-guards,
                    6919 rank and file, and 5714 horses. In this enumeration, however, the cavalry
                    serving in India, the waggon-train, and the Cape corps of mounted riflemen, are
                    not included. The first regiment of dragoon-guards consists at present of 407
                    rank and file, and 307 horses; but the remaining regiments of the cavalry of the
                    line have only 305 rank and file and 253 horses each. The officers and
                    non-commissioned officers of a regiment of life-guards, on its present
                    establishment, amount to 89; of a regiment of the cavalry of the line, to
                    between 60 and 70.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Army
                    Estimates for 1830.</p></note> Thus, supposing the latter to consist of 368
                    privates, divided into 8 companies or squadrons, such a regiment would have 1
                    colonel, 2 lieutenant-colonels, 2 majors, 8 captains, 8 lieutenants, 8 cornets,
                    1 paymaster, 1 adjutant, 1 quarter-master, 1 surgeon, I assistant-surgeon, and 1
                    veterinary-surgeon, or 35 officers in all; besides 28 sergeants and 8
                    trumpeters; making a total of 71 officers and non-commissioned officers, and
                    raising the entire strength of the regiment to 439 men. And the same relative
                    proportion obtains, whatever be the footing in point of effective force, on
                    which the regiment is placed.</p>
                <p>Since the peace of 1815, various changes have been made in the arms and
                    equipments of our cavalry. In the first place, armour was given to the
                    life-guards, immediately after they had proved its total inefficiency in the
                    field of battle, and torn the laurels of Waterloo from the redoubted cuirassiers
                    of France. That armour must prove a decided impediment to the efficiency of a
                    dragoon on service, is what no one can for a moment doubt. Its enormous
                    weight,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The largest
                    sized cuirass worn by the life-guards weighs 15 pounds; the smallest 12 pounds 6
                    ounces. A life-guardsman, in marching order, weighs upwards of 25 stone,
                    supposing the man personally to weigh 13 stone! Besides, these cuirasses are as
                    ugly as they are weighty, and give to the really fine men who are compelled to
                    wear them an appearance of being <hi rend="italic">hump-backed</hi>.</p></note>
                    the constant cleaning which it requires, the pain which its inflexibility must
                    occasion under fatigue, and the obstacles it opposes to the free and full action
                    of the muscular powers of the human body, greatly detract from its advantages.
                    These, moreover, have been overrated; and we are much mistaken if it will not
                    one day be shown that the life-guards, encumbered with the cuirasses, are
                    immeasurably less formidable than they were when their natural strength, weight,
                    and activity, had full freedom of action allowed them. In the next place, four
                    of our regiments of light horse have been converted into lancers. We agree in
                    opinion with Montecuculi that the lance “est la reine des armes pour la
                    cavalerie ;” and we also think, with Major Beamish, that lancers should
                    constitute the standard cavalry of England. But we do not the less object to the
                    particular kind of lance introduced into our service, and the description of
                    cavalry to whom it has been assigned. No nation possesses such materials as
                    Britain for the formation of redoubtable lancers; no nation has the command of
                    such means of bringing them to perfection: and if solid squares of infantry are
                    ever to be penetrated by cavalry, it must be performed by cavalry armed with the
                    lance. But this will never be achieved by such a weapon as that at present in
                    use. It must be effected by a lance of sufficient length to overcome the
                    infantry bayonet, which, thus opposed, would no longer be formidable; and this
                    lance must be put into the hands of our heavy cavalry, particularly the
                    household troops, which, thus armed, would be able to contend on equal terms
                    with the best infantry in the world, and would un questionably be capable of
                    penetrating its closest formation.</p>
                <p>The British <hi rend="italic">infantry</hi> on home service is composed of 3
                    regiments of guards, viz. the 1st or grenadier regiment, the Coldstream
                    regiment, and the 3d regiment, amounting together to 5104 rank and file; of 79
                    regiments of the line, consisting of 1 battalion each, 740 strong; of one
                    regiment (the 60th foot) and the rifle brigade, two battalions each; of 2 West
                    India regiments, the royal waggon train, 2 companies of the royal staff corps, 3
                    Newfoundland and 3 royal veteran companies, the African corps, the Ceylon
                    regiment, and the Cape corps of mounted riflemen; making a total of 66,240 men,
                    exclusive of the guards. The regiments of infantry of the line have only one
                    battalion as a constant nucleus. When additional battalions are raised, they are
                    employed separately, and commanded each by a lieutenant-colonel. With regard to
                    the colonelcy of a regiment, it is in a great measure a sinecure. The ordinary
                    staff of a battalion of 800 men, rank and file, consists of 1
                    lieutenant-colonel, 2 majors, 10 captains, 12 lieutenants, 8 ensigns, 1
                    paymaster, 1 adjutant, 1 quarter-master, and 1 surgeon with 2 assistants; in all
                    39 officers. The petty staff is composed of a sergeant-major, a quarter-master
                    sergeant, a paymaster sergeant, an arm sergeant, a schoolmaster sergeant, 10
                    colour sergeants, 30 sergeants, a drum-major, and 21 drummers; in all 106 men.
                    Hence the total strength of such a battalion would consist of 39 officers, 106
                    non-commissioned officers, 40 corporals, and 760 soldiers, or 906 men in
                    all.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Army Estimates for
                    1830.</p></note></p>
                <p>The force at present serving in India consists of 4 regiments of light dragoons,
                    each 701 strong, or 2804 in all; <pb break="no" facs="nls:193103634"

                    or, including supernumeraries and others, 17,312 in all.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">royal artillery</hi> forms only one corps, which is
                    absurdly denominated a regiment, since, in time of war, it is increased to more
                    than 24,000 men. The master-general of the ordnance has the title and powers of
                    colonel of the regiment of artillery; the lieutenant-general of the ordnance is
                    lieutenant-colonel; and a general officer, with the title of
                    deputy-adjutant-general, performs the functions of head of the artillery-staff,
                    but is in no way dependent upon the adjutant-general of the British forces. The
                    board of the deputy-adjutant-general of artillery is at Woolwich, which may be
                    considered the head-quarters of the ordnance. The royal artillery corps consists
                    of the brigade of horse-artillery, and of the artillery serving on foot. The
                    horse-artillery is subdivided into companies tolled troops, varying in number
                    from six to ten. Of these two served in the Peninsula in 1808, five in 1813, and
                    seven at Waterloo in 1815. It is under the orders of 2 colonels commanding, 2
                    colonels <hi rend="italic">en</hi><hi rend="italic">second,</hi> 2
                    lieutenant-colonels, and 1 major; while each company or troop is commanded by a
                    captain of the first rank, a captain of the second, and 3 lieutenants. The foot
                    artillery is divided into battalions of ten companies each, under the orders of
                    2 colonels, first and second, 2 lieutenant-colonels, 1 major, 1 adjutant, 1
                    quarter-master, and a surgeon with 2 assistants in time of war, and 1 during
                    peace. In the year 1792, there were 4 battalions of foot artillery of 820 men
                    each, with one of invalids containing 483; making 3707 in all. In 1814, there
                    were 16,157 artillery-men, forming 11 battalions of 1459 men each. In 1819 there
                    were only 9 battalions of 8 companies and 638 men each, or 5742 in all; which is
                    pretty nearly the actual strength of this arm. The rocket corps is attached to
                    and forms part of the artillery; and the same thing holds of the royal
                    artificers, the royal waggon train, and the artillery drivers.<note

                <p>In the war which preceded the peace of Amiens, and even in the early campaigns in
                    Portugal, the <hi rend="italic">engineer</hi> department was in a very
                    ineffective condition; particularly from the want of the necessary means of
                    transport, and partly also from a deficiency both in the number and quality of
                    military artificers. In order to remedy these inconveniences, the Duke of
                    Wellington, in 1814, caused a brigade of engineers, consisting of a company of
                    sappers and miners, with horses, cars, and drivers, to be attached to each
                    division of the army, and to be regularly trained and exercised in field duties,
                    as well as in those which might be required of them in sieges. A captain and a
                    certain number of subalterns were specially attached to each brigade, and were
                    held responsible for the effective condition both of the men and the horses.
                    Thus the remainder of the engineers, free from any embarrassments relative to
                    the <hi rend="italic">matériel</hi> and <hi rend="italic">personnel of</hi> that
                    department of the service, were enabled to give their undivided attention to
                    important military operations, and to contribute, in a most essential manner,
                    towards the success of the succeeding campaigns. Five companies of sappers and
                    miners also served with the pontoon-train, which consisted of eighty pontoons,
                    besides forges, waggons, &amp;c. drawn by about 800 horses; the whole under the
                    orders of a major of the brigade of engineers. Since the peace great attention
                    has been paid both to the instruction and organization of this important branch
                    of the service; which, in the event of another war, will be found on a very
                    different footing, in point of efficiency, from that on which it stood during
                    the greater part of the Peninsular campaigns. Experience taught important
                    lessons, which have been suitably and effectually improved.</p>
                <p>The portion of the British army presently serving in India amounts, as we have
                    already seen, to about 20,000 men. The European troops in the company’s service
                    consist of 8000 infantry and 4000 artillery; while the native regular troops
                    are, according to the best information, composed of 10,000 cavalry, 130,000
                    infantry, and 8000 artillery; and the native irregular force, of 7000 cavalry
                    and 17,000 infantry. Our Indian army, therefore, may be considered as amounting
                    to 19,000 cavalry, 168,000 infantry, and 12,000 artillery, or, in all, about
                    200,000 men. The organization of the native army being, in all essential
                    respects, the same as that of the British army, no particular description of it
                    seems to be required under this head.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>The character of the British army has been earned in battle and attested by
                    victory. Wherever it has been even tolerably led, it has conquered; nor is there
                    any army in the world which has sustained so few serious reverses. The elements
                    of which it is composed are such as, if fairly developed in action, must, on any
                    thing like equal terms, insure victory; for not only are the soldiers more
                    robust, and possessed of greater physical power (or, as it is technically
                    called, <hi rend="italic">bottom),</hi> than those of any other nation, but they
                    are also distinguished by an unflinching, indomitable courage, which may be
                    safely reckoned upon at all times and in all circumstances; which it is often
                    difficult to restrain, but never necessary to excite; and which always rises to
                    a pitch of sublime elevation at the prospect of the charge and the close combat.
                    They are the only troops in the world who look with indifference on naked
                    points, and who are constantly impelled by a powerful instinct to close with
                    their enemy; who maintain the distant battle with unyielding stedfastness, yet
                    rejoice when the moment arrives that is to rest the issue of the conflict on the
                    bayonet’s point, and a struggle hand to hand with the enemy. Hence their fire is
                    close, steady, and destructive; their charge, where it can be given,
                    irresistible. “Les troupes Anglaises,” says General Jomini, “se distinguent par
                    leur bonne discipline et leur sang-froid; le soldat s’y enrôle pour la vie [this
                    is a mistake; soldiers may enlist for any period], ce qui est bien
                    extraordinaire chez un peuple si jaloux de sa liberté, mais ce qui ne surprend
                    pas moins, c’est qu’il est docile et soumis: ces qualités essentielles qui
                    constituent une armée solide, sont peut-être préférables à one valeur brillante

                <p>“Il faut de dire,” says he, “après les Français, tels qu’ils ont été pendant
                    vinq-quatre ans dans nos armées, les Anglais sont les militaires les plus actifs
                    de tout l’Europe; ils le sont d’une manière qui leur est propre. Leur activité
                    n’a pas les élans prodigieux dont nous avons tant fois offert de mémorables
                    exemples; mais elle n’a jamais d’intermittence, et se montre toujours la même.
                    Cela lui fait produire, au bout d’un temps donné, one somme de résultats plus
                    grande qu’on n’aurait pu le prévoir, d’après la vue d’une action <pb break="no"

                    brillante. Le soldat Bréton a généralement moins d’esprit naturel et de
                    pénétration que le soldat Français; mais l’immobilité de son imagination rend
                    ses actions plus mesurées. Moins distrait par la vue des objets extérieurs, par
                    les souvenirs du passé, par les espérances ou les terreurs de l’avenir, il est
                    toujours tout entier au moment présent. Plus attentif au commandement actuel, il

                <p>In this passage there is some truth, mixed up with much nonsense and
                    misrepresentation. The British soldier, it seems, is inferior to the French
                    soldier in intelligence. And why? Because he does not concern himself about
                    “grand movements executed and to be executed and because he is more attentive to
                    command, and goes to <hi rend="italic">present</hi> death without disturbing
                    himself about <hi rend="italic">death to come.</hi> These appear strange grounds
                    upon which to rest the alleged superiority of the French or the inferiority of
                    the British soldier in point of intelligence. That a native of this country,
                    admitted on all hands to be at least one of the most intellectual on the face of
                    the earth, should be at once metamorphosed by a red coat into a mere automaton
                    or lump of living but impassible matter, would indeed be an extraordinary
                    phenomenon; nor must it appear less singular that the French armies, with all
                    their intellectual superiority, and all their attention to “grand movements,”
                    should have been constantly overthrown by our animated machines. But the plain
                    fact is, that the assertion is wholly erroneous. The English soldier is inferior
                    to no other that ever existed in point of intelligence; and even the late
                    General Foy, whose book appears to have been written chiefly for the purpose of
                    calumniating our army, makes admissions which show that such was his own real
                    opinion, while maintaining a contrary one. This officer repeatedly says that the
                    non-commissioned officers of the British army are superior in activity,
                    intelligence, and zeal to those of the same rank in any other army, not
                    excepting the French; and that this superiority was conspicuously evinced
                    throughout the whole of the Peninsular campaigns. But these persons are taken
                    almost indiscriminately from the ranks, and of course must represent the average
                    amount of intelligence and activity diffused amongst the private soldiers; a
                    circumstance which General Foy had not adverted to when he made the admission in
                    question; for he was too good a Frenchman to allow British soldiers any merit
                    which he could decently and with any show of probability deny them.</p>
                <p>But thebest answer to all his captious and querulous strictures is to be found in
                    his own description of the conduct of the British regiments at Waterloo. “The
                    cavalry which supported them,” says he, “was cut to pieces [this is not true],
                    the fire of their artillery completely silenced. The general and staff officers
                    were galloping from one square to another, not knowing where to find shelter.
                    Carriages, wounded men, parks of reserve, and auxiliary troops, were all flying
                    in disorder towards Brussels. Death was before them, and in their ranks;
                    disgrace in their rear. In this terrible situation, neither the bullets of the
                    imperial guard, discharged almost point-blank, nor the victorious cavalry of
                    France, could make the least impression on the immovable British infantry. One
                    might have been almost tempted to fancy that it had rooted itself in the ground,
                    but for the majestic movement which its battalions commenced some minutes after
                    sunset, at the moment when the approach of the Prussian army apprised Wellington
                    that—thanks to numbers, thanks to the force of inert resistance, and as a reward
                    for having contrived to draw up brave fellows in battle—he had just achieved the
                    most decisive victory of our age.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Foy, <hi rend="italic">History of the Peninsular War,</hi>
                    vol. i. p. 224, English translation.</p></note> The British army can desire no
                    better panegyric than this, pronounced by a beaten enemy; and if the French
                    shall continue to comfort themselves with the idea that the British soldier is
                    deficient in intelligence, because he possesses that strength of mind which no
                    danger can appal, and that tenacity which carries off the prey by sticking to it
                    to the last, it would certainly be a pity to deprive them of any slender
                    consolation which they may derive from cherishing such a delusion. But instead
                    of adding any thing further of our own, we shall conclude by citing an authority
                    which, on this as on all other military subjects, is universally admitted to be
                    of the highest order.</p>
                <p>“That the British infantry soldier,” says Colonel Napier, “is more robust than
                    the soldier of any other nation, can scarcely be doubted by those who, in 1815,
                    observed his powerful frame, distinguished amidst the united armies of Europe;
                    and, notwithstanding his habitual excess in drinking, he sustains fatigue, and
                    wet, and the extremes of cold and heat, with incredible vigour. When completely
                    disciplined, and three years are required to accomplish this, his port is lofty,
                    and his movements free: the whole world cannot produce a nobler specimen of
                    military bearing; nor is the mind unworthy of the outward man. He does not
                    indeed possess that presumptuous vivacity which would lead him to dictate to his
                    commanders, or even to censure real errors, although he may perceive them; but
                    he is observant, and quick to comprehend his orders, full of resources under
                    difficulties, calm and resolute in danger, and more than usually obedient and
                    careful of his officers in moments of imminent peril.</p>
                <p>“It has been asserted that his undeniable firmness in battle is the result of a
                    phlegmatic constitution, uninspired by moral feeling. Never was a more stupid
                    calumny uttered. Napoleon’s troops fought in bright fields, where every helmet
                    caught some beams of glory; but the British soldier conquered under the cold
                    shade of aristocracy: no honours awaited his daring, no despatch gave his name
                    to the applauses of his countrymen; his life of danger was uncheered by hope,
                    his death unnoticed. Did his heart sink therefore? Did he not endure with
                    surprising fortitude the sorest of ills, sustain the most terrible assaults in
                    battle unmoved, and, with incredible energy, overthrow every opponent; at all
                    times proving that, while no physical military qualification was wanting, the
                    fount of honour was also full and fresh within him?</p>
                <p>“The result of a hundred battles, and the united testimony of impartial writers,
                    of different nations, have given the first place amongst the European infantry
                    to the British; but, in a comparison between the troops of France and England,
                    it would be unjust not to admit that the cavalry of the former stands higher in
                    the estimation of the world.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
