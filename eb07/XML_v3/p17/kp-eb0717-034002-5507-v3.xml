                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">PHARISEES</label>, a famous, sect amongst the Jews, who
                    distinguished themselves by their zeal for the traditions of the elders, which
                    they derived from the same fountain with the written word itself; pretending
                    that both were delivered to Moses from Mount Sinai, and were therefore of equal
                    authority. From their rigorous observance of these traditions, they looked upon
                    themselves as more holy than other men; and therefore separated themselves from
                    those whom they thought sinners or profane, so as not to eat or to drink with
                    them. Hence, from the Hebrew word <hi rend="italic">pharic</hi><hi rend="italic
                    subscript"> i</hi> which signifies to separate, they received the name of <hi
                    rend="italic">Pharisees</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Separatists.</hi></p>
                <p>This sect was one <hi rend="italic">of</hi> the most ancient and considerable
                    amongst the Jews; but its origin is not very well known. However, it was in
                    great repute in the time of our Saviour, and must have had its origin at the
                    same time with the traditions; in fact, they grew together, until at length they
                    had so far gained ground that the traditional law swallowed up the written, and
                    those who were the propagators of it included the bulk of the Jewish nation.</p>
                <p>The extraordinary pretences of the Pharisees to righteousness drew after them the
                    common people, who held them in the highest esteem and veneration. Our Saviour,
                    however, frequently charges them with hypocrisy, and with making the law of God
                    of no effect through their traditions.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Matth, ix. 2, XV. 1-6, xxiii. 13-23; and Luke, xi.
                    39-52.</p></note> Several of these traditions are particularly mentioned in the
                    gospel; but they had a vast number more, which may be seen in the Talmud, the
                    grand object of which is to explain and enforce those which this sect required
                    to be believed and observed.</p>
                <p>The Pharisees, contrary to the opinion of the Sadducees, held a resurrection of
                    the dead, and the existence of angels and spirits. But, according to Josephus,
                    this resurrection of theirs was no more than a Pythagorean resurrection, that
                    is, of the soul only, by its transmigration into another body, and being born
                    anew with it; and from this they excluded all who were notoriously wicked, being
                    of opinion that the souls of such persons were consigned to a state of
                    everlasting wo. As to lesser crimes, they held that these were punished in the
                    bodies which the souls of those who committed them were next sent into.</p>
                <p>Josephus, however, either mistook the faith of his countrymen, or, which is
                    equally probable, wilfully misrepresented it, in order to render their opinions
                    more respected by the Roman philosophers, whom he appears on every occasion to
                    have been desirous to please. The Pharisees had many pagan notions respecting
                    the soul; but Bishop Bull, in his <hi rend="italic">Harmonia</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Apostolica,</hi> has clearly proved that they held a resurrection
                    of the body, and supposed a certain bone to remain uncorrupted in order to
                    furnish the matter out of which the resurrection of the body was to be effected.
                    They did not, however, believe that all mankind were to be raised from the dead.
                    A resurrection was the privilege of the children of Abraham alone, who were all
                    to rise on Mount Zion; their incorruptible bones, wherever they might be buried,
                    being carried to that mountain below the surface of the earth. The state of
                    future felicity, in which the Pharisees believed, was in fact exceedingly gross.
                    They * imagined, that men in the next world, as well as in the present, were to
                    eat and drink, and enjoy the pleasures of Jove, each being reunited to his
                    former wife. Hence the Sadducee, who believed in no resurrection, and supposed
                    that our Saviour taught it as a Pharisee, shrewdly urged <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193495520" xml:id="kp-eb0717-5520-0341"/>the difficulty of disposing
                    of the woman who had in this world been the wife of seven husbands. Had the
                    resurrection of Christianity been of the Pharisaical kind, this difficulty would
                    have been insurmountable; and accordingly we find the people, and even some of
                    the Pharisees themselves, struck with the manner in which our Saviour removed
                    it.</p>
                <p>This sect appears to have had some confused notions, derived probably from the
                    Chaldaeans and Persians, respecting the pre-existence of souls; and hence it was
                    that Christ’s disciples asked him, concerning the blind man, “Who did sin, this
                    man or his parents, that he was born blind ?” And when the disciples told
                    Christ, that some said he was Elias, Jeremias, or one of the prophets, the
                    meaning of this can only be, that they thought he had come into the world with
                    the soul of Elias, Jeremias, or some other of the old prophets, transmigrated
                    into him. Like the Essenes, the Pharisees held absolute predestination, and like
                    the Sadducees, free-will; but how they reconciled these incompatible doctrines
                    is nowhere sufficiently explained. The sect of the Pharisees was not
                    extinguished by the ruin of the Jewish commonwealth. The greater part of the
                    modern Jews are still of this sect, and as much devoted to traditions or the
                    oral law as their ancestors ever were.</p>
