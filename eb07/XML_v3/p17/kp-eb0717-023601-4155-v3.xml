                <p><label type="entry">PERNAMBUCO</label>, a large and important province of Brazil,
                    in South America. It is separated on the south from the provinces of Seregipe
                    and Bahia by the river St Francisco, and from Minas Geraes by the river
                    Carinhenha; on the west it touches on Goyaz; and Paraiba, Seara, and Piauhy
                    bound it on the north. This province is reckoned one of the most flourishing and
                    important in Brazil, and contains more ports than any other, Recife, the
                    capital, being only inferior to Rio and San Salvador in commercial enterprise
                    and industry. Pernambuco extends about six hundred miles in length, but its
                    breadth is much less, being only about fifty miles in the middle, though it
                    widens to about two hundred towards each extremity. Its surface is very unequal,
                    being in some parts mountainous, dry, and barren. In the interior, behind the
                    capital, are immense plains, stretching to a great distance in all directions,
                    although traversed in part by the great middle chain of mountains called the
                    Serra of Borborema, which is described as the most majestic in Brazil. It
                    commences near the sea, in the province of Rio Grande do Norte, and traverses
                    that of Paraiba from north-east to south-west; it then bends to the west,
                    separating that province from Pernambuco and Seara; and, lastly, inclines to the
                    northward, dividing Pernambuco from Piauhy, its name changing as frequently as
                    its altitude varies. In some parts it is rocky and barren, but the greater
                    portion of it is covered with beautiful forests. The whole of this maritime
                    district or canton was included, up to 1810, in the jurisdiction of the ouvidor
                    of Jacobina; but it now goes by the name of the ouvidoria of the sertam of
                    Pernambuco. The most important river of this state, or of any other in Brazil,
                    belonging wholly to the country, is the St Francisco, the largest stream which
                    flows into the Atlantic between the Amazons and the Plata. It rises in the serra
                    of Canastra, in the province of Minas Geraes, in latitude 20° south. After
                    traversing that province from south to north, it bends to the north-east on
                    touching Pernambuco, and flowing along the borders of that state, keeps the same
                    general bearing till within two hundred miles of the sea, when it bends to the
                    south-west, entering the Atlantic in south latitude ll <hi rend="superscript">
                    0</hi> nearly, after a course of more than one thousand miles. It receives
                    several large streams during the first part of its course, the principal being
                    the Carinhenha, which joins it on the borders of the comarca of Paracatu; the
                    Rio das Velhas, and the Rio Verde, which enter from the right; and the Paracatu,
                    Correntes, and Rio Grande, which flow into it from the left. But no stream of
                    any importance joins the St Francisco after the confluence of the Rio Grande;
                    and so few streams of any description flow from the arid regions of Bahia and
                    Pernambuco,, that it may be doubted whether it does not lose more water by
                    evaporation than is supplied by all the paltry affluents which join it during
                    the latter part of its course. After the confluence of the Rio Grande, it bends
                    first to the east, then to the east-southeast, to the aldeia of Vargem Redonda,
                    where the navigation from above terminates. Below Villa Nova the river begins to
                    separate into two large portions, forming a great number of low wooded islands,
                    which are covered by the inundations. This great river, so deep in the interior
                    during the middle part of its course, at length discharges itself by two shallow
                    mouths. The principal one, which is the most northerly, although nearly two
                    miles in width, has not depth enough to allow of the entrance of sumacas, except
                    at high water. In fact, it is navigated by larger boats in the upper than in the
                    lower part of its course.</p>
                <p>The climate of Pernambuco is hot and moist in the interior, but more agreeable in
                    the maritime district. Generally speaking, the soil is in many parts rich and
                    fertile, producing cotton, sugar, cocoa, maize, mandioc, and a variety of
                    fruits, medicinal herbs, and vegetables. In the interior, the vast plains
                    already mentioned are covered with luxuriant grass, upon which vast herds of
                    cattlö are fed; but these will be described afterwards. The province is divided
                    into two parts by the river Pajehu, a tributary of the St Francisco, namely, the
                    eastern and western districts or cantons. The eastern canton or ouvidoria is
                    subdivided into three comarcas, the northern, central, and southern, the
                    respective head towns of which are Olinda, Recife, and Alagoas. The western,
                    however, has latterly been regarded as a separate province; but if so, it is a
                    very small and unimportant one. The ouvidoria, as containing the capital,
                    demands our first attention. Recife, or, as it is commonly called, Pernambuco,
                    is not to be confounded with Olinda, although some geographers have considered
                    them as forming but one city. It stands upon a flat, and is divided into three
                    parts, a peninsula, an island, and the continent. Recife, or Pernambuco properly
                    so called, is built upon a peninsula, which extends to the southward of Olinda.
                    This is the most mercantile part of the threefold city. St Antonio stands upon
                    an island or sand-bank formed by the arms of the Capibaribe, being connected
                    with Recife by a large bridge almost entirely constructed of stone. The third
                    division of the city is situated on the main land, to the southward of the other
                    two, and is joined to them by a wooden bridge, considered as the largest in
                    Brazil. This portion of Pernambuco is called Boa Vista, where the richer
                    inhabitants reside. The appearance of the country, when Pernambuco is approached
                    by sea, is described as charming. The hills are clothed with wood, gradually
                    rising towards the interior, but none of them is of any considerable height. A
                    singular reef of rocks runs parallel with the coast, and forms the harbour of
                    Pernambuco, vessels being moored between it and the town, safe from every storm.
                    This remarkable reef at the top is scarcely sixteen feet in breadth. To a great
                    depth on the outside it slopes off more rapidly than the Plymouth breakwater,
                    but it is perpendicular within, thus forming a magnificent natural bulwark or
                    breakwater, within which the ocean is as still as a mill-pond. The reef extends
                    beyond the northern boundary of the province to Maranham on the south. In some
                    parts it sinks under water, and there are numberless breaks, by which a
                    communication with the sea is laid open. In breadth it varies from a few fathoms
                    to three quarters of a mile; but everywhere the water is of sufficient depth to
                    admit the vessels mooring close to the rock. There is a bar at the entrance of
                    the harbour, over which, in ordinary tides, there are sixteen feet of water, so
                    that ships of considerable burden may lie there. The entrance into the harbour
                    is very narrow, and close by a fort built on the reef. The hill of Olinda,
                    studded with houses and convents, rises on the right hand, and an island thickly
                    planted with cocoa-nut trees adds considerably to the scene on the left. The
                    principal street of Boa Vista, the last portion of Pernambuco which remains to
                    be described, is broad and handsome, although the ground on which it stands used
                    formerly to be overflowed at high water. A long embankment connects the
                    sand-bank and town of St Antonio with the mainland at Affogados, to the south
                    and west of Boa Vista. The river Capibaribe, so famous in Pernambucan history,
                    discharges its waters into the channel between St Antonio and Boa Vista,
                    afterrunning for some distance in a course nearly from east to west. The city of
                    Pernambuco, which, Mr Southey remarks, “has not inaptly been called the Tripoli
                    of the New World,” has continued to be a place of the first consequence from the
                    period of the Dutch conquest; and no other place has derived so great and
                    unequivocal advantages from the growth of the cotton trade. Recife was built by
                    the Dutch</p>
                <p>• under Maurice of Nassau, and by them called Maurice Town or Mauritius. It is
                    situated in latitude 8.14. south, and longitude 35.15. west, containing a
                    population of above 60,000 souls. Of these, in 1821 not above a third were <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193494168" xml:id="kp-eb0717-4168-0237"/> whites, and they
                    must now be greatly diminished. The rest consisted of mulattoes and negroes. The
                    former are, generally speaking, more active, more industrious, and much more
                    lively, than the others. Pernambuco long constituted, and still does, we
                    suspect, one of the principal slavemarkets in the country; and the callousness
                    and cruelty with which this inhuman traffic has always been carried on, have
                    powerfully contributed to debase the minds and corrupt the morals of the
                    inhabitants. Although within a few degrees of the equator, the climate of
                    Pernambuco is remarkably salubrious, and rendered almost temperate by the
                    refreshing sea-breezes. The comarca of Recife contains only three small towns,
                    besides the capital, and these are too unimportant to require any particular
                    description.</p>
                <p>Olinda is situated upon a rocky hill, which, although not very high, is
                    nevertheless the highest in the neighbourhood. Its appearance from the sea is
                    beautiful and prepossessing; but this presage of elegance and grandeur is not
                    realized on a narrow inspection. It is now in a state of great decay, having
                    been deserted for the lower town of Recife. The elevations on which it stands
                    are embosomed in dark woods, which seem coeval with the land itself; and being
                    rent and broken in various directions, they present the most abrupt and
                    picturesque scenery. The population of Olinda may amount to about seven
                    thousand. When it was burned by the Dutch in 1631, it is said to have contained
                    2500 houses, and about 25,000 inhabitants. It was founded by Duarte Coelho
                    Pereira about the year 1535, but it has continued to decline as Recife has
                    advanced in prosperity. In the comarca of Olinda there are, besides the capital,
                    four other towns, amongst which Goiana and Iguarassu are reckoned considerable
                    places. The latter, distant from Recife seven leagues to the northward, and two
                    from the sea, is one of the most ancient towns of the province. It contains but
                    a scanty population. Goiana, distant about fifteen leagues from Recife, and four
                    from the sea, is a much larger and more flourishing place than the other. It is
                    situated on the banks of a river of the same name, which here bends so
                    considerably as almost to surround the town. Besides sugar, a great quantity of
                    cotton is exported, and there is a large cattle-fair held every Thursday. The
                    planters have the advantage of water-carriage to Recife, as the river for many
                    leagues both to the north and south is one of the largest, and is influenced by
                    the tide even above Goiana. This town, with the surrounding district, is
                    supposed to contain upwards of 20,000 inhabitants. There are several other towns
                    or villages which carry on a considerable trade, and being chiefly situated upon
                    the river Capibaribe, they enjoy ample facilities for communication with the
                    capital.</p>
                <p>One of the most important places in Pernambuco is the Island of Itamarca, one of
                    the oldest settlements in Brazil, and formerly ♯, distinct captaincy. It is
                    situated eight leagues to the northward of Recife, at a short distance from the
                    mainland. The Dutch took it in 1633, built a fort on it, and of such importance
                    did it appear to them, that for some time they contemplated removing the seat of
                    government to the island; a plan which was overruled, although Itamarca appears
                    to possess decided advantages as compared with the capital. In the year 1645
                    Joam Fernandes Vieira, the principal hero of the Pernambucan war, attacked the
                    island, but did not succeed in obtaining possession of it. Subsequent attempts
                    were made, with only partial success, and the Dutch did not surrender the fort
                    until their expulsion in 1654. Itamarca is three leagues in length by about two
                    leagues in breadth; it contains a considerable quantity of excellent land, and,
                    with the exception of the immediate vicinity of Recife, is the most populous
                    part of the province of Pernambuco. As the island produces excellent cane, there
                    are here several sugar-works; and vines were formerly cultivated with great
                    success. The shores are planted with cocoa-trees, amongst which are thickly
                    scattered the cottages of fishermen. One chief source of the wealth to Itamarca
                    is the salt-works, formed upon the sands which are overflowed by the tide at
                    high water. Conception is the oldest town on the island; but the long village of
                    Pillar, situated on its eastern side, is the principal settlement. The ants, the
                    pest of Pernambuco, and indeed of all Brazil, are so numerous here, that whole
                    plantations of mandioc and maize are sometimes destroyed by them. At the
                    northern entrance to the channel of Itamarca is the port of Catuama, the second
                    in importance in the province. Next to it, in the opinion of the inhabitants, is
                    that of Tamandare, ten leagues south-west of Cape St Augustin; but Mr Henderson
                    thinks this port the best of the whole. It is in the form of a bay, with a depth
                    of water sufficient for large vessels, capacious enough to receive a fleet, and
                    securely defended by a strong fort. Cape St Augustin is the only promontory on
                    this part of the coast, and the most eastern land of South America. It has two
                    forts, each of which defends a small port, and stands in latitude 8. 26. south.
                    The comarca or province of Alagos is of comparatively little consideration. The
                    capital, however, which bears the same name, is a place of considerable
                    commerce, and has a population of 14,000 souls. The other towns belonging to
                    Alagos are Maceyo, Porto de Pe-dras, and Penedo. The latter, the port of the
                    great river St Francisco, is situated about seven leagues from its mouth. It is
                    a flourishing place, and, with the district, contains about 12,000 inhabitants.
                    The river, which is here a mile in breadth, rises only three feet in spring
                    tides; but the town is exposed to injury when the freshes come down.</p>
                <p>The western part of the province, or the sertam, is much more extensive than the
                    maritime district; but it is very thinly inhabited, owing to the natural
                    sterility of the soil, and the want of rain, which only falls during thunder
                    showers. It contains several towns, the largest of which, called Barra do Rio
                    Grande, is situated at the confluence of the Rio Grande with the St Francisco.
                    One hundred miles below this town is that of Pilao Arcado, the second place in
                    importance in the sertam. The population of the district has been stated at 5000
                    souls. Maize, mandioc, and melons are cultivated on the margins of the river,
                    but all the country beyond its immediate vicinity is wild and sterile. There are
                    a great many salt lakes at various distances from the river, and on the margins
                    of these, salt collects, and forms a considerable article of trade. The great,
                    indeed the only business of importance carried on in the sertam is the rearing
                    of cattle, great herds of which range over the immense plains situated on either
                    side of the mountain-chain already mentioned. The Sertanejos, as the inhabitants
                    are called, occupy fazendas or cattle farms of such vast extent, that few know
                    their bounds, although they attempt to calculate them by the hundreds of cattle
                    pastured upon them. Their leagues, as in all other thinly-inhabited tracts, are
                    of deceptive length, sometimes four miles. Their dress consists of jacket, hat,
                    and long pantaloons or leggins, all of brown untanned leather, a tanned
                    goat-skin over the bicast, and a pair of coarse cotton drawers or trousers. When
                    on horseback and on a journey, which is often the case, the Sertanejo takes his
                    hammock and portions of his wardrobe along with him, and also carries his
                    farinha, dried meat, and other necessaries. The usual colour of a Sertanejo is
                    dark brown; and the complexion even of those who are born white soon becomes as
                    completely tanned as the dress which they wear. The dress of the women is homely
                    enough, and they are kept in a state of considerable restriction, seldom
                    appearing abroad, or, if they do so, they are never allowed to take any part in
                    conversation. There are no wild cattle in these sertarns; but kine are
                    exceedingly plentiful. The religion of the Sertanejos is confined to the
                    observance of certain forms and <pb break="no" facs="nls:193494181"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0717-4181-0238"/>ceremonies, and to the frequent repetition of a
                    few prayers; but they have great faith in charms, relics, and other things of
                    the same kind. The traffic of the sertam is conducted by pedlars, who give them,
                    in exchange for their live stock, hides, and cheese, various trinkets, articles
                    of luxury, and English cottons, which are now superseding the coarse fabrics of
                    the country. The population of the whole province amounted in the year 1830 to
                    602,000 souls.</p>
                <p>The following is a statement of the quantities of the principal articles of
                    merchandise exported from Pernambuco during the year ending January 1836:
                    Cotton, 52,142 bags; sugar, 17,520 cases, 2846 half cases, 56,996 barrels, and
                    9180 bags; hides, 91,492; coffee, 300 bags; rum, fifty-eight puncheons; Brazil
                    wood, 1200 quintals; and mandioc 1217 bags; the estimated value of the whole
                    being nearly one million sterling. The number of vessels which entered during
                    the same period was 247, and their total tonnage 47,696. Of these, 179 cleared
                    with cargoes, the rest in ballast. The trade of Pernambuco with Great Britain is
                    more extensive than that with any other country. The goods chiefly sent thither
                    are cotton manufactures, hosiery, lace, and small wares, with earthenware,
                    leather wrought and unwrought, hardwares and cutlery, iron and steel, beaver and
                    felt hats, brass and copper manufactures, apparel, slops and haberdashery, beer,
                    ale, butter and cheese, glass, arms, and ammunition. It appears by the
                    parliamentary papers, from which this statement of the exports is taken, that
                    the trade of Pernambuco is on the increase. <hi rend="smallcaps">(r. r.
