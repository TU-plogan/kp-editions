                <p><label type="entry">PINUS</label>, the <hi rend="smallcaps">Pine-tree,</hi> was
                    one well known to the ancients, and has been described and celebrated both by
                    their philosophers and their poets. Pliny enumerates no less than six species of
                    trees of this genus; and it is mentioned by Virgil in his Eclogues, his
                    Georgics, and his Aeneid; by Horace in his Odes, by Ovid in his Metamorphoses,
                    by Statius, and by Catullus.</p>
                <p>There are generally reckoned fourteen species of this genus, of which the most
                    remarkable are the following :—</p>
                <p>1. The <hi rend="italic">pinea, pineaster,</hi> or wild pine, which grows
                    naturally on the mountains in Italy and the south of France. It grows to the
                    size of a large tree; the branches extend to a considerable distance; and whilst
                    the trees are young, they are fully garnished with leaves, especially where they
                    are not so close as to exclude the air from those within; but as they advance in
                    age, the branches appear naked, and <pb break="no" facs="nls:193500798"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0717-0798-0747"/>all those which are situated below become
                    unsightly in a few years; for which reason they are now much less esteemed than
                    formerly.</p>
                <p>2. The <hi rend="italic">pinus pinea,</hi> or stone pine, is a tall evergreen
                    tree, a native of Italy and Spain. It delights in a sandy loam, although, like
                    most others, it will grow well in almost any land. Respecting the uses of this
                    species, Hanbury tells us that the kernels are eatable, and by many preferred to
                    almonds.</p>
                <p>• 3. The <hi rend="italic">rubra,</hi> commonly called the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Scotch fir</hi> or <hi rend="italic">pine,</hi> is common throughout Scotland,
                    whence its name; though it is also found in most of the other countries of
                    Europe. Μ. Duhamel mentions his having received some seeds of it from St Domingo
                    in the West Indies; and thence concludes, that it grows indifferently in the
                    temperate, frigid, and torrid zones. The wood of this tree is the red or yellow
                    deal, which is the most durable of any of the kinds yet known</p>
                <p>4. The <hi rend="italic">pinus picea,</hi> or yew-leaved fir, is a tall
                    evergreen, and a native of Scotland, Sweden, and Germany. This species includes
                    the silver fir and the balm of Gilead fir. The first of these is a noble upright
                    tree. The balm of*Gilead fir has of all the sorts been most coveted, on account
                    of the great fragrance of its leaves; though this’ is not its only good
                    property; for it is a very beautiful tree, naturally of an upright growth, and
                    the branches are so ornamented with their baΓmy leaves, as to exceed any of the
                    other sorts in beauty. The silver fir is very hardy, and will grow in any soil
                    or situation; but it always makes the greatest progress in rich loamy earth. The
                    balm of Gilead fir must be planted in deep, rich, good earth; nor will it live
                    long in any other. The soil may be a black mould, or of a sandy nature, if it be
                    deep enough, and if the roots have room enough to strike freely.</p>
                <p>5. The <hi rend="italic">pinus abies,</hi> or European spruce fir, a native of
                    the northern parts of Europe and of Asia, includes the Norway spruce and
                    long-coned Cornish fir. The former of these is a tree of as much beauty whilst
                    growing, as its timber is valuable when propagated on that account.</p>
                <p>6. The <hi rend="italic">pinus</hi><hi rend="italic">Canadensis,</hi> or American
                    and Newfoundland spruce fir, a native of Canada, Pennsylvania, and other parts
                    of North America, includes three varieties; the white Newfoundland spruce, the
                    red Newfoundland spruce, and the black Newfoundland spruce. These, however,
                    dif-er so little, that one description may serve for them all. They are of an
                    upright growth, though they do not shoot so freely or grow so fast with us as
                    the Norway spruce. The leaves are of the same green, and garnish the branches in
                    the same beautiful manner, as those of that species; only they are narrower,
                    shorter, and stand closer. The greatest difference is observable in the cones;
                    for these are no more than about an inch in length, and the scales are closely
                    placed. In the cones, indeed, consists the difference of these three sorts;
                    those of the white species are of a very light brown colour, those of the red
                    species more of a nut-brown or reddish colour, and those of the black species of
                    a dark or blackish colour.</p>
                <p>7. The <hi rend="italic">pinus</hi><hi rend="italic">balsamea,</hi> or hemlock
                    fir, a native of Virginia and Canada, possesses as little beauty as any of the
                    fir tribe; though, being rather scarce in proportion, it is deemed valuable. It
                    is called by some the <hi rend="italic">yew-leaved fir,</hi> from the
                    resemblance of the leaves to those of the yew-tree. It is a tree of low growth,
                    with but few branches; and these are long and slender, spreading abroad without
                    order.</p>
                <p>8. The <hi rend="italic">pinus orientalis,</hi> or oriental fir, a native of the
                    East, is a low but elegant tree. The leaves are very short, and nearly square.
                    The fruit is exceedingly small, and hangs downward; and the whole tree makes an
                    agreeable variety with the other kinds.</p>
                <p>9. The <hi rend="italic">strobus,</hi> or North American white pine. This grows
                    sometimes to the height of a hundred feet and up wards, and is highly valued on
                    account of its beauty. The bark of the tree is very smooth and delicate,
                    especially when young; the leaves are long and slender, five growing out of one
                    sheath; and the branches are pretty closely garnished with them, thus making a
                    fine appearance.</p>
                <p>10. The <hi rend="italic">pinus</hi><hi rend="italic">taeda,</hi> or swamp-pine,
                    is a tall evergreen tree, being a native of the swamps of Virginia and Canada.
                    1here are several varieties of this genus.</p>
                <p>11. The <hi rend="italic">pinus cedrus,</hi> ranked by Tournefort and others
                    under <hi rend="italic">lαrix,</hi> and famous for its duration, is that
                    popularly called by us the <hi rend="italic">cedar of Lebanon,</hi> by the
                    ancients <hi rend="italic">cedrus magna</hi> or the <hi rend="italic">great
                    cedar</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> also <hi rend="italic">cedrelate,
                    κεδfKaτη</hi>; and sometimes the Phoenician or Syrian cedar, from the country
                    where it grows in its greatest perfection. It is a coniferous evergreen, of the
                    larger sort, bearing roundish cones of smooth scales, standing erect, the leaves
                    being small, narrow, and thickly set. They sometimes counterfeit cedar by dyeing
                    wood of a reddish hue; but the smell discovers the cheat, that of true cedar
                    being very aromatic. In some places the wood of the cajou tree passes under the
                    name of cedar, on account of its reddish colour and its aromatic smell, which
                    somewhat resemble those of sandal. Cedar-wood is reputed almost immortal and
                    incorruptible; a prerogative which it owes chiefly to its bitter taste, which
                    the worms cannot endure. For this reason it was that the ancients used cedar
                    tablets to write upon, especially for things of importance, as appears from the
                    expression of Persius, <hi rend="italic">Et</hi><hi rend="italic">cedra</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">digna locutus.</hi> A juice alluded to by Horace was also drawn
                    from cedar, with which the ancients smeared their books and writings, or other
                    matters, to preserve them from rotting; and by means of which it was that Numa’s
                    books, written on papyrus, were preserved entire to the year 535, as we are
                    informed by Pliny.</p>
                <p>Solomon’s temple, as well as his palace, were both constructed with this wood.
                    That prince gave Hiram, king of Tyre, several cities for the cedars he had
                    furnished on these occasions. Cortes is said to have erected a palace at Mexico
                    in which were 7000 beams of cedar, most of them 120 feet in length and twelve
                    feet in circumference, as we are informed by Herrera. Some tell us of a cedar
                    felled in Cyprus 130 feet in length and eighteen in diameter. It was used for
                    the mainmast in the galley of King Demetrius. Le Bruyn assures us, that the two
                    largest he saw upon Mount Lebanon measured, one of them fifty-seven palms, and
                    the other forty-seven, in circumference. In the temple of Apollo at Utica there
                    were cedar-trees near two thousand years old; which yet were nothing to the beam
                    in an oratory of Diana at Saguntum in Spain, said to have been brought thither
                    two hundred years before the destruction of Troy. Cedar is of so dry a nature
                    that it will not endure to be fastened with iron nails, from which it usually
                    shrinks; so that they commonly fasten it with pins of the same wood.</p>
                <p>It is remarkable that, as far as has yet been discovered, this tree is not to be
                    found as a native in any other part of the world than Mount Libanus. What we
                    find mentioned in Scripture of the lofty cedars can be nowise applicable to the
                    common growth of this tree; since, from the experience we have of those now
                    growing in England, as also from the testimony of several travellers who have
                    visited the few trees remaining on Mount Libanus, they are not inclined to grow
                    very lofty, but, on the contrary, extend their branches very far; a circumstance
                    with which the allusion made by the Psaloust agrees very well, when, describing
                    the flourishing state of the people, he says, “They shall spread their branches
                    like the cedar-tree.”</p>
                <p>12. There is another species, namely, the <hi rend="italic">larch-tree,</hi>
                    which the old botanists ranked under <hi rend="italic">larix,</hi> with
                    deciduous leaves and oval obtuse cones. It grows naturally upon the Alps and
                    Apennines, and of late has been very much propagated in Britain. See <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Plantation.</hi></p>
