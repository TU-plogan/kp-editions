                    structure of our planet, of the arrangement of the solid and liquid materials of
                    which its surface consists, of the nature of the elastic invisible fluids with
                    which it is surrounded, and an account of the distribution of the organized
                    beings by which it is inhabited. A detailed description of a field so vast, of a
                    range of subjects so multifarious, would embrace every branch of natural
                    history; but the province of physical geography is understood to be limited to
                    general views of the different subjects now indicated. These views, if founded
                    on legitimate deductions from observed phenomena, should enable us to reduce to
                    a few general principles the infinite variety of appearances presented to us by
                    nature; and it is this generalization which in modern times has elevated the
                    study to the dignity of a science. Physical geography, however, in this
                    philosophical sense, is of very recent origin; much of every domain of
                    terrestrial nature yet remains to be explored; the surface of our earth is still
                    but partially known; and although each succeeding age adds prodigiously to the
                    knowledge of mankind, this exhaustless field will, for ages to come, afford
                    materials to exercise the industry and reward the investigations of the
                    philosophical inquirer, ere physical geography approaches to its limits of
                    perfection.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> I.— <hi rend="italic">Position of the Earth in
                    the System of the Universe; its Form, Magnitude, Density.</hi></p><p>The sublime conceptions of astronomy, founded on observation and on mathematical
                    inductions, have taught us to consider the innumerable stars visible to the
                    naked eye and indicated by the telescope, as so many suns, probably enlightening
                    and gladdening unseen worlds, which revolve round each, as our earth and its
                    kindred planets revolve round our glorious luminary. The stars nearest to our
                    earth are grouped into constellations, for the convenience of descriptive
                    astronomy; but the more distant appear to the eye as nebulous patches or streaks
                    of diluted light, which the highest powers of optical instruments have barely
                    enabled us to resolve partially into clusters of stars, which analogy would lead
                    us to regard as myriads of other suns; while imagination, ranging through
                    illimitable space, pictures still more remote orbs, whose light has for ages
                    travelled the profound, without as yet reaching the abodes of men. Such lofty
                    conceptions of infinite power and beneficence are calculated to elevate the mind
                    which entertains them, and to afford a compensation to human vanity for the
                    comparative insignificance of our earth in the scale of creation. The solar
                    system, of which our planet forms only a small part, seems to be itself but a
                    fragment of a more extended system, round the centre of which the observations
                    of Maskelyne and Herschel have rendered it probable that the sun and the fixed
                    stars all revolve.</p><p>The terraqueous globe, without including comets, is one of twenty-nine bodies
                    wheeling round our sun. Of these, eleven are termed <hi rend="italic">primary
                    planets,</hi> and revolve round the sun as a common centre; the remaining
                    eighteen are named moons, satellites, or secondary planets, because they also
                    revolve round some one of the primaries. The earth is accompanied in her orbit
                    by one of these satellites. The orbits of two other planets are included within
                    her path round the sun. The orbit of the earth is elliptical, but differs so
                    little from a circle, that, in estimating its diameter, it may be considered as
                    such; and its semidiameter, or the earth’s distance from the sun, as determined
                    from various astronomical data, especially from the transits of Venus over the
                    sun’s disc, equals ninety-five millions of miles.</p><p>That the earth is globular, is proved by ships steering in a general direction,
                    either westward or eastward, arriving again at the point of departure; and very
                    satisfactorily by the phenomena exhibited by vessels in receding from an island
                    in the ocean. At a short distance the hull of the ship is sunk below the
                    horizon; a little farther and the <hi rend="italic">courses</hi> or lower sails
                    are lost; and soon only the upper sails are descried on the circular horizon.
                    The rotundity of the earth is such, that when the eye is elevated six feet above
                    the water, an object on its surface may be seen at a distance of three miles;
                    and at all other altitudes of the eye, the distance of the utmost visible point
                    varies as the square root of the altitude.</p><p>The earth, however, is not a perfect sphere, but is somewhat flattened at the
                    poles, or forms what is termed an <hi rend="italic">οblate spheroid.</hi> Newton
                    attempted to ascertain the ellipticity of the earth by calculation; and,
                    considering the effect of its diurnal velocity on a homogeneous fluid of the
                    mean density of the earth, he determined its equatorial to be to its polar axis
                    as 236 to 230; but he imagined, that if the density were greater at the centre
                    than at the surface, the compression would be <hi rend="italic">greater</hi>
                    than in a spheroid of equal density. This error was pointed out by Huygens, who,
                    on the supposition that the density increases regularly with the depth in the
                    earth, estimated the relative axes as 578 to 579. But the determination of both
                    philosophers is at variance with the results of geodesical experiments made
                    about that time, and with the more refined measurements of meridional degrees in
                    different parts of the earth in later times, as well as with the results of
                    observations with the pendulum made by Maskelyne on the mountains of Perthshire,
                    and the very recent investigations on the same subject by Forster, Sa» bine,
                    Duperrey, Freycinet, Kater, Brisbane, and others.</p><p>On comparing the two methods of determining the figure of the earth, we are
                    inclined to place more confidence in the result of measurements of meridional
                    arcs than on the pendulum experiments, because the latter are liable to be
                    disturbed by the geological structure of the regions in which they are made; and
                    this is probably the cause why they accord less with each other than we should
                    have expected from the delicacy of the apparatus, and the expertness of the
                    observers. They give a greater ellipticity to the earth than the comparison of
                    meridional arcs. The latter are not only more accordant with each other, but
                    agree very nearly with the form deduced from the inequalities in the moon’s
                    motions, the equations for which were discovered by Laplace. The result of the
                    whole is, that we may safely assume the ellipticity as equal to y½çth of the
                    earth’s axis; or the polar is to the equatorial diameter as 305 to 306.</p><p>The solution of this problem is essential to the determination of the exact
                    length of the radius of the earth; a most important problem in astronomy, as it
                    is the <hi rend="italic">unit</hi> by which we measure the planetary distances.
                    But the determination of meridional arcs affords the solution of the point in
                    question; and, aided by calculations, we obtain the following results in English
                    miles:</p><p>Equatorial radius = 3963∙7</p><p>Polar radius = 3949∙8</p><p>Ellipticity = 13∙9</p><p>Mean radius = 3956∙75</p><p>Mean diameter = 7913∙5</p><p>Mean circumference = 24871∙</p><p>The oblate figure of the earth appears to be a consequence of its rotation on its
                    axis. Mathematicians have demonstrated, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193497574" xml:id="kp-eb0717-7574-0499"/>that if the
                    earth had been a homogeneous body, its ellipticity would have been greater than
                    it really is; and if it had been so constituted that its density increased so as
                    to be infinitely great at the centre, the ellipticity must have been much less.
                    But the ellipticity is intermediate between these extremes, and perhaps
                    coincides with that of a spheroid of equilibrium. The effect of centrifugal
                    motion has evidently affected not only the liquid, but the solid materials of
                    the globe; and this has been adduced by Playfair as a striking proof of the
                    former fluidity of the solid materials of the earth.</p><p>The revolution of the earth on its axis is performed in a natural day, or, more
                    strictly speaking, once in 23 <hi rend="superscript"> h</hi> 56' 4"; and as its
                    mean circumference is = 24871 miles, it follows that any point in its equatorial
                    surface has a rotatory motion of more than 1000 miles per hour. This velocity
                    must gradually diminish to nothing at either pole. Whilst the earth is thus
                    revolving on its axis, it has a progressive motion in its orbit. If we take the
                    length of the earth’s orbit at 600,000,000, its motion through space must exceed
                    68,490 miles in the hour.</p><p>Besides these two motions, the refinements of modern astronomy have determined
                    two secular movements of extreme slowness, produced by the attractions of the
                    other heavenly bodies of our system, namely, the motions which cause the <hi rend="italic">precession of the equinoxes,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">nutation of the earth’s axis.</hi> These motions, though important astronomical
                    speculations, are little connected with geography; but it is otherwise with the
                    diurnal and annual movements of our planet, the former of which produces the
                    grateful vicissitudes of day and night, the latter the changes of the seasons.
                    Both exercise remarkable influences upon the organized beings inhabiting the
                    earth; and their consequences, therefore, deserve notice in a treatise of
                    physical geography.</p><p>Various astronomical phenomena indicate that the density of the earth increases
                    towards the centre. Cavendish endeavoured to estimate the mean density of the
                    earth from the force of gravitation; and, from experiments with spheres of lead,
                    he estimated it at 5 ’ 48. The investigations with the pendulum by Maskelyne and
                    more recent observers have given it as equal to 4∙71; and perhaps we shall not
                    greatly err, if in round numbers we consider the mean density of the earth as
                    equal to five times that of water. But the average density of the rocky masses
                    which compose the crust of the earth does not exceed 2∙5, or 2∙8 at the utmost;
                    and therefore the density of the interior parts must be considerably greater
                    than that of the materials on the surface. Laplace considers it as probable that
                    the density increases progressively with the depth, and that the globe may be
                    composed of concentric beds symmetrically arranged round the centre of gravity.
                    From these determinations, some philosophers have conjectured that the interior
                    of the earth must consist of matter as ponderous as the metals, and that
                    probably the metallic veins which we find near the surface may only be small
                    portions of the central masses, expanded and projected through the concentric
                    stony materials by the internal heat of the earth. If, however, we admit that
                    the density of all matter is in the direct ratio of the pressure which it
                    sustains, it has been shown, by a philosopher not less remarkable for the
                    originality and boldness of his theoretical speculations, than for the
                    profundity and sagacity of his philosophical investigations, that the interior
                    of the earth cannot be a solid mass of any material with which we are
                    acquainted, but “that our planet must have a very widely cavernous structure,
                    and that we tread on <hi rend="italic">a</hi> crust or shell whose thickness

                    the Land and Water.</hi></p><p>On glancing at a map of the world, we are immediately struck with the great
                    extent of its superficies occupied by the waters, which are united into one
                    great <hi rend="italic">ocean,</hi> filling up the depressions which separate
                    the more elevated portions of the solid crust of the globe, and dividing the
                    land into detached masses of very various extent, which we denominate <hi rend="italic">continents, islands,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">insulated
                    rocks.</hi> These divisions, however, differ only in size; the continent is but
                    a larger island; and the insulated rock is merely the summit of a mountain, the
                    flanks and base of which are buried below the general level of the sea.</p><p>We are in the habit of speaking of the four quarters of the world, and sometimes
                    of its four continents; but it is sufficiently obvious that there are only two
                    great distinct divisions or principal masses of the dry land to which the name
                    of continent should be applied; the eastern, including Europe, Asia, and Africa,
                    which, from being the earliest abodes of civilization, may be termed the <hi rend="italic">Old Continent;</hi> and the western, or American, which is usually
                    known as the <hi rend="italic">New Continent.</hi> By confining the designation
                    of continent to these prime divisions of the land, we shall find no difficulty
                    in classing Australia with islands. The old continent includes three of the
                    great divisions of the earth, Europe, Asia, and Africa; the western continent,
                    though chiefly occupied by the descendants of Europeans, is naturally divided
                    into two great portions, which in future ages may become as distinctly marked by
                    political and moral differences as they are by geographical peculiarities.</p><p>The vast extent of Australia has induced some geographers to consider it as a
                    continent; but it may more justly be reckoned the first of islands in magnitude;
                    and it might be grouped with the numerous and extensive islands lying to the
                    south-east of the old continent, as a fifth great division of the globe, under
                    the title of the <hi rend="italic">Oceanic</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Polynesian.</hi></p><p>The terms employed in describing the various forms of the land, and the
                    subdivisions of the liquid surface of our planet, have been sufficiently noticed
                    under the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Geography,</hi> to which the reader is
                    referred.</p><p>The slightest glance at a map of the world will show, that there exists a greater
                    accumulation of dry land in the northern than in the southern hemisphere. Recent
                    voyages have indeed proved that this disproportion was over-rated by the
                    geographers of the last age. The late discoveries of the extensive tracts of
                    land to which the names of New Shetland, New Orkney, and Sandwich Land have been
                    given, prove that considerable deductions must be made from what was at one time
                    considered as the domain of the Antarctic Ocean. But the voyages of Cook,
                    Furneaux, Weddell, and others, have shown that these, although extensive groups
                    of islands, do not belong to a great antarctic continent; and even if such
                    existed, the general form of the ancient, as well as of the western continent,
                    towards the north, would still leave a great preponderance of dry land in the
                    northern hemisphere. It is not unworthy of notice, that the proximate sides of
                    the old and new continent seem as if they had mutually influenced the forms of
                    each other; for where any remarkable projection of the one is perceived, we find
                    an indentation nearly opposite in the other. Thus, the principal eastern
                    projection of South America is almost opposite to the vast African <hi rend="italic">bight,</hi> extending from Cape Palmas to Cape Negro; the great
                    western projection of Africa is opposed to the basin of the Carribbean Sea and
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:193497587" xml:id="kp-eb0717-7587-0500"/>the Gulf of Mexico and the north-eastern trending of the coasts of Europe is
                    balanced by the opposite direction of the shores of North America.</p><p>The general disposition of the land is different in each. In the old continent
                    the principal extension is to the west and east; in the new it is to the north
                    and south. In the former we may draw continuous straight lines of immense extent
                    in different directions without encountering one sea. Thus a line from Cape de
                    Verd in Western Africa will pass through continuous land till it reaches the
                    promontory which separates the Yellow Sea from the Gulf of Leatong, a distance
                    of 7800 geographical miles. One projected from Cape Palmas, on the Gulf of
                    Guinea, to the Asiatic promontory called Tschcoutskoi-nos, will extend 8700; and
                    another, from Tangier to the Cape of Good Hope, will be nearly 5800 geographical
                    miles. The longest straight line which we can project on the land of the new
                    continent is from Cumana to Tierra del Fuego, a distance of 4600 geographical
                    miles; and the next, from Icy Cape to Puerto de los Angelos, on the western
                    coast of Mexico is about 4100. In the old continent the lines we have described
                    have large portions of the surface on either hand; but in the new continent the
                    greater part of the land is on the eastern side of the imaginary lines.</p><p>The greatest extension of each considerable division of the two continents lies
                    in the direction of its principal mountain chains. This is strikingly
                    exemplified in America, where the Rocky Mountains and Western Cordillera of
                    Mexicoin the northern, and the gigantic Andes in the southern hemisphere, pursue
                    the general direction of the American continent. The greatest extent of Europe
                    is from west to east, and this is the general direction of the chains of the
                    Pyrenees, the Alps, the mountains which form the northern boundary of Turkey in
                    Europe, and the Carpathians. A similar direction is pursued by Mount Taurus, and
                    other ranges of Central Asia, &lt;he Himalaya chain, and the mountains of
                    Thibet. In Africa the position of the mountain chains is less known; but the
                    direction of the rivers, and the notices of travellers, would lead to the
                    inference, that, on its eastern side, a spine of mountains, more or less
                    interrupted, extends from Abyssinia towards the southern extremity of Africa.
                    Even the direction of smaller portions of both worlds, as of islands and
                    peninsulas, coincides with their principal mountain chains. This is well
                    illustrated in Norway, in Italy, in the so-called peninsula of India, in Siam,
                    Cambodia, Florida, and California, and on a smaller scale in the islands of
                    Ceylon, Madagascar, Cuba, and Great Britain.</p><p>The expanse of the waters is termed the <hi rend="italic">Ocean</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> but, for the convenience of descriptive geography, it is
                    divided into several, though, strictly speaking, there is but one ocean; and the
                    different seas form but parts of a vast whole, which communicate freely with
                    each other, and can scarcely be considered as marked by definite limits. Most
                    geographers speak of two grand oceans, which have derived their appellations
                    from their position relative to the old continent.</p><p>I. <hi rend="italic">The Western Ocean,</hi> which includes three principal
                    subdivisions. 1. The <hi rend="italic">Northern Ocean,</hi> of which the
                    southern limits are the British coasts, and a line drawn thence to the southern
                    extremity of Greenland. 2. The <hi rend="italic">Atlantic Ocean,</hi> which
                    should be limited to the south by the extreme projections of Guinea and Brazil.
                    3. The <hi rend="italic">Ethiopic</hi><hi rend="italic">Ocean,</hi> which lies
                    between the limits of the last, and a line joining the southern extremities of
                    Africa and America. All three are sometimes, though less correctly, denominated
                    the <hi rend="italic">Atlantic.</hi></p><p>II. <hi rend="italic">The Eastern Ocean,</hi> which is also subdivided into three
                    principal portions. 1. <hi rend="italic">Th-e Indian Ocean,</hi> comprehending
                    the seas between Southern Africa, Australia, and the Malayan Islands. 2. The <hi rend="italic">Pacific Ocean,</hi> extending from Behring’s Straits to Cape Horn,
                    and the southern side of Australia. It is often subdivided into the Northern and
                    Southern Pacific, of which the limits are not well defined. 3. <hi rend="italic">The Austral</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Southern Ocean,</hi> which in general
                    terms may be described as extending southwards from a line passing round the
                    globe and touching Van Diemen’s Land, and the Cape of Good Hope, and Cape Horn.
                    With these main oceans various seas communicate, either by narrow straits, as
                    the Persian Gulf, the Red Sea, the Mediterranean, and the Baltic; or by wider
                    channels, as the Sea of Okhotsk, the Yellow Sea, the Sea of Hudson, and of
                    Baffin; or by numerous openings, as the Sea of China, the Carribbean Sea, and
                    the Mexican Gulf. The Euxine, the Caspian, the Sea of Aral, and of Baikal, and
                    the magnificent fresh-water lakes of North America, have many of the
                    characteristics of lakes; but their gigantic scale, and their important
                    influence on the climate of the adjacent countries, entitle them to the
                    designation of Inland Seas.</p><p>The portions of the earth’s surface which are covered by 1 the waters bear a
                    large proportion to the dry land. Dr Hal- ] ley first suggested the idea of
                    ascertaining the comparative, surface of the land and water, by cutting them out
                    of a map, and weighing them separately. It was by this means that he ascertained
                    the relative area of the English counties. The astronomy of Dr Long, published
                    in 1742, contains the application of this principle for ascertaining the
                    relative surface of the land and water on the earth. He describes his having cut
                    out each from the gores of Senex’s sixteen-inch globes, and on carefully
                    weighing them he obtained the ratio of the water to the land as 349 to 124, or
                    very nearly as 3 to 1. Dr Long’s experiment appears to have been conducted with
                    great nicety; for Professor Rigaud of Cambridge has very lately confirmed it by
                    a laborious and careful repetition upon the great scale. This latter gentleman
                    used the gores printed for Addison’s three-feet globes, which contain a
                    superficies of 4071½ square inches. The gores of this magnificent globe are
                    twenty-four in number. The torrid zone was divided at these lines and at the
                    equator, and thus formed into forty-eight divisions; the divisions of the two
                    temperate zones were also forty-eight, and these together made ninety-six
                    divisions, each of which was carefully examined separately, divided into land
                    and water, and accurately weighed in a balance which easily indicated one tenth
                    of a grain.</p><p>The southern frigid zone was considered as wholly consisting of water; but the
                    northern frigid zone, from longitude 180° to 270° west, was taken as land, and,
                    from 270° to 360°, was computed to consist, one half of land and one half of
                    water. The whole surface of the earth was supposed to be divided into 1000

                    but little from his former experiment on Carey’s twenty-one-inch globe; but both
                    differ considerably from the calculations of Malte-Brun. As, however, that
                    author has not furnished us with the elements of his calculation, it ought not
                    to be put in competition with the elaborate investigations of Long and of
                    Rigaud.</p><p>The dry superficies of each great division of the globe was ascertained by the
                    same method; and the tables of Rigaud enable us to give an accurate comparative
                    view of their relative area in thousandths of the earth’s surface.</p><p>Europe = 15∙6989</p><p>Asia = 88-7320</p><p>Africa = 59∙5764</p><p>America = 91∙2573</p><p>New Holland = 9∙9063</p><p>Smaller islands = 0∙7524</p><p>265∙9233</p><p>If we take the whole superficies of the globe=196,836,658 square miles, as the

                    whole land occupies a surface of 52,363,231 square miles, and the ocean an area
                    of 144,473,427 square miles.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> III.— <hi rend="italic">Variations of the
                    Surface.</hi></p><p>Besides the inequality produced by the oblate figure of the earth, different
                    portions of its surface are at different distances from its centre. The dry land
                    is elevated into mountains, depressed into valleys, or stretched out into
                    plains, varying in extent and elevation above the sea; and the ocean itself must
                    be considered as effused into a vast basin, seemingly diversified, like the dry
                    land, with mountains, precipices, valleys, and plateaux of an infinite variety
                    of shapes and dimensions. In fact, the whole dry land may be considered as a
                    series of islands, or of plains and mountains, elevated above the general
                    surface of the ambient fluid which occupies the deeper valleys that divide
                    them.</p><p>The whole surface of the dry land is elevated more or less above the general
                    level of the ocean; with one remarkable exception, which, however, has only of
                    late years been detected. Barometrical measurements have shown that a vast area
                    of Central Asia, no less than 18,000 square leagues, is considerably below the
                    level of the ocean. This tract includes the Caspian and the Aral, the surfaces
                    of which have recently been shown to be 101∙2 feet lower than that of the
                    Euxine. Should any convulsion of nature, such as earthquakes are known to
                    produce in other quarters of the earth, depress the low sandy tract which now
                    separates the sea of Azof and the Caspian, the waters of the Euxine, and also of
                    the Mediterranean and the Atlantic, would inundate an enormous extent of the
                    sandy <hi rend="italic">steppes</hi> of Asia, and entirely change the climate
                    and face of that portion of the earth.</p><p>Plains of greater or less extent, with inconsiderable inequalities, are found in
                    every region. The most considerable plain in Europe is that which, commencing on
                    the Northern Ocean, between the extremity of Jutland and the mouths of the
                    Scheldt, extends eastwards through Prussia and Poland into Russia, and
                    constitutes in that empire an almost unbroken plain, from the confines of the
                    Frozen Ocean to the shores of the Euxine and the Caspian, until it meets the
                    Uralian chain, which separates Northern Europe from Northern Asia. In this vast
                    expanse, the surface is scarcely broken by any hills, except the inconsiderable
                    ridge of Valdai, between Toropetz, Smolensk, and Moscow, which nowhere rises to
                    1200 feet above the sea. This magnificent plateau is divided by the Uralian
                    Mountains from a still more extensive plain, which may be denominated the great
                    plain of Northern Asia, the boundaries of which are the Altaian chain and the
                    Icy Ocean. It commences at the eastern side of the Ural, and inclines towards
                    the northeast until it almost touches the Northern Pacific Ocean. Both plains
                    together form a remarkable feature in the surface of our earth, and being only
                    interrupted by the Ural chain, which never exceeds 4500 feet in height, have
                    been regarded by some geographers as but <hi rend="italic">one plateau</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> which, thus considered, is the most extensive on our
                    planet, with a medium breadth of 1100 miles, a length of 6000, and a surface of
                    about 6,600,000 square miles. The surface of much of these two great plains is
                    fertile; some of it is covered with heaths or swamps, producing dwarf birches, .
                    willows, and a stunted vegetation; a considerable part is shrouded in dark pine
                    forests.</p><p>Far different in appearance are the enormous wastes of arid sand in Northern
                    Africa and Central Asia, the vast <hi rend="italic">savannas</hi> of the
                    Mississippi and the Missouri, and the <hi rend="italic">pampas</hi> and <hi rend="italic">llanos</hi> of South America.</p><p>A prodigious zone of sand stretches like an ocean, in Northern Africa, between
                    the ridges of Mount Atlas and the parallels of the Senegal and the Niger, and
                    from the Atlantic to the narrow valley of the Nile. It may be said to cover a
                    tract across that continent between the eighteenth and thirty-first degrees of
                    north latitude, extending from long. 15° W. to 30° E. This enormous area may be
                    considered as having a length of 2470 miles, a breadth of 900 miles, and
                    consequently a superficies of about 2,200,000 square miles. It is, however, by
                    no means an uniform surface of loose sand. In many parts the dreary waste is
                    broken by low hills of naked sandstone, or by tracts of arid clay; occasionally
                    it is enlivened in a few spots by verdant isles, or <hi rend="italic">oases,</hi> of various extent, according as water finds its way to the parched
                    surface. The principalities of Fczzan and Darfûr are the most considerable of
                    these islands of the desert; but the most celebrated of these insulated spots is
                    the far less considerable oasis of Siwah, the palms of which still wave over the
                    ruins of the Temple of Ammon, and indicate the most ancient seat of African
                    civilization.</p><p>Egypt, Nubia, and Sennaar, the eastern boundaries of this desert, would long ago
                    have been overwhelmed by the moving sands of the western desert, but for the
                    annual inundation of the majestic Nile; and thus the empire of sand would have
                    stretched uninterruptedly into Arabia. As it is, the narrow valley of that
                    river, and the Red Sea, are all that separate the African deserts from those of
                    Asia. Soon after quitting the Nile, the traveller by the route of Suez
                    encounters sand, which is continued into the centre of Arabia, where it forms
                    the Desert of Nedsjed, extending to the valley of the Euphrates. The sandy zone
                    then inclines northwards, enters Persia, and forms the saline deserts of Adjemi,
                    Kerman, and Mekran; it is turned north-east by the valley of the Indus, passes
                    through Caubul and Little Bukharia, till it joins the vast deserts of Cobi and
                    Shamo, which occupy so large a portion of Central Asia between the Altaian and
                    Mustag chains, and reach to the confines of China. The sandy zone thus traced
                    throughout the breadth of the ancient continent, from Western Africa to the 120°
                    of cast longitude, has been computed to cover an area of 6,500,000 square miles;
                    but the Asiatic portion of this tract includes many chains of mountains and
                    fertile valleys. It is characterized by the occurrence of arid wastes of sand or
                    clay, sometimes with saline incrustations on the surface, and is remarkably
                    deficient in considerable rivers; except the Nile, the Euphrates, the Indus, and
                    the Oxus, there are no large rivers in a region which embraces almost a fourth
                    part of both Africa and Asia. This portion of Central Asia forms a series of
                    elevated plains six thousand miles in length from west to east. “Some of these
                    plains,” says Humboldt, “are covered with herbage; others produce only evergreen
                    saliferous plants, with fleshy and jointed stems; but a great <pb break="no" facs="nls:193497613" xml:id="kp-eb0717-7613-0502"/>number glitter
                    from afar with a saline efflorescence, that crystallizes in the semblance of
                    lichens, and covers the clayey soil with scattered patches like new-fallen
                    snow.”</p><p>From these elevated plains have issued the barbarous hordes which at different
                    periods have swept like a whirlwind over the regions where the human intellect
                    had achieved its proudest triumphs, and devastated the seats of Asiatic and
                    European civilization. From this <hi rend="italic">officina</hi><hi rend="italic">gentium</hi> have successively issued the Huns, the Avars, the
                    Mongols, the Alans, and Uzes—the scourges of humanity; and possibly also the
                    tribes by whom the American continent was originally peopled.</p><p>The great valley of the Mississippi is a magnificent plain, covered with primeval
                    forests, or spreading in vast savannahs; but a great portion of it is liable to
                    periodical inundations from the river. At 100 miles from the sea its annual
                    inundation has a breadth of from 80 to 100 miles; and even at the mouth of the
                    Ohio, which is 1000 miles from the sea, the inundating waters have the breadth
                    of thirty miles. This shows the extreme flatness of the soil. The river has been
                    extensively embanked, to rescue a portion of the rich soil from these
                    inundations; but, during the season of the inundations, the greatest part of
                    this extensive plain is still abandoned to the alligator and other reptiles, and
                    to enormous herds of wild animals during the rest of the year.</p><p>The banks of the Lower Missouri, for 2500 miles, present a succession of fertile
                    plains beyond the reach of inundations. This district, which may be considered
                    as a continuation of the great valley of the Mississippi, exhibits an agreeable
                    intermixture of natural prairies and forests, abounding in wild animals, which
                    retreat before the rapidly-advancing tide of human colonization.</p><p>These immense plains are probably destined to become the abodes of a dense
                    population, and perhaps the seat of a mighty empire, subject to few of the
                    natural vicissitudes that impede the march of improvement, if we except the
                    contingent risk of some mighty convulsion, by which the waters of the extensive
                    fresh-water seas of Canada may be permitted to overwhelm this extensive realm
                    with a far more formidable catastrophe than the deluge of Deucalion. Lake
                    Superior has a depth of about 600 feet, and its surface is more than 300 feet
                    above the level of the plains of the Mississippi. Should earthquakes disrupt the
                    intervening barrier, the waters of that and the other great inland seas would
                    sweep these plains with a devastation quite unparalleled in the history of our
                    planet since the deluge of Noah.</p><p>The interior of South America presents plains not less extensive, the
                    peculiarities of which have been sketched with a masterly hand by Humboldt. The
                    first may be termed the valley or plain of the Orinoco. It is bounded on the
                    north by the maritime ridge of Caraccas, on the south by the forests of Guiana,
                    and extends westward to the mountain chain of New Granada, the summits of which
                    are lost in perennial snow. It is a solitude of more than 20,000 square
                    leagues.</p><p>The second is divided from the first by the mountain-arm which the Andes sends
                    eastward to separate the waters of the Orinoco from those of the Marañon, an
                    interrupted branch, stretching from the towering ridges of Popayan, to the
                    humbler granitic Sierra de Tumucuraque, on the confines of Guiana. The southern
                    boundary of this second plateau consists of the chains of Santa Cruz de la
                    Sierra, of Chiquito, and Cuyaba, which separate it from the plains of the
                    Paraguay, the Parana, and La Plata. The western boundary is the cordillera of
                    the Andes. This territory includes the <hi rend="italic">llanos,</hi> extended
                    solitudes, with a scanty soil, destitute of trees, but covered with a luxuriant
                    herbage, the consequence of the periodical inundations, which convert this
                    portion of South America into inland seas; amidst the turbid waters of which, as
                    has been forcibly described by Humboldt, may be seen herds of wild cattle and of
                    horses, swimming from one gradually-diminishing island to another, in search of
                    food, or escaping from the attacks of the jaguar, to become the prey of the
                    alligator, or perhaps to be stunned by the strokes of the electric gymnotus. In
                    the immense tract of country included in this second division, are some detached
                    groups of mountains, indicated on the magnificent map of Olmedilla; but they are
                    generally of inconsiderable elevation, and the face of the country may be
                    considered as one enormous plain, or succession of contiguous plains, little
                    elevated above the general level.</p><p>The third system of great South American plains forms the basins of the Paraguay
                    and La Plata. This region includes the vast <hi rend="italic">pampas</hi> of
                    Buenos Ayres, extending from the foot of the eastern ridge of the Andes to the
                    “sea-like Plata,” and stretching southward into the cheerless deserts of
                    Patagonia, presenting to the eye interminable plains, with a surface often as
                    unvaried as the ocean, inhabited by vast herds of wild cattle and droves of
                    horses; while the tall form of the <hi rend="italic">Rhea Americana,</hi> a
                    species of ostrich, frequently gives local peculiarity to the picture.</p><p>Besides the extensive plains already described, which are either not much
                    elevated above the sea, or rise by imperceptible degrees, there are other
                    plains, with steep acclivities on every side, which have thence been termed <hi rend="italic">tablelands.</hi> Some of these are very extended, and retain a
                    general level of several thousand feet above the sea. Sometimes they are
                    bordered with chains of mountains, much less elevated on the side towards the
                    table-land than in the opposite direction; sometimes they have surfaces much
                    undulated or broken. There are few table-lands in Europe of sufficient
                    importance to be here noticed. The most considerable is that of Central Spain,
                    embracing the two Castilles, which has a general elevation of nearly 2000 feet
                    above the level of the sea. The barometer at Madrid has a mean height of about
                    twenty-seven English inches, which, supposing the instrument on the shores to
                    have a mean of thirty inches, would give to the capital of Spain an elevation of
                    about 1900 English feet. The thermometer in winter often descends below the
                    freezing point; and the <hi rend="italic">chaemerops</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">agave,</hi> which flourish luxuriantly in the plains around the
                    table-land, are unknown at that elevation, though under the fortieth parallel of
                    north latitude. The descent from this table-land on all sides is steep; and the
                    transition from the arid and almost trceless plains of Castille, into the milder
                    climate at the foot of the mountain ridges which support it, is marked by the
                    vegetable productions of a warmer latitude.</p><p>Our imperfect knowledge of Central Asia prevents any accurate notion of the
                    extent and form of these remote regions; but there can be little doubt, that in
                    this quarter there is the most extensive table-land on the face of our globe.
                    The severity of the climate, the direction of the rivers flowing from it on
                    every side, and the scanty information derived from Asiatic caravans, all
                    indicate that there is a prodigious central elevation, supported on the north by
                    the chain of the Altai, on the west by that of Belug Tag, on the south by the
                    mountains of Thibet, and on the east by the chain of Sialki, which divides the
                    country of the Mandshurs from their Tatar brethren of Mongolia. This enormous
                    tract, however, can scarcely be described as consisting of one table-land; for
                    it is intersected by the lofty mountain ranges of Alakì and Mus Tag, which are
                    capped with perennial snows, and it contains the vast, trceless, sandy deserts
                    of Cobi and Shamoo.</p><p>The central plateau of Asia, from the severity of its climate, is inferred by
                    Humboldt to have an elevation of not less than 9000 or 10,000 feet above the
                    sea; and this region, including Thibet and the desert of Shamoo, is believed to
                    have a superficies of 1,500,000 square miles.</p><pb break="no" facs="nls:193497626" xml:id="kp-eb0717-7626-0503"/><p>According to the observations of Olivier, Persia should likewise be considered as
                    a table-land of great elevation. Southern India affords an excellent instance of
                    a table-land, which includes the whole kingdom of Mysore. It stretches from the
                    banks of the Kistna on the north, and is supported by the steep acclivities of
                    the Western, and of the less abrupt Eastern Ghauts. The general elevation of
                    this region is about 3000 feet; but at its southern extremity it abuts against a
                    smaller though much loftier table-land, the district of the Neilgherry Hills,
                    which, till lately, was almost unknown to Europeans. A good account of it has
                    recently been published at Calcutta, by Dr Robert Baikie, from which we learn
                    that the district occupies an area of 600 or 700 square miles, between the
                    eleventh and twelfth degrees of north latitude, and the seventy-sixth and
                    seventy-seventh degrees of east longitude. The general level of its
                    finely-undulated surface is between six and seven thousand feet above the sea.
                    It is connected with the Mysore country by a neck of land about fifteen miles in
                    width; but its northern flank towers above that kingdom by 3500 feet, and it is
                    separated from the subjacent plains of Malabar and Coimbetore by an almost
                    precipitous boundary 7000 feet in perpendicular altitude. The surface is
                    fertile, the climate mild and salubrious; and there the invalid, suffering from
                    the baneful influence of a residence in the sultry plains of India, finds a
                    European climate. The barometer varies from 22∙840 to 23∙220; whilst the
                    thermometer throughout the year ranges from 73° ∙51 to 42°, and has a mean of
                    52° ∙50. The quantity of rain is = 42∙251 inches; heavy rain falls on nineteen
                    days, showers on eighty days, and the clear days arc 179 in the year.</p><p>The great similarity of this Indian table-land, in elevation, in salubrity, and
                    in climate, to the more extensive table-land of Mexicoin North America, is
                    remarkable.</p><p>The Mexican plateau (No. 1) has also a general elevation of 7000 feet above the
                    sea; it rises as abruptly as the Neilgherry district, especially from Vera Cruz,
                    and in a single day the European may escape from the pestilential atmosphere of
                    the plains, to an elevation at which the <hi rend="italic">black vomit</hi> is
                    unknown. The sea-coasts of Mexicoare hot and unhealthy at certain seasons, and
                    are known to the natives by the name of <hi rend="italic">Tierras
                    Calientes,</hi> or burning regions, producing the vegetable riches of the torrid
                    zone. A single day, from Vera Cruz, suffices to reach the height of 4000 feet,
                    where there reigns, a perpetual spring; and this region, termed <hi rend="italic">Tierras Templadas,</hi> though often enveloped in clouds and fogs,
                    is healthy. On ascending to the height of 7000 feet, the traveller gains the <hi rend="italic">Tierras Frias</hi> of the Mexicans, or great table-land, which has
                    generally a mean temperature of 63° Fahrenheit. It produces the cerealia of
                    Europe, and the vine and the olive flourish on its plains. But its surface is
                    varied by hills; and along its margins, stupendous peaks, such as Orizaba,
                    Popocateptl, and the Sierra Nevada of Mexico have their summits far above the
                    limits of perpetua! snow. There are other plains in Mexicowhich are more than
                    1000 feet above the general level of the great plateau. Such is the plain of
                    Toluca, where the climate is severe, and the mean temperature so low that the
                    olive there refuses to ripen its fruit.</p><p>Several less extensive table-lands are included between the two lofty parallel
                    chains which constitute the Southern Andes. Thus the plains of Quito and
                    Riobamba are true table-lands; the general level of the first being 8000 feet
                    above the sea, and the city of Riobamba having an elevation of 10,800 feet, so
                    that it is probably the most elevated city in the world.</p><p>Mountain chains and ranges of hills are separated by valleys, which have obtained
                    the names of <hi rend="italic">ravines, dells, (kfiles, or passes,</hi> when
                    narrow and difficult of access. These chiefly occur among lofty mountains, and
                    sometimes present mural precipices of wonderful sublimity. Narrow valleys often
                    present a striking coincidence in the position of the salient and receding
                    angles of their opposite sides. This has been well described, as observed in the
                    Pyrenees, by Ramond; and some geologists have considered it as a proof that such
                    valleys had been formed by the sudden disruption of continuous strata.</p><p>In describing valleys, geologists likewise distinguish them into different kinds,
                    according to their respective relation to the mountain ranges on which they
                    occur. <hi rend="italic">Principal valleys</hi> are such as run parallel to and
                    separate great chains of mountains. Those which have a direction at a
                    considerable angle with the principal chain, separating the branches or arms of
                    the mountain chain, are termed <hi rend="italic">lateral valleys</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and the smaller ones, running into these lateral arms, are
                    denominated <hi rend="italic">subordinate valleys.</hi> The lateral open into
                    the principal, and the subordinate into the lateral valleys.</p><p>Sometimes we find a valley, consisting of a chain or succession of basin-shaped
                    cavities, at different levels, separated from each other by narrow gorges. Such
                    appearances are not uncommon among all mountains; and several examples occur in
                    our Highland glens, as in Glen Roy, Glen Gluoy, and Glen Spean, where the
                    fancied parallel roads mark the successive heights at which the waters formerly
                    stood, until the rocky barriers which pent them up were opened.</p><p>Sometimes a valley has a circular form, or is <hi rend="italic">basin-shaped,</hi> and on all hands surrounded with mountains, excepting at a
                    narrow gorge, where the waters of the valley make their escape. Two of the most
                    remarkable instances of this are found in Bohemia and in Cashmere. The former
                    consists of a single circular valley, nearly 200 miles in diameter, which
                    appears at one time to have been a vast lake, until the formation of the defile
                    in the Erzgebirge, through which the Elbe escapes into Saxony. Cashmere is a
                    fertile valley of difficult approach, nearly circular, and ninety miles in
                    diameter, embraced by the arms of the Himalaya Mountains. Native tradition
                    represents it as a lake, until one of the Hindu deities burst the rocky
                    boundary, by the formation of the ravine through which the Vidusta now pours its
                    waters.</p><p>Some valleys contain large rivers and lakes, from which there is no issue or
                    outlet. Such valleys have not yet been drained by the giving way of some point
                    of their boundaries. Central Asia affords many instances of this species of
                    valley, as in the districts around the Koko-noi, the Loke-nor, the lakes of
                    Zaizan, Kirgha, and Palkati, and the Sea of Aral. A very remarkable instance
                    occurs amidst the loftiest peaks of the Andes, in the valley which contains the
                    great lake of Titicaca, which the ancient Peruvians regarded as sacred, the
                    residence of the founder of their monarchy, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193497639" xml:id="kp-eb0717-7639-0504"/>and which is
                    sufficiently remarkable, by its extent, and the sublimity of the surrounding
                    scenery.</p><p>The most elevated portions of the earth’s surface are either connected in
                    extensive mountain chains, or they exist in aggregated groups branching from a
                    common centre, or they form insulated heights, rising - more or less abruptly
                    from plains. We have seen that the direction of mountain chains is that of the
                    principal extension of the regions in which they occur; and the same thing holds
                    good in peninsulas and islands, in which we generally find the chains
                    longitudinal. Thus the principal mountains of Europe, Asia, and America form
                    extensive chains in the direction of the greatest extent of each of these
                    divisions of the earth.</p><p>The direction of peninsular chains is well seen in Norway, in the Apennines, in
                    the mountains of the western side of Arabia, in the Ghauts of India, and in the
                    mountains of Corea, Kamtschatka, and California. The direction of insular
                    chains, as corresponding with the principal dimension of each island, is also
                    illustrated in Madagascar, Ceylon, Japan, Cuba, St Domingo, the British isles,
                    Sardinia, Sicily, and in many of the smaller islands.</p><p>If we endeavour to generalize the observations on the direction of mountain
                    chains, one very remarkable peculiarity seems deducible, namely, that they very
                    generally present their steepest acclivities towards the great basins to which
                    they are contiguous, while they slope more gradually in the opposite direction;
                    and on examining their intimate structure, we find their stratified beds dipping
                    generally <hi rend="italic">from</hi> the basins to which their escarpments are
                    presented. Thus the ridges of the Scandinavian peninsula present their boldest
                    escarpments to the basin of the Northern Atlantic; while the opposite ranges of
                    Greenland and Iceland also show their steepest acclivities towards that basin.
                    Round the shores of the Mediterranean the same arrangements are especially
                    observable. The lofty ridge of the Atlas is very bold on the northern side, and
                    declines more gradually towards the Sahara. The chain of Spanish mountains which
                    skirt the Mediterranean, from Gibraltar to the Pyrenees, present their
                    escarpments towards that sea; and the Maritime Alps of France, the mountains of
                    Switzerland and the Tyrol, of Istria, Dalmatia, and Thrace, all present their
                    most precipitous sides to the basin of the Mediterranean. We believe that the
                    considerable chain which in Asia Minor extends from Mount Ida to the country
                    around Scanderoon, has the escarpment directed towards the Levant seas; while
                    the mountains of Armenia present their boldest declivities to the basin of the
                    Euxine, and the Caucasus and mountains of Mazanderan towards that of the
                    Caspian. The escarpment of the great chain of Africa, termed that of Lupata,
                    which seems to be prolonged from the lofty mountains of Abyssinia to the south
                    of the Mozambique Channel, would appear, from the little we have learned of its
                    structure, to face the basin of the Indian Ocean; and we know that the steepest
                    declivities of the Western Ghauts of India are directed towards the same basin.
                    The mighty spine of the American continent, from the shores of the Arctic Frozen
                    Ocean to the extremity of South America, through a course of more than 8600
                    British miles, presents a series of rugged precipices to the vast basin of the
                    Pacific; and, if we might indulge in one sweeping generalization, it would seem
                    that the chains stretching from the Persian Gulf eastward through Thibet, and
                    thence bending to the north-east through Mongolia and Northern China to
                    Tscheoutskoi-nos on the Frozen Ocean, present their fronts also to the Pacific
                    Ocean.</p><p>As such coincidences can scarcely be considered as accidental, they afford a wide
                    field for speculation. Can we suppose that appearances, on such an immense
                    scale, have any relation to the operation of the force which caused the
                    elevation of the land, acting towards a central point, and producing the dip of
                    the elevated strata all around, from a common axis of movement? Such
                    speculations, aided by the position of volcanoes, and other mountains of igneous
                    formation, might lead us to infer the direction of the great lines of
                    subterranean disturbances which have modified the appearance of the crust of the
                    earth.</p><p>The inequalities of the earth’s surface, however considerable they may appear to
                    the eye that contemplates them, bear but a trifling proportion to a sphere of
                    nearly 8000 miles in diameter. The loftiest peaks are not quite five miles in
                    height above the sea; and we may obtain some idea of their effects on its
                    general form, by considering, that such inequalities on the surface of our earth
                    produce no greater proportional deviation from its spherical shape than a
                    roughness equal to γτ⅛&lt;5 <hi rend="superscript"> t</hi> h of an inch would on
                    a ball an inch in diameter; not so considerable as the inequalities produced
                    upon the form of an orange by the papillae of its rind. The heights of
                    mountains, however, exercise an important influence on the climate and
                    productions of the regions where they occur; and it becomes an important point
                    in physical geography to determine their respective altitudes. This has usually
                    been attempted by two methods; by geodesical mensuration, and by marking the
                    difference of the barometrical columns on their summits and at their bases. The
                    first is the most accurate when we can obtain a level base at a moderate
                    distance from the height to be ascertained, and when the measurements of the
                    angles are carefully taken by expert operators, and with good trigonometrical
                    instruments. The use of the barometer is confined to accessible heights; but it
                    is much more easily managed, under such circumstances, and requires little more
                    than attention to the true height of the barometrical column, corrected for the
                    temperature of the instrument and of the ambient air. In variable climates,
                    accuracy would require synchronous observations at the foot and on the summit of
                    the height to be ascertained; but in tropical climates, or even in the south of
                    Europe, the barometer scarcely varies throughout the year at the level of the
                    sea, and therefore such measurements are more easily made. The methods of both
                    kinds of observation are sufficiently detailed in the articles <hi rend="smallcaps">Barometrical Measurements</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Trigonometry.</hi></p><p>Accessible heights have also been estimated by the fall of the thermometer on
                    ascending. It has been found that, in our latitudes, an ascent of every 300 feet
                    may be considered as equivalent to a fall of 1° of Fahrenheit’s thermometer; but
                    this formula does not answer so well either in high or in low latitudes.</p><p>It has also been proposed to measure such elevations by marking the temperature
                    at which water boils at the base and on the summit. A convenient instrument for
                    such observations was invented by the Rev. F. Wollaston, but it is liable to
                    accidents in carriage; and, on the whole, geologists trust either to
                    barometrical or to trigonometrical observations for measuring mountain
                    elevations.</p><p>The most lofty mountains in general form parts of extensive chains; but there are
                    many instances of great elevations being attained by isolated peaks. Instances
                    of the former are familiar in the Alps, the Carpathians, the Himalaya, and the
                    Andes; of the latter, in the towering summits of Aetna, Teneriffe, and Mouna Roa
                    in the Sandwich Islands. But such detached elevations are either active or

                    found in the Himalaya range. Some of them attain an elevation a mile higher than
                    Chimborazo, which was long regarded as the loftiest mountain on the globe. Of
                    late years our countryman Mr Pentland has measured several mountains in Upper
                    Peru, especially near the Lake of Titicaca, much higher than Chimborazo; and
                    Sorata, one of these, is only surpassed by a few peaks in the great Indian
                    chain. Although those who first attempted to measure the summits of the Himalaya
                    appear to have exaggerated their real altitude, succeeding observers have shown
                    that we must consider that range as the most elevated on the globe, and the peak
                    of Dhawala-giri as the sovereign of mountains.</p><p>Human habitations, and even considerable towns, have been erected in very
                    elevated stations on mountain chains. Dr Gerard states, that in the valley of
                    Sulei, in the Himalaya Mountains, there is a village at the enormous elevation
                    of 14,700 feet above the sea, and that rye is cultivated as high as 14,900 feet.

                    Solid Materials of the Globe.</hi></p><p>A particular description of the solid materials of our earth has been given under
                    the articles <hi rend="smallcaps">Geology</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Mineralogy</hi>; but it is our business to present here a brief statement of
                    their general distribution.</p><p>Persons unaccustomed to examine the structure of the crust of our earth are apt
                    to imagine that mineral masses present but a confused congeries of stony matter,
                    without any order or particular arrangement. Nothing, however, can be more
                    erroneous. Wherever water-courses, artificial excavations, or abrupt precipices,
                    expose the structure of the crust of the earth, we find very striking
                    appearances of the agency of causes which must have acted with great uniformity
                    over vast portions of its surface, and which have produced a general resemblance
                    between the structure of countries widely distant from each other. A large
                    portion of the solid materials is arranged in beds, varying in extent and
                    thickness, but everywhere indicating the operation of one common agent. These
                    beds are sometimes slightly coherent, as when composed of clay or sand; at other
                    times they are consolidated stony bodies, arranged in parallel layers, which are
                    often subdivided into thinner portions by seams or joints, and preserve their
                    parallelism for a great extent, whether their position be horizontal, or at
                    different degrees of inclination. Such beds are termed <hi rend="italic">strata,</hi> and the general fact is expressed by the term <hi rend="italic">stratification.</hi> Sometimes we find a succession of strata of the same rock
                    in juxtaposition; at other times there are strata of different substances
                    interposed or alternating with the principal rock. The position of strata in
                    plains is generally but little inclined towards the horizon; but as we ascend
                    mountains, the strata are usually inclined, sometimes nearly, or even absolutely
                    vertical. When a mountain, or a chain of mountains, is lofty, it is not unusual
                    to find the strata inclined from the centre or axis of the chain towards either
                    hand (No. 2); and in such cases we generally find the strata reposing on a
                    different kind of rock, which has no appearance of having a seamed or stratified
                    structure. Such rocks may also occur in plains; they have frequently a granular
                    or crystalline structure, and form an important class of stony bodies. Hence the
                    distribution of rocks into two great divisions, the stratified and unstratified.
                    Both divisions present instances of rocks which either appear simple or
                    homogeneous to the eye, or consist of stony bodies, which are evidently composed
                    of two or more materials. Instances of the one occur in clay-slate, limestone,
                    quartz-rock, and basalt; of the other in mica-slate, gneiss, granite, and
                    porphyry. The visible axis of a mountain chain is very often some species of
                    unstratified rock, and stratified materials usually form its flanks. In other
                    instances no unstratified material is visible at the axis, as far as we can
                    trace the structure of a mountain. But whenever the mountain is much elevated,
                    or steep, and its sides ploughed by torrents, it is very rare not to find some
                    unstratified material as the nucleus upon which the inclined strata rest (No. 3,
                    <hi rend="italic">g).</hi> We are not, however, to assume, that in the order of
                    superposition the stratified materials are invariably above the unstratified.
                    Though this holds good in a great number of cases, we frequently observe vast
                    masses of unstratified rock directly resting upon regular strata (No. 3, <hi rend="italic">t~).</hi> In some cases we are able to show such irregular masses
                    connected with other similar materials much lower in the series of rocks, by one
                    or more lines of communication penetrating the strata, which, according to their
                    shape and size, have obtained the name of veins or dykes. Instances of this
                    occur frequently in mountains into the composition of which trap-rocks enter
                    (No. 4).</p><p>There are, however, other kinds of veins which we cannot so readily trace to
                    larger masses of mineral substances. The most familiar instances of such occur
                    in metallic veins (No. 5). They may often be observed penetrating both
                    stratified and unstratified matter, in the greatest diversity of forms and
                    directions; sometimes in very minute threads, expanding to the dimensions of
                    many feet, or even yards, and repeatedly contracting again to the thickness of a
                    fraction of an inch.</p><p>Sometimes mineral bodies form irregular masses entirely enclosed in the rocks in
                    which they occur, varying in weight from a few grains to many tons, without any
                    perceptible trace of the mode by which they were so introduced. Occasionally
                    long fissures occur, which are not filled up by any solid material; sometimes
                    also cavities are left in the more solid species of rocks, the sides of which
                    are lined with crystalline bodies of various kinds. Sometimes these fissures and
                    cavities are of enormous extent, forming vast caverns in the bowels of the
                    earth, which are either empty or filled with water. Instances of these on the
                    great scale occur<pb break="no" facs="nls:193497691" xml:id="kp-eb0717-7691-0508"/> in the limestone strata of many countries,
                    especially of Carniola and North America; and on a less scale in France,
                    Germany, and in our own island. The cavern of Adelsberg, in Carniola, extending
                    to three leagues in its various ramifications, and containing a subterranean
                    lake and river, affords an example of the extent of caverns in limestone rocks;
                    and the no less remarkable Mammoth Cave of Kentucky, which has been traced to
                    the extent of nine or ten miles, is an American example of the same formation.
                    Almost every extensive cavern of Europe is also in limestone, as the interesting
                    ossiferous caves of Gailenreuth and Kü-loch, in Franconia; of Bize, Somières,
                    and Racogne, in France; the Kifkdale Cave, and the caverns of the Craven and
                    Mendip Hills, in England; but the fine stalactitic cave of the Isle of Skye is
                    in sandstone. We do not recollect any considerable caverns found in other rocks,
                    excepting one in the schist of the island of Thermiae in the Archipelago, and
                    the vast Icelandic cavern of Surtshellir, in a current of lava which had flowed
                    from the Bald Yökul. This last cavern, as described by Henderson, is nearly a
                    mile in length, and appears to have been formed in the flowing lava by the
                    disengagement of gaseous matters; as it has all the appearance of being the
                    consequence of an enormous air-bubble, having its arched roof ornamented with
                    coralliform projections of black slag. Perhaps we may also give as an exception
                    the small but remarkable columnar cave at Staffa, which is in trap-rock.</p><p>Such is the general structure of the solid crust of our earth. But when we
                    examine the rocks more minutely, we find other striking peculiarities belonging
                    to each, which, besides the order of their superposition, mark different eras in
                    their formation.</p><p>The regularity of the lines dividing stratified rocks early suggested the idea of
                    their deposition from water; and this was rendered still more apparent when
                    observers began to remark that the remains of organic beings were often included
                    in them. Plants, shells, and eorallines were first noticed as entering into the
                    composition of rocks; and next the remains of fishes, and of other vertebrate
                    animals, were distinctly recognized. Some organic remains were observed to
                    pervade limestone rocks at great depths in the earth, and upon very high
                    mountains; and remains of plants, and even stems of trees, were found
                    fossilized, or converted into stone, in the strata of the coal formation. Some
                    remains of marine genera of animals were detected in slaty strata which do not
                    belong to either of these two kinds of rocks; and, lastly, the remains of
                    quadrupeds were recognised in the sandy marl and gypseous deposits which in some
                    countries lie immediately below the soil, or were imbedded in sedimentary matter
                    in the floors of caverns in various parts of the world. In most instances there
                    is an alternation of marine and fresh-water organic remains; and the general
                    fact appears to be, that the fresh-water shells are most numerous in the upper
                    beds, and those of marine origin in the subordinate strata of the low country,
                    while the former seldom attain any considerable height on mountains; but the
                    marine animal remains are found on the summits of ridges as lofty as the
                    Pyrenees.</p><p>Minute examination of the organic remains collected from different strata have
                    established the fact, that comparatively but few of the fossil animals are of
                    the same species with those of the same families now living; and we cannot doubt
                    that whole genera and orders have disappeared from the face of the earth. It is
                    only in the upper deposits that any species identical with those now existing
                    have been detected. Where the organic bodies are completely fossilized, very few
                    if any living species can be recognised; and generally the recent species most
                    nearly allied to the fossils are now no longer to be found in the adjacent seas
                    or regions. Thus the fossil-shells and corallines of northern countries, in both
                    continents, have their congeners (when such are known) generally in tropical
                    climates; and the fossil-trees of the British coal-fields have a greater
                    affinity, to the <hi rend="italic">tree-ferns</hi> and <hi rend="italic">cyacadeae</hi> of southern regions, than to any sort of European
                    vegetation.</p><p>These circumstances are too remarkable not to have suggested theoretical
                    speculations. Accordingly, geology has long been conversant with sublime, but
                    hasty, and sometimes unwarranted generalizations; and though she is still remote
                    from the period when a lasting theory shall safely and satisfactorily embrace
                    the explanation of observed phenomena, yet she has begun to assume a more
                    philosophical aspect. Facts are rapidly accumulating, and the deductions of
                    ingenious men, applying the science of number and calculation to this
                    interesting study, have already established a basis on which future observers
                    may erect a philosophical theory of the earth.</p><p>The crystalline arrangements of the particles of a considerable portion of the
                    solid materials of the earth’s crust, indicate, beyond doubt, that the particles
                    have been once in a state of such freedom of movement as to assume a determinate
                    order, that is, in a certain degree of fluidity; and hence the geologist assumes
                    that such minerals must have either been softened, or melted by heat, or have
                    been suspended in a fluid medium. The phenomena of stratification, and the
                    incorporation of organized bodies in different rocks, are not less certain
                    indications that a large portion of stony matter has obtained its present form
                    by subsidence from water; and this constitutes the grand basis of geological
                    reasoning. The second link in the chain, the relative age of the different
                    strata, is derived from the order of their succession. As the strata bear the
                    marks of deposition from water, it is obvious that the lowest in the series must
                    have been the first deposited, and the upper beds the most recent formations. No
                    such chronological data are afforded by the unstratified rocks, though their
                    relations to stratified materials afford just inferences respecting their true
                    era; but it is from the examination of the strata of any country that we can
                    arrive at a just conception of its geological history.</p><p>Relative geological age, then, is to be sought by a careful examination of the
                    superposition of the strata; and as the observation of organic remains has shown
                    a succession of living forms to be peculiar to each series of rocks, the
                    knowledge of such remains forms an important feature in modem geology. Certain
                    fossils are peculiar to certain formations, and we are sometimes able to
                    identify particular rock formations by their included organized remains. It is
                    on such a basis that the most generally received classification of strata has
                    been established; and geologists now usually divide them into three great
                    classes, <hi rend="italic">the primary, secondary,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">tertiary.</hi></p><p>The primary strata are such as do not include any organic bodies. They are the
                    lowest in the series of strata, and are found to repose on crystalline
                    unstratifìed rocks, generally on granite, which, as far as we have penetrated
                    the crust, has the appearance of being the general fundamental rock. The name
                    <hi rend="italic">primitive</hi> was originally given to these rocks because
                    they were supposed to have been deposited before the creation of organized
                    bodies; but this involves a hypothesis which we cannot prove, as the
                    disappearance of organic remains may be owing to the cause which crystallized
                    such rocks. The term, however, as indicative of the oldest strata, is
                    convenient, although the theory which suggested it may be exploded.</p><p>The secondary strata are generally less crystalline in structure, and in their
                    lower beds the organic remains are few,, being chiefly marine productions; but
                    these increase in number and variety in the upper beds, which may be said to end
                    with the chalk formation. The organized bodies are chiefly marine productions,
                    as zoophyta, Crustacea, shells, fishes; sometimes reptiles, amphibia, and plants
                    are also found in secondary strata. During the deposition of the <pb break="no" facs="nls:193497704" xml:id="kp-eb0717-7704-0509"/>secondary
                    strata the land appears to have been gradually rising above the level of the
                    waters which once covered it; and during the same period there are marks of more
                    sudden changes or disturbances among them, which are most probably to be
                    accounted for by the forcible irruption of ignigenous rocks from the bowels of
                    the earth. The land appears to have attained extensive elevations above the
                    waters after the deposition of the cretaceous formation, the newest of the
                    secondary rocks; and another system of deposits now begins to be developed.
                    Stratified rocks appear now also to have been formed by deposition from fresh
                    water, as is proved by the abundant remains of animals inhabiting that element;
                    and this is one characteristic of the <hi rend="italic">tertiary strata.</hi> It
                    is true, that in the coal-fields of the secondary rocks, we occasionally find
                    alternations of sea and fresh water animals; which may be explained by such
                    formations having taken place in extensive estuaries, into which rivers have
                    flowed. But the decided alternations of fresh and salt water deposits are
                    peculiarly characteristic of the tertiary period; and this, with the limitation
                    of such formations to particular basins or circumscribed hollows, enables us to
                    recognise them. Some of the best recognised of these beds are the Paris Basin,
                    the London Basin (No. 6), and that of the Isle of Wight and the opposite coast
                    of Hampshire. Tertiary beds appear to be entirely wanting in Scotland and in
                    Ireland; but they occur in Germany, in Spain, in Italy, and in different parts
                    of Asia and America. In the upper strata of the tertiary period we find many
                    shells similar to living animals in the adjacent seas; and bones of extinct
                    mammalia also occur among their beds. Sometimes the remains belong to genera of
                    which no species now exists; at other times to genera of which we still possess
                    living types.</p><p>Μ. Deshayes has attempted to ascertain the dates of tertiary deposits by the
                    number of living species they contain, considering that which contains the
                    greatest number of existing species the most recent. He distinguishes three
                    tertiary epochs. The most ancient is that of the Paris, London, and Hampshire
                    Basins, in which he finds 3∙5 per cent, of living shells, corresponding to the
                    Eocene deposits of Mr LyeÙ. The middle group includes the basins of the
                    southwest of France, of Baden, Vienna, Hungary, and Moravia. Among these he
                    found 15∙2 per cent, of living shells; and this corresponds to Lyell’s Miocene
                    period. The most recent strata include the tertiary beds of Italy, Sicily,
                    Spain, of the south-east of France, the Morea, and the <hi rend="italic">crag</hi> formation of England. In it he detected 45∙4 per cent, of living
                    shells; and it corresponds to the Pliocene formation of Mr Lyell.</p><p>Besides these great formations, there are local deposits of more limited extent,
                    which we may slightly notice. 1. The formations at present going on, or elevated
                    within historical periods, by earthquakes and volcanic agency from the bed of
                    the sea, and added to the dry land. 2. Lacustrine deposits, now forming the rock
                    called <hi rend="italic">travtrtino,</hi> or giving rise to marly sediments.
                    This last deposit, at Big-bone-Lick, in Kentucky, contains bones of the mastodon
                    and other mammalia, with fresh-water shells; and at Market Weigh ton, in
                    Yorkshire, the bones of the elephant, with those of the lion and the wolf. 3.
                    The incrustations of calcareous matters cementing fragments of other rocks, as
                    in the <hi rend="italic">nagelfluhe</hi> of the Germans; or including bones of
                    living species, which have fallen or have been washed into caves and fissures.
                    4. Superficial deposits of gravel and sand, evidently the produce of rivers or
                    of floods, which sometimes contain bones of elephants, the rhinoceros, &amp;c.,
                    and are distinguished by the name of diluvian. 5. Erratic blocks of different
                    rocks, which have been removed from their original beds, and scattered over
                    extensive tracts. The most remarkable instances of this transportation are the
                    profusion of large blocks of the zircon syenite of Norway, scattered over all
                    the north of Germany, to the very foot of the Jura chain; of the granites of the
                    Alps on the summit of the Jura, and beyond it into France; and of the granite of
                    Shap Fell, over the intervening mountains, into Lancashire and Yorkshire. 6. The
                    deposits formed by volcanoes at present in activity, consisting either of ashes,
                    mud, or lava; to which we may add the obsidian, pumice beds, trachyte, and
                    basalts of extinct volcanoes. The best characterized and most remarkable of the
                    former are the ashes which have buried Pompeii, the mud eruptions of Tunguragua
                    in 1797, the enormous lava streams of the Skaptar Yökul in 1783, and of Vesuvius
                    and of Aetna at numerous periods: of the latter, we have examples in the
                    obsidian of Lipari, Ascension Island, and Teneriffe; in the pumice beds of
                    Lipari and of Auvergne; in the trachytes of the latter country, of Germany, and
                    Italy; and in the basalts of almost every region.</p><p>The general opinion now entertained by geologists is, that the stratified
                    materials of the earth’s crust have been horizontally deposited from water at
                    different eras, but that the unstratified rocks have been produced by the action
                    of a high temperature. The consolidation of the older strata is supposed to have
                    been accomplished by heat, produced either by internal changes among the
                    elements of which they consist, or derived from a source of heat deep seated in
                    the earth. The less crystalline state of the secondary strata, with the more
                    perfect preservation of the forms of these organic remains, are ascribed to
                    their having been subjected to a less intense temperature; while the still more
                    earthy texture of the beds, and less altered nature of the organic bodies among
                    tertiary strata, are ascribed, with seeming justice, to the still less heat they
                    have experienced. The loose beds of clay and sand appear to have been deposited
                    when the crust of our earth was cooled down to its present state.</p><p>The unstratified rocks are now generally allowed to be of igneous origin, and
                    believed to have been introduced into their present situations after the
                    deposition of the greater part of the stratified materials. These are believed
                    to have been liquefied by heat in the bowels of the earth, and forced upwards by
                    the expansion of elastic matter, either in a softened state, or, in some
                    instances, after they had been melted and again consolidated. In this view,
                    granite, which so often forms the nucleus of mountains, and the lowest basis we
                    can discover of other rocks, is supposed to have been acted on by heat, and
                    slowly cooled after it had been elevated by the agent which liquefied it This
                    elevation is considered as having produced the fractures, dislocations, and
                    elevations of the stratified rocks; and the heat of the melted material, thus
                    introduced, is believed by most geologists to be the cause of the crystalline
                    state of the older strata which rest on it. In some instances the elevating
                    force has tilted the strata to an absolutely vertical position; at other times
                    it has carried up detached portions of the strata, and separated them from the
                    principal bed, or even inverted the order of their superposition in considerable
                    masses (No. 7). The injection of the fluid matter of granite between some of the
                    strata, has given rise to the rare appearance of beds of this <pb break="no" facs="nls:193497717" xml:id="kp-eb0717-7717-0510"/>material; and
                    when the force applied has rent or fissured the different strata, some of the
                    liquefied matter has formed granitic veins, penetrating the stratified matter in
                    different directions.</p><p>Trap-rocks, in like manner, are now generally considered as the immediate progeny
                    of fire. They are occasionally found as interposed beds, or sometimes alternate
                    with other matter, in distinct but thick beds, though not exhibiting the seams
                    of true stratification. Most geologists regard such appearances as the
                    consequence of subaqueous volcanic eruptions, in which liquid matter had flowed
                    out of craters, spread over the adjacent strata, and been covered by aqueous
                    depositions; after which a repetition of the same process may have given rise to
                    such alternations. The more ordinary appearance of trap-rocks, especially of
                    greenstone and basalt, is either in the form of veins penetrating stratified
                    rocks, or as forming mountain caps, or huge beds superimposed on secondary, or
                    sometimes on tertiary strata. Familiar instances of these veins occur in all
                    coal-fields, more especially in the vicinity of the great coal deposits around
                    Edinburgh and Glasgow. Arthur’s Seat, near the former, affords a good example of
                    a mountain capped by trap reposing on sandstone strata; and Salisbury Craig, of
                    a vast bed of greenstone overlying the same strata (No. 8). The chalk of Antrim
                    is in the same manner covered by greenstone and basalt; and the tertiary strata
                    of Auvergne are often concealed by beds of trachyte or other ignigenous
                    rocks.</p><p>The movements which produced these changes are believed to be comparatively of
                    considerable antiquity, that is, before the records of history; but there are
                    some causes, in operation at the present day, which may affect the stability of
                    those more ancient arrangements, and which therefore we must now briefly
                    consider.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> V.— <hi rend="italic">Circumstances affecting the
                    present Order of Geological Phenomena.</hi></p><p>These may be considered as four: Atmospherical action; the effect of the waters
                    of the ocean and of floods; disturbances occasioned by earthquakes; and the
                    influence of volcanoes.</p><p>1. Atmospherical action is slow, but constant. The united influences of winds and
                    rains serve to form <hi rend="italic">detritus,</hi> by which the higher
                    portions of the earth’s surface are gradually lowered, and the materials thus
                    abraded carried by streams and rivers to the sea. The consequence must be, a
                    very gradual change in the relative level of the land and the ocean. The
                    abrasion of mountains by torrents and impetuous rivers produces deposits of
                    gravel, sand, and mud in plains at their feet. These effects are increased by
                    the sudden bursting of water long pent up in the bowels of a mountain, or dammed
                    up in an alpine lake; thus giving rise to the phenomena which are termed <hi rend="italic">debacles.</hi> Instances of the fall of mountains have been
                    frequently afforded in the Alps and other lofty mountains. The fall of the
                    Rossberg was foretold by General Pfeffer, several years before it happened, from
                    the existence of enormous collections of water in its bowels; and in the recent
                    fall of one of the <hi rend="italic">Aiguilles,</hi> which border the southern
                    side of the valley of Chamouni, a vast torrent of liquid mud, bearing before it
                    woods and vast masses of rock, proved the influence which dammed-up water had in
                    the catastrophe. The fall of the mountain of Chiavenna, which in 1618 buried the
                    town of Pleurs and all its inhabitants, appears to have been produced by water
                    insinuating itself among the shaly strata which underlie the limestone beds in
                    the Italian Alps. Among lofty mountains, another cause of disintegration is
                    perpetually at work. The accumulation of snow, and the formation of glaciers on
                    their steep acclivities, where there is a considerable difference between the
                    summer and winter temperature of the climate, is a powerful cause of the
                    degradation of these elevations. The fall of the thundering avalanche, and the
                    movements of the increasing glacier, from its own weight, detach vast masses of
                    rocks, and hurl them into the valleys below. Even the action of minute particles
                    of sand, moved by the winds for a succession of ages, is capable of wearing the
                    hardest stones. Thus the polished surface of the granite of Sinai has been, with
                    great probability, attributed to the perpetual descent of quartz sand over the
                    rock; and we have in our possession nodules of Egyptian jasper, the exterior of
                    which has been worn into smooth and deep channels, apparently by the
                    long-continued action of the sands of the desert of Nitria on the surface of
                    this hard mineral.</p><p>The heavier detritus of mountains is accumulated at their bases; but land-floods
                    often convey large blocks of stone to astonishing distances. The finer particles
                    are swept by rivers to the ocean. Humboldt has pointed out how the Gulf of
                    Mexicois rapidly filling up by the sedimentary deposits from the waters of the
                    Mississippi and other rivers which fall into that inland sea. The turbid waters
                    of the Orinoco and the Marañon discolour the ocean to the distance of 300 miles
                    from their mouths; and there can be no doubt that the formation of the flat land
                    of Guiana, now about 100 miles in width, from the most eastern ridge of hills,
                    is principally the alluvial deposition of these mighty rivers. The waters of the
                    Ganges, at the highest inundation, are stated by Rennell to contain an enormous
                    quantity of sedimentary matter; and we can hence conceive how the flat shores of
                    the Hoogly, and the other branches, have originally been formed, and how the Bay
                    of Bengal may, in process of time, be materially altered in its depth. Another
                    striking instance of the effect of rivers in <hi rend="italic">silting</hi> up a
                    confined sea is to be observed in the Gulf of Leaotong, or upper part of the
                    Yellow Sea, into which a great part of the detritus of Northern China is
                    deposited by its numerous large rivers, and by the effects of the strong
                    currents in that inland sea. Staunton has calculated that the Yellow River alone
                    discharges into the Yellow Sea more than 2,000,000 of cubic feet of earthy
                    matter every hour. The matter carried down by the Nile and the Po is well known
                    to affect the extent and deepness of the adjacent seas; and the distance of
                    Ravenna from the present shores of the Mediterranean (between three and four
                    miles) proves how a comparatively small river like the Mon tone, pouring its
                    sediment into a still bay, has altered the situation of a port, where, in the
                    ages even of the lower empire, the Roman fleets used to anchor. These facts
                    would lead to the supposition that the land was gaining upon the sea; but there
                    are other circumstances which are at least equivalent to this change.</p><p>The natural consequence, as was well pointed out by Playfair in his Illustrations
                    of the Hnttonian Theory, and previously noticed by Manfredi, must be to elevate
                    the surface of the ocean, by the deposits of detritus in its bed. This rise is
                    most conspicuous in inland seas. Thus, on the western side of Italy, the ruins
                    of the palace of Tiberius at Ca-prae are now wholly covered by the sea; and the
                    far-famed temple of Serapis, situated on the Bay of Baiae, has its pavement
                    below the present level of the Mediterranean. Man <pb break="no" facs="nls:193497730" xml:id="kp-eb0717-7730-0511"/>fredi states,
                    that when the ancient pavement of the cathedral of Ravenna was discovered in
                    1731, it was found to be a foot below the present high-water mark; from which we
                    must infer that the level of the Adriatic had risen at least as much in 1500
                    years. The shores of Baiae may have had the level altered by the vicinity of an
                    active volcano, and the temple alluded to shows indications of more than one
                    upheaving and depression of the land; but the district of Ravenna is all
                    alluvial; and a similar rising was noticed at Venice by Zendrini.</p><p>The same fact is attested by observations along our own coasts. The submarine
                    forest on the coast of Lincoln, first described by Correa de Serra in the
                    Philosophical Transactions, 1799, proves a rise in the level of the sea; and the
                    tradition, that the Godwin Sands once formed part of the fertile domain of the
                    Saxon earl of that name, has probably a fair claim to be arranged with the same
                    phenomenon.</p><p>2. The wasting of the land by the waves of the ocean, and the overwhelming of
                    large tracts by the sea, are nearly allied facts. The changes on our own coasts,
                    and on the countries between the Rhine and the Elbe, afford striking instances
                    of the encroachments of the ocean on the land. Even where the rocky boundaries
                    are the most solid, the ceaseless action of the waves has wasted and
                    disintegrated the cliffs around all our shores; but the destruction of the
                    softer strata along the east coasts of England, and the chalky heights of Dover,
                    is still going on, and affords undeniable proofs of the power of this agent. The
                    swallowing up of whole districts along the coasts of Yorkshire is shown in the
                    annihilation of the villages of Auburn, Hyde, and Hartburn, and in the ravages
                    of the sea on the neck of land uniting the Spurnhead with the rest of the
                    country. We have authentic records of the destruction of Dunwich, on the coast
                    of <hi rend="subscript"> ι</hi> Suffolk; and near Harwich, in Essex, the sea is
                    annually encroaching. The Start islet was within the memory of man a part of the
                    island of Sandey, in the Orkneys.</p><p>Still more remarkable changes have taken place on the coasts of Holland and
                    Friesland within historical periods. Well-known instances of this occurred in
                    the devastation which accompanied the formation of the Zuyder Zee in the
                    beginning of the thirteenth century; in the successive encroachments of the
                    ocean, which formed the islands near the Texel in 1251; and in the disappearance
                    of the once fertile district of North Friesland, the only remnants of which,
                    since the disastrous 11th of October 1634, are the three small islets of
                    Noordstrand.</p><p>Such changes have occurred in various parts of the earth. Some of them,
                    especially the overwhelming of low sea-coasts, may be owing to the gradual
                    elevation of the level of the sea by detritus washed into it; but probably still
                    more is due to chariges in the level of the land by unequal subsidence, the
                    consequence of earthquakes.</p><p>3. The terrible effects of earthquakes have attracted attention in every age, and
                    records of some of such convulsions have descended to us from very remote ages.
                    No period of our earth’s history has been more noted for the violence and extent
                    of earthquakes than that between the first, third, and the middle of the
                    fourteenth century. China was terribly convulsed for ten years from 1333, when
                    Kiang-si, its capital, was swallowed up; mountains were engulfed, and floods,
                    occasioned by the obstruction of the course of rivers, destroyed vast multitudes
                    of human beings. The succussions extended westwards, and Asia Minor and Egypt
                    were violently shaken in 1346; while in the following year severe earthquakes
                    were experienced in Cyprus, Greece, and Italy. In 1692, the island of Jamaica
                    was visited by a most terrible earthquake, in which enormous masses of earth and
                    rock were detached from the Blue Mountains, and vast quantities of timber,
                    hurled from their flanks, covered the adjacent sea like floating islands. It was
                    during this earthquake that the city of Port Royal, with a tract of adjacent
                    land, estimated at 1000 acres, sunk, in one minute, into the deep. In the
                    succeeding year great earthquakes in Sicily destroyed the city of Catania, and a
                    hundred and forty other towns and villages in that island, where upwards of
                    100,000 persons perished. In 1746, Lower Peru suffered severely from this
                    calamity. The ocean burst in upon the land with irresistible force, when the
                    barrier of land sunk into the sea, Lima was overwhelmed, and the present port of
                    Callao formed. These convulsions were accompanied by eruptions of water and mud
                    from several volcanoes among the Andes. In 1750, the city of Conception, in
                    Chili, disappeared during an earthquake, and the sea rolled over it. In 1755,
                    Lisbon was in a great measure destroyed by one of the most terrible earthquakes
                    that ever visited Europe. The mountain chains between the Douro and the Tagus
                    were most dreadfully convulsed. The new mole at Lisbon, to which multitudes had
                    fled, as to a place of safety, suddenly sunk into an hideous abyss, and not one
                    body floated to the surface, nor were any fragments of the vessels sucked into
                    the chasm rendered up, and on the spot there is now an hundred fathoms of water.
                    In this awful convulsion at Lisbon sixty thousand persons perished in about six
                    minutes. A violent shock threw down the greatest part of the city, and the sea
                    retired, leaving the bar momentarily dry; but suddenly a mighty wave, fifty feet
                    high, rolled in on the devoted city. The extent of the <hi rend="italic">terrae</hi><hi rend="italic">motus,</hi> on this occasion, is very remarkable.
                    The violence of the shocks, which were accompanied by a fearful subterranean
                    noise, like the loudest thunder, was chiefly felt in Portugal, Spain, and
                    Northern Africa; but its effects were perceived over a considerable part of
                    Europe, and were even experienced in the West Indies. Our Scottish lakes,
                    particularly Loch Ness and Loch Lomond, rose and fell repeatedly on that
                    dreadful day. Ships at sea were affected by the shocks, as if they had struck on
                    rocks, and their crews were in some instances thrown down by the violence of the
                    concussions. In 1766, the island of Trinidad, and great part of Colombia, were
                    violently agitated by earthquakes; an islet in the Orinoco disappeared, and land
                    in other parts of the coast was raised above the waters. In 1772, the lofty
                    volcano of Papandayang (the loftiest mountain in Java) disappeared, and an area
                    around, fifteen miles by six, was swallowed up. Most terrible earthquakes
                    desolated Calabria in 1783. This calamity has been admirably described by
                    several writers, among whom we may mention Dr Vivenzio, Grimaldi, Sir William
                    Hamilton, Dolomieu, and the commission of the Royal Academy of Naples. The
                    violence of the shocks was chiefly felt in the Farther Calabria, and in the
                    neighbourhood of Messina. The principal agitation was felt over an area of five
                    hundred square miles. Many sudden sinkings of the land were perceived, numerous
                    fissures were formed, and partial elevations were effected in some places. The
                    greatest depressions happened at Terra Nuova, Oppido, Si-nopoli, and Santa
                    Christina: a fissure a mile in length, a hundred and five feet in width, and
                    thirty feet in depth, opened at Plaisano; another about the same length, and a
                    hundred feet in depth, was formed at Cerzulle; and at La Fortuna a chasm a
                    quarter of a mile in length, thirty feet in width, and two hundred and
                    twenty-five feet in depth, suddenly opened in the ground. In some districts
                    considerable mountain-slips, or the separation of huge masses of earth and rock,
                    took place; and along the Straits of Messina, in the neighbourhood of Scylla,
                    the cliff of Gian-Greco, a mile in length, was precipitated on the subjacent
                    houses and gardèns. A fragment detached by the earthquake from Monte Jaci
                    crushed multitudes who had fled to the shore for safety; and at the same moment
                    a wave broke on the devoted shore, and swept away the aged prince of Scylla, and
                    numbers of his people.</p><p>In the year 1797, Upper Peru was terribly convulsed. The <pb break="no" facs="nls:193497743" xml:id="kp-eb0717-7743-0512"/>shocks of
                    earthquakes continued with great violence for three months, and the face of the
                    country in the centre of the convulsion was totally changed. In 1811, violent
                    earthquakes shook the valley of the Mississippi, by which lakes of considerable
                    extent disappeared, and new ones were formed; but these were less terrific than
                    the catastrophe which destroyed the city of Caraccas in 1812. On the 26th of
                    March there were heard subterraneous thunderings; the ground undulated, as if
                    agitated by a boiling liquid, and at one shock this fine city entombed in its
                    ruins 10,000 of its inhabitants. During the earthquake the great lake of
                    Maracaibo had its level lowered, and the riven earth at Puerto Cabello and
                    Valencia poured forth enormous torrents of water. It is remarkable, that the
                    volcano of St Vincent, which had been perfectly quiescent for a century, burst
                    out with prodigious violence on the 27th of April in the same year, and threw
                    out clouds of ashes, which rose to an immense height into the air. Much of the
                    island was ruined by showers of scoriae and ashes; and such was the violence of
                    the eruption, that the decks of vessels 200 miles to windward of St Vincent were
                    covered with an impalpable dust. On the day of this eruption subterranean
                    thunderings were distinctly heard at Caraccas, and even on the Rio Apure, 210
                    leagues in a right line from St Vincent. In the eruption of Tomboro, about to be
                    noticed, the earthquakes extended throughout an area a thousand miles in
                    diameter, a considerable tract of land at the foot of the mountain disappeared
                    in the waves, and the port of Bima, where ships of war could formerly anchor,
                    was ruined by the upraising of a shoal. On the 19th of November 1822, Chili was
                    visited by a most destructive earthquake. The shock was strongly felt at the
                    same time throughout a line of coast 1200 miles in extent. It is stated, on good
                    authority, that the coast for one hundred miles sustained an elevation of from
                    two to four feet; and about a mile inland from Valparaiso it was raised from six
                    to seven feet. The sudden elevation of the coast was indicated by shell-fish
                    being found adherent to the rocks considerably above high-water mark. The shocks
                    continued until the end of September in the following year; and the area over
                    which the permanent alteration of level extended is believed to embrace the
                    country from the base of the Andes to the sea, a surface of not less than
                    100,000 square miles. In 1827 Popayan and Bogota suffered most severely from
                    earthquakes, during which vast fissures opened in the elevated plains around the
                    latter city.</p><p>The last earthquake in Europe occurred in Murcia in 1829, near Alicante. Several
                    villages in an area of above four square miles were thrown down by vertical
                    movements in the valley through which the Rio Segura flows, and many small
                    fissures were formed in the alluvial soil; while black mud, sand, and marine
                    shells were thrown up from small cavities formed near the sea. Such are some of
                    the severer earthquakes on record; but less considerable shocks are of frequent
                    occurrence in various countries, especially in South America and in Italy. Smart
                    shocks are occasionally felt in Scotland. They have often occurred at Comrie in
                    Perthshire. A smart shock rent the spire on the town-hall of Inverness in the
                    year 1816; and another earthquake was felt at Lancaster in 1834, which shattered
                    chimneys, and alarmed the inhabitants. But all the shocks experienced in our
                    island have fortunately been insignificant compared to those which have been
                    felt in many other countries.</p><p>4. The alterations produced on our earth’s surface by volcanoes in activity
                    within historical periods appear to be underrated by some writers. Few
                    geologists now will be disposed to doubt that most of the phenomena of
                    earthquakes are the consequences of volcanic fire. The coincidence of those
                    formidable shakings of the earth with volcanic eruptions, and the distance to
                    which such agitations have been felt, show that the causes of both are
                    deep-seated in the earth, and that they are probably the consequences of elastic
                    matter formed by subterranean heat. We shall say nothing of the almost universal
                    diffusion of trap-rocks, which, under the name of trachyte, basalt, greenstone,
                    and trap-tuffa, are now generally admitted to be of igneous origin, nor of the
                    true craters of extinct volcanoes which abound in France, Germany, and many
                    other parts of the earth, but which have ceased to emit any eruption within
                    known periods, and confine our attention to those mountains now either in active
                    combustion, or which have been so within historical periods. Gay-Lussac
                    enumerates 163 volcanoes active at the present time; and Professor Jameson gives
                    the following distribution of 193 volcanoes in a state of present activity:</p><p>Continent of Europe 1</p><p>European islands 12</p><p>Continent of Asia 8</p><p>Asiatic isles 58</p><p>African islands 8</p><p>Continent of America...87</p><p>American islands 19</p><p>193</p><p>To these we may add the gigantic crater of Kirauca, in Hawaiah, one of the
                    Sandwich Islands; the volcano of Tomboro, in the isle of Sumbawa; the volcano of
                    Tofua, in the Friendly Islands; that of Barren Island, one of the Andamans, in
                    the Bay of Bengal; to which we may perhaps add the submarine volcanoes which
                    have suddenly risen from the bosom of the deep, but soon afterwards have again
                    disappeared, as that of Nyoë, off the coast of Iceland; Sabrina, off St
                    Michaels, in the Azores; and Graham’s Island, not far from the east coast of
                    Sicily.</p><p>The substances ejected by volcanoes consist either of melted stony matter termed
                    <hi rend="italic">lava,</hi> of <hi rend="italic">scoriae,</hi> of ashes, of
                    sand, of muddy eruptions, or of vast quantities of hot and fetid water, always
                    accompanied by earthquakes and subterranean thunderings, and generally by
                    columns of flame or of dense smoke.</p><p>The general form of a volcano is a truncated cone, often isolated, and having a
                    circular depression or spiracle on or near its summit, which is named a <hi rend="italic">crater.</hi> From this crater smoke is perpetually issuing;
                    sometimes flame appears, or volleys of ignited stones are projected into the
                    air. From the dark cloud of smoke emitted during eruptions, vivid lightnings are
                    usually seen to dart; and the vapours of sulphur, ammonia, or of muriatic acid,
                    are often emitted. Sometimes the boiling lava is elevated from the bowels of the
                    mountain to its terminal crater, fills that cavity entirely, and descends from
                    the cone in streams of liquid fire, which concretes as it cools on the surface,
                    but continues to move on with resistless force till it congeals into stone,
                    though it often retains its heat for long periods. At other times the elasticity
                    of the pent-up matter is incapable of forcing the lava to the highest crater;
                    but the liquefied material bursts through the flanks of the mountain, and pours
                    into the plains. Sometimes the volcanic cone is included in an exterior one; a
                    circumstance on which Von Buch has founded his theory of <hi rend="italic">craters of elevation</hi> (No. 10). The strata or beds in both concs are
                    inclined from the general axis. The projectile power of volcanoes is prodigious.
                    The dust of the volcano of St Vincent was carried more than 200 miles <pb break="no" facs="nls:193497756" xml:id="kp-eb0717-7756-0513"/>
                    eastward of that island, and must have attained a vast elevation, to obviate the
                    effect of the trade-wind in its descent. It is stated, on credible authority,
                    that Vesuvius has projected large stones 3600 feet above its summit; and
                    Cotopaxi was ascertained by the French academicians to have hurled a rock,
                    calculated to weigh 200 tons, to the distance of three leagues, or more than ten
                    English miles.</p><p>Instances of volcanic eruptions are by no means rare. There are fifty-nine or
                    sixty eruptions of Aetna recorded by historians, and about fifty-two of
                    Vesuvius. The first eruptions of Aetna are lost in the remoteness of antiquity.
                    Vesuvius was not in existence as an active volcano till the year seventy-nine of
                    the Christian era, when the ancient crater presented a slight circular hollow,
                    the sides of which were overgrown with wild vines, and the exterior of the cone
                    was well cultivated. In the eruption which then took place, Stabiae, Herculanum,
                    and Pompeii were destroyed, and the elder Pliny lost his life. Stromboli appears
                    to have been an active volcano from 300 years before Christ, and is still in a
                    state of incessant activity, ejecting flame and red-hot stones in quick
                    succession. The most noted eruption of Aetna was probably that of 1699, when,
                    from a long rent on its flank, it poured out a stream of lava, which in its
                    course to the sea destroyed fourteen towns and villages, some of which contained
                    three or four thousand inhabitants. This current is fifteen miles in length,
                    about 600 yards at its broadest part, and there it is forty feet deep. Vesuvius
                    has more frequently been active in our own times than Aetna. One of its most
                    terrible eruptions was that of 1538, when Monte Nuovo was forced up in two days
                    to the height of 413 feet, and with a circumference of 8Õ00 feet. Another
                    happened in 1631, which covered with lava most of the villages at its foot, and
                    sent forth torrents of boiling water. In little more than a century it has had
                    eighteen eruptions. The eruption of 1794 has been well described by Breislac,
                    who estimates one of its streams of lava on that occasion as containing upwards
                    of forty-six millions of cubic feet. It again burned with great fury in 1805,
                    1813, and in 1822. We possess lavas of this latter period so strongly
                    impregnated with sulphuric and muriatic acids, that they destroy every species
                    of vegetable material they rest on; and, when recent, the specimens smelled
                    strong of the latter acid. The volcanoes of Iceland have been in activity ever
                    since the island was discovered, in the ninth century. Hekla, though not the
                    most considerable of these, from its position and its former activity, is the
                    best known. It has had many formidable eruptions, twenty-two of which have been
                    noted in about 800 years; and in the same period we have notices of twenty
                    eruptions from five other Icelandic volcanoes. A succession of eruptions of
                    Hekla lasted for six years; but the most severe convulsions of that country
                    happened in 1783, when the dreadful eruption of the Skaptar Yökul burst forth,
                    and did not cease till the following year. About a month before this terrible
                    catastrophe a submarine volcano elevated the crater of Nyoë, seventy miles
                    south-west of Cape Reikianes, and threw out such an immense quantity of scoriae
                    as to cover the sea, to the distance of 150 miles, with a stream which impeded
                    the progress of ships making the island; and portions of this eruption floated
                    as far as the Shetland and Orkney Islands. Nyoë emitted smoke and scoriae from
                    several apertures; but within a year the island disappeared, and a shoal marks
                    its former site. On the 8th of June the Skaptar Yökul threw out smoke; on the
                    10th an enormous current of molten lava flowed from numerous cones on the Yökul,
                    which, dividing into two main streams, pursued its course to the sea, filling up
                    the beds of two large rivers, and covering an immense extent of once productive
                    country. The horrors of the scene were aggravated by the enormous torrents of
                    boiling water produced by the liquefaction of the glaciers that covered the
                    Yökul, and by incessant showers of ashes which darkened the sun; stream of lava
                    succeeded stream from the 10th of June to the end of August, at short intervals;
                    and noxious emanations destroyed numbers of those whom fire and water had
                    spared. From this calamity Iceland has never recovered; for within the space of
                    two years the island, in consequence of this eruption, lost 9336 persons, 11,460
                    head of cattle, 28,000 horses, and 190,480 sheep. The extent of the principal
                    stream of lava is fifty miles in length; its greatest breadth is from twelve to
                    fifteen miles; in the plains its general depth is 100 feet, but in the channel
                    of the Skaptà River, which it dried up, it is 600 feet in perpendicular depth.
                    The south-western side of Iceland appears to be one vast focus of subterranean
                    fire; for the several eruptions of the Oraefa, the Skeiderà, Sida, and Skaptar
                    Yökuls, seem but as occasional <hi rend="italic">outbreakimps</hi> from one
                    immense volcanic fissure, which really belongs to the same chain of icy
                    mountains.</p><p>The volcanic formations of Java have been well examined by Dr Horsfield, who
                    describes them as extending throughout the centre of that noble island. They
                    form a chain, in which thirty-eight large mountains, evidently volcanic, are
                    conspicuous, and attain an elevation of from 5000 to 12,000 feet. Most of them
                    are no longer in activity. Tankuban Prahu has been quiescent for a series of
                    ages; but its crater contains a large lake, a mile and a half in circumference,
                    and 250 feet deep, from one side of which sulphureous vapour issues with great
                    violence. Papandayang was once the largest of the Javan volcanoes; but in August
                    1772 the greatest part of it was swallowed up during an eruption. A luminous
                    cloud at first seemed to envelope the mountain, prodigious quantities of ashes
                    were ejected, which destroyed forty villages, and an area of fifteen miles by
                    six was entirely swallowed up.</p><p>The eruption of Tomboro, in the island of Sumbawa, in the year 1815, described by
                    Sir Stamford Raffles, is one of the most violent on record. The earthquakes
                    caused by this eruption were felt over a circle with a radius of 1000 miles; and
                    all around to the distance of 300 miles the quantity of ashes excited terror and
                    dismay. In Java, though 300 miles in a direct line from Sumbawa, the sky at
                    mid-day was darkened by dense clouds of fine dust ejected from the volcano. In
                    Sumbawa it was attended by a whirlwind of surprising fury, which lasted for an
                    hour, sweeping away trees and houses in its career. The explosions commenced on
                    the ceasing of the whirlwind. They began on the 5th of April, and continued
                    until the 15th of July. Whole villages were swept away, and upwards of 12,000
                    persons perished in this eruption. Vast numbers of trees, torn up by the
                    whirlwind, strewed the ocean to a considerable extent. Raffles states that the
                    explosions of Tomboro were distinctly heard in a circle with a diameter of 1700
                    miles; and that the quantity of light scoriae and pumice it threw out within a
                    week formed a bed on the ocean two feet in thickness, and many miles in extent,
                    which impeded ships in approaching Sumatra.</p><p>The volcanoes of America claim notice, not only from their magnitude and number,
                    but from the peculiarities of their position. Several of the most lofty
                    mountains of the South American Andes are active volcanoes. Cotopaxi has an
                    elevation of 16,800 feet above the sea; the volcanoes of Mecas and Antisana
                    equal 17,000 feet, and Tunguragua<pb break="no" facs="nls:193497769" xml:id="kp-eb0717-7769-0514"/> 16,500 feet.
                    Humboldt considers these enormous cones as the spiracles of one prodigious
                    volcanic vault, stretching from south to north, which presents an area of 600
                    square leagues; and he regards them as merely different summits of the same
                    volcanic mass. “The fire issues sometimes from one, sometimes from another, of
                    these summits. The obstructed craters appear to us to be extinguished volcanoes;
                    but we may presume, that while Cotopaxi or Tunguragua have only one or two
                    eruptions in the course of a century, the fire is not less active under the city
                    of Quito, under Pichincha, and Imbaburu.”</p><p>The connection of the volcano of Pasto, in New Granada, with the volcanoes of
                    Quito, was strikingly displayed in 1797. A column of black smoke had continued
                    for several months to issue from the Volcan de Pasto; but, to the surprise of
                    the inhabitants, this smoke suddenly disappeared on the 4th of February 1797, at
                    the precise moment when, at sixty-five leagues from the city of Pasto, the city
                    of Riobamba, near Tunguragua, was destroyed by a terrific earthquake,</p><p>The eruption of Tunguragua, on the 4th of February 1797, was of a very
                    extraordinary nature. The country around, to the extent of forty leagues from
                    south to north and twenty leagues from east to west, sustained an undulatory
                    movement of extreme violence, which lasted four minutes. In the district around
                    the mountain every town was levelled with the ground, and the cities of Riobamba
                    and Quero were buried under the ruins of the impending mountains. The base of
                    Tunguragua was riven asunder, and poured out, from numerous apertures, streams
                    of water and mud, which accumulated in the valleys to 600 feet in depth. The mud
                    covered everything, blocked up the channels of the rivers, forming lakes which
                    remained for more than eighty days. Fetid, suffocating exhalations were emitted
                    by the lake Quilo-toa, and it is said that flames also issued. The covering of
                    mud, and the levelling of elevated portions of the country, totally changed its
                    face. The shocks continued to be violent for upwards of three months, and were
                    felt over a district 170 leagues from south to north, and 140 from west to cast.
                    It was during this eruption that the curious fishes, <hi rend="italic">Pimelodes
                    Cyclopum,</hi> were discovered in the ejected water of the volcano. They are
                    supposed to be generated in subterranean lakes in the bowels of the mountain,
                    and only to be brought to light by such an explosion. There are no less than
                    sixteen active volcanoes in Chili, the eruptions of which are confined to the
                    valleys of the Andes. A line of volcanoes in South America may be distinctly
                    traced from 5° to 6° of south latitude, running parallel to the ocean, and
                    occupying the highest ridges of the Andes.</p><p>In North America, Mexicopresents a chain of active volcanoes crossing the general
                    direction of the cordillera of Anahuac from east to west. It commences on the
                    coasts of the Mexican Gulf, with the small but energetic Volcan de Tuxtla, which
                    lies a little to the southward of a line joining the rest; next is the vast cone
                    of the peak of Orizaba (No. 9), which attains an elevation of 16,365 feet; and
                    then the still loftier Popocateptl, rising to 17,060 feet. These lie to the east
                    of the city of Mexico and on its west are the cones of Jorullo and Colima. They
                    are all active; but at no very distant period the snow-clad summits of
                    Iztacci-huatl, of Toluca, and of Tancitara, lying in the same line, were also
                    burning. This chain extends for 140 leagues; and perhaps the volcanoes should be
                    considered as spiracles, all connected with an huge ignited fissure, passing
                    throughout the table-land of Mexico Five of these mountains penetrate far into
                    the region of perpetual congelation; and from the inaccessible summits of
                    Orizaba and Popocateptl are pinnacles of frozen snow, from which smoke
                    continually issues.</p><p>The extent of these eruptions is attested by the prevalence of volcanic rocks
                    over the whole table-land; and the present form of this magnificent plateau
                    would seem to be derived from the accumulation of ignigenous formations in a
                    series of valleys among primary rocks. Tuxtla had a strong eruption in 1793,
                    which covered the roofs of the houses at Oaxaca, Vera Cruz, and Perote, with
                    ashes; and at the latter, which is 196 miles distant, the subterranean noises
                    resembled heavy discharges of artillery.</p><p>The formation of the volcano of Jorullo dates not farther back than the year
                    1759. Until that period, the present site of the volcano was a fertile plain,
                    well cultivated, and producing indigo and the sugar-cane. In the month of June
                    in 1759 subterranean thundcrings commenced, accompanied by frequent shockè of
                    earthquakes; and these alarming phenomena continued to terrify the inhabitants
                    for fifty or sixty days. About the beginning of September everything seemed to
                    announce the re-establishment of tranquillity; but on the night of the 28th the
                    horrible subterranean explosions were renewed, and an area of four square miles
                    rose up, like an enormous bladder, to the height of above 500 feet. Those who
                    gained the mountains around saw flames shoot up, from a surface of a square
                    league in extent, and huge fragments of ignited rock hurled into the air through
                    a dense cloud of ashes. The softened surface was seen to undulate like an
                    agitated ocean. The waters of two streams precipitated themselves into the
                    burning chasm, and this seemed to add fresh fury to the flames. T housands of
                    small burning cones, from six to eight feet high, issued from the softened and
                    inflated surface; and in the midst of these <hi rend="italic">hornitos</hi> or
                    ovens, which still pour out steam, and emit the sounds of internal ebullition,
                    six vast mountain masses arose, to a height varying from 300 to 1690 feet above
                    the former plain. The most elevated of these is the <hi rend="italic">Volcan de
                    Jorullo,</hi> which is perpetually burning, and has ejected a vast quantity of
                    ashes and scoriaceous lava, often mingled with fragments of primary rocks. The
                    ashes of this eruption were scattered to a distance of 160 miles. The eruptions
                    of the Jorullo continued till February 1760 without intermission, but they have
                    since become less and less frequent. On this catastrophe Humboldt justly
                    remarks, that an event, “by which so considerable an extent of country entirely
                    changed its appearance, is perhaps one of the most remarkable physical
                    revolutions in the annals of our globe. Geology indicates parts of the ocean
                    where, within the last two thousand years, several small volcanic islands have
                    been formed; but it gives no other example of the formation, from the centre of
                    a thousand burning cones, of a mountain of scoriae and ashes 1695 feet above the
                    level of the adjoining plain, upwards of thirty-six leagues from the sea, and
                    forty-two leagues from every other active volcano ;” and he adds, that though
                    within six days’ journey of the Mexican capital, this wonderful event had
                    remained unknown in Europe until the period of his journey (No. 11).</p><p>In the works of the South Sea missionary Ellis there is an interesting account of
                    the volcano of Kirauca, in the Sandwich Islands. The devastating effect of
                    volcanic fire in the island of Hawaiah had been noticed by Captain Cook, but it
                    has been particularly described by Mr Ellis. The route to the present volcano is
                    over a vast waste of naked lava. Instead of a mountain-crater, however, Kirauca
                    presents a chasm in a plain, perhaps occasioned by the engulfing of the <pb break="no" facs="nls:193497782" xml:id="kp-eb0717-7782-0515"/>
                    previous elevation. He describes it as a flat area of fifteen or sixteen miles
                    in circumference, sunk from 200 to 400 feet below the level of the country by
                    which he approached Kirauca. In the bottom of this area yawns an immense abyss,
                    in the form of a crescent, about two miles in length from north-east to
                    south-west, and about a mile in breadth at its widest part. One portion presents
                    a flood of glowing matter in a state of terrific ebullition. Fifty-one conical
                    islets, containing as many craters, rise around the edges, or from the surface
                    of the burning lake. Some of them emit flame and smoke, and others occasionally
                    vomit streams of lava, which roll in blazing torrents down their black sides
                    into the boiling flood below. The sides of the gulf just described are
                    perpendicular, and rise from a wide horizontal ledge of solid lava of irregular
                    breadth, but extending completely round the chasm; and beneath this ledge the
                    sides slope to the burning lake, the surface of which appears to be from three
                    hundred to four hundred feet lower.</p><p>Besides this volcano, there are several others now extinguished in the island. Of
                    these, one is Mouna Roa, which Captain King calculated, from the position of its
                    perennial line of snow, to be 16,020 feet in height; and the same navigator
                    assigns to another, Mouna Kaah, the vast elevation of 18,000. In a word, the
                    researches of Mr Ellis would lead us to infer that the whole island of Hawaiah,
                    an area of about 4000 square miles, is covered by lavas and other volcanic
                    matters in various stages of decomposition.</p><p>The whole islands in the Pacific are divided by Kotzebue into two classes; the
                    <hi rend="italic">low</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">elevated.</hi> The former
                    are coral reefs, of which the formation has been so well described by Captains
                    Flinders and Beechy. Their bases would appear to be submarine mountains, which
                    are brought to the surface of the waters by the depositions of the coral
                    animalcules. Captain Beechy examined thirty-two of these islands, the largest of
                    which was thirty miles, the smallest one mile, in diameter. Twenty-nine had
                    lagoons within their centres, which seem once to have existed in them all, until
                    they had been filled up by the operations of the zoophytes. These low coral
                    islands present a singular appearance. (No. 12, a section.) They often form
                    chains, extending for hundreds of miles with little interruption. Their exterior
                    is a border of dead coral rock, and stands a few feet above the waves, on which
                    the seeds of plants, wafted by the sea, soon fix their roots, and speedily a
                    verdant wood encircles the island, whilst its central lagoon is still the
                    habitation of living zoophytes. The elevated islands of the Pacific very
                    generally abound in volcanic products, and numbers of them are still the seats
                    of active volcanoes. Many of them have the appearance of having been raised from
                    the deep by submarine volcanoes; and Mr Lyell has with much force of reasoning
                    contended, that numerous coral islands ought to be considered as the cones of
                    extinguished submarine volcanoes covered over by coralline formations. If we
                    adopt this idea, and extend it to the enormous coral reefs described by
                    Flinders, King, Horsburgh, and Chamisso, the surface of the Pacific must repose
                    upon a prodigious magazine of volcanic energy, which is from time to time
                    destined to increase the surface of the habitable globe. A very extensive line
                    of active volcanoes exists in the Great Eastern Ocean, which has been noticed by
                    Lyell, and forms too remarkable a feature on our globe to be omitted in a sketch
                    of physical geography. It commences in Barren Island, off the coast of the
                    Malayan peninsula; is continued by a chain of active volcanoes through Sumatra,
                    Java, Sumbawa, and Flores; it then turns northward through the Moluccas, the
                    Philippines, Formosa, and Loo-Choo; it passes through Japan, Jesso, and the
                    Kuriles; reaches the peninsula of Kamtschatka, and terminates in the Aleutian
                    Islands, after a course of between 9000 and 10,000 miles, besides the several
                    branches which are sent off to the eastward in the directions of Papua and the
                    Ladrone Islands.</p><p>The cause of volcanic phenomena is involved in obscurity; but various conjectures
                    have been proposed by geologists. The Neptunian hypothesis has ascribed them to
                    the inflammation of beds of coal, or of other combustibles, in the burning
                    mountain; regarding them as local, or very limited in their range. Lemery’s
                    experiment on the heat extricated by moistening a mixture of iron filings and
                    sulphur, and burying it in the earth, was supposed to afford a satisfactory
                    explanation of the manner in which the fire might originally be kindled; and the
                    extinction of volcanoes was supposed to give probability to the local nature of
                    the heating cause. Abbé Breislac modified this hypothesis, by supposing that
                    volcanic fires were fed by collections of petroleum collected in caverns, and
                    set on fire by the chemical action of several other substances. Both these views
                    seem to afford too narrow a basis for the extent of volcanic energy, the
                    apparent connection between distant volcanoes, and the great length of time that
                    some of them are known to have remained in activity. The Huttonians consider
                    volcanoes as spiracles connected with the great source of central heat.
                    (Playfair, 86.)</p><p>Another hypothesis has been suggested by the discovery of the metallic bases of
                    the alkalis and earths. Their bases have been supposed to constitute the
                    interior of the earth; and when water finds its way to them, through fissures in
                    its crust, it will be rapidly decomposed, with the extrication of intense heat
                    and the evolution of elastic gases, and thus the phenomena of earthquakes and
                    volcanoes may be produced. This view, originally suggested by Sir Humphry Davy,
                    has been illustrated by Humboldt, and especially by Daubeny, with great
                    ingenuity; and although it has not yet arrived at the state in which, perhaps,
                    we are entitled to denominate it a <hi rend="italic">theory,</hi> it is an
                    hypothesis which affords a satisfactory explanation of the observed
                    phenomena.</p><p>All the enumerated causes have produced and are still producing changes upon the
                    surface of the globe; some of which are general, though slow in their operation,
                    whilst others act much more violently, but are more local in their effects.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Mud and air volcanoes,</hi> as they have been termed, appear to
                    owe their existence partly to the disengagement of gases by subterranean fire,
                    but in a great measure to water from a higher level, compelled to pursue a
                    subterranean course, by a thick bed of tenacious clay suddenly escaping by a
                    perpendicular fissure, with a force proportional to the height of the aqueous
                    column. An ingenious explanation of the phenomena of the mud eruptions of Sicily
                    and Italy, on this principle, is given by Dr Daubeny. One of the most noted
                    eruptions of this sort is that of <hi rend="italic">Macaluba</hi> in Sicily,
                    which in 1777 threw up a vast column of mud, mixed with stones and naphtha, and
                    the disengagement of sulphureous vapours, with much hydrogenous gases. Similar
                    eruptions occur near Catania, and also near Modena. The gaseous exhalations of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Grotta del Cane</hi> and of the lake of <hi rend="italic">An-santo</hi> in the kingdom of Naples, are probably disengaged from mineral
                    bodies by heat. The inflammable air of <hi rend="italic">Pietra</hi><hi rend="italic">Mala</hi> near Bologna, and of the <hi rend="italic">petroleum
                    wells</hi> of the country around Baku, on the western shores of the Caspian, are
                    evidently connected with subterranean fire. In the latter district there are
                    strong proofs of volcanic agency still active in the bowels of the earth. The
                    singular eruption which Μ. Figalgo saw at the northern extremity of Prince
                    William’s Sound in North America, belongs to the same class. “The Indians
                    conducted him into a plain covered with snow, where he saw great masses of ice
                    and stones <pb break="no" facs="nls:193497795" xml:id="kp-eb0717-7795-0516"/>thrown up to prodigious heights in the air with a
                    dreadful noise.” (Humboldt.)</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> VI.— <hi rend="italic">Distribution of the Waters
                    of the Globe.</hi></p><p>Natural water never exists in a state of absolute purity. When collected as it
                    descends from the atmosphere, it always contains air; and when derived from
                    springs, lakes, or rivers, it invariably contains more or less of saline
                    ingredients. Dr Henry found in spring-water between four and five per cent, of
                    its bulk of gas, of which nearly three and a half consisted of carbonic acid,
                    and the rest of atmospheric air. Besides the gases, natural waters contain the
                    following salts; muriate of soda, muriate of lime, sulphate of potassa, sulphate
                    of lime or of magnesia, carbonate of lime, and sometimes carbonate of soda. Hail
                    and snow water, when collected at a distance from habitations, contains scarcely
                    any trace of these salts. Rain-water is next in purity; but dew-water is
                    generally contaminated with vegetable matter, as well as with salts. The water
                    of springs usually abounds with these salts, and often with other ingredients.
                    River-water differs much in its purity; but when it flows through a siliceous
                    rock it is often very pure. Lakewater is subject to much contamination; but
                    often, when the lakes are deep and extensive, the water is depurated by
                    subsidence and rest; though stagnant water, when shallow, becomes contaminated
                    with vegetable and animal matter. The water of the ocean contains about three
                    per cent, of saline contents, or one thirty-third part of its weight. The
                    quantity of saline matter appears to increase slightly from the highest
                    latitudes towards the equator. The ocean, from its extent, claims our first
                    attention.</p><p>1. <hi rend="smallcaps">Ocean.</hi> —From data already given in section second,
                    we shall probably not err if we estimate the surface of the whole ocean and its
                    branches at 144,473,000 square miles. It is not so easy to arrive at a safe
                    conclusion with regard to its mean depth. Laplace and later investigators seem
                    to believe that the depths of the ocean may be in proportion to the elevation of
                    the land, and the ratio of their respective areas. Mrs Sommerville states, that
                    although it is probable that profound cavities of small extent exist in the bed
                    of the ocean, its mean depth does not exceed the mean height of the continents
                    and islands above its level. According to Lagrange, the velocity of the tidal
                    wave is a function of the depth of the channel through which it moves; and
                    recent investigations respecting the velocity of the tidal wave in these seas,
                    would lead us to infer that the mean depth of the sea around the coasts of
                    England is about 120 feet, on those of Scotland 360 feet, on the western coast
                    of Ireland 2000 feet, and in the main Atlantic 50,000 feet, or a little more
                    than nine miles and a half. The examination of the co-tidal lines on Whewell’s
                    charts would lead to the conclusion that no considerable extent of the ocean has
                    a greater depth than the Atlantic. If the depths of the ocean are indeed
                    proportional to the elevation of the land, in the ratio of their respective
                    surfaces, the greatest profundity of the oceanic abyss would be about fifteen
                    miles, and its mean depth, at a distance from the land, would vary from one to
                    five miles. If we assume four miles as its mean depth, this would give
                    577,892,000 cubic miles as the volume of the whole waters of the globe; or, if
                    we reckon it five miles in depth, the mass of waters would equal 722,365,000
                    cubic miles.</p><p>The waters of the ocean are in perpetual movement, from the effects of winds,
                    currents, and the tides. The effect of winds in agitating the ocean is chiefly
                    confined to its surface. The most powerful waves in the free sea only rise to
                    the height of a few feet; and it is highly probable, that in the profound depths
                    of the ocean, there reigns a perpetual stillness, unruffled by any movement,
                    except in as far as general currents may disturb the tranquillity of the waters.
                    The surface, acted upon by strong gales, is thrown into long ridgy waves, which
                    rise with an uniform swell, and maintain the same velocity for considerable
                    distances, the top curling in foaming surges, which are precipitated on the
                    undulating surface below, often to the great danger of the navigator. No region
                    of the ocean is subject to more violent oscillations of this nature than that
                    portion of the Atlantic termed the Bay of Biscay, when agitated by a smart gale
                    of westerly wind. Geometry has been applied to measure the velocity of waves,
                    and Lagrange estimates, that where the depth is not very great, the velocity
                    will be the same as a heavy body would acquire in descending from a height equal
                    to half the depth of the water, and that the velocity of the wave is in the
                    duplicate ratio of the depth of the channel in which the water moves. It is
                    believed, however, that the wildest tempest in the open sea does not agitate the
                    water at the depth of an hundred feet; but when waves meet with resistance, as
                    when they dash upon lofty cliffs, we have known them rise apparently in one
                    unbroken mass to the height of two hundred feet.</p><p>There are other movements of the waters of the ocean, termed <hi rend="italic">currents.</hi> The most general currents are produced by the movement of the
                    waters perpetually setting from the polar regions towards the equator, and the
                    progression of the tropical seas towards the west. Both are chiefly caused by
                    the centrifugal force of the earth’s diurnal rotation. This produces a
                    culmination of water towards the equator, and thus a current is generated
                    towards the part of the earth in most rapid motion; but the water accumulated
                    there passes off before the influence of the trade-winds; and the strength of
                    the western current is increased by the mobility of the particles of water
                    preventing the fluid immediately acquiring the velocity of that portion of the
                    earth over which it arrives in its progression towards the equator, by which it
                    will appear to have a motion from east to west, or in an opposite direction to
                    the earth’s rotation. The higher density of the sea, when it has been cooled by
                    the polar ices, will increase its tendency to displace the lighter waters, which
                    are forced westward by the constant pressure of the trade-winds, and the other
                    causes already mentioned. The currents from the north have been well described
                    by Martens, Scoresby, and other navigators. The set of the current from the
                    antarctic regions has been illustrated by the voyages of Cook, La Perouse,
                    Flinders, and others. The equatorial current becomes very apparent in the
                    Atlantic and in the Pacific, between the parallels of 30° on each side of the
                    equator. According to the best observers, it has a mean velocity of nine or ten
                    miles per day in the open sea. In the Atlantic it produces that remarkable
                    movement of the waters termed <hi rend="italic">the gzdf-stream.</hi> This
                    current passes between the West Indian islands, and sweeps along the northern
                    coasts of South America, from Cumana to the isthmus of Darien; from thence it
                    stretches toward Cape Catoche in Yucatan, and, after wheeling through the
                    Mexican Gulf, it rushes through the channel between Cuba and Florida, passing
                    between the Bahamas and the United States of North America towards Newfoundland.
                    In the latter part of its course it can be distinctly traced, not only by its
                    effect on the dead reckoning of ships, but by the superior temperature of its
                    waters, which betray its tropical origin, and by its greater depth; for it
                    appears in <hi rend="italic">a</hi> long succession of ages to have hollowed out
                    for itself a submarine channel. In the Bahama Channel it has a breadth of
                    fifteen leagues, and its waters have, in latitude 42°, a temperature of 71°
                    Fahrenheit, whilst that of the adjacent sea beyond its influence is only 63°.
                    The gulf-stream flows with diminished velocity as it proceeds northward, until
                    it is lost on the banks of Newfoundland, where it encounters the great current
                    from the arctic regions. This vast sub-marine bank, indeed, probably owes its
                    origin to the deposition of the solid particles borne along by both currents, at
                    the point where their opposing forces meet; and there can be little <pb break="no" facs="nls:193497808" xml:id="kp-eb0717-7808-0517"/>
                    doubt that the <hi rend="italic">eastern</hi> movement of the waters of the
                    Northern Atlantic is the resultant of the compound motion of these mighty
                    oceanic streams. It has been computed from the average velocity of both, that
                    the waters of the Atlantic, between the parallels of 10° and 43° north, perform
                    a circuit of about 3800 nautical leagues in thirty-four months. The retrograde
                    current preserves a general easterly direction after leaving Newfoundland; but
                    it reaches considerably farther north, for its influence frequently throws on
                    our western shores the trees and ligneous fruits of the Antilles; but the great
                    body of it is deflected to the southward at the Azores, partly by the influence
                    of the polar current from the north; and then sending a branch to enter the
                    Straits of Gibraltar, gives rise to that dangerous current which has been
                    described by Major Rennell as the cause of the frequent shipwrecks on the
                    African coast within the Canary Islands, when the mariner, by reckoning,
                    considers himself as far to the westward of Teneriffe.</p><p>Another branch of the great western current of the Atlantic appears to be
                    deflected by the peculiar form of South America, from the latitude of
                    Pernambuco, along the eastern coasts to Cape Horn; and, doubling that
                    promontory, it finds its way into the Pacific. There is also a general western
                    current in the Great Pacific. Ships are carried by this with great celerity from
                    Acapulco to the Philippine Islands; but, in returning, it is found advisable to
                    sail northwards, for the benefit of the variable winds and of the polar
                    currents. In the Southern Pacific, the polar currents, being little interrupted
                    by land, proceed with less deviation from their course than those in the
                    northern hemisphere; and hence they carry icebergs nearer to the tropical
                    regions than we ever find to the north of the equator. The western motion of the
                    waters of the Pacific is interrupted and broken by the vast chain of islands,
                    shoals, and sub-marine banks which stretch from China to New Zealand. The
                    general direction is changed or modified by the form of these lands; and the
                    vast mass of New Holland is one cause of those dangerous currents around its
                    shores which were noticed by Cook, La Perouse, and Flinders. The weakened force
                    of the general current in the Indian seas permits its interruption by the
                    variable direction of the <hi rend="italic">monsoons</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> but the current which always sets from Australia towards the Bay of
                    Bengal seems to be produced by the modifying influence of the south polar
                    current on the general equatorial current when weakened by the interruption of
                    islands. The direction of this current, finding obstacles to" its progress in a
                    north-west direction, and being resisted by the banks and islands which stretch
                    between Cape Comorin and Madagascar, is deflected to the south-west, forming the
                    current in the Mozambique Channel, and thence sweeping round the Cape of Good
                    Hope in a powerful stream, not less than forty-three leagues in breadth. The
                    entrance into this current may be ascertained by the sudden increase in the
                    temperature of the water to eight degrees beyond that of the adjacent ocean. It
                    is probably to this current that the vast shoal off the Cape, known by the name
                    of the Aguillas Bank, is to be attributed. It appears to round off upon both
                    sides, forming a bank forty leagues in breadth, and 160 leagues from east to
                    west.</p><p>The strong current through Bass’s Straits, separating New Holland from Van
                    Diemen’s Land, is but a part of the general western current; but in its passage
                    through the intricate channels between the islands, reefs, and shoals of the
                    ocean north of Australia, it is divided and modified in a thousand different
                    ways. There is another current less easily accounted for. On the western coast
                    of Africa, about thirty leagues from the land, a strong current appears to set
                    eastward in the Gulf of Guinea, and often draws ships far off their southern
                    course. It seems to be a species of eddy, produced by resistance to the polar
                    current caused by the sudden contraction of the Atlantic from the form of the
                    opposite coasts of America and Africa. These currents may be considered as
                    general; but there are other currents which, though special, are remarkably
                    constant. Of these we may notice the perpetual current which sets into the
                    Mediterranean through the Straits of Gibraltar. It occupies the middle of the
                    Straits. On either shore a less powerful and less extensive current alternates
                    with the tides; but there is a constant and powerful influx from the Atlantic
                    into the Mediterranean. A perpetual current sets out of the Baltic to the
                    Northern Ocean; and here also smaller counter-currents are found on the coasts
                    of Sweden and Jutland. Another considerable local current perpetually sets from
                    the Black Sea in the Mediterranean. The causes of these peculiarities we shall
                    afterwards explain.</p><p>Besides the motions already described, the waters of the ocean are subject to
                    alternations in the level of its surface in any particular place several times a
                    day. The rising of the water is termed <hi rend="italic">flood,</hi> the fall is
                    named <hi rend="italic">ebb-tide.</hi> The connection between the tides and the
                    moon were long observed before any theory was proposed to account for them.
                    Descartes ascribed the flood to the pressure of the moon on the earth’s
                    atmosphere; but Kepler first suggested that it might arise from the attraction
                    exerted by the moon; and this theory was confirmed and enlarged by Newton, who
                    showed how well the general phenomena might be explained on the principle of
                    universal gravitation. The theory and the phenomena are given under the article
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Astronomy</hi>; to which we refer for the explanation of
                    the two floods and two ebbs daily, how the united influence of the sun and moon
                    causes the two spring and two neap-tides during each lunation; and why the
                    highest tides of all take place about the equinoxes, when the sun and moon are
                    on the equator, and in <hi rend="italic">perigee.</hi></p><p>The phenomena of the tides accord well with the theory in the open sea; but in
                    the vicinity of land, amongst numerous islands, or in deep inland basins, their
                    regularity is affected by various causes, as the occurrence of strong gales in
                    particular directions, the form of points of land, of banks, and shoals, and the
                    mechanical influence of narrow channels. Thus the tides of the German Ocean take
                    twelve hours to reach London bridge; and consequently the time of high-water
                    there is just as a new flood is commencing in that sea. The usual rise of the
                    tides in mid-ocean is about three or four feet; but on the coasts of Britain,
                    especially in the mouths of rivers, the attraction of the land raises them far
                    higher. Thus, at Chepstow, the tide rises from forty-five to sixty feet; and it
                    is recorded that once, froip the influence of a strong gale blowing at the same
                    time into Bristol Channel, the rise was seventy feet. In the river of Annapolis,
                    which falls into the bay of Fundy, on the coast of America, the spring-tides
                    have been known to reach the surprising height of 120 feet. In such cases the
                    flood-tide often rushes in with a vast mass, like a huge wave, several feet
                    above the general surface, which is termed a <hi rend="italic">bore,</hi> and is
                    dangerous to ships that may have been stranded on the receding of the tide.
                    Something similar is often seen in our smaller rivers, and on such extensive
                    flat sands as those in Morecamb Bay on the coast of Lancashire, and in the
                    SolwayjFrith. In narrow straits the tide runs with great velocity, such as no
                    ship can stem even with the most favourable breeze. In the embouchure of the
                    Mersey, the ebb-tide has a rate of five or six miles an hour. In the Pentland
                    Frith, between Caithness and the Orkney Islands, the spring-tides have a
                    velocity of nine miles an hour.</p><p>Whirlpools appear to be occasioned by currents meeting with sub-marine obstacles,
                    which throw them into gyration. When the movement is rapid, the centre is the
                    most depressed portion of the rotating circle, and objects drawn within it are
                    submerged in that point. Several small whirlpools, capable of whirling round a
                    boat, are seen among the Orkney Islands. That of Coryvrechan, in the narrow
                    channel between Scarba and Jura, in the Western Islands, is <pb break="no" facs="nls:193497821" xml:id="kp-eb0717-7821-0518"/>caused by a
                    rock of a conical form rising abruptly from the bottom, where the depth is 600
                    feet, and reaching to within ninety feet of the surface. This obstruction, in a
                    tortuous rocky channel, causes a succession of eddies; and when the flood-tide
                    sets in, with a fresh breeze in the opposite direction, the eddying waters rise
                    in short heavy waves, which are highly dangerous to boats, and even to decked
                    vessels.</p><p>The Malstrom on the coast of Norway, near the island of Moskoe, is a whirlpool of
                    a similar kind, the perils of which are probably much exaggerated. The
                    flood-tide setting from the south-west amongst the Laffoden Isles, especially
                    when it meets with a strong gale from the north-west, produces a great agitation
                    of the waves, and a whirlpool is formed, the roaring of which is heard at the
                    distance of many miles. Its agitated vortices are dangerous to vessels, and it
                    is said that seals and whales, when caught within its eddies, are unable to
                    extricate themselves from destruction.</p><p>It is now well ascertained that Charybdis, in the Strait of Messina, owes its
                    terrors to the imagination of seamen in the infancy of navigation, and all its
                    celebrity to poetic fancy.</p><p>The sea, when viewed near land, has its colour affected by the nature of the
                    bottom. Where the bottom is sandy, and the depth not very considerable, it has a
                    greenish tint; and this is the general hue of the German Ocean; but when viewed
                    out of soundings, the colour of the ocean is generally of a beautiful deep blue.
                    This may be considered as the natural hue of a deep column of water, from which
                    only the most refrangible colours reach the eye of the spectator placed on a
                    ship’s deck; and the greenish tint is produced by the mingling of this hue with
                    the yellowish tint of the sandy bottom. Sometimes partial colours are observed
                    in the ocean. Captain Cook and other navigators describe a brown colour of the
                    sea, produced by myriads of minute mollusea and Crustacea. In the Greenland
                    seas, the waters in which the whales chiefly delight are streaked with green.
                    This colour appears in broad streams in the sea; and, when examined by Scoresby,
                    was found to be produced by innumerable medusae and minute Crustacea, the
                    olive-green water containing sixty-four in one cubic inch. Captain Horsburgh
                    mentions a milky appearance of the sea, observed in a passage from China to
                    Australia, which was occasioned by minute globular bodies linked together, and
                    doubtless forming some species of <hi rend="italic">beroe</hi> or <hi rend="italic">medusa.</hi> The occasional red colour of the sea on the coast of
                    Brazil and of China is believed to proceed from minute mollusea which float in
                    myriads in the waters at certain seasons of the year. Ehrenberg asserts that the
                    name of <hi rend="italic">Red Sea</hi> has been given to that gulf from the
                    prevalence of a species of <hi rend="italic">oscillatoria.</hi></p><p>The phosphorescence of the sea is a very brilliant appearance which the ocean and
                    arms of the sea frequently assume. It is best seen when a vessel is in brisk
                    motion through the waves, or when a boat is impelled by oars through a calm sea.
                    We have seen this appearance so brilliant that we could distinguish letters in a
                    book by its phosphorescence in the wake of a ship, where it will sometimes form
                    a line of pale lambent light several hundred yards in length. We have also seen
                    from the deck, by its light, the hour on a watch, when in other situations on
                    the deck we could not distinguish the features of the seamen. When the hand is
                    immersed in luminous water, we have found the shining “particles adhering to the
                    fingers; and on examining such water in a globular glass vessel by transmitted
                    light, we scarcely ever failed to observe in it several minute animals of the
                    genera <hi rend="italic">medusa</hi> and <hi rend="italic">beroe.</hi> These
                    animals appeared to have tire power of emitting light by their own efforts, as
                    the water, when left at rest, shone by fits. On counting their number in a glass
                    of water, and suddenly dashing it on the deck, in a dark night, it was observed
                    that the number of luminous points generally coincided with that of the animals
                    in the water, and never exceeded it. We have found these animals in sea-water,
                    from 60° to 37° north latitude, in the Atlantic, and in innumerable bays; and
                    believe that they are very general in the ocean.</p><p>The dependence of the phosphorescence of the sea on living animals was long ago
                    asserted by Captain Cook and Sir Joseph Banks. In the voyage from the Canaries
                    to Rio de Janeiro they drew a net through luminous water, and caught a large
                    medusa, which shone brilliantly when taken on board; they obtained from it also
                    three minute <hi rend="italic">Crustacea,</hi> about one tenth the size of the
                    glow-worm, which also were very luminous in the dark. Banks named the first <hi rend="italic">Medusa pellucens,</hi> and the most brilliant of the second <hi rend="italic">Cancerfulgens.</hi> Other naturalists have enlarged the list of
                    marine luminous animals, which includes occasional instances amongst the larger
                    fishes.</p><p>A considerable number of experiments have been made on the temperature of the
                    ocean by Ellis, Piron, Flinders, Parry, Ross, and others; but the results are
                    not uniform. Ellis found in the Atlantic that the temperature remained
                    stationary at 50° at depths a little exceeding a mile. Piron, who had sounded to
                    greater depths, found it to decrease with the depth. The mean temperature of the
                    ocean at the surface, and at a distance from land, is higher than that of the
                    atmosphere with which it is in contact; but it is generally lower than the air
                    at mid-day, and, higher than the atmosphere at midnight. The ocean over a bank
                    is colder than where it is of great depth. This is ascribed to cold currents
                    being forced upwards by the obstruction; but whatever be the cause, the fact is
                    important, as it may enable a seaman to recognise his approach to land when the
                    atmosphere is obscure and his reckoning doubtful, as was first remarked by Mr
                    Williams.</p><p>The Southern Ocean, receiving less fresh water than the Atlantic, is rather
                    salter, as is also the Mediterranean; but the Baltic, White and Black Seas, from
                    the size of the rivers they receive, are fresher. According to Marcet their
                    specific gravities are as follows:</p><p>Mediterranean 1∙02930</p><p>Southern Ocean P02882</p><p>Northern Ocean 1*02829</p><p>Arctic Frozen Ocean I∙02664</p><p>White Sea 1∙01901</p><p>Baltic 1∙01523</p><p>Euxine 1∙01418</p><p>Sea-water has a mean specific gravity of 1∙0280 to dis tilled water as 1∙0000.
                    The late Dr John Murray published an admirable analysis of sea-water, 10,000
                    parts of which afforded him</p><p>Muriate of soda 24-5∙04</p><p>Muriate of magnesia 28∙63</p><p>Muriate of lime 0∙00</p><p>Sulphate of magnesia 17∙04</p><p>Sulphate of soda 2 ’ 66</p><p>Sulphate of lime 9∙72</p><p>303∙9</p><p>Dr Murray detected no trace of muriate of lime, which Lavoisier has stated as
                    high as 20∙38, and Pfaff at 31∙25. In reflecting upon these discrepancies, he
                    was led to conclude that several of the products obtained may be the results of
                    the mutual decomposition of the salts during the processes for separating them
                    from the water; thus the sulphates of magnesia and of lime would be decomposed
                    by muriate of soda, and when both are obtained from sea-water, we should regard
                    them as results of decomposition. The real ingredients of sea-water would thus
                    be,</p><p>Muriate of soda 220∙01</p><p>Muriate of magnesia 33∙16</p><p>Sulphate of soda 42∙08</p><p>Muriate of lime 7∙84</p><p>303∙9 <pb break="no" facs="nls:193497834" xml:id="kp-eb0717-7834-0519"/>This doctrine he has happily applied to explain
                    the activity of several mineral waters, the analysis of which only affords inert
                    ingredients.</p><p>The saline contents of the ocean do not appear to vary considerably; they,
                    however, increase as we approach to the equator, from <hi rend="subscript">
                    3</hi> ⅛ to <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> ⅛, as is proved by the increase of
                    density. The numerous experiments of Bladh of Sweden proved that the specific
                    gravity of the waters of the Atlantic on both sides of the equator increase as
                    they recede from the poles. This table was republished by Kirwan in the
                    Geological Essays, with a reduction of the specific gravity to temperature 62°
                    Fahrenheit. The longitudes of Bladh are from the meridian of Teneriffe.</p><table><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell cols="2" role="data" rows="1"><p>Latitude.</p></cell><cell cols="2" role="data" rows="1"><p>Longitude.</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Sp.

                    different parts of the Atlantic, from 53° to 6° N., which also show a
                    progressive increase in the specific gravity of the ocean towards the equator,
                    and likewise as the depth increases.</p><p>Lat 47° 47' N.

                    it into two kinds, <hi rend="italic">field</hi> and <hi rend="italic">mountain
                    ice.</hi> Field-ice has a thickness of from two to three or four fathoms. He
                    mentions single fields 100 miles in length and fifty in medial breadth, with a
                    general elevation above the water of from four to six feet. When the ice is of
                    smaller extent it is termed a <hi rend="italic">fiae.</hi> Mr Scoresby found the
                    specific gravity of ice to sea-water to be as 8 to 8∙97, or nearly as 8 to 9, so
                    that ice floats in sea-water with ½th above water; and a field which has six
                    feet above water will have forty-eight feet below it, if the ice be of uniform
                    thickness. When a field or floe is exposed to the dashing of the waves,
                    especially to what is called a ground-swell, it is speedily broken up; but the
                    pieces are apt to collect into what is termed a <hi rend="italic">pack,</hi>
                    when from the mast-head no opening can be discovered in it. In smaller
                    collections it forms <hi rend="italic">patches.</hi> The ice is <hi rend="italic">loose</hi> or <hi rend="italic">open</hi> when ships can pass
                    between the fragments of floes or packs. By the collision of pieces of ice, the
                    fragments are often heaped on the larger portions, and form <hi rend="italic">hummocks,</hi> which are thus sometimes raised thirty feet above the general
                    level of the ice. Some ocean-ice is whitish and porous. This affords only a
                    brackish water; for though freezing separates the salt from the ice, the salt
                    water is retained in its pores, and the water yielded is not potable; but ice
                    which looks blackish whilst swimming has a solid consistence, a beautiful
                    beryl-green hue in the air, and when melted affords a potable water, a fact of
                    great importance to navigators in high latitudes. Sea-ice assumes different
                    appearances, according as it is formed in smooth or in rough water. The first
                    process in freezing is the formation of minute prisms; when these form in smooth
                    water, they speedily unite into sheets of ice, which in twenty-four hours of
                    keen frost will attain a thickness of two or three inches, and in forty-eight
                    hours will be able to bear the weight of a man. This sort often forms in the
                    interstices of fields, and is termed <hi rend="italic">bay-ice.</hi> It
                    sometimes increases to three feet in thickness. When the congelation takes place
                    in rougher water, the crystals of ice accumulate, rendering the water sluggish;
                    and this is termed by sailors <hi rend="italic">sludge.</hi> When the motion of
                    the waves prevents the concretion into larger masses, it forms what sailors term
                    <hi rend="italic">pancakes,</hi> which generally attain the thickness of a foot.
                    Both these sorts of ice are termed <hi rend="italic">young ice,</hi> to
                    distinguish them from the more solid <hi rend="italic">field-ice.</hi> They
                    often rapidly form around ships engaged in the whale fishery, till no open water
                    can be seen from the mast-head; and they often disappear, from the effects of
                    gales or currents, with an almost magical celerity. The heaviest ice is liable
                    to disruption by the waves, especially when detached from the shores, and when
                    the fields are carried by currents into the open sea. Through the openings thus
                    produced, Scoresby penetrated in one voyage as far north as 81° 30' N. between
                    Spitzbergen and Greenland; and at another time reached the long-lost eastern
                    coast of Greenland, which he surveyed to the extent of 800 miles. The drifting
                    of fields of ice is a proof of the existence of currents from the circumpolar
                    regions. Scoresby mentions that he has seen a field drift 100 miles to the south
                    in a month, although the wind had been very variable during that time. When
                    ice-fields drift they often acquire a rotatory motion, which brings them into
                    collision with other fields; the crushing of the weaker ice is attended with an
                    awful noise; and the utmost presence of mind in the mariner is often required to
                    extricate his vessel from the encounter of such irresistible forces. <hi rend="italic">Mountain-ice</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Iceberg</hi> is the term
                    applied to those enormous masses of ice that are more common in Baffin’s Bay
                    than in any other part of the northern seas, and are also very frequent in the
                    Great Southern Ocean. It is now generally believed that they are glaciers
                    originally formed on the cliffs of lofty islands or in abrupt valleys, where
                    their lower part being undermined by the waves, in process of time they thus
                    become detached from the land, and float about, as impelled by currents. Some of
                    the icebergs seen in Davis’ Straits have an area of five or six square miles,
                    rise 100 feet above the surface, and are aground in water of 100 fathoms; from
                    which data we calculate, that such enormous masses weigh more than two thousand
                    millions of tons.. Icebergs assume most fantastic shapes, as may be seen in
                    Captain<pb break="no" facs="nls:193497847" xml:id="kp-eb0717-7847-0520"/> Ross’s and Captain Parry’s Voyages. Large
                    icebergs can only be produced where there is deep water close to the cliffs on
                    which they are formed; and this is probably the reason why they abound in Davis’
                    Straits. In the Southern Ocean icebergs have been said occasionally to be 200
                    feet above the surface, and Forster describes them as composed of layers of
                    different coloured ice. It is dangerous to approach some icebergs, still more to
                    make fast to them; for sometimes they suddenly split into a thousand pieces,
                    with a thundering explosion, as if they were of unannealed glass; at other times
                    they suddenly lose their equilibrium, and are overturned by the wasting of the
                    submerged parts, whilst the upper portion has lost little of its weight.
                    Icebergs have been wafted by currents and storms far from their native seats.
                    Occasionally they have been encountered in the Atlantic, in latitude 40° north;
                    but in the southern hemisphere they have been frequently seen as low as 35°. The
                    <hi rend="italic">Ice-blink</hi> is one of those singular effects of
                    extraordinary refraction, by which die existence of open water is often
                    recognised, though it really be beyond the limits of direct vision.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Scoresby’s Arctic Regions,
                    and Ross’s and Parry’s Voyages</p></note></p><p>The polar ices appear to be subject to periodical increase and diminution,
                    depending on causes not yet perfectly understood. One of the last and most
                    remarkable disruptions of the arctic ice is that described by Scoresby. That
                    able philosopher has traced the usual boundary of the firm ice in close and open
                    seasons; and during one of those periodical disruptions/in which more than two
                    thousand square leagues of ice had broken up, he was enabled to penetrate
                    through the boundary, which had seemingly remained undisturbed for four
                    centuries. Large, however, as this quantity disrupted seems, it is a very small
                    part of the whole polar ices. Leslie computed that a total eclipse of the sun
                    for a single hour deprives our planet of as much heat as would be capable of
                    melting a circle of ice 500 miles in diameter and 150 feet in thickness, which
                    he estimates to be sixty times the extent of what is annually melted in the
                    Greenland Seas; yet the effect of a total eclipse of the sun does not cool the
                    atmosphere more than 3° of the thermometer. We cannot, then, ascribe any
                    important influence on our climate to the melting of this portion of the polar
                    ices.</p><p>2. <hi rend="smallcaps">Inland Seas.</hi> —A few of the inland seas yet remain to
                    be noticed. We begin with the <hi rend="italic">Baltic.</hi> This sea differs
                    from the arms of the ocean already mentioned, by its comparative freshness, by
                    its want of tides, and by its sending a current continually into the German Sea.
                    Its freshness arises from the number and size of the rivers it receives, in
                    proportion to its extent. It is a narrow, irregular sea, the extreme length of
                    which is about 1200 miles, with a mean breadth of about 140 miles. This will not
                    give an area of 70,000 square miles, and its mean depth is only about sixty
                    fathoms. Yet it receives forty considerable rivers, and the waters of
                    innumerable lakes, which are the drainage of a country five times as extensive
                    as its whole surface. The immense influx of fresh water into such a small basin,
                    from which evaporation is but slow for a large portion of the year, sufficiently
                    accounts both for its deficiency of salt and for the out-going current. The want
                    of regular tides in the Baltic is a consequence of the same causes that operate
                    in all confined collections of water having narrow communications with the
                    ocean, viz. that the moon must act almost equally on all parts of its surface at
                    the same time, and the oceanic tidal-wave, obstructed by the sinuosities of the
                    narrow channel, only penetrates a little way into the three passages which lead
                    into theBaltic.</p><p>The <hi rend="italic">Mediterranean</hi> is the noblest and most remarkable
                    inland sea on the face of our earth. A strong current is perpetually setting
                    into the Mediterranean through the Straits of Gibraltar, especially in the
                    centre; and although there be an eddy on each side, this reflux is far inferior
                    to the quantity flowing in from the Atlantic. This inland sea, which is 2350
                    miles in length, with a breadth varying from 100 to 650 miles, covers an area of
                    about 1,000,000 of square miles. Its depth is much more considerable near the
                    Straits than that of the adjacent Atlantic. The fine hydrographical chart of Don
                    Vincente Tofiño de San Miguel, republished in this country with additions by
                    Captain W. H. Smyth, R. N., shows, that from the longitude of Cape Trafalgar,
                    where the Atlantic is from fifty to sixty fathoms, the channel deepens as we
                    proceed upwards, until, a little within Gibraltar, it is a thousand fathoms
                    deep, and soon after is beyond soundings. It is also very deep towards its
                    eastern extremity. Between Sicily and Africa its depth varies from a hundred to
                    thirty fathoms; so that there exists in that part of the sea a submarine chain
                    or shoal, which may be considered as an extension of the rock-formations of
                    Italy and Sicily, with deep water on either hand. Besides the perpetual current
                    from the Atlantic, it receives the surplus waters of the Euxine, by the constant
                    stream passing through the strait of the Dardanelles. These immense additions
                    appear necessary to supply the enormous evaporation from its surface. It has
                    been remarked, that the rivers which fall into it are the contributions of a
                    smaller extent of territory than the river-domain of any other inland sea, in
                    proportion to its area; for they are to each other rather less than one and a
                    half to one. Some have contended that there is a current below that setting in
                    from the Atlantic. The only fact offered in proof is stated to have happened in
                    1712. A Dutch merchantman, laden with wine and brandy, was sunk by a broadside
                    from a French privateer in mid-channel, and a few days afterwards the ship and
                    cargo were cast on shore near Cape Spartel, twelve miles below where the
                    accident happened; but the nature of the cargo probably prevented the complete
                    sinking of the vessel, and she may have drifted within the range of the outgoing
                    current on the African shore. The eastward slope of the bottom of the strait
                    would certainly favour the ingress of the cooler waters of the Atlantic into the
                    Mediterranean, and afford an argument against the existence of this alleged
                    under-current.</p><p>There is, however, no need of the hypothesis of a counter-current to explain the
                    preservation of the level of this sea, notwithstanding that it receives several
                    large rivers, and a perpetual supply from the Euxine and the ocean; since Dr
                    Halley has shown, that the amount of evaporation from its extensive surface, in
                    so warm a latitude, is sufficient to preserve its level unchanged.</p><p>Tides are but little felt in the Mediterranean. They are only sensible in certain
                    parts of that sea, and seldom rise to six inches above the mean level; but, in
                    the Straits of Messina, the form of the land, and the peculiar set of the
                    currents, give them a more considerable range. These tides, however, are
                    irregular, and are liable to be affected greatly by the direction and force of
                    the winds. The want of considerable tides in the Mediterranean kept the Romans
                    ignorant of the extent of ebbs and floods, and caused them several disasters
                    when they carried their arms to the shores of Western Europe. Even in the time
                    of Tacitus they were imperfectly acquainted with the currents produced by the
                    tides around the northern coasts of Scotland, the difficulty of stemming which
                    the historian ascribes to a “mare pigrum, remigantibus infestissimum.”</p><p>That large inland sea the <hi rend="italic">Euxine</hi><hi rend="italic                     subscript"> y</hi> with its branch the Sea of Azof, has somewhat of the
                    characters of the North American lakes in its comparative freshness, which is
                    one cause of the duration of ice on waters that have the same latitude as the
                    finest regions of Italy and France. The surface<pb break="no" facs="nls:193497860" xml:id="kp-eb0717-7860-0521"/> of the Euxine
                    and the Seaof Azof is estimated as equal to 170,000 square miles; but as they
                    receive some of the largest rivers in Europe, and smaller streams from Asia, the
                    drainage of an extent of country equal to five times their own surface, we see a
                    strong reason why there should be a constant efflux through the Bosporus. This
                    current in the Thracian Bosporus has generally a velocity of from three to five
                    miles an hour, according to the direction and force of the wind. Before this
                    outlet was formed, the Euxine probably united with the Caspian, and constituted
                    an hyperborean sea on the plains of Russia, and the provinces on the Lower
                    Danube; and most probably the floods of Deucalion and Ogyges were connected with
                    <hi rend="italic">debacles</hi> arising from disruptions of the barrier of this
                    sea.</p><p>According to Pallas, there arc traces of the former union of the <hi rend="italic">Caspian</hi> with the Euxine, in the saline marshy ground and
                    numerous lakes which intersperse the flat countries of Ulagann-Ternik, Alabuga,
                    and Byeloe. The present Caspian is below the level of the Euxine. From
                    barometrical measurements, Parrot stated its surface to be 300 feet below the
                    level of that sea; but the recent trigonometrical levelling of Fuss, Sabler, and
                    Sawitch, which has been conducted with the utmost care, reduces this depression
                    to 101∙2 feet. Its length is about 700 miles, and its breadth about 210, which
                    would give it an area of 147,000 square miles. It has a very unequal bottom.
                    Hanway states, that in some places 450 fathoms of line could not reach the
                    bottom; but in other places it abounds in shallows, which render its navigation
                    perilous, independently of the sudden storms to which it is liable. It is
                    without tides; but its shores are subject to irregular floods, from the size and
                    number of its rivers, and the direction of the winds. It is extremely salt, and
                    abounds with fish; amongst which the most important is the isinglass sturgeon,
                    and the sterlet <hi rend="italic">(Ac-cipenser huso,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">A. Rutkenus).</hi> Several species of <hi rend="italic">Salmo</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Cyprinus,</hi> and a species of herring, are numerous; and there
                    arc extensive fisheries of several kinds of seals. How seals found their way
                    into this inland sea, unless at one time it communicated with the ocean, we
                    cannot easily explain.</p><p>The <hi rend="italic">Sea of Aral</hi> seems once to have communicated with the
                    Caspian, from the similarity of their fishes, and the numerous salt lakes and
                    marshes that still crowd the intervening space, especially towards the northern
                    extremity. The Sea of Aral is 200 miles by 100, and therefore has an area of
                    about 20,000 square miles. It is extremely salt, though it receives several very
                    large rivers, particularly the Sihon and Gihon, the ancient Jaxartes and
                    Oxus.</p><p>The inland sea or lake called <hi rend="italic">Baikal</hi> differs from those
                    already mentioned in being perfectly fresh. Its length is 360 miles, and its
                    breadth forty; so that its area is about 14,400 square miles, including the
                    islands which it contains. This lake or sea is remarkable for its green tint,
                    and the very great inequalities of its bottom. In some parts its depth is
                    asserted to be more than 3000 feet, but then the water suddenly shoals to 150
                    feet. Considering the mass of water it receives from the rivers Bargazin,
                    Selinga, Angara, and many less considerable tributaries, and that its only
                    visible outlet is the Lower Angara, which is not capable of discharging above a
                    tenth of the water poured into this sea, it is conceived by some geographers,
                    that evaporation, in a climate where the whole surface is annually frozen for
                    five months, could not carry off the surplus, and that therefore the Baikal must
                    have some secret outlet, by which its superfluous waters may reach the ocean.
                    The same difficulty occurs here as with the Caspian and the Aral. How could the
                    seals which it contains have been introduced? They are extremely numerous in its
                    northern part, and as many as two thousand have been killed in one year. Of the
                    fishes, the <hi rend="italic">omul,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Salmo</hi><hi rend="italic">migratorius,</hi> is the most important in an economical point of
                    view; but it also contains <hi rend="italic">S. salvelinus, S.
                    oxyrliinchus,</hi> the carp, the tench, the sterlet, and the isinglass sturgeon.
                    One fish is peculiar to this sea, <hi rend="italic">Calyonymus Baikalxnsis,</hi>
                    which occurs in such quantities as to corrupt the air by its putrefaction on the
                    shores after storms, to which this sea is very liable. There are many
                    appearances of volcanic fire in the vicinity of the Baikal. It is probable that
                    the surface of the waters of this inland sea once stood on a higher level than
                    at present, and that thus the salmon and the seal might have been able to
                    surmount the rapids of the Yenisei, or have found their way into the Baikal by
                    the channel of the Lena.</p><p>The <hi rend="italic">Red Sea</hi> is the only other Asiatic sea which we shall
                    here notice particularly. It is a long arm of the ocean, extending between Asia
                    and Africa for nearly 1500 miles, whilst its medial breadth is not above 100
                    miles. Until Lord Valentia’s voyage, our charts of this sea were very imperfect,
                    and much still remains to be done; but his lordship has established the
                    important point of the superior depth of the western side, although the general
                    depth is inconsiderable. These peculiarities of its form give it more the
                    character of a river than of an arm of the ocean; a circumstance which, with the
                    position of its strait in the direction of the tidal wave from the Arabian Sea,
                    makes it subject to very considerable tides, especially in its lower part;
                    whilst their rise is not prevented by the influx of any river. The less powerful
                    influence of shape, and the influx of the united streams of the Euphrates and
                    Tigris, tend to diminish the height of the tides in the <hi rend="italic">Persian Gulf,</hi> another inland sea, about half the length of the Red
                    Sea.</p><p>The <hi rend="italic">Tchad,</hi> an inland sea of fresh water, is one of the
                    most considerable of the kind in the world; and constitutes that <hi rend="italic">Bahr el Soudan,</hi> so long considered as the common receptacle
                    of the rivers of Central Africa. The discoveries of Denham and Clapperton prove
                    that it is one of the grandest features in the kingdom of Bornou. It seems to be
                    not less than 200 miles in length by 150 in breadth; but in the rainy season it
                    becomes greatly enlarged, and encroaches on its flat shores. It is principally
                    fed by the rivers Shary and Yeou. The former flows from the south into the lake,
                    and is a noble, rapid river, half a mile in width. The latter, once supposed to
                    be the Niger, comes from the west, but is not considerable.</p><p>We have already noticed the general direction of the equinoctial current into the
                    <hi rend="italic">Gulf of Mexico</hi> from which it has obtained the name of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Gulf Stream.</hi> The eddying of this current in the great
                    inland basin, the prevalence of the trade-winds, and the enormous quantity of
                    mud brought down by the Mississippi and the less important tributary streams
                    descending from the Mexican Sierra Madre, are, according to Humboldt, rapidly
                    filling up the gulf. The eastern coast of Mexico from 18° to 26° north latitude,
                    abounds with bars, over which large vessels cannot pass; and, far inland, that
                    distinguished traveller found banks filled with sea-shells but little changed.
                    Were the Isthmus of Darien annihilated, the equinoctial stream would pass round
                    the globe; and this change would probably, ere long, place the feeble
                    governments of Japan and China at the mercy of some European conqueror.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Hudsons Sea,</hi> improperly called a bay, is during a great
                    part of tire year encumbered with ice. This basin is almost three times larger
                    than the Baltic, comprehending an area of about 500,000 square miles. It is
                    inhabited by some kinds of cetacea, especially the Greenland whale and the
                    beluga.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Baffin’s Sea</hi> is now found to communicate with the polar
                    sea by several openings. Its extent, if we include Davis’s Straits to the
                    latitude of Cape Farewell, is only inferior, as an inland sea, to the
                    Mediterranean. It is locked up for a considerable period of the year in
                    impenetrable ice; but in the summer months the ice is broken up, and partially
                    carried off by a strong current, which is continually setting down <pb break="no" facs="nls:193497873" xml:id="kp-eb0717-7873-0522"/>
                    through the strait. The centre of that sea, however, is occupied either by a
                    series of rocky islands, or by shoals, on which vast icebergs are perpetually
                    grounded. Its desolate shores have been much frequented by our whale fishers, on
                    account of the multitudes of the <hi rend="italic">balaena mysticetus</hi> that
                    resort to this inlet.</p><p>Buffon has justly termed North America the country of <hi rend="italic">lakes</hi> or <hi rend="italic">oξfresh-water seas.</hi> Commencing in the
                    north with <hi rend="italic">Great Bear Lake,</hi> we may trace a connection by
                    means of minor lakes to <hi rend="italic">Slave Lake,</hi> a vast sea of fresh
                    water, about 200 miles in length and 100 in breadth. This last lake communicates
                    with the Arctic Ocean by Mackenzie’s River, and with <hi rend="italic">Alhabasca
                    Lake</hi> by Slave River. A chain of smaller lakes conducts thence to <hi rend="italic">Winnipeg,</hi> which is scarcely inferior to Slave Lake in extent
                    of surface. Advancing to the south-east, we arrive at <hi rend="italic">Lake
                    Superior,</hi> which, with the <hi rend="italic">Michigan</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Huron,</hi> may be considered as forming the great inland sea of
                    Canada. Lake Superior has an extreme length of 380 miles, a breadth of 161, and
                    a circumference of 1525 miles; the coasts are rocky, and its depth, in some
                    points, is 1200 feet, but its mean depth may be about 900 feet; and its surface
                    is 641 feet above the sea. The Huron communicates with the Michigan by a channel
                    four miles in length; it is 250 miles in length, varies from sixty to 180 miles
                    in breadth, and has a circumference of 1100 miles. The Michigan is 262 miles in
                    length by 55 in breadth, and has a circumference of 915 miles. The mean depth of
                    the three lakes is 900 feet, which shows that their bottom is 300 feet below the
                    level of the ocean. Their whole surface is computed at 72,930 square miles. We
                    have already pointed out the danger to the whole valley of the Mississippi,
                    should earthquakes ever burst the rocky barrier at the southern extremity of the
                    Michigan.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Lake Erie</hi> is connected with the Huron by a narrow channel,
                    which expands into <hi rend="italic">Lake St Clair,</hi> and again contracts ere
                    it reaches the lower lake. Erie is 230 miles in length, about sixty in breadth
                    where it is widest, and about thirty-five at the mean. It differs from the upper
                    lakes by its comparative shallowness, the mean depth not exceeding 120 feet.
                    From many observations, it would appear that Lake Erie is rapidly filling up.
                    Long Point, at the Big Creek, is stated to have advanced three miles in three
                    years, in consequence of the <hi rend="italic">alluvion</hi> carried into the
                    lake by its numerous rivers. The connection of this lake with that of <hi rend="italic">Ontario</hi> is by the river Niagara. The difference in level
                    between the lakes is 330 feet; and, after the river has passed down twenty-one
                    miles, it suddenly precipitates itself over the celebrated cataracts of Niagara,
                    in a fall with a depth of 160 feet. It then flows for seven miles through a deep
                    rocky chasm to Queenstown, where the country suddenly sinks; and it flows seven
                    miles farther, through a champaign country, to Lake Ontario, another fresh-water
                    sea, 171 miles in length and about sixty in breadth. The lakes above the falls
                    abound with many kinds of fish, as salmon, sturgeons, several species of <hi rend="italic">cyprinus,</hi> &amp;c. The five last-mentioned seas or lakes are
                    computed to have an area of 70,000 or 80,000 square miles.</p><p>3. <hi rend="smallcaps">Lakes.—</hi> Several of the large collections of water
                    already mentioned have been considered as <hi rend="italic">lakes;</hi> but that
                    designation properly belongs to those less considerable bodies of water which we
                    arè now to notice. Many lakes are salt; and of such, a considerable number exist
                    in Asia. The most celebrated salt lake in that quarter is the <hi rend="italic">Dead Sea,</hi> or Lake Asphaltites. Independently of the account in the sacred
                    Scriptures relating to the destruction of the cities of the plain the site of
                    which is now occupied by this lake, the nature of the surrounding country bears
                    evident traces of the ravages of fire in remote ages. The frowning cliffs on its
                    eastern shore are evidently volcanic, thermal waters occur near them, the
                    country around is often to this day shaken by earthquakes, and asphaltum is yet
                    collected on its shores. Some have supposed it the crater of a volcano. The lake
                    is much more saline than the ocean; and although the waters are limpid, their
                    specific gravity is 1∙2110. Mr Gordon attests their great buoyancy, and an
                    analysis of the waters by Dr Marcet shows that they contain one fourth of their
                    weight of salts. An hundred parts of water yielded,</p><p>Muriate of lime 3∙920</p><p>Muriate of magnesia 10∙246</p><p>Muriate of soda 10∙360</p><p>Sulphate of lime 0 ’ 054</p><p>24∙580</p><p>This saltness of the Dead Sea is evidently owing to the abundance of salt in its
                    vicinity, which all the streams falling into it perpetually deposit in this
                    lake. Although the waters of the Jordan, the most considerable of these, are
                    nearly tasteless, and do not contain above one three-hundredth of their weight
                    of salts, the latter are of the same kinds as are obtained from the waters of
                    the Dead Sea; and it is easy to imagine how this constant supply of saline
                    matter to a lake of narrow dimensions, without any visible outlet, must produce
                    an accumulation of salt, which cannot pass off by evaporation. On the western
                    shores of this lake are the ruins of considerable edifices, and still more
                    ancient remains are said to be covered by its waters.</p><p>Messrs G. Moore and Beck have very lately proved, by the temperature at which
                    water boils, that the surface of the Dead Sea is 500 feet lower than that of the
                    Mediterranean; and the correctness of this estimate they confirmed by the
                    barometrical results of Professor Schubert of Munich, which give 500 feet as the
                    depression of the Lake of Tiberias, and 598 feet as that of the Dead Sea.</p><p>The no less celebrated <hi rend="italic">Lake of Gennesareth,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Sea of Tiberias,</hi> is still smaller. According to Ali Bey, it
                    is only seven leagues in length by two in breadth. It is embosomed in lofty
                    mountains of a volcanic character, amongst which Mount Thabor is pre-eminent.
                    Ali Bey considers this lake as the crater of an ancient volcano; and the nature
                    of the rocks around, and the thermal springs of Tiberias, favour the idea of the
                    volcanic nature of the country.</p><p>The want of any outlet, and the influx of rivers passing through a very saline
                    soil, are the causes of the saltness of the considerable lakes of <hi rend="italic">Van</hi> in Armenia, and of <hi rend="italic">Ourrnia</hi> in
                    Persia. The former has a circumference of 168 miles; and its waters, though

                    saltest of any known lake. Its waters are stated to contain thirty-two per cent,
                    of salt; and the sinking of the waters, during the dry season of the year,
                    leaves a thick crust of salt on its shores, which at some points extends a
                    considerable distance into the lake. There are many other lakes of considerable
                    size in Central Asia; many of them are salt; but the most singular is that in
                    Thibet, which produces tin cal or borax, a substance which is imported in flat
                    prismatic crystals into Europe; where it undergoes purification.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Lakes of America.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> If North
                    America be the country of lakes, South America is remarkably deficient in them.
                    That of <hi rend="italic">Titicaca,</hi> in Upper Peru, already noticed, is the
                    only considerable one in the southern division of the new world. It is true,
                    that in the rainy season, the mighty rivers which water the plains of central
                    South America inundate the low country to an immense extent, converting it into
                    seas with a prodigious area, but of small depth; and it appears that inundations
                    of this sort gave rise to the fable of the <hi rend="italic">Lake of
                    Parima,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">El Dorado.</hi></p><p>The Mexican lakes are more remarkable for their elevation of 7450 feet above the
                    sea than for their extent. They are essentially saline, being more salt than the
                    Baltic. The specific gravity of the waters of <hi rend="italic">Tezcuco</hi> is
                    l∙0215, and the impregnation is derived from a soil containing muriate <pb break="no" facs="nls:193497886" xml:id="kp-eb0717-7886-0523"/> of
                    soda and carbonate of soda. These lakes have diminished since the Spanish
                    conquest, and the capital is no longer in the lake, but connected with it by a
                    canal. The natural decrease of these lakes has been accelerated by the felling
                    of trees, and by a tunnel driven.with immense labour through a mountain, to
                    carry off the superfluous water that formerly often flooded part of the city.
                    Between the inland seas of North America and the Icy Ocean there arc innumerable
                    lakes; a circumstance in which the northern portion of the new continent
                    resembles the boreal regions of the old. A lake amongst the defiles of the Rocky
                    Mountains, about the fiftieth degree of latitude, we were assured by the late Mr
                    D. Douglas (a botanist, who several times crossed that chain, and was afterwards
                    unfortunately killed by a wild bull in the Sandwich Islands), presents a
                    remarkable peculiarity. From each extremity it discharges a considerable stream,
                    one of which, falling into the Columbia, finds its way to the Pacific, whilst
                    the other forms a branch of the Saskatchewan, and therefore may be said to fall
                    into the Atlantic, through Lake Winnipeg, the inland seas of Canada, and the St
                    Lawrence.</p><p><hi rend="italic">European Lakes.·</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> Amongst these
                    some of the most celebrated are the <hi rend="italic">Lakes of Constance</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">Geneva.</hi> The first receives the Rhine, which was
                    fabled to pass through it without mingling with its waters. Like other alpine
                    lakes, it uniformly increases in summer, by the melting of the mountain snows;
                    and its lowest period is in winter, when its sources are locked up in ice. Its
                    length is thirty-five miles, its greatest breadth is eighteen miles, and its
                    mean depth is 600 feet, but in some places it requires a line of 2130 feet to
                    reach the bottom. Its waters thus fill a chasm about 1000 feet below the level
                    of the ocean.</p><p>The <hi rend="italic">Lake of Geneva</hi> has an area less than that of
                    Constance; its extreme length being fifty-four miles, and its greatest width
                    fifteen. Its depth is very variable; in some parts it was found by Deluc to be
                    960 feet, which shows that its bottom is only 200 feet higher than the level of
                    the Mediterranean. Like the Lake of Constance, it receives a river, the Rhone,
                    at one end, and discharges it at the other extremity, near to which the river
                    precipitates itself into a subterranean channel termed <hi rend="italic">Perte</hi><hi rend="italic">de Rhone.</hi> The beauty of the banks of this
                    lake, and the prospect of the distant glaciers, have given to it great
                    celebrity. The other Swiss lakes, though eminently beautiful, are not of
                    sufficient importance to be described here.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Italian Lakes.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> The beautiful
                    scenery on the <hi rend="italic">Lago di Como</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Lago Maggiore</hi> have been the theme of general praise; but some of the
                    smaller Italian lakes, which seem to be the craters of extinct volcanoes,
                    deserve notice. The lakes of <hi rend="italic">Nemi</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Averno</hi> are most evidently so; and the poetical representations of the
                    sulphureous exhalations from the latter may possibly have had a real origin in
                    former periods; but now birds rest with impunity on its surface, and fishes
                    inhabit its waters.</p><p><hi rend="italic">British Lakes.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> Our lakes are in
                    general of small extent. The lakes of Westmoreland and Cumberland are more
                    remarkable for their picturesque beauty than their size, and appear but as
                    insignificant specks in a map of Europe. A few of the Scottish lakes are on a
                    larger scale. Some of them are remarkable for their depth, and probably on that
                    account <hi rend="italic">Loch Toy</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Loch Ness</hi> are
                    never frozen. Loch Ness in some parts is 800 feet deep; so that its bottom is
                    not less than ninety or a hundred feet below the bottom of the deepest part of
                    the German Sea, on the eastern coast of Great Britain. The depth of Loch Tay
                    varies from eighty to 600 feet. <hi rend="italic">Loch Lomond</hi> is the
                    largest of the Scottish lakes, being thirty miles in length by nine in its
                    widest part, and at its northern extremity it is 600 feet deep. In the terrible
                    earthquake at Lisbon, Loch Lomond repeatedly rose and fell several feet. The
                    same took place in Loch Ness. A huge wave rolled with impetuosity from east to
                    west, and the waters sunk and fell repeatedly in an hour. Loch Tay was
                    remarkably agitated in 1783 and 1784, during the violent earthquakes in
                    Calabria. On 22d September of the latter year, two large waves were observed to
                    rush from each extremity of the lake, and coalesce near its centre, leaving
                    about 100 yards of its banks at the eastern extremity momentarily dry; but the
                    water returned and overflowed its usual boundary. The same appearances were
                    repeated for several successive days with less violence; and the agitations of
                    the loch did not cease till the 15th of October.</p><p>The agitation to which some alpine lakes are subject when the air is perfectly
                    calm, in which even whole breakers have been observed, is a very obscure
                    phenomenon. It has been often observed on the lakes in the north-west of
                    England, in the Highlands of Scotland, and in the Lake of Geneva. It may
                    possibly be explained by the compression of air in caverns existing in the
                    adjacent mountains, the roofs of which are on a higher level than the surface,
                    and communicating with the bottom of the lakes. If water much charged with air
                    find its way into such caverns, the air separated may be compressed in their
                    roofs, until its elasticity becoming superior to the pressure of the column of
                    water, forces its way into the lake, and thus gives rise to what in England is
                    termed a <hi rend="italic">bottom wind.</hi></p><p>The Irish lakes of <hi rend="italic">Killarney</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Lough
                    Erne</hi> are highly picturesque; but the petrifying qualities of the waters of
                    the more extensive <hi rend="italic">Lough Neagh,</hi> in Antrim, ought rather
                    to be attributed to the qualities of the soil in its vicinity. We possess
                    specimens from that locality of wood converted into siliceous petrifactions.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Periodic Lakes.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> The inundations
                    of rivers may be said to form <hi rend="italic">periodic lakes;</hi> but there
                    are other instances where the cause is more occult, although the effect be no
                    less conspicuous. The best-known instance of this is the celebrated <hi rend="italic">Lake of Cirknitz,</hi> in Carolina. It is only about eight miles
                    in length by two in breadth. In the beginning of June its waters disappear
                    through several fissures in its basin, and the peasants immediately begin to
                    cultivate its bottom, or to pasture their herds on the rich herbage which its
                    oozy bed soon produces. The crop is removed, and about the end of September or
                    middle of October the waters return, spouting up through several apertures in
                    the earth with great force. With these waters various species of fish appear;
                    and sometimes is seen amongst them that curious animal, so puzzling to
                    systematic naturalists, the <hi rend="italic">Anguinα Proteus</hi> of Laurenti,
                    the <hi rend="italic">Syren</hi><hi rend="italic">Anguina</hi><hi rend="italic">of</hi> Shaw. This lake is placed in a valley amongst limestone
                    hills, which are well known to be hollowed out into vast caverns. Of these the
                    most considerable is Mount Javomick. The caves are supposed to be the
                    receptacles of subterranean rivers, which, when augmented by the autumnal rains,
                    overflow into the channel which communicates with the basin of the Cirknitz; and
                    when the sources of these floods fail, the waters retreat to their summer level.
                    Other lakes of a similar kind are said to occur in Dalmatia.</p><p>4. <hi rend="smallcaps">Rivers.</hi> —The size and course of rivers are chiefly
                    determined by the height and direction of the mountain chains in which they
                    originate. Thus the Rhine, the Danube, and the Rhone, the largest rivers in
                    Europe, take their rise in the Swiss Alps. The great rivers of Asia have their
                    origin in some of its lofty central chains. The northern rivers, the Irtish, Ob,
                    Yenisei, and Lena, may all be traced to the Altai; the Ho-yang-Ho and Yang-tse
                    Kiang of China arise in the mountains forming the eastern abutment of the
                    central table-land of Asia; whilst the southern ramparts of that table-land
                    contain the sources of the great river of Cambodia, the Irawaddy, the
                    Brahmaputra, the Ganges, and the Scind or Indus. In Africa, the Nile has one of
                    its sources in the lofty mountains of Abyssinia, and the other in the more
                    distant central chain; the Niger rises in the western chain, runs eastward, is
                    deflected in the kingdom of Houssa <pb break="no" facs="nls:193497899" xml:id="kp-eb0717-7899-0524"/>towards the
                    south and west, and finally pours its waters into the Atlantic in the Gulf of
                    Guinea. In America, the Madalena and Marañon spring directly from the
                    Cordilleras of the Andes, which also contain the principal sources of the
                    Orinoco; whilst the more sluggish streams of the Paraguay and Parana derive
                    their waters from a lower transverse chain, stretching to the coast of Brazil.
                    In North America, the Arkansas, Red River, and Missouri, the great feeders of
                    the Mississippi, spring from the Northern Andes, where also are the sources of
                    the Columbia to the west, and of the Saskatchewan, the principal stream, which,
                    flowing into Lake Winnipeg, becomes thus a part of that vast chain of lakes or
                    seas, the outlet of which is the St Lawrence.</p><p>The channels of rivers are partly produced by the action of their own waters; but
                    undoubtedly also by some of the causes which we have indicated as disturbing the
                    original arrangement of the solid materials of the earth. Thus earthquakes have
                    often opened passages for rivers through barriers of rocks and mountain chains.
                    It may be admitted, that the continual action of water will excavate the hardest
                    stone; but the ravines through which rivers flow frequently bear no traces of
                    having been formed by the action of water; and the depth of some channels,
                    compared to the scantiness of the stream, scarcely permits us to ascribe the
                    whole to the excavation produced by the water. Thus, it is impossible to suppose
                    <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> that the small stream of the Lauricoha, in South
                    America, has cut its way through the chain of the Andes, which it traverses in a
                    long mural chasm, only twenty-five fathoms wide, but of astonishing sublimity.
                    In other instances, the bottom of the channel itself is even below the level of
                    the ocean; thus, the bed of the Marañon, above its junction with the Rio Negro,
                    and more than 1000 miles from its embouchure, was found by Condamine to exceed
                    620 feet; which, by the estimate of Humboldt, is more than 100 feet below the
                    level of the Atlantic. This may be a chasm produced by an earthquake, like that
                    which, in 1752, suddenly opened, and received the whole waters of the Rio del
                    Norte (a river which has a course of 1000 miles), so as to lay dry its channel
                    for a distance of fifty leagues; and it was several weeks before the river
                    assumed its usual level. Sometimes the channel of a river near its mouth is much
                    below that of the adjacent sea. It is so in the Marañon; and the same has also
                    been proved with regard to the Mississippi, which, just above New Orleans, is
                    153 feet deep, that is, at least fifty feet below the mean depth of that part of
                    the Mexican Gulf. In such circumstances it is obvious, that the lower part of
                    these hollows in river channels must be filled with salt water; which, by its
                    superior gravity, will insinuate itself below the descending current. Indeed
                    this takes place in the mouths of all rivers communicating with the sea by
                    considerable channels of small declivity. Thus the lowest stratum of water at
                    London Bridge, at the highest flood, is salt, though the upper current flowing
                    over this stratum is quite potable. The tides in the Marañon are sensibly felt
                    600 miles from its mouth; and probably the sea-water forces itself up at least
                    thus far beneath the mighty current of the river.</p><p>Rivers occupy the lowest parts of valleys through which they flow, and when they
                    are very large their declivities are generally small. The surface of the
                    Marañon, 3000 miles from the sea, has only an elevation of 1235 English feet,
                    which would give less than five inches per mile for its mean declivity; but,
                    from the point to which the tides of the ocean reach, the declivity is
                    considered as not above 0∙2 inch per mile. The Ganges, from Hurdwar, where it
                    issues from the defiles of the Himalaya, has a mean declivity of four inches per
                    mile; that of the Volga is about five inches.</p><p>The general form of the channels of rivers, however, especially in a champaign
                    country, indicates, that if not wholly formed, they are greatly modified, by the
                    action of their waters. In fact, their beds are usually proportional to the
                    force of the stream. On the banks of many large rivers we can still trace the
                    different heights at which the waters have formerly flowed. Playfair mentions
                    the existence of four or five successive terraces on the Rhine,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Works, vol. i.</p></note>
                    each of which has evidently been formed in succession by the river; and hence he
                    concludes that the Rhine once flowed 360 feet above its present level. Similar
                    remarks were made on the Upper Rhone by Saussure. The general effect of the
                    action of the water must be the erosion of the channels in the lapse of ages;
                    and even in the rocky beds of rivers this action of water is very perceptible.
                    Thus the waters of the Niagara have apparently worn away the limestone rock of
                    the falls, and formed a deep ravine through the stony bed, six miles in length
                    from Queenstown, where the cliffs terminate abruptly, to the present site of the
                    Falls. The undermining of the cliffs by this stupendous cataract has caused a
                    recession of the Falls equal to about eighteen feet in thirty years; but we
                    cannot thence infer the length of time that this cataract has existed, because
                    we have no certainty of the equability of the disintegration, nor of the other
                    causes which may have aided or facilitated the process. When rivers which have
                    their sources in lofty mountains flow through extensive plains, they are subject
                    to periodical inundations at the rainy season, or when the snows which feed them
                    are melted by the summer heat. Under these circumstances, the swollen river
                    bears along with it mud, sand, and gravel. A portion of these is deposited on
                    the banks of the river, and thus tends to elevate them above the level of the
                    adjacent country; whilst a portion is swept to the sea by the current, and the
                    materials are there collected into sand-banks, or, by the repellent action of
                    the waves, serve to augment the triangular plain often formed at the mouths of
                    rivers, to which the name of <hi rend="italic">delta</hi> has been applied. This
                    evident and gradual increase of a delta has given rise to the idea of attempting
                    to estimate the antiquity of existing geological arrangements by such a natural
                    chronometer. Thus, if the increase of a delta at the mouth of any river be a
                    certain number of feet in a given time, it has been supposed that we could
                    thence obtain a measure of the age of the whole alluvial land at that point. But
                    for the accuracy of such deductions several data are required. We must ascertain
                    that the supposed delta is really the formation of the river, and that the rate
                    of increase at distant periods is uniform. In every attempt to solve such
                    problems there is danger of mistaking the effects of general for local causes;
                    and there is strong reason to disbelieve the alleged uniformity of the increase
                    of the alluvial soil at the mouths of rivers. The Po, of late years, appears to
                    have gained upon the Adriatic, at the rate of 228 feet per annum, at its two
                    principal embouchures; but had the annual increase always equalled this, the
                    mouth of the Po at the commencement of the Christian era should have been
                    seventy-eight miles from the present shore, or extended beyond Mantua. But towns
                    fifty miles nearer the Adriatic, in the valley of the Po, have existed from
                    before the birth of Christ. The calculations of Volney, on the advance of the
                    delta of the Nile, are founded on very insufficient grounds; and as yet it must
                    be conceded, that we have no determinations of this sort worthy of
                    confidence.</p><p>The currents of large rivers may frequently be traced, by their colour, to great
                    distances in the ocean. Thus the Ganges, when in flood, discolours the sea in
                    the Gulf of <pb break="no" facs="nls:193497912" xml:id="kp-eb0717-7912-0525"/>Bengal to the distance of sixty miles, and its mud
                    covers the bottom at eighty miles from the land. The mud of the Orinoco is
                    carried far into the Atlantic; and on examining water drawn from the sea in
                    latitude 8° 20'north, that is, in the parallel of the Orinoco, and 200 miles
                    from its embouchure, Traill ascertained that the specific gravity of the water
                    suddenly fell below what it was to the north and to the south of this parallel.
                    The enormous mass of water discharged by the Marañon, according to Sabine,
                    discolours the ocean, and has even considerable rapidity in a direction inclined
                    to that of the equinoctial current, at the distance of 300 miles from the
                    American coast. Fresh water may be obtained from the surface of this current, at
                    a great distance from the shore.</p><p>The periodical inundations of rivers depend on great falls of rain in mountainous
                    regions, or on the melting of snows in the neighbourhood of their source. The
                    period depends on the return of these seasons in different places. Within the
                    tropics the rainy season is usually about the time when the sun passes the
                    meridian towards the tropic; and continues until his return to the same place.
                    The floods of the Marañon and La Plata cover a vast extent of unexplored
                    country. The rise of the Orinoco commences in May, its inundation begins in
                    June, and the waters return to their channel in September; from which time they
                    decrease until April of the succeeding year. The inundations of the Lower
                    Mississippi begin in March, are at their height in June, and the river is lowest
                    in October. The waters, at their height, 1000 miles from the sea, attain a rise
                    of fifty feet; at 300 miles, of twenty-five feet; and at 100 miles, of twelve
                    .feet. The western bank of the Mississippi forms a vast series of lakes, which
                    are dried up in autumn into arid plains, interspersed with swamps; but the delta
                    below the junction of Red Riv.er is a dismal swamp, scarcely elevated above the
                    sea. In the Red River, the Arkansas, and the Lower Mississippi, are found those
                    enormous rafts of drift-wood, formed during the river floods, which sometimes
                    extend for ten or twelve miles in one mass, rise and fall with the stream, yet
                    have a luxuriant vegetation on their summits. The inundations of the Ganges
                    follow a nearly similar course. The waters begin to increase in April, when the
                    rains commence in the mountains in which it has its sources; the rate of its
                    increase is about three inches daily until the month of July, when the rains
                    descend in torrents in the plains. The increase of the river is then more rapid,
                    being about five inches daily; and the country for 100 miles along its banks
                    presents in the end of July the appearance of a vast lake, interspersed with
                    insulated villages and woods. The general height of the inundation-waters in
                    Bengal is about twelve feet, but in some places they have a depth of more than
                    thirty feet. The great river of Ava, the Indus, the Euphrates, and the Tigris,
                    have also their periods of inundation, depending on the circumstances
                    determining the setting in of the rains on the mountains in which they
                    originate.</p><p>The inundations of the Nile have long been celebrated. Shortly after the
                    commencement of the rains on the mountains of Abyssinia, in June, the river
                    begins to rise, and attains its greatest height in August. At Cairo the greatest
                    rise is twenty-eight feet; at Rosetta it is no more than four about the middle
                    of August, when the valley of Egypt, with a mean breadth of three or four
                    leagues, and the greatest part of the delta, are covered with one sheet of
                    water. Its increase is irregular; and it decreases gradually until the following
                    May. As soon as the waters are within their usual channel, the soil, moistened
                    and enriched by the sediment deposited from the inundation, is diligently
                    cultivated by the natives.</p><p>By such inundations the banks of rivers are usually elevated above the adjacent
                    plains; and when the stream carries down much mud and gravel, the whole bed of
                    the river may become considerably raised above the general level of the country
                    through which it flows. This natural process has been considerably accelerated
                    by art on the Po in Italy. To obviate the evil of sudden overflowings of this
                    river, its channel, and that of the tributary streams, have for many ages been
                    carefully embanked; but the quantity of mud and gravel carried down by its
                    waters is so great, that the bottom of the river is gradually raised, further
                    embankments become necessary, and the repetition of these processes have
                    elevated the whole bed of the river below its junction with the Mincio, until it
                    is now actually thirty feet higher than the general level of the adjacent
                    plains; a circumstance fraught with the utmost danger to the whole country
                    between that point and the sea, should any accident happen to the main
                    embankment. Where the evil is of less magnitude, the Italian engineers have long
                    followed a remedy, devised, it is said, by Torricelli. When streams bring down
                    much mud, and their channels have been suffered to become elevated above the
                    level of the adjacent plains, the lower ground is subdivided by embanked
                    enclosures; the turbid waters of the river are admitted by flood-gates into the
                    subdivisions, and are there allowed to deposit their sediment. The addition of
                    fertilizing mud thus made, in many situations amounts to four inches in depth by
                    each irrigation, which may be repeated several times in the year. By such means,
                    in five or six years, the soil is raised to a level with the river, and the risk
                    of extensive inundations greatly diminished. The process is termed <hi rend="italic">la colmata.</hi> It has been very advantageously, applied in
                    Tuscany and Lombardy; and if steadily and judiciously directed, under the
                    auspices of a just and vigorous government, might possibly still avert a
                    catastrophe which seems to impend over the districts of the Lower Po.</p><p>When river-courses lie amongst mountains, they are subject to sudden breaks,
                    which, according to their depth, give rise either to <hi rend="italic">rapids</hi> or to <hi rend="italic">cataracts.</hi> There are many picturesque
                    waterfalls in Scotland, as the Cascade of Fyers and that at Lochleven-head in
                    Inverness-shire, Bruar Cascade in Athole, the Devon Lynn in Clackmannanshire,
                    and the magnificent Falls of the Clyde near Lanark. The most stupendous cascade
                    in Great Britain is the Fall of Glomach, in the district of Applecross, in the
                    parish of Kintail, and county of Ross. At the head of a wild and solitary glen,
                    seven miles from the inn of Shealhouse, the river Girsac is precipitated in one
                    unbroken fall of more than three hundred feet. At the distance of about fifty
                    feet from the bottom, the water impinges on a shelf, whence it falls into a dark
                    pool, amidst naked perpendicular rocks. When the river is in flood, it descends
                    in one unbroken sheet of above 380 feet in height. Wales and Cumberland can
                    boast of many beautiful cascades on a smaller scale, particularly the <hi rend="italic">Pistil</hi><hi rend="italic">y</hi><hi rend="italic">Cain</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">Pistil</hi><hi rend="italic">y</hi><hi rend="italic">Mouddach</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> i</hi> in Merionethshire. The

                    <hi rend="italic">Styx</hi> of Homer, Hesiod, and Pausanias, in Arcadia, and the
                    Fall of the Rhine at Schauffhausen, are amongst the most celebrated in
                    Europe.</p><p>A cataract may exist in a comparatively flat country, from a sudden sinking in
                    its level. The stupendous cataract of Niagara, in which a large and rapid river,
                    1650 feet in width, precipitates itself, by two channels, in one vast leap of
                    16Ó feet perpendicular, is an instance of such an occurrence. The celebrated
                    cataract of Tequendama, near Bogota, though found by Humboldt to be far less
                    lofty than had been supposed by Bouguer, is still of stupendous height, and one
                    of the most magnificent in the world: a river half the breadth of the Seine at
                    Paris is precipitated into a rocky gulf, at two bounds, to a depth of 540
                    feet.</p><p>The cataract of the river <hi rend="italic">Shirawati,</hi> in the Indian
                    province of Canara, exceeds in beauty and sublimity every <pb break="no" facs="nls:193497925" xml:id="kp-eb0717-7925-0526"/>waterfall which
                    has been hitherto made known in Europe. The country around the village of
                    Haliali, about three miles north-west of the fall, presents the richness of a
                    tropical forest, mingled with cultivation. The traveller comes suddenly on the
                    river. “A few steps more,” says Dr Christie, “over huge blocks of granite, bring
                    you to the brink of a fearful chasm, rocky, bare, and black, down into which you
                    look to the depth of a thousand feet.” The bed of the river is one fourth of a
                    mile broad, in a direct line; but the edge of the fall is elliptical, with a
                    sweep of about half a mile. This body of water rushes, at first for about three
                    hundred feet, over a slope at an angle of 45°, in a sheet of white foam, and is
                    then precipitated to the depth of eight hundred and fifty feet more, into a
                    black abyss, with a thundering noise. It has therefore a depth of 1150 feet. In
                    the rainy season the river appears to be about thirty feet in depth at the fall;
                    in the dry season it is much lower, and is divided into three cascades of varied
                    beauty and astonishing grandeur; but the smaller streams are almost dissipated
                    in vapour before they reach the bottom. Dr Wilson succeeded in viewing this
                    magnificent cataract from the bed of the river, from which it appears to much
                    advantage.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Jameson’s
                    Journal, vol. xxiv. for January 1838.</p></note></p><p>The number of considerable rivers which fall into the sea in different parts of
                    the old continent amounts to 430, and those of the new continent may be
                    estimated at 140, but this seeming disproportion is amply compensated by the
                    vast dimensions of the latter.</p><p>Several attempts have been made by philosophers to compute the quantity of water
                    which rivers discharge into the ocean; but it is a problem scarcely admitting of
                    any solution, beyond a probable approximation From the observations of Father
                    Riccioli on the discharge of the river Po, it has been calculated, that the
                    water poured out by all the rivers of the globe is equal to forty-one cubic
                    miles daily, or to 14,965 cubic miles annually. This computation is probably too
                    high. The greatest estimate of the mean annual fall of rain, dew, &amp;c. is not
                    above thirty-four inches for the whole earth; and the superficies of the globe
                    being 196,816,658 square miles, this will afford a mass of water equal to
                    105,614 cubic miles as the whole that is annually precipitated on the earth. But
                    from this must be deducted all that falls on the ocean, which, if we consider
                    the precipitation in the ratio of their surfaces, will give 38,271 cubic miles
                    as the water that falls on the land. Of this quantity, however, at least two
                    thirds are expended in irrigating the soil or in sustaining vegetable life, and
                    are restored to the atmosphere by the process of evaporation, so that no more
                    than 12,757 cubic miles will become the annual tribute of the rivers of the
                    globe to the ocean. This estimate differs less from that founded on the tables
                    of Cotte than some later speculations on this subject, in which we suspect that
                    the mean annual rain, and the quantity returned by the rivers to the sea, are
                    considerably underrated.</p><p>The length of the course of twenty-two of the principal rivers, and the area of
                    their respective domains or basins, were calculated with much care, and given in
                    a tabular form in the essay on Physical Geography in the last edition of the
                    Encyclopaedia Britannica. These elements we here insert, with the addition of a
                    reduction of the proportional lengths into English miles, which has been
                    obtained by multiplying them by 180, the distance between the remotest sources
                    of the Thames and its embouchure at the Nore, that river having been assumed as
                    unity in the first column of the table. The proportion of water discharged by
                    each has been omitted, because the data on which that column was calculated did
                    not seem to be sufficiently established.</p><table><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>R</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1"

                    globe w ill be found in Plate CCCC^X.</p><p>We have noticed the usual courses of rivers; but sometimes their streams, after
                    flowing through open channels, are engulfed, and afterwards re-appear at
                    considerable distances from their <hi rend="italic">occultation.</hi> Limestone
                    districts afford many specimens of this phenomenon. In Derbyshire, the small
                    streams named the Hamps and the Manifold sink into a chasm on a common near
                    Ashburn, and re-appear in Islam grounds, three miles below. The stream which
                    issues from the Cavern of the Peak is believed to be the same which disappears
                    near the road from Chapel-in-Frith to Castleton; and the caves of Weathercote
                    and Yordas in Yorkshire exhibit similar instances. The occultation of the Rhine
                    has great celebrity, and attracts numerous visitors from Geneva. The Guadiana,
                    one of the largest rivers in Spain, disappears near the village of <hi rend="italic">Castillo de Cervera,</hi> and, after pursuing a subterranean
                    course for twelve or fourteen miles, bursts again into day near the high road to
                    Madrid, between Manzanares and Villaharta, at the spot named <hi rend="italic">Ojos de</hi><hi rend="italic">Guadiana,</hi> or the Eyes of the Guadiana. No
                    country surpasses Greece in the number of its subterranean streams, the
                    peculiarities of which are often clothed in splendid mythological fictions by
                    her ancient bards. The waters of many valleys in the Peloponnesus have no other
                    outlets than ζsgs0gα, or chasms engulfing the streams, which are termed <hi rend="italic">Katavothra</hi> by the modern Greeks. Such are the outlets of the
                    valleys of Tegea, Manincia, Asaea, Orchomenus, Alea, Stymphalus, and Peneus. A
                    familiarity with such phenomena, and a poetical temperament, readily led the
                    ancient Greeks to conceive still more distant secret communications; and the
                    imagination which peopled every <pb break="no" facs="nls:193497938" xml:id="kp-eb0717-7938-0527"/>grove and
                    animated every stream with presiding deities, could easily reconcile itself to
                    the fabled loves of Alpheius and Arethusa, which led the enamoured river-god to
                    pursue his coy nymph, beneath the bed of the ocean, from Greece to the shores of
                    Sicily.</p><p>5. <hi rend="smallcaps">Springs.</hi> —Springs derive their origin from water
                    raised into the atmosphere by evaporation, falling down in the form of showers
                    or mists on hills, and thence percolating through fissures in rocks, or through
                    porous beds, until they appear at lower points of the earth’s surface. Hence
                    springs of any size are rarely found near the summits of mountains. When they
                    occur in such situations, they probably arise from water collected on higher
                    though distant mountains, finding its way, as in the two legs of a siphon,
                    through a fissure open to the air only at its extremities. Springs are most
                    numerous in mountainous districts, because hills readily arrest and condense
                    clouds. The observation of Mr White of Selborne, on the condensation of moisture
                    by a single tree, is a proof of the effect of even small elevations in
                    collecting moisture from the atmosphere. Springs are directed to the surface by
                    the position of the strata or fissures through which they flow. In flat
                    countries, springs sometimes have a long subterranean course, especially when
                    they encounter beds of plastic clay, through which their waters cannot
                    penetrate. Copious perennial springs usually undergo very little alteration in
                    their temperature throughout the year; and therefore very generally indicate the
                    mean temperature of the climate where they occur. But water brought up from
                    considerable depths in the earth, as in those wells which (from having been
                    first introduced in Artois) are termed <hi rend="italic">Artesian,</hi> has
                    usually a higher degree of heat, which increases with their depth.</p><p>A higher temperature than the mean of the latitude is occasionally also observed
                    in large springs, the source of which is perhaps not deep. Professor Traill has
                    stated, that the largest spring in Great Britain, <hi rend="italic">St
                    Winefredds Well,</hi> at Holywell, has always a temperature several degrees
                    above the mean heat of our climate, and that at different times he had found it
                    to vary as much as 4° of Fahrenheit. This noble spring may be considered as the
                    bursting out of a subterranean river; for it throws up, it is said, about
                    twenty-one tuns of water per minute, or 30,240 tuns daily. It is worthy of
                    remark, that this spring issues from a hill much disturbed by numerous mineral
                    veins, and probably has its temperature also affected by surface water.</p><p>The <hi rend="italic">Crawley Spring,</hi> from which Edinburgh is supplied with
                    water, though of far inferior size, is yet very remarkable, as it yields 220
                    cubic feet, or more than a tun, per minute, of the purest water.</p><p>The most magnificent spring we have ever beheld is the far-famed <hi rend="italic">Fountain of Petrarch,</hi> at Vaucluse. It rises within a cavern,
                    at the foot of a vast semicircular precipice of compact limestone terminating a
                    wild valley. In the beginning of autumn, by clambering over a heap of rubbish,
                    the traveller may descend into the cavern, and will find himself on the brink of
                    a gulf of the clearest water, of unfathomable depth, with the deep blue tint of
                    the ocean out of soundings, rising with .great force, and an unruffled surface,
                    from the recesses of the mountain. It issues from the cavern through concealed
                    channels, and forms at once the river Sorgue, capable at its very source of
                    moving machinery, and almost immediately navigable for boats. The waters of this
                    extraordinary spring never vary half a degree in temperature. When the melting
                    of snow on the neighbouring Alps increases its sources, the cavern is entirely
                    filled with water, and the stream rushes over the rugged bank at the mouth of
                    the cavern with the tumult of a cascade.</p><p>The water of springs always contains air, and some saline ingredients. In good
                    potable water the air usually equals ⅛th or <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> ⅛th of
                    its volume; of this one third is atmospheric air, and the rest carbonic acid
                    gas. The saline contents of good spring-water generally vary from <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> θ* <hi rend="subscript"> σπ</hi> th to <hi rend="subscript"> π</hi> θ⅛ <hi rend="subscript"> π</hi> th of their weight; and
                    such water has a specific gravity of from 1∙00016 to 1∙00030. Such springs are
                    termed <hi rend="italic">soft,</hi> and answer well for culinary and other
                    domestic purposes. When the solid ingredients exceed this proportion, the water
                    becomes <hi rend="italic">hard;</hi> and is less fitted for cooking or
                    dissolving soap, in proportion to the quantity of foreign impregnation it
                    contains. The springs of Upsal, analysed by Bergman, afford a good instance of a
                    very <hi rend="italic">soft water.</hi> The three purest contained no more than
                    <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> ^⅛^th part of their weight of solid matter, and had
                    a specific gravity of l∙0002. From a <hi rend="italic">kanne</hi> (about 57,000
                    grains troy) of the Sandvik spring, he obtained 9∙65 of solid contents, in the
                    following proportions:</p><table><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Carbonate of lime...</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Grains. 5∙5</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Muriate of lime</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Grains. 0∙5</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Muriate of soda</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>2∙25</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Sulphate of potassa..</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>....0∙25</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Silica</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>0∙5</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Carbonate of soda....</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>0∙25</p></cell></row></table><p>besides four cubic inches of carbonic acid gas, and two cubic inches of oxygen
                    gas.</p><p>The same ingredients are found in most potable waters, and many also contain
                    sulphate of lime. The springs which supply Liverpool have a specific gravity of
                    from 1∙0026 to 1∙0027, and contain <hi rend="subscript"> 7</hi> ⅛ <hi rend="subscript"> σ</hi> of solid matter. They are rather <hi rend="italic">hard</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> but when the ingredients are in more
                    considerable quantity, the spring becomes a <hi rend="italic">mineral
                    water.</hi></p><p>Mineral springs, besides the substances already indicated, may contain one or
                    more of the following substances: sulphuretted hydrogen, or nitrogen; sulphates
                    of soda, ammonia, magnesia, alumine, iron, copper; nitrates of potassa, lime,
                    and magnesia; muriates of potassa, ammonia, and baryta; more rarely free
                    sulphuric acid, boracic acid, and borate of soda. Muriatic acid uncombined has
                    been detected in the waters of the <hi rend="italic">Pusarnbio</hi> in South
                    America, which arise from the volcanic mountains of Purace, and are strongly
                    impregnated with sulphuric and muriatic acids; and in Java sulphuric acid has
                    been discharged by volcanoes in such quantities as to destroy vegetation.
                    Boracic acid is deposited from several of the Tuscan springs, especially from
                    the thermal waters of <hi rend="italic">Sasso.</hi> The borate of soda is found
                    in some of the lakes of Persia and Thibet. <hi rend="italic">Mineral waters</hi>
                    may be, J. acidulous; 2. chalybeate; 3. sulphureous; or, 4. saline. The first
                    generally owe their sparkling appearance and acid qualities to carbonic acid.
                    The second contain either the carbonate or the sulphate of iron. The third owe
                    their fetid smell to sulphuretted hydrogen, or to sulphurets of lime, or of some
                    other alkaline substance. The fourth contain a notable portion of neutral salts,
                    from which they have a disagreeable taste, and are hard waters.</p><p>The acidulous waters almost always contain some alkaline or earthy salt. Such are
                    the waters of Tunbridge, Spa, Pyrmont, Seltzer, and others. The chalybeates
                    generally contain from one to two and a half grains of oxide of iron, or some
                    salts, in each English pint, often combined with other salts. Of this kind are
                    the British springs of Peterhead, Brighton, and the chalybeate sources of
                    Harrowgate and Cheltenham, which last, however, are much mixed with other saline
                    ingredients. These vary from 1O007 to 1∙0010 in specific gravity.</p><p>Our sulphureous waters are potent, and owe their qualities to sulphuretted
                    hydrogen. The principal are, Strathpeffer, near Dingwall; St Bernard’s Well, at
                    Edinburgh; Hartwell, near Moffat; Harrowgate, Leamington, and a less known well
                    at Kilburne, near London. Their specific gravity ranges from 1*0042 to L0132,
                    especially of those which, like Harrowgate and’Leamington, contain much saline
                    matter. Moffat spring contains very little saline impregnation, and its
                    sulphuretted hydrogen amounts to 1∙20 cubic inch in each English pint. The old
                    well at Harrowgate contains much saline matter, and 1∙75 cubic inch of that gas
                    in the same quantity of water. The thermal waters<pb break="no" facs="nls:193497951" xml:id="kp-eb0717-7951-0528"/> of
                    Aix-la-Chapelle are very strongly impregnated; containing no less than 5∙5 cubic
                    inches of sulphuretted hydrogen.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Saline mineral waters</hi> contain a notable quantity of some
                    of the salts already indicated as found in springs. The most noted in Great
                    Britain are the waters of Dumblane, Pitcaithly, Cheltenham, and Leamington.
                    Their specific gravity varies from 1∙0047 to 1∙0119. The waters of the two last
                    contain respectively 80∙5 and 110∙38 grains of salts in each English pint. All
                    these mineral springs are reputed remedies for various diseases, but are
                    evidently unfit for culinary purposes. The source of their peculiar
                    impregnations is the mineral beds through which they flow.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Thermal Springs</hi> The heat of thermal waters has been
                    ascribed, by Hutton, Laplace, and Bischoff, to the agency of a central heat,
                    which is conceived to exist in the bowels of the earth. Some indeed have
                    supposed that their temperature may be derived from the mutual chemical action
                    of local accumulations of certain substances at more moderate depths in the
                    earth. But the long-continued uniformity of their heat has given rise to a
                    modification of this doctrine, which is ably supported by Dr Daubeny. He
                    considers thermal springs as deriving their temperature from the same source as
                    volcanoes, viz. the infiltration of water through the external crust of the
                    earth, to the regions where he conceives the metallic elements of earthy and
                    alkaline bodies to exist. The intense heat extricated during the oxidation of
                    these elements will convert a portion of the water into steam, which, under
                    compression, will attain a high temperature, act on various earthy matters, and
                    communicate its heat to the subterranean waters which issue in thermal springs.
                    The position of such springs in the vicinity of disturbances or npheavings of
                    strata by ignigenous rocks, seems to favour this idea. Whatever may be the
                    cause, we can now no longer doubt that there is within the earth a source of
                    heat, the eff ect of which is perceived in the increased temperature as we
                    descend in deep mines, and in the distances to which the effects of volcanoes
                    are known, to be propagated. The hypothesis of a central heat, unconnected with
                    chemical changes, has been strongly insisted on, from the uniformity of the
                    increments of temperature with the depth of borings for Artesian wells; and the
                    result would lead to the conclusion, that the heat of the earth augments, at an
                    average, one degree of Fahrenheit for every 100 feet of perpendicular depth; so
                    that at the depth of three miles water would be boiling hot. But if we adopt the
                    views of Daubeny, the temperature of particular springs will depend on the
                    variable profundity of the unoxidized materials of the globe, and the supply of
                    water. The temperature of thermal waters seems to be liable to little change in
                    each spring; but in different waters it occurs in every degree, from a
                    temperature very little exceeding the mean of the place, to the boiling point of
                    water.</p><p>Table of the Temperature of some Thermal Springs.</p><table><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Matlock 66°</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Vichy, France 113°</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Bristol 74</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Cauterets, do 130</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Buxton 82</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Bonrbonncles Bains, do.] 31</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Bath 116</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Neris, do <hi rend="subscript"> i</hi>....145</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Alhama, Spain 118</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Plombieres, do 146</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Aregos, Portugal 142</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>.

                    issuing out of a small mass of rock in the midst of a large river, as that
                    figured by Sir George Mackenzie in the Reikiadalsaa &gt; others are celebrated
                    for their intermissions and magnificent jets of boiling water, as the <hi rend="italic">Geysers.</hi> These fountains are well known by the writ- ' ings
                    of Von Troil, Stanley, Mackenzie, Hooker, Henderson, and by two Danish
                    publications, the first by Olafsen and Povelsen, the latter by Ohlsen. The two
                    principal of these singular fountains are in a valley near Haukadal, about
                    sixteen miles from Skalholt, the bottom of which contains numerous cavities
                    filled with hot water. In the midst of a little mount formed by siliceous
                    deposits from its waters, six or seven feet in height, opens a circular basin
                    fifty-six feet in diameter in one direction, and forty-six in the other. The
                    depth of this basin is three feet; but in its bottom is a round hole about ten
                    feet wide, the termination of a pipe or fissure which sinks into the earth to
                    the depth of seventy-eight feet. By this pipe the water occasionally retires,
                    leaving the basin quite dry, and no steam is then perceived to issue from the
                    pipe. Periodically the. water begins to rise in the pipe, and again fills the
                    basin to overflowing; the ground is shaken by hollow subterraneous explosions;
                    suddenly a prodigious column of boiling water is shot into the air with
                    astonishing violence, and clouds of steam obscure the atmosphere. This is
                    followed by successive jets, sometimes to the number of sixteen or eighteen in
                    five minutes, the last of which is generally the most energetic, and attains an
                    altitude of from 90 to 100 feet. On a second visit to the Great Geyser in 1815,
                    Mr Henderson saw it rise to the height of 150 feet; and Lieutenant Ohlsen says
                    that in 1804 he took the altitude of one eruption with a quadrant, and
                    ascertained it to be 212 feet. These efforts are attended with a loud noise, and
                    the ground trembles beneath the feet, whilst the velocity with which the jets
                    and the accompanying steam are hurled into the air is astonishingly sublime.
                    When stones are thrown into the pipe, they remain there until the succeeding jet
                    projects them with great violence into the air, and they may be seen descending
                    amid showers of boiling water. The intermissions of this extraordinary fountain
                    are not absolutely regular; but there are generally four great series of
                    eruptions from its orifice in twenty-four hours.</p><p>The jets from the <hi rend="italic">Strokr,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">New
                    Geyser</hi> of Stanley, though smaller in diameter, are scarcely less
                    magnificent; and, taking place more frequently, and with surprising violence,
                    afford a high gratification to the traveller.</p><p>The mechanism of these Geysers must be simple, to have lasted for many ages. They
                    are mentioned by Saxo in his History of Denmark; and this shows that some of
                    them have existed for about 600 years. It is not easy to imagine an application
                    and removal of a heating cause within the earth in such short intervals; but an
                    arrangement somewhat resembling that represented in No. 13 would be capable of
                    producing a Geyser. A cavity similar to that supposed by Mackenzie or by Lyell,
                    in which water performs the office of a valve, from the form of the lower part
                    of the canal communicating with the surface, might suffice; or its </p><pb break="no" facs="nls:193497964" xml:id="kp-eb0717-7964-0529"/><table><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"/><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Gr.</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Gr.</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Silex</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>...31∙58</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Argil 2∙80</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Muriate of soda</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>....14∙42</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>And a little sulphuretted</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Sulphate of soda....</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>.... 8∙57</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>hydrogene.</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Caustic soda</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>5∙56</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"/></row></table><p>effect might be increased by a simple valve formed by a mass of stone
                    accidentally getting into the position represented in the figure. Indeed, an
                    experiment of Mr Henderson on the <hi rend="italic">Strockr</hi> proves the
                    dependence of the force of its jets on some such mechanical obstruction. That
                    gentleman found that the eruptions were accelerated by throwing a quantity of
                    stones into the pipe, and the violence of the succeeding jets seemed to be in
                    proportion to the load so applied; just as loading the valve of a steam-boiler
                    will increase the elasticity of the steam. Henderson asserts that he was thus
                    able to double the effect of the fountain, and to make it project the water to a
                    height of 200 feet. The steam is no doubt produced by the agency of that
                    volcanic fire which everywhere pervades Iceland, and is evidently in great
                    activity under this secluded valley.</p><p>If the cavern in the imaginary section, No. 13, be supplied with water from a
                    subterranean source, whilst steam is introduced into it from some more distant
                    volcanic focus, the fountain will remain quiescent until the accumulation of
                    steam, and the pressure of the vertical column of water, aided by the rude valve
                    of rock, will augment its elasticity, until it become sufficient to overcome the
                    resistance, and to project the water remaining in the pipe into the
                    atmosphere.</p><p>The Geysers are not confined to the valley near Haukadal; several on a smaller
                    scale exist at Reykum, issuing, at intervals of about an hour and a half, from a
                    bank of hot sulphureous clay.</p><p>The waters of the Great Geyser hold a notable proportion of silex in solution,
                    which no doubt is owing to their alkaline impregnation, and their high

                    Philosophical Transactions, vol. iii., an English gallon contains—</p><p>The silex is deposited in beautiful stalactitic forms in many of the adjacent

                    <hi rend="italic">intermitting</hi> springs, in which the issue is entirely
                    suspended for a time, and the water returns at intervals of greater or less
                    regularity.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Nicholson’s
                    Journal, eighth series, vol. v. p. 35.</p></note> Of the former sort we have a
                    good example in <hi rend="italic">Giggleswwk Well,</hi> in Yorkshire, in which
                    the reciprocations are well marked. In it the water will sometimes rise and fall
                    a foot in ten or fifteen minutes; at other times it will fall as much in four
                    minutes, but usually requires double that time to regain its former height. The
                    water bubbles out with force, so as to carry with it particles of sand. Another
                    reciprocating well occurs near Torbay, called <hi rend="italic">Lay-well.</hi>
                    It is described, in an early volume of the London Philosophical Transactions, as
                    ebbing and flowing sixteen times in an hour. A similar well, but on a far less
                    scale, is St Anthony’s Well on Arthur Seat. The cause seems to be in both
                    instances the confinement and compression of air in tortuous cavities within the
                    subterranean channel of the spring, which, from the position of the aperture, is
                    alternately compressed by the accumulating fluid, until it acquire sufficient
                    elasticity to drive before it the resisting column of water. It is easy to
                    conceive a simple mechanism capable of this alternation, without any species of
                    valve, except that formed by the water itself, which may be represented by the
                    diagram No. 13, without its valve. Of the perfectly <hi rend="italic">intermitting spring</hi> the most remarkable is the <hi rend="italic">Bolder-Born,</hi> in Westphalia, near Paderborn. After flowing for twenty-four
                    hours, it entirely ceases for the space of six hours; it then returns with a
                    loud noise, and mixed with air, in a stream sufficiently powerful to turn three
                    mills very near its source. In Lowthorpe’s Abridgment of the Philosophical
                    Transactions (vol. ii.), it is said to disappear <hi rend="italic">twice in
                    twenty-four hours</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and possibly its intermissions
                    are not regular, but may depend upon the quantity of rain which has recently
                    fallen. Dr Boué has described a powerful intermitting spring which occurs at
                    Bihar, in the commune of Maybugyer, in Hungary. It issues, many times a day,
                    from the foot of a mountain, after hollow subterranean noises; in such quantity
                    as in two minutes to fill the channel of a considerable stream. Its returns are
                    most frequent from Christmas to Midsummer, when they take place every quarter of
                    an hour; but they are rarer during the other half of the year.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Jameson’s Journal, vol. xxxv.

                    the descent of streams of water, much mixed with air, into a cavern, the more
                    direct communication of which with the surface is through a channel so connected
                    with the cavem as to confine the air in its upper part, in the manner of a <hi rend="italic">water-blast,</hi> until the increasing elasticity, from

                    retained by the influence of gravitation toward the earth, though, from the
                    repulsion between its own particles, it extends to a considerable distance from
                    the surface. Its density diminishes as it recedes from the earth, and its
                    expansibility is in the inverse ratio of the force by which it is compressed.
                    Its density is farther affected by the influence of heat and cold, by the
                    admixture of watery vapour it contains, by the decreasing force of terrestrial
                    gravitation, and the increasing attraction of the heavenly bodies as its
                    distance from the surface of the earth is augmented. Experiment and calculation
                    have proved that the rate of diminution is such, that the atmosphere at the
                    height of seven miles would only have a density ½th of what it has at the
                    surface; and that if the altitudes be taken in an arithmetical series, the
                    decrease in density will follow a geometrical ratio. Thus, if the density at the
                    surface be assumed as unity, at seven miles it will be ½th, at fourteen miles it
                    will be ⅛th, at twenty-one miles it will be ⅛th, and so on. This property of the
                    air would lead to the idea of an indefinite extension of the atmosphere; but
                    there is evidently a limit to this, probably arising from the gravitation of the
                    particles of air; and the nicest observations on the duration of twilight, as
                    well as some other phenomena in astronomy, almost warrant the inference, that
                    the utmost limit of the atmosphere cannot exceed forty-five miles in altitude.
                    See the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Atmosphere.</hi></p><p>Air is ponderable; 100 cubic inches of air at the temperature 60° Fahrenheit
                    weigh 30∙5 grains troy, at a mean barometrical pressure; and a perpendicular
                    column of the whole atmosphere is just balanced by a mercurial column of about
                    thirty inches in height. Hence the length of such a column is employed to

                    times. See the articles <hi rend="smallcaps">Barometer, Atmosphere,</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Meteorology.</hi></p><pb break="no" facs="nls:193497977" xml:id="kp-eb0717-7977-0530"/><p>The height of the barometer forms an important part of a meteorological journal.
                    Observation has made us acquainted, not only with the occasional, but also with
                    the diurnal oscillations of the column; and exhibited the connection of the more
                    considerable variations with changes in the weather. The trouble of continual
                    attention to obtain the mean heights of the barometer at any place, have given
                    rise to several contrivances for registering the maxima and minima during the
                    absence of the observer. A very ingenious instrument for this purpose is
                    described by Mr Keith, in the Philosophical Transactions of Edinburgh (vol.
                    iv.). The open end of the instrument is a larger cylinder than the rest of the
                    tube. The cistern is placed horizontally at the upper part, and an ivory float,
                    supporting a <hi rend="italic">kneed wire,</hi> is placed on the surface of the
                    fluid, as in No. 14. The scale is above the opening of the tube, and the kneed
                    wire moves two light indices, sliding on a fine wire, with sufficient friction
                    to retain them in the position which they receive from the movements of the
                    ivory float. The same gentleman caused the instrument, by a slight modification,
                    to record the whole course of its observations through a given period. A
                    perpendicular cylinder, divided into thirty-one compartments, is moved round its
                    axis once a month by clock-work; a pencil attached to the float wire records the
                    whole course of the oscillations; and a proper scale, marked on the cylinder,
                    gives the value of the irregular curves thus traced. Once a month the cylinder
                    is covered with a fresh paper, ruled into thirty-one columns, for another
                    monthly series.</p><p>Professor Traill has given a simple and cheap form of a register barometer for
                    maxima and minima.</p><p>A diagonal barometer registers the maximum height of the column. Before the tube
                    is bent, a piece of iron wire is introduced into the closed end of the tube,
                    which is then filled in the usual way. The wire being lighter than the mercury,
                    will rise to the top of the column, is pushed before it on the rise of the
                    barometer, and, on the fall, remains, by its own weight, at the point it had
                    attained. A slight modification of Cassini’s rectangular barometer marks the
                    minima, by means of a piece of iron wire introduced at the open end of the tube,
                    as in No.</p><p>15. To make the indications of both instruments as nearly equal as the
                    construction will allow, the lower part of this tube is bent to less than a
                    right angle.</p><p>It is obvious that the barometer affords the means of ascertaining the weight of
                    the whole atmosphere. The pressure of the atmosphere varies from twenty-eight to
                    thirty-one inches of the barometric column. A column of pure mercury, whose base
                    is a square inch, and its height the mean between twenty-eight and thirty-one,
                    or 29∙5 inches, is found to weigh 14∙5 pounds avoirdupois; therefore, the
                    pressure of the whole atmosphere will be 14∙5 pounds on each square inch of the
                    earth’s surface. And as the superficies of our globe is equal to
                    790,116,426,647,756,800 square inches, if we multiply this number by 14∙5, we
                    obtain, as the absolute weight of the whole atmosphere,
                    11,456,688,186,392,473,600 pounds; or, if we adopt the more common estimate of
                    the mean barometric height at 30 inches, and the weight of that column at 15
                    pounds on the square inch, this will give 11,851,746,399,716,352,000 pounds, or
                    5,290,958,214,159,085*7 tons, as the mass of our atmosphere.</p><p>The variations of atmospherical temperature are ascertained by the thermometer.
                    (See the articles <hi rend="smallcaps">Meteorology</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Thermometer).</hi> The instrument, for this purpose, should be placed in the
                    shade, protected against reflected heat, and also against that transmitted
                    through walls, or other bodies to which it is attached. It is by no means easy,
                    in a town, to obtain an eligible position for a measure of atmospheric
                    temperature, on account of the many causes which affect the instrument. It ought
                    to be protected by a glass case against rain; yet the air should circulate
                    freely around it, and it ought to radiate its heat freely to the sky. The
                    importance of obtaining accurate information on changes of the temperature of
                    the atmosphere has given rise to numerous observations on the annual, monthly,
                    daily, and hourly variations of the thermometer.</p><p>The labour and minute attention required in such investigations have induced
                    ingenious men to devise methods of ascertaining mean temperatures from a few
                    observations. It has been found that the mean of the thermometer during the
                    month of April will, in our climate, nearly indicate the mean annual
                    temperature; and that the mean of observations made about half past 8 <hi rend="smallcaps">a. μ.,</hi> at 2 p. <hi rend="smallcaps">μ.,</hi> at 9 p. <hi rend="smallcaps">m„</hi> and an hour before sunrise, will give the mean
                    temperature of each day. To abridge such fatiguing observations, <hi rend="italic">register thermometers</hi> have been devised. The best known of
                    these are the thermometers of Six and of Rutherford. (See the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Meteorology,</hi> Plate CCCLIV. fig. 6 and 7.) A modification
                    of Six’s thermometer, rendering springs to the indices unnecessary, has been
                    constructed by Professor Traill, in which the indices slide in slightly inclined
                    tubes, as will be easily understood from No. 16.</p><p>As in Six’s thermometer, the expansions of alkohol are the measure of the
                    temperature; the indices, of iron wire, enclosed in glass tubes, are moved by a
                    short column of mercury; and they are adjusted for a fresh observation by
                    bringing them to the extremities of the mercurial column with a magnet.</p><p>The atmosphere itself is invisible; but the column of air interposed between the
                    eye and distant objects invests them with an azure hue. This tint depends upon
                    the great- <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> er refrangibility of the blue rays of
                    light than of those towards the other end of the spectrum. When a ray of white
                    or undecomposed light enters our atmosphere, the red and yellow rays pass with
                    little deviation from a rectilineal course; but the blue rays are dispersed in
                    the air, and affect the colour of objects beheld through a long column of the
                    atmosphere. As we ascend lofty mountains, the refractive power of the air
                    diminishes with its density, and hence the blue tint is lost in the blackness
                    produced by the want of refraction; until a traveller, on the ridges of the
                    Alps, the Andes, or the Himalaya, will perceive the sky to assume a hue
                    approaching to deep blue or black. Saussure has described this phenomenon, and
                    invented the <hi rend="italic">Cyanometer</hi><hi rend="italic subscript">
                    i</hi> an instrument for measuring the intensity of the colour of the sky. (See
                    the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Cyanometer.)</hi> The form will be best
                    understood from No. 17.</p><pb break="no" facs="nls:193497990" xml:id="kp-eb0717-7990-0531"/><p>With this instrument Saussure found a numerical value for the colour of the sky
                    at different places. Thus it was at Geneva = 17°, at Chamouni = 19°, on Col du
                    Géant = 31, and on Mont Blanc, at the height of 15,750 feet, it was = 39°. It
                    also showed that the intensity of the colour varied at the same place at
                    different times. The intensity of the colour is greatest at the zenith. It
                    increases towards mid-day, more rapidly on mountains than on plains; and the
                    difference between morning and mid-day is then also greatest; but the whole
                    difference is most considerable in plains.</p><p>The following comparative tables of observations on Col du Géant, and at Geneva,
                    illustrate these points. The first column shows the degrees above the horizon,

                    employing thin films of blue glass in constructing a cyanometer. The first
                    degree was formed of a single film enclosed between plates of thin crown glass,
                    and each succeeding degree consisted of an additional film.</p><p>To the refractive power of the atmosphere we owe the splendours of sunrise and
                    sunset. When the sun is on the horizon his beams reach the eye through a long
                    column of dense air; the more refrangible rays are dispersed, and the eye
                    receives the red and orange rays undiluted, especially through the serene air of
                    a summer evening. As the brilliant hues of sunset melt away, the blue tone which
                    the atmosphere had acquired by the dispersion of the most refrangible rays, but
                    which was lost in the splendour of sunset, gradually reappears. and, mingling
                    with the ruddy gleam, sheds the purple hght of evening on the softened
                    landscape. As the sun descends more below the horizon the purple colour fades
                    away, and gradually gives place to the “faint erroneous ray,” that “flings half
                    an image on the strained eye.”</p><p>Atmospherical air was long considered as a simple substance, one of the elements
                    of other matter; but the discoveries of Black, Cavendish, Priestley, Scheele,
                    and Lavoisier, have proved it to be a compound, of which the principal
                    constituents are oxygene and nitrogene gases, usually estimated at twenty-one
                    volumes of the former to seventy-nine of the latter. Dr Black discovered that
                    the atmosphere always contained carbonic acid, which was found to exist in
                    slightly variable proportions; and it holds water suspended in the state of
                    vapour, in proportions which are still more fluctuating. If we average the two
                    last ingredients, the composition of the atmosphere may be stated as
                    follows:</p><table><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"/><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Volume.</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Weight.</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>h⅛i trogen e</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>= 77∙50....</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>,.. = 75∙55</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Oxygene</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>= 21∙00....</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>.. = 23∙32</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Carbonic acid..</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>0∙08....</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>.. = 0∙10</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Aqueous vapour</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>1∙42....</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>..= 1∙03</p></cell></row></table><p>The manner in which these different ingredients are united has given rise to some
                    controversy. The opinion once generally entertained was, that they were united
                    by an affinity between their particles, like that which forms chemical
                    compounds. The celebrated Dr Dalton first suggested the theory, that of the
                    various elastic fluids constituting the atmosphere, the particles of one are
                    neither retractive nor repellent of the particles of another; but that the
                    pressure upon any one particle of such a mixture is entirely derived from
                    particles of the same kind of matter. Each fluid, on this view, is considered as
                    occupying the same space as it would in a vacuum; and each constituent of the
                    atmosphere, under a mean barometrical pressure of thirty inches, as exerting its
                    own separate pressure in the following proportions, depending on its own
                    quantity and specific gravity. Thus, the</p><table><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Nitrogene would exert a pressure....,</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>.... = 23∙36</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Oxygene</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>... = 6∙18</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"/><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"/></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Carbonic acid</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>... = 0∙02</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Aqueous vapour .</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>.... = 0∙44</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"/><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>30∙00<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Manchester Memoirs, vol. v∙ See the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Atmosphere.</hi></p></note></p></cell></row></table><p>Soon after the composition of the atmosphere was detected, and the qualities of
                    oxygene in supporting combustion and respiration were understood, it was
                    conceived that important modifications of disease might depend on or originate
                    in the varying proportions of this essential ingredient in the air; and various
                    methods were devised for analysing atmospheric air, and ascertaining the
                    quantity of oxygene it contained. 1. Dr Priestley devised a method of doing this
                    by the <hi rend="italic">eudiometer,</hi> or measure of the purity of the air.
                    His method consisted in adding, in a graduated tube, fifty-five volumes of
                    nitric gas to a hundred of atmospheric air. The property of this gas is to
                    abstract oxygene from the air, and to form nitrous acid, which is absorbed by
                    water; and the amount of the diminution marked the quantity of oxygene in the
                    air. 2. Gay-Lussac improved Priestley’s eudiometer. Instead of adding the nitric
                    gas in the graduated tube, he mixed a hundred volumes of the gas with as much of
                    the air to be analysed, in a wide jar, and transferred this mixture to the
                    graduated tube to ascertain the diminution; on dividing the residual air by
                    four, he obtained the amount of the oxygene present in the air. 3. Scheele
                    employed the sulphurct of potassa for the same purpose. 4. Seguin used the rapid
                    combustion of phosphorus; and, 5. Volta exploded a mixture of hydrogene and air
                    by means of an electrical spark. This is one of the most elegant and accurate of
                    the eudiometers. He recommends a mixture of 200 volumes of hydrogene with 300 of
                    air. On passing an <pb break="no" facs="nls:193498003" xml:id="kp-eb0717-8003-0532"/>electric spark through the wires in the top of the
                    jar, the hydrogene is fired, instantly forms water with the oxygene of the
                    included air, and, in ordinary cases, the diminution of volume of the mixture
                    amounts to 195, of which one third is oxygene, or sixty-five parts of oxygene
                    have been lost by 300 of air, or about twenty-one per cent.</p><p>6. Dr Hope’s eudiometer consists of a graduated tube exactly ground to a small
                    tubulated phial. The bottle may be filled, either with hydrosulphuret of
                    potassa, or with a liquid proposed by Davy (which is formed by saturating
                    sulphate of iron in solution with nitric gas.) The air is in the tube, which is
                    inserted in the phial; the instrument is inverted; the air, now in the phial, is
                    agitated with the liquid for a few minutes, and on opening the tubulature of the
                    phial, below the surface of the liquid, the amount of the oxygene absorbed will
                    be indicated on the graduated tube. This very neat instrument has been modified
                    by Dr Henry, who substituted a bottle of caoutchouc for the phial. Any of these
                    instruments, especially 18 or 19, will show the quantity of oxygene in any given
                    air; but it has been found that the quantity of oxygene of the air is little
                    subject to variation, and that gas is equally present on mountains and in
                    plains, in the town or in the country, except in confined situations, where fuel
                    is burning, or many animals respiring. Air which is very deleterious to man has
                    no sensible difference in the proportion of the oxygene from the purest
                    atmosphere; and we must probably look to other causes than this for the
                    unwholesomeness of the atmosphere.</p><p>The quantity of carbonic acid in the atmosphere is subject to slight variation,
                    except in confined apartments. Dr Dalton found it only varying from <hi rend="subscript"> τ</hi> ⅛ <hi rend="subscript"> 7j</hi> th to <hi rend="subscript"> τ</hi> θ⅛ <hi rend="subscript"> σ</hi> th of the whole air, an
                    uniformity which is surprising, considering how much carbonic acid is constantly
                    formed during respiration and combustion. Perhaps this may be partly owing to
                    our imperfect modes of ascertaining very minute changes in its quantity. If we
                    are to give credit to the experiments of the younger Saussure, the quantity in
                    the atmosphere is greater in summer than in winter, by 2∙3 volumes in 10,000;
                    but his experiments are not generally considered as satisfactory, in a case
                    where the difference appears so great, and the point so difficult of
                    determination. Even the experiments of Dalton are not considered as decisive;
                    for lime-water does not appear to be capable of abstracting all the carbonic
                    acid from air, as was remarked by Cavendish; and philosophers have generally
                    considered the quantity as ranging from ^½ <hi rend="subscript"> s</hi> th to
                    <hi rend="subscript"> τδ</hi> ⅛^th of the whole atmosphere. In confined
                    apartments, however, the quantity of carbonic acid is sometimes much increased,
                    while the oxygene is consumed in the process of combustion and respiration; and
                    this double vitiation of the air may give rise to fatal consequences, as was too
                    well illustrated in the catastrophe of our unfortunate countrymen in the dungeon
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Black Hole</hi> in Calcutta in 1756, and in one which
                    happened to persons confined in St Martin’s Roundhouse in London in 1742. In the
                    celebrated <hi rend="italic">Grotta del Cane,</hi> the carbonic acid which
                    issues from crevices in the floor fills the bottom of the cave to the level of
                    the entrance, and then flows out by its superior gravity, so that the upper part
                    is free of the noxious impregnations. A man enters with impunity, because his
                    head is above the stratum of carbonic acid; but the air of the cave is speedily
                    fatal to a dog, because the prone position of his air-passages brings his
                    respiratory organs into contact with the gas. It is remarkable that these gases
                    do not appear to vary considerably in their relative proportions in any part of
                    the accessible atmosphere. Air collected on the summit of Mont Blanc was
                    analysed by the younger Saussure, and agreed in the proportions of the gases
                    with that of Geneva; and the same uniformity was found in air from Spain by De
                    Marti, from Egypt and France by Bertholet, from the coast of Guinea and England
                    by Davy, from the summit of Teneriffe and the ridges of the Equinoxial Andes by
                    Humboldt.</p><p>The quantity of aqueous vapour in the atmosphere is liable to far greater
                    variations than that of the other constituents. Water in the state of vapour is
                    invariably present; but the proportion is modified by the temperature, and by
                    changes in the barometric pressure of the air. The process by which water finds
                    its way into the atmosphere is one of the highest importance, and has obtained
                    the name of <hi rend="italic">Spontaneous Evaporation.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> If water be exposed to the air, it gradually disappears; and if this be
                    carried on in closed vessels, the air is found to have taken up water, which may
                    again be obtained by the action of certain substances that have a great affinity
                    for water. The principal substances which have been employed for abstracting
                    water from air are, sulphuric acid, quicklime, chloride of lime, and carbonate
                    of potassa. If given proportions of any of these be enclosed in a vessel
                    containing air, they absorb the moisture of that air; and the weight they thus
                    acquire has been taken as the measure of the quantity of its water. The same is
                    estimated by the quantity of water which is absorbed by a given volume of air
                    thus artificially dried. Some very careful experiments on this subject were made
                    by Saussure, who inferred that a cubic foot of air, at temperature 65°
                    Fahrenheit, when fully saturated with moisture, holds eleven grains of water
                    dissolved. Notwithstanding the acknowledged accuracy and patience of this
                    philosopher, we are inclined to prefer the method of Dr Dalton (founded on the
                    suggestion of Le Roy of Montpellier), of observing the temperature at which
                    moisture begins to be separated from the air. This is termed the <hi rend="italic">Dew-point</hi> of that atmosphere, and forms an important element
                    in several interesting problems in meteorology. Dalton had shown, that the water
                    existing in the atmosphere has precisely the same elasticity as it would assume
                    in a vacuum at the same temperature; hence it is obvious that it exists in the
                    air, not as water, but as elastic vapour. But the elasticity of vapour is
                    demonstrated to depend on temperature; and, therefore, if we could measure the
                    elasticity, we could determine the quantity of water in the atmosphere. This
                    elasticity is measured by the <hi rend="italic">Manometer,</hi> a barometer the
                    cistern of which is enclosed in the vessel containing the air, and therefore
                    only affected by the variations of elasticity of the included air. Deductions
                    from these experiments have been given in a tabular form in the Manchester
                    Society’s Transactions.</p><p>In the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Hygrometry</hi> there is another table of
                    great value, showing the elasticity, weight, and rate of expansion of aqueous
                    vapour, in air saturated with moisture, at each degree of Fahrenheit’s
                    thermometer, from 0° to 100°, which was intended by the author of that treatise
                    to facilitate hygrometrical investigations. In this table the elasticity of the
                    vapour is calculated on a formula deduced by Biot from Dalton’s experiments.</p><p>The quantity of water suspended in the air is liable to great variation, from
                    several natural causes; and it is chiefly liable to be deposited or separated,
                    on a diminution of the capacity of the air for moisture, by a reduction of its
                    temperature. Warm air is capable of taking up, in the state of invisible vapour,
                    more water than cold air. Thus a cubic foot of saturated air, at 32°, contains
                    of watery vapour 2∙350 grains; at 60°, 5∙825 grains; at 70°, 7∙941 grains. When
                    the temperature of the air is diminished, as, for instance, by mingling with
                    colder currents in the atmosphere, a quantity of water is separated; and,
                    according to the suddenness<pb break="no" facs="nls:193498016" xml:id="kp-eb0717-8016-0533"/> of the change, will be suspended in the form of
                    visible clouds, or precipitated in fogs or rain.</p><p>Changes in the density of the air also affect its capacity for retaining
                    moisture. Evaporation is quicker, everything else remaining unchanged, in rare
                    than in dense air. Saussure found, that water evaporated quicker on the Col du
                    Géant, which is 11,275 feet above the sea, than at Geneva, which is but 1324
                    feet above that level, in the proportion of eighty-four to thirty-seven. Light
                    air then speedily becomes charged with moisture, which slight changes in
                    temperature are ready to precipitate; and hence a falling barometer is often the
                    immediate precursor of rain.</p><p>When atmospheric air approaches its point of saturation with moisture,
                    evaporation goes on slowly, at length ceases, and a slight diminution of
                    temperature is sufficient to precipitate a portion of water on contiguous
                    bodies; we then term the air <hi rend="italic">damp</hi> or <hi rend="italic">moist.</hi> This change is not always to be immediately recognised by our
                    sensations; and as the change is important to the success of some processes in
                    the arts, and also to health, philosophers have invented instruments for
                    indicating the approaches of the air to saturation, which have been named <hi rend="italic">Hygrometers,</hi> or measures of moisture. The change in bulk
                    which some vegetable and animal substances undergo, in moist air, has been
                    employed for this purpose. The most common are the twisting and untwisting of a
                    cord of flax or hemp by moisture and dryness; the movements of the natural twist
                    in the beard of the wild oat, <hi rend="italic">avena fatua</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> in the Indian grass, <hi rend="italic">andropogon</hi><hi rend="italic">contortum,</hi> proposed by Captain Kater; or the arista of the
                    seed of <hi rend="italic">stipa pennata</hi> (a common inmate of our gardens,
                    and often found in our fields), proposed by Dr Cumming of Denbigh. Unfortunately
                    these substances, though indicating minute changes in the air, are incapable of
                    forming <hi rend="italic">comparable</hi> hygrometers, and gradually become less
                    and less sensible to the influence of humidity. The same may be said of the
                    animal substances which have been employed in the construction of such
                    instruments. The most simple of the animal hygrometers is Wilson’s, formed of a
                    rat’s bladder fixed to a glass tube, and filled with mercury to a certain point
                    on the tube when the bladder is moist. As it dries, the contraction of the
                    bladder raises the mercury in the tube. Still more delicate hygrometers were
                    formed by Saussure and De Luc, on nearly the same construction. (See the article
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Hygrometry.)</hi> Saussure employed a fine human hair,
                    freed from unctuous matter by boiling in a weak alkaline solution; and De Luc
                    used a slip of whalebone, scraped extremely thin. These animal bodies lengthen
                    by moisture; and, in both instruments, one end of the hygrometric substance was
                    fixed to the frame, while the other was attached to a fine flat wire lapped
                    round an index made to move along a graduated arc by the varying length of the
                    hygrometric substance. In Saussure’s instrument, the index was brought back by a
                    small weight as a counterpoise; and the same was effected in De Luc’s by a
                    spiral gold-wire spring. Both instruments were graduated by placing them in a
                    jar filled with air saturated with moisture, and then in air dried by quicklime,
                    or some similar body; and the space between these extreme points was divided
                    into 100°, or any given number of degrees.</p><p>The imperfection of these instruments, when made by the hands of the inventors
                    with every care, rendered it difficult to have two that gave the same
                    indications under similar circumstances; and the still more fatal objection,
                    that they become altered by time in mobility and delicacy of indication.
                    Although both Gay-Lussac and Biot have endeavoured to show the relation between
                    the indications of the hair hygrometer and the quantity of moisture in the air,
                    we cannot consider the instrument as entitled to confidence.</p><p>A very elegant hygrometer was invented by Daniel, founded on the determination of
                    the temperature at which dew begins to be deposited; but for the description of
                    it we must refer to the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Hygrometry,</hi> as well as
                    for an ingenious substitute devised by Mr Adie of Edinburgh, and another by Μ.
                    Pouillet. All these depend on the dewpoint; and all are liable to the objection,
                    that it is difficult to determine the precise degree at which dew begins to be
                    formed, especially at low temperatures. The original idea of obtaining a measure
                    of the hygrometric state of the air from comparing the indications of a
                    thermometer with its bulb moist and dry, is certainly due to Dr James Hutton,
                    the celebrated geologist. This eminent philosopher made use of a single
                    thermometer, which he carried enclosed in a glass case. This form of hygrometer,
                    neglected for thirty years, has at length become an object of philosophic
                    interest in this country and Germany; and two thermometers are now mounted on
                    the same scale, and the indications of the wet and dry bulbs seen at the same
                    time. This instrument has been termed a <hi rend="italic">psychrometer.</hi> The
                    most elegant form of an instrument on this principle is the hygrometer of Sir
                    John Leslie, or double air-thermometer; one of the balls is covered with tissue
                    paper, defended by a thin covering of blue silk, while the other is naked; but
                    in order to obviate the effect of light, the dry ball is formed of pale-blue
                    glass. This instrument is described in his original paper, and fully in the
                    article <hi rend="smallcaps">Meteorology</hi> of this work. When the covered
                    ball is moistened with water, the evaporation produces a degree of cold in
                    proportion to the dryness of the ambient air; and the air within that ball
                    contracting, the elasticity of the air in the other ball pushes the coloured
                    fluid in the stem towards the covered ball. This transference is marked on a
                    scale, each degree of which is equivalent to -⅛th of a centigrade thermometrical
                    degree. This hygrometer does not indicate the absolute <hi rend="italic">dryness</hi> of the atmosphere, but only the degree of dryness it has after
                    being reduced to the temperature of the humid ball. In the article to which we
                    have just referred, there are tables given ‘for correcting the indications of
                    Leslie’s hygrometer, and showing the point of saturation at different centesimal
                    degrees, and the corresponding degrees of the hygrometer.</p><p>The instrument gives excellent comparative results; and two or three minutes are
                    sufficient to bring the fluid to equilibrium, which marks the full effect of the
                    evaporation; and no farther sinking of the hygrometer is produced by keeping the
                    ball bedewed with moisture. In winter, in our climate, it ranges from 5° to 25°;
                    in our summer from 15° to 55°. It has occasionally been observed as high as 80°
                    or even 90°, and in thick fogs it falls to the beginning of the scale: it rises
                    when the weather clears up after rain, and in long tracts of clear warm weather
                    it remains high. It always falls before rain, and remains low during wet
                    weather. When as low as 15°, the air feels damp; when it is between 30° and 40°,
                    we should term the weather <hi rend="italic">dry</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi>
                    from 50° to 60°, <hi rend="italic">very dry;</hi> and from 70° upwards, it would
                    be called <hi rend="italic">intensely dry.</hi> In a warm inhabited apartment
                    the hygrometer would not be below 50°; but when below 30°, that room would be
                    felt to be uncomfortably damp.</p><p>The mean annual evaporation is an interesting subject, for an approximation to
                    which we are mainly indebted to the experiments of Dr Dalton and Mr Hoyle, at
                    Manchester, in 1796, 1797, and 1798. A cylindrical vessel of tinned iron, three
                    feet deep and ten inches in diameter, was filled with soil; it was provided with
                    one pipe near the bottom, and another one inch from the top. This was left in
                    this state for a year, until it became covered with grass. Bottles were now
                    applied to the end of each pipe, so as to collect both the surplus water which
                    soaked through the earth, and that which ran off at the upper pipe. The soil <pb break="no" facs="nls:193498029" xml:id="kp-eb0717-8029-0534"/> was
                    soaked with water on commencing the experiment; a rain gage of similar

Dr Dalton considers
                    that we ought to add five inches to this for the annual dew, which will raise
                    the evaporation to about thirty inches.</p><p>From the nature of our climate, the mean annual evaporation over the globe cannot
                    be estimated at less than thirty-four; and this would make the whole mass of
                    water raised from the surface of the earth equal to 105,614∙72 cubic miles, or
                    equal to all the rain that falls upon the globe. The evaporation of any place
                    may be ascertained by exposing freely to the air a given quantity of water in a
                    shallow circular dish, accurately turned, so as to have 100 inches of
                    superficies. It should be so placed as not to receive any rain: on measuring the
                    remainder once a week or once a month, we shall obtain the evaporation.</p><p>There is reason to believe that the evaporation from the foliage of trees and
                    from herbage is somewhat greater than from an equal area of water, and that the
                    quantity from the surface of new-ploughed land is almost equal to what arises
                    from water; but we have got no good comparative experiments on this subject.</p><p>Having considered the conversion of water into an elastic fluid, let us turn our
                    attention to the mode by which it is re-converted into moisture.</p><p>1. <hi rend="italic">Clouds.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> Some have accounted
                    for the suspension of so dense a fluid as water in air, on the supposition that
                    the vapour in clouds existed in the shape of hollow spherules, filled with a
                    lighter fluid than the atmosphere; but this suggestion would seem to be devised
                    rather to meet the difficulty than to be supported by observation; and it is
                    possible to explain the considerable durability of clouds without recourse to
                    any such gratuitous assumption.</p><p>The experiments of Volta and Cavallo have shown, that when water is converted
                    into vapour, not only is caloric absorbed, but electricity is also developed.
                    The vapour acquires positive electricity, and the remaining fluid possesses the
                    opposite electric state. By the process of evaporation much electric fluid must
                    be carried into the atmosphere; and when the capacity of the vapour for
                    electricity is diminished by its partial condensation by cold in the upper
                    regions of the air, it may be conceived that the spherules of vapour may become
                    surrounded with atmospheres of electric fluid, the mutual repulsions of which
                    may prevent the coalescing of the particles of vapour into drops so heavy as to
                    descend by their gravity on the earth, especially as a stratum of air charged
                    with moisture is specifically lighter than dry air at the same temperature. The
                    form of clouds, and their different degrees of aggregation, may depend on the
                    electric tension of the atmospheres surrounding the particles of which they are
                    composed; or on a balance between the electric repulsions and the gravitation of
                    the particles for each other. This view is favoured by the generally positively
                    electrified state of the atmosphere when clouds are forming, the heavy falls of
                    rain which accompany electric explosions when the discharge of the accumulated
                    electricity allows the coalescing of the moisture into heavy drops, as well as
                    by the peculiar odour of some kinds of fog, and the highly electric state such
                    fog often exhibits. Beccaria, Romayne, Bennet, and Volta have remarked, that the
                    atmosphere exhibits signs of electricity on the appearance of clouds and fogs.
                    Beccaria always found the electricity of the air <hi rend="italic">positive</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and Romayne states, that mere diminution of volume in
                    any substance is constantly attended with increased electrical tension. The
                    various forms of clouds, their aggregation in deep masses piled on each other,
                    or their dispersion in long radiated filaments, may be more easily explained on
                    an electric theory than on any other supposition; and the accidental manner in
                    which solar light is reflected from them to the eye of the spectator gives an
                    infinite diversity to their appearance.</p><p>The vulgar have long remarked the association of certain forms of clouds with the
                    state of the weather; and meteorologists have begun to appreciate the value of a
                    descriptive language for indicating their varied appearances. No system of
                    nomenclature has yet been applied to clouds superior to that proposed by Mr Lnke
                    Howard. He divides them into seven species. (See Plate CCCCXI.)</p><p>1. <hi rend="italic">Cirrus.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> A cloud resembling a
                    lock of hair or a feather, composed of parallel, flexuous, or diverging fibres,
                    unlimited in the direction of their increase.</p><p>2. <hi rend="italic">Cumulus.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> A cloud which
                    increases from above, in dense, convex, or conical heaps.</p><p>3. <hi rend="italic">Stratus.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> An extended,

                    spreading out into a crown of cirrus, and passing beneath into a shower.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Philosophical Magazine; Rees’
                    Cyclopaedia; Nicholson’s Journal, xxx.</p></note></p><p>The cirrus is generally formed of white radiated streaks, pencilled on an azure
                    sky. It is the most elevated species of cloud. Its motions are slow. It
                    generally indicates a breeze, and often precedes a storm. Horizontal sheets of
                    cirrus, with streamers pointing upwards, often indicate rain; while the
                    depending fringes are the precursors of fine weather.</p><p>The cumulus is generally a dense cloud, moving near the surface of the earth.
                    When large, this species often exhibits large intervening spaces of clear sky.
                    It begins in the morning, and obtains its maximum about two P. Μ, and usually
                    decreases before sunset, breaking up and disappearing before nightfall. It is
                    the prognostic of settled weather.</p><p>The stratus is the lowest modification of cloud, often creeping along the ground,
                    in calm evenings, from lakes and rivers, and rising toward the higher grounds.
                    It often, at night, travels over plains, invests the summits of moderate
                    elevations, but usually melts away before the mom-ing<pb break="no" facs="nls:193498042" xml:id="kp-eb0717-8042-0535"/> sun. Few days
                    are more serene than those ushered in by stratus.</p><p>Cirro-cumulus consists of dense rounded masses, in close position. It often forms
                    beds at different altitudes in the air. It is transient in winter, and occurs in
                    the intervals of summer showers. A frequent repetition of it is amongst the best
                    prognostics of fine weather.</p><p>The cirro-stratus is narrow in proportion to its horizontal length. It seldom
                    retains long the same form. It is often seen very high in the air, especially
                    that variety which is composed of grouped masses, and is chiefly seen in summer
                    evenings. When seen overhead, it has an uniform hazy appearance; but viewed on
                    the horizon, it often seems very dense, from being viewed edgewise. It indicates
                    rain or storms of snow when it is stationary. It often forms the seat of
                    rainbows and halos when descending from the zenith. It often shrouds mountain
                    summits, and in cold weather often descends into plains as soaking dense mist.
                    The cumulo-stratus usually appears in an overcast sky, and may be regarded as a
                    prognostic of rain. It appears to be formed by the successive blending of
                    cumuli, inlaced by streaks of dark stratus. The thunder-cloud is one
                    modification of this species. It often assumes a portentous size, and is
                    contorted into singular forms. Its indications are not uniform. When it appears
                    in the morning, the day is Often dry, though overcast; but when much mixed with
                    stratus, it indicates approaching rain, after some interval.</p><p>The nimbus is a shower seen in profile as it approaches the spectator from the
                    horizon. The thunder-cloud, on the discharge of its electricity, generally
                    passes into the nimbus.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Mists</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Fogs</hi> are but the
                    condensation of invisible vapour into minute drops of water. They are generally
                    more stationary on the sea than on the land. They are less frequent in the day
                    than the night, in hot than in cold climates; and they are frequent in
                    approaching the poles. One of the most remarkable stationary fogs is on that
                    part of the Atlantic called the <hi rend="italic">Banks of</hi><hi rend="italic">Newfoundland.</hi> The warm waters of the gulf-stream, after
                    sweeping along the shores of the United States, and warming the superincumbent
                    air, are encountered at Newfoundland by the polar currents, and the colder air
                    over them. The consequence of this intermixture of the aerial currents at
                    different temperatures, is the diminished capacity of the mixture for moisture,
                    and the consequent deposition of a portion of its vapour in the form of mist.
                    When the cold producing condensation of atmospheric moisture is intense, instead
                    of mist, a deposition of minute particles of ice may take place, and will cover
                    with delicate crystallizations the hair and clothes of the traveller, or the
                    twigs and branches of trees. When the air is saturated with moisture, sudden
                    condensation assumes the form of <hi rend="italic">Ram.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> Amongst the numerous speculations on the production of rain, one of the
                    most ingenious is that proposed by Dr James Hutton. He evidently considered the
                    water as <hi rend="italic">dissolved</hi> by the air; but if we merely consider
                    the term “complete saturation with moisture” as meaning the dewpoint, and the
                    quantity suspended by air as indicating the quantity of vapour existing in the
                    atmosphere at a given temperature by its own elasticity, this phraseology will
                    produce no error. Hutton ascribed rain to the intermingling of air saturated
                    with moisture at different temperatures. His views were communicated to the
                    Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1787; but, from his contenting himself with a mere
                    enunciation of his theory, it has been scarcely noticed by meteorologists, until
                    illustrated in the articles <hi rend="smallcaps">Meteorology</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Hygrometry.</hi> Sir John Leslie has shown, that the mere
                    commixture of air at different temperatures would produce but a small part of
                    the effect perceived. It is proved by experiment that the capacity of air for
                    moisture, or the quantity of vapour in a given space, increases in'a much higher
                    ratio than the temperature; and hence, if the space occupied by the mixture of
                    masses of moist <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> air, at different temperatures,
                    have the mean temperature of the mixture, or one below it, a deposition of
                    moisture or of rain will follow; but the whole effect would be smaller than what
                    is often observed to take place, unless we suppose that two currents of air are
                    moving, with considerable velocity, in opposite directions.</p><p>The objection to this simple view of the question is, that there are often heavy
                    falls of rain when the clouds emitting it are evidently in very slow movement;
                    and we have long believed, that without calling in the aid of electricity, as
                    already stated when treating of the formation of clouds, no theory of rain will
                    be satisfactory.</p><p>The hygrometric water in the air seems to owe its suspension to the repulsions
                    among the electric atmospheres of its particles: when that electricity is
                    withdrawn by any cause, the particles of water, no longer kept asunder by their
                    electricity, coalesce, and descend by their gravity with a force proportional to
                    their quantity and the reduction of their electric tension. If the electric
                    fluid be slowly withdrawn, there is neither lightning nor any explosion; but if
                    the accumulation has been great, and the abstraction sudden, we have the
                    phenomena of thunder and lightning. On this view, evaporation is to be
                    considered as the grand mode by which the atmosphere acquires electricity, and
                    the accumulation seems in general in proportion to the intensity and duration of
                    the evaporation. Hence lightning is most common and vivid in warm latitudes; and
                    there is seldom any considerable electric discharge from the atmosphere, without
                    a concomitant fall of rain, which is usually proportional to the violence of the
                    thunder-storm.</p><p>Rain falls in drops of a size varying from ⅛th to ½d of an inch in diameter; and
                    it has been calculated that their ultimate velocity is in the duplicate ratio of
                    their diameters. When formed high in the atmosphere, or passing through very
                    cold strata of air, they congeal into hail or into snow.</p><p>To ascertain the quantity of rain which falls in any place in a given time,
                    various species of <hi rend="italic">ombrometers</hi> or <hi rend="italic">rain-gages</hi> have been employed. The most usual form of the gage is that
                    represented in No. 21. It consists of a cylindrical vessel of copper, usually
                    3∙75 of an inch in diameter. Upon its upper part, a funnel of the same metal,
                    with an upright brim exactly one foot in diameter, is fitted; a hollow vessel of
                    metal, or a piece of cork, serves as a float, to support a rod of boxwood
                    graduated in tenths of an inch. The water which falls into the funnel finds its
                    way into the cylinder, and raises the float. The quantity is read off the rod at
                    a stay placed across the funnel, and from the relative proportion of the
                    cylinder and funnel, each -⅛th of an inch is equivalent to <hi rend="subscript">
                    τ</hi> ⅛ <hi rend="subscript"> u</hi> th of an inch of water entering the mouth
                    of the funnel.</p><p>Another very convenient form is represented in No. 22., where the <pb break="no" facs="nls:193498055" xml:id="kp-eb0717-8055-0536"/>height of the
                    column of water in the cylinder is seen in a glass tube connected with the
                    cylinder below. A scale is applied, as in the figure; and when the observation
                    is made, the water is let off by the stop-cock.</p><p>Mr Luke Howard’s raingage is seen in No. 23. The funnel is fitted on the neck of
                    a glass bottle, by means of an exterior tube, which is soldered to the funnel,
                    and prevents the entrance of water into the vessel, except through the mouth of
                    the funnel. The quantity of rain is ascertained by a graduated glass measure,
                    the divisions of which correspond to 100ths of an inch, falling on the mouth of
                    the funnel. This same measure will serve to ascertain the quantity evaporated in
                    a given time, provided the mouth of the vessel, No. 20, is exactly equal to the
                    mouth of the rain-gage.</p><p>There are considerable practical difficulties in the proper position of a
                    rain-gage. It is found, that if one be placed on the ground, and another on the
                    top of a building, that which is in the lowest position will almost always
                    indicate more rain than the upper. Thus, the quantity collected in a gage on the
                    top of York Minster, from February 1833 to February 1834, only equals 14∙963
                    inches, while perfectly similar instruments placed on the top of the museum of
                    that city, and on the ground, gave relatively 19∙852, and 25∙706 inches. The
                    elevations of the first and second stations are 212 feet 10^ inches and 43 feet
                    8 inches above the surface. These differences are too considerable to be
                    attributed to any thing but somé imperfection in the instrument when much
                    èxposed to gales of wind; and it probably arises from eddies being formed round
                    the rim of the funnel, which divert part of the water. On the whole, the most
                    accurate estimate of the quantity of rain will be obtained from instruments
                    placed on the ground, or near it. The larger the recipient surface, the more
                    accurate will be the indications; and on this principle, General Sir Thomas
                    Brisbane, president of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, collects the rain from
                    the roof of his observatory (the area of which has been accurately ascertained),
                    for measuring the quantity of rain which falls in his vicinity.</p><p>When the quantity of rain which falls at any place has been regularly kept for
                    several years, it is easy to obtain the mean annual quantity at that place. The
                    multiplication of such observations has proved, that the mean annual quantity is
                    greatest in tropical climates, and diminishes as we recede from the equator.

                    have been mentioned by different observers. Wormius records such a shower as
                    occurring at Copenhagen in May 1646; but the same phenomenon occurred in May
                    1804; and the philosophers of our own age, on analyzing this deposit, recognised
                    it to consist of a vegetable pollen, resembling the powder of <hi rend="italic">lycopodium.</hi> This substance fell in the night time, and, being
                    phosphorescent when observed, gave considerable alarm. At Bordeaux, in 1761, a
                    shower of a yellow powder was observed, which, however, was recognised as the
                    pollen of the pine forests in the neighbouring <hi rend="italic">landes,</hi>
                    carried up into the air by a violent gale. Of a similar nature, in all
                    probability, was the <hi rend="italic">yellow rain</hi> which covered the Lake
                    of Zurich in 1677.</p><p>The supposed <hi rend="italic">showers of blood</hi> which have been record-1 ed

                    insects, which are sometimes carried down in great quantity with rain. The
                    appearance of drops of blood falling from the air has occasionally been produced
                    by the red excrement of insects. That small frogs and fishes have occasionally
                    descended with rain has been admitted, as such animals, and even much more

                    distinguished by one remarkable similarity, viz. their containing an alloy of
                    iron and nickel, generally with twenty-five of the former to six or eight of the
                    latter.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Dew</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> The phenomena and cause of
                    this deposition have engaged the attention of philosophers from the time of
                    Aristotle; but their speculations present little that is satisfactory until the
                    experimental investigations of Dr Wells. One of the most remarkable
                    circumstances attending the deposition of dew is, that the bodies on which it is
                    found have invariably a lower temperature than the ambient air, as was first
                    pointed out by Dr Patrick Wilson of Glasgow, who ascribed the coldness to the
                    deposition of dew; but Dr Wells has proved that the cooling of these bodies
                    below the temperature of the air always <hi rend="italic">precedes the formation
                    of the dew,</hi> and is, in fact, the cause of this aqueous meteor. His theory
                    is founded on Leslie’s view of the neat which is sent off from the earth toward
                    a clear sky; and on this simple principle Wells has been enabled to give a
                    satisfactory explanation of the phenomena of dew.</p><p>The essential requisites for the deposition of dew are five in number, viz.</p><p>1. An atmosphere replete with moisture. As dew is a deposition of water from the
                    air, it obviously must be in excess ere it is deposited. In Egypt, the south
                    winds, blowing over extensive tracts of sandy desert, deposit no dew; but when
                    the <hi rend="italic">Etesian</hi> or north wind blows, loaded with moisture
                    from the Mediterranean, the deposition of dew in lower Egypt is sufficient to
                    soak through the garments of the inhabitants; and in the arid plains of New
                    Castille the dews are far less copious than on the coasts of Andalusia.</p><p>2. There must be a considerable difference between the temperature of the earth
                    in the night and the day. Other things being the same, the deposition is
                    greatest when a cool evening succeeds a sultry day·. In our climate, the dews
                    are most abundant in spring and autumn, when the difference of temperature is
                    greatest; but as the ratio of the increase of moisture in the air is greater
                    than the increase of heat, hot climates have more copious dews than Great
                    Britain, even though the difference between diurnal and nocturnal temperature be
                    less in the former. Thus we have found the dews in the south of Spain, and in
                    Marocco, far more copious than here; a short exposure about sunset in those
                    countries completely soaking one through the clothes.</p><p>3. But the most essential requisite for the deposition of dew is, that the bodies
                    upon which it forms should have their temperature considerably lower than that
                    of the ambient air. In repeating Wilson’s experiments, Dr Wells found that all
                    bodies on which dew formed were colder than the air by 10° or 15°. Thus, in
                    clear weather, he observed that a thermometer laid on grass was 12° lower than
                    one laid on mould, and sixteen and a half beloav one on a gravel walk. He always
                    found that the coldness of the body preceded the deposition of dew; and this is
                    illustrated by the deposition of moisture which immediately takes place on
                    pouring into a glass cylinder, placed in a warm, moist room, very cold
                    water.</p><p>4. A serene and cloudless sky is also very favourable to the formation of dew.
                    Wells found, that although the atmosphere be in other respects favourable to the
                    deposition, yet little or none is formed if the sky be veiled in clouds; and, in
                    such cases, the temperature of objects on the surface was near that of the air.
                    He points out how clouds act as a screen to intercept the emanations be tween
                    the eaι∙th and the upper regions of the air, which are well known to be the
                    abodes of perpetual congelation.' The same effect was produced by interposing
                    screens of an opake material between the sky and the surface of the earth. Thus
                    a thermometer, laid on a table, indicated a lower temperature than one placed on
                    the ground under the table; and a lock of wool laid on the table collected ten
                    grains of dew, whilst an equal weight of wool placed under the table gained only
                    two grains. Fogs, acting also as screens, intercept the influence of the sky;
                    and though in themselves moist, they are unfavourable to the deposition of true
                    dew, which may be regarded as water separated from the inferior stratum of air;
                    but fogs, like rain, are precipitated from the general mass of the
                    superincumbent air.</p><p>The effect of clouds in preventing the radiation of heat is beautifully
                    illustrated by carrying Professor Leslie’s elegant invention, the Aethrioscope,
                    into the open air. Every cloud that passes the zenith affects this delicate
                    instrument, which rapidly loses its heat when exposed to the clear sky; or the
                    effect is still more conspicuous if the operator hold a parasol, and alternately
                    extend the aethrioscope beyond the shade and withdraw it under the parasol.</p><p>5. Serene and calm weather is favourable to the formation of dew; a fact which
                    had been noticed by Aristotle. The influence of wind seems to depend on the
                    rapid succession of aerial particles preventing the full influence of the
                    cooling medium on the general temperature of an inferior stratum of the
                    atmosphere. Every circumstance which favours radiation is favourable to the
                    deposition of dew, such as a rough surface, and dark colour; proving the
                    dependence of dew on the cooling of the objects on which it is deposited.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Wells’s Essay on Dew, London,
                    1814.</p></note></p><p>Dew often partakes of the sensible qualities of the bodies upon which it is
                    found; hence dew-water is very apt to putrefy. Some substances found on plants
                    have been erroneously confounded with dew. What is termed <hi rend="italic">honey-dew</hi> generally owes its qualities to the saccharine exudation from
                    the bodies of the insects called <hi rend="italic">Aphides. Υhejelly-dew</hi> is
                    believed to be the original form of a cryptogamian vegetable production, the <hi rend="italic">Tremella nostoc</hi> of Linnaeus; a membranous, pellucid,
                    greenish-yellow matter, about one or two inches in width, which is at first
                    moist and soft to the touch, but dries into a blackish membrane.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Snow.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> When the congelation of
                    moisture takes place slowly, the flakes of snoav assume very symmetrical
                    figures, the varieties of which have been well represented in the work of
                    Scoresby. They usually present modifications or combinations of the hexangular
                    prisms, often consisting of a star of six rays, formed of prisms united at
                    angles of 60°; and from these other prisms shoot, at similar angles,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Scoresby’s Arctic Regions,
                    vol. i.</p></note> ® giving the whole a plumose appearance, of exquisite beauty,
                    and often of surprising regularity.</p><p>The quantity of snow which falls in any place is not proportional to the height
                    of its latitude. In many temperate countries, the successive falls of snow,
                    during a winter, may often greatly exceed in depth what falls in the same period
                    in countries between the 65th and 80th degrees of latitude. In fact, it bears
                    some proportion to the evaporation in countries where the winter temperature is
                    below the freezing point of water. Snow is extremely useful, in cold climates,
                    as a loose and spongy covering of a white colour, in preventing the loss of
                    terrestrial heat by radiation, and in defending the surface from the frigorifie
                    influence of very cold winds.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Hail</hi> differs from snow chiefly in its state of
                    aggregation, and its far less regular crystalline form. It appears, indeed, to
                    be the production of sudden and intense cold in the <pb break="no" facs="nls:193498081" xml:id="kp-eb0717-8081-0538"/>higher regions
                    of the atmosphere, and therefore often occurs in warm climates, where snow is
                    utterly unknown. A hail shower is often ushered in by a rattling noise, heard
                    over head, before almost any hailstones have reached the ground. The ordinary
                    size of hailstones with us varies from -⅛th to ½d of an inch in diameter.
                    Occasionally they are much larger; as in the remarkable hail-storm described by
                    Dr Neill, which occurred during a thunder-storm in the Orkneys on the 24th of
                    July 1818.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Edinburgh

                    enormous masses of ice, some as large as the egg of a goose; by which animals
                    were killed, and individuals wounded. An enormous hailstone is recorded to have
                    fallen, amongst many very large masses, at Handsworth House, near Birmingham,
                    during a thunder-storm, on the 8th of June 1811. It consisted of a cuboidal mass
                    6½ inches in diameter; and, from the engraved sketch, it resembled a congeries
                    of frozen balls about the size of walnuts. On the Continent of Europe, the large
                    hail of summer is frequently exceedingly destructive to vineyards; and in some
                    districts of France, where the damage has often been great from thunder-storms,
                    accompanied by large hailstones, the ingenious device of the <hi rend="italic">Paratonnerre</hi> has been employed to prevent the accumulation of electricity
                    over these valleys. The contrivance consists in the erection of pointed electric
                    conductors on the surrounding hills, by which the lightning is silently and
                    gradually abstracted from the air, and dangerous accumulations over the included
                    districts generally prevented. In hot climates, the descent of large masses of
                    frozen water is still more common than in Europe, especially within the <hi rend="italic">Calms</hi> off the western coast of Africa.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Winds.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> The influence of
                    mechanical causes in producing those aerial currents termed winds has been
                    generally admitted, from the ages when théy were poetically imagined as viewless
                    forms, imprisoned or let loose from the caverns of Aeolus, to the present day,
                    when they are considered as the consequences of partial changes in the density
                    of the atmosphere, arising from the unequal distribution of heat over the
                    surface of the globe, or from alterations on its hygrometric and electric
                    states. But the manner in which their force and direction are affected by these
                    circumstances, in those sudden and local storms which frequently agitate the
                    air, is difficult of explanation, although the general phenomena may admit of a
                    very probable solution.</p><p>The dependence of the weather on the direction and force of the winds has given
                    rise to many inventions for indicating their variations. The direction is shown
                    by the well-known vane, or simple <hi rend="italic">anemoscope,</hi> the
                    movements of which are referred to the cardinal points by a fixed index, or by a
                    plate marked with the rhumbs of the mariner’s compass. To save the trouble of
                    frequent daily observations, the labour of the meteorologist may be materially
                    abridged by the following methods of obtaining <hi rend="italic">maxima</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">minima</hi> of the direction of the winds.</p><p>In the first, No. 24, the vane <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> fixed to the axis <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> causes the latter to revolve in a socket, in the centre of
                    a writing slate marked with the rhumbs of the compass. The arm <hi rend="italic">c,</hi> jointed to it, carries a pencil <hi rend="italic">d,</hi> which records
                    ’ the progress of the vane on the slate. The pressure of the pencil may be
                    regulated by sliding the ball <hi rend="italic">e</hi> on the arm; and, to
                    diminish friction, the socket consists of a flint, with a smooth hollow cavity,
                    and the axis is kept perpendicular by moving between friction rollers.</p><p>In the second, No. 25, the same effect is shown on a vertical dial, by converting
                    the horizontal motion of the vane into a vertical movement of the index. This is
                    produced by one bevelled wheel <hi rend="italic">e</hi> on the axis of the vane,
                    and a similar one c on the axis of the index <hi rend="italic">f.</hi> The <hi rend="italic">maxima</hi> and <hi rend="italic">minima</hi> are shown by two
                    moveable arms <hi rend="italic">gg,</hi> concentric with the index, but pushed
                    to either side by a stud on the lower surface of the index. These instruments,
                    devised long ago by Traill, and published in Professor Jameson’s Journal for
                    1837, sufficiently answer the object for which they were intended.</p><p>The varying force of the wind is ascertained by the <hi rend="italic">anemometer.</hi> The principle of several such instruments is the direct
                    pressure of the wind on a given surface, kept by a vane perpendicular to the
                    direction of the breeze. Sometimes this pressure is measured by raising a
                    weight; in some instruments by the degree of compression of a spiral spring; or,
                    as in the ingenious anemometer of Mr Waddel of Leith, by the compression of a
                    slender cylindrical bag filled with quicksilver, and connected with a’vertical
                    tube one foot in length, with a bore of <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> ∙ <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi><hi rend="subscript"> σ</hi> th of an inch. The force
                    of the wind is estimated by the height of the column of mercury. A practical
                    difficulty arises from the quickness of the oscillations, which renders it not
                    easy to read off the indications of the instrument during a smart gale.</p><p>The same objection in some measure applies to the elegant pocket anemometer of Dr
                    Lind. It consists of two equal glass tubes, united below by a narrow connecting
                    piece, as in No. 26, and having between them a scale of equal parts. The tubes
                    are filled to the middle with water; and as the instrument is made to revolve
                    freely round the iron spindle <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> its body acts as a vane,
                    to keep the orifice of the kneed brass tube always directed to the wind. The
                    breeze received at that aperture depresses the liquid in that limb, and raises
                    it in the other to a certain point on the scale, according to the force of the
                    breeze. When it is very strong, the detached piece of brass <hi rend="italic">b</hi> is joined to the top, and an allowance made for the effect on the
                    column. The sum of the two columns is the height of a column of water which the
                    wind is capable of sustaining; and every body opposed to that wind will be
                    pressed on with a force equal to the weight of a column of water of that height,
                    and with a base equal to that of the surface exposed to the wind. In the
                    original instrument the bore of both legs = -⅛ths of an inch, the connecting
                    tube was <hi rend="subscript"> τ</hi> ¾ths, and the length of the whole was six
                    inches. Lind gave the following table as its indications.</p><pb break="no" facs="nls:193498094" xml:id="kp-eb0717-8094-0539"/><table><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Height of Water in the Gage.</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Force of the Wind on One Foot Square, in lbs.

                    and has the advantage of portability. The oscillations of the liquid might be
                    farther checked by twisting spirally the tube of communication, as in the marine
                    barometer.</p><p>A very ingenious anemometer has been constructed by Mr Richard Adie, late of
                    Edinburgh, now of Liverpool. An index E is moved by the rising and falling of a
                    cylinder A, closed at one end, and inverted in a larger cylinder G, containing
                    water, on the principle of a gasometer for chemical experiments. The inverted
                    vessel is suspended by a cord passing over a pulley B fixed on the axis C of the
                    index. The counterpoise is a weight W, the cord of which, wound on a fusee
                    orsnail D, equalizes the counterpoise in the different positions of the internal
                    cylinder. The influence of the wand on the instrument is produced through a
                    tube, as in the figure. One end terminates in the interior cylinder, and the
                    other in a kneed tube moving freely round by means of the attached vane. A very
                    gentle breeze is sufficient to elevate the cylinder, and the revolution of the
                    index marks the comparative force of different winds. This anemometer has been
                    found to act well, and has been put up at several of the northern
                    lighthouses.</p><p>The last anemometer we shall notice is that invented by Professor Whewell, who
                    exhibited it to the British Association. It consists of a small <hi rend="italic">wind-wheel</hi> of eight vanes, directed to the wind by an
                    attached vane. By a train of toothed wheels and endless screws, the rapid
                    revolutions of the wheel are converted into a slow, vertical motion, by which a
                    pencil is made to trace a downward line on the surface of a vertical cylinder
                    having the same axis as the vane. The length of this line records the whole
                    amount of the aerial current that passes over the place of observation, and the
                    part of the circumference of the cylinder on which the trace appears indicates
                    the direction of the winds. Three of these instruments are, by direction of the
                    Association, on trial in different places, and the results will be communicated
                    in the present year (1838).</p><p>In Smcaton’s valuable paper upon the moving power of wind and water
                    (Philosophical Transactions, vol. li.) there is the following table of the force
                    of the wind, calculated by his friend Mr Rouse; which the celebrated engineer
                    considers as entitled to confidence, especially in velocities below fifty miles

                    the Atlantic and the Pacific Oceans between the tropics, the wind has,
                    throughout the year, a direction from the <hi rend="italic">east.</hi> The
                    following explanation agrees pretty well with the facts. The dense cool air of
                    the polar and temperate regions naturally tends to displace the lighter warm air
                    over intertropical regions, which, heated by the sun, produce vertical movements
                    in the superincumbent atmosphere. Hence the ascending current of warm air
                    between the tropics has its place supplied by the denser air from either side;
                    and thus two currents are set in motion, from the poles towards the tropical
                    regions. The velocity of every point on the earth’s surface increases from the
                    poles to the equator. But as the particles of these currents cannot at once
                    acquire a velocity equal to the continually accelerating velocity of the parts
                    of the earth’s surface over which they arrive in this transit, the northern and
                    southern currents will gradually seem to acquire a motion in an opposite
                    direction to that of the rotation of the earth, that is, both will gradually
                    decline to the west, assuming in the northern hemisphere the character of a N.
                    E., and on the south side of the line of a S∙ E. wind; whilst both will become
                    more <hi rend="italic">easterly</hi> as they approach the equator. This effect
                    of the augmenting velocity of the earth’s surface, in approaching the équinoxial
                    line, is increased by the continual movement of the point over <pb break="no" facs="nls:193498107" xml:id="kp-eb0717-8107-0540"/>which the sun
                    is vertical, and consequently his heat the greatest, to the west; and the effect
                    of the gravitation of the sun and moon on the atmosphere, as was shown by
                    D’Alembert, must directly tend to increase the force of the east-· erly wind.
                    The influence of these luminaries on our atmosphere is corroborated by the
                    observations of Bacon, Halley, and Gassendi, on the frequency of storms about
                    the equinoxes, or at full and new moon, and the general occurrence, in calm
                    weather, of light airs of wind at the time of high water. When these causes are
                    not counteracted by the superior rarefaction of air over land heated by the
                    sun’s rays, the easterly winds blow with much regularity, as in the great
                    oceans; and, from their important influence on navigation, they have obtained
                    the denomination of <hi rend="italic">trade-winds.</hi> They extend to about 30°
                    on each side of the equator; but, from the less density of the atmosphere in the
                    northern hemisphere, arising from the greater quantity of land to be acted on by
                    the Sun’s rays in that half of the globe, the line which marks the blending of
                    the S. E. and N. E. tradewinds is between two and three degrees north of the
                    equator.</p><p>If the surface of the globe had been one expanse of water, the trade-winds would
                    have blown all round the equator, and the only other winds known would have
                    probably been N. and S. winds near the poles, gradually bending from E. to W. as
                    they approached the tropics. But the air over the land being much more heated by
                    the sun’s rays than that over the sea, the vicinity of large islands or of
                    continents causes interruptions to the regularity of the trade-winds. Thus, on
                    the coasts of Africa, within the regular limits of the trade-winds, <hi rend="italic">westerly</hi> gales are not unknown; and a <hi rend="italic">southerly</hi> wind prevails along the western shores of that continent, from
                    Cape Palmas to the Cape of Good Hope; a consequence of the form and climate of
                    Northern Africa, which continues the southern polar current far beyond its
                    limits in the free ocean.</p><p>A similar cause appears to give rise to the <hi rend="italic">Calms</hi> on that
                    coast, from 10° to 4° N., a tract avoided by seamen, on account of these calms,
                    and sudden alternations, with tremendous storms of thunder and lightning, to
                    which it is subject. The general direction of the trade-winds is affected by
                    their approach to the shores of America; they are expanded, chiefly owing to the
                    resistance they meet with from the land, and also by the additional rarefaction
                    of the air re-acting upon that continent. Precisely similar disturbances from
                    the position of land produce</p><p>The <hi rend="italic">Monsoons</hi> of the Indian Ocean. The eastern tradewind
                    blows regularly in that sea between the parallels of 10° and 30° S.; but from
                    these parallels northwards, or on the sea between Sumatra and Eastern Africa,
                    the course of the trade-winds is reversed for half the year, from April to
                    October, during which period there is a constant wind from the S∙ W. During the
                    other six months the regular tradewind, from the N. E., resumes its course.
                    These winds are termed the S. W. and N. E. <hi rend="italic">monsoons,</hi> from
                    a Malayan word signifying <hi rend="italic">seasons.</hi> The latter is produced
                    by the same Causes as the general trade-wind. The other appears to be occasioned
                    by the great rarefaction of the atmosphere over the extensive regions of Eastern
                    Asia when the sun is north of the equator, and the dense air of the Indian Ocean
                    rushes in to occupy the place of the ascending current.</p><p>This disturbance of the trade-wind is attended with very remarkable effects on
                    the climate of the country where it prevails. It is the harbinger of the rainy
                    season in India, which is ushered in by violent thunder-storms. A most striking
                    picture of this change of monsoon is given by Mr Elphinstone in his Account of
                    Caubul. “The most remark able rainy season is that called in India the S. W.
                    monsoon. It extends from Africa to the Malayan peninsula, and deluges all the
                    intermediate countries, within certain lines of latitude, for four months in the
                    year. In the south of India this monsoon commences about the beginning of June,
                    but it gets later as we advance towards the north. Its approach is announced by
                    vast<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Account of Caµþul,
                    p. 1.26.</p></note> masses of clouds, that rise from the Indian Ocean, and
                    advance towards the N. E., gathering and thickening as they approach the land.
                    After some threatening days, the sky assumes a troubled appearance in the
                    evenings, and the monsoon in general sets in during the night. It is attended by
                    such a thunderstorm as can hardly be <hi rend="superscript"> l</hi> imagined by
                    those who have only seen that phenomenon in a temperate climate. It generally
                    begins with violent blasts of wind, which are succeeded by floods of rain. For
                    some hours lightning is seen almost without ∙ intermission; sometimes it only
                    illumines the sky, and shows the clouds near the horizon; at other times it
                    discovers the distant hills, and again leaves all in darkness; when, in an
                    instant, it re-appears in vivid and successive flashes, and exhibits the nearest
                    objects in the brightness of day. During all this time the distant thunder never
                    ceases to roll, and is only silenced by some nearer peal, which bursts on the
                    ear with such a sudden and tremendous crash as can scarcely fail to strike the
                    most insensible heart with awe. (Malabar is the province ψost distinguished for
                    the violence of the monsoon.) At length the thunder ceases, and nothing is heard
                    but the continued pouring of the rain, and‘the rushing of rising streams. The
                    next day presents a gloomy spectacle; the rain still descends in torrents, and
                    scarcely allows a view of the blackened fields: the rivers are swollen and
                    discoloured, and sweep down along with them the hedges, the huts, and the
                    remains of the cultivation which was carried on during the dry season, in their
                    beds.</p><p>“This lasts for some days, after which the sky clears, and discovers the face of
                    nature changed, as if by enchantment. Before the storm, the fields were parched
                    up, and, except in the beds of the rivers, scarce a blade of vegetation was to
                    be seen. The clearness of the sky was not interrupted by a single cloud, but the
                    atmosphere was loaded with dust: a parching wind blew, like a blast from a
                    furnace, and heated wood, iron, and every solid material, even in the shade; and
                    immediately before the' monsoon this wind had been succeeded by still more
                    sultry calms. But when the first violence of the monsoon is over, the whole
                    earth is covered with a sudden but luxuriant verdure: the rivers are full and
                    tranquil; the air pure and delicious; and the sky is varied and embellished with
                    clouds. The effect of this change is visible on all the animal creation, and can
                    only be imagined in Europe by supposing the depth of a dreary winter to start at
                    once into all the freshness and brilliancy of spring. From that time the rain
                    falls at intervals for about a month, when it comes on again with great
                    violence, and in July the rains are at their height: during the third month they
                    rather diminish, but are still heavy; and in September they gradually abate, and
                    are often suspended till near the end of the month, when they depart amid
                    thunders and tempests, as they came.” <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi><hi rend="italic">Sea and land breezes</hi> are occasioned by the same causes which
                    produce the S. W. monsoon, and are chiefly experienced on tropical
                    sea-coasts.</p><p>The sea-breeze commences about 10 <hi rend="smallcaps">a. μ.,</hi> and continues
                    throughout the day, till towards 6 <hi rend="smallcaps">p. μ.,</hi> when it

                    fainter breeze from the land, especially in those islands which have
                    considerable mountains. It is well <pb break="no" facs="nls:193498120" xml:id="kp-eb0717-8120-0541"/>known in
                    Jamaica, but less so in the smaller Antilles, and scarcely at all on the flat
                    coasts of America. It continues during the night, and usually dies away before
                    six or seven in the morning; but it is <hi rend="superscript"> ι</hi> much less
                    regular in its periods than the sea-breeze. The latter, too, occurs in places
                    where the land-breeze is quite unknown. An admirable description of these is
                    contained in the voyages of Dampier, and given at. length in the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Meteorology.</hi> The sea-breeze is more or less felt on the
                    coasts of all warm countries. We have had occasion to observe with what
                    regularity the sea-breeze sets in from the S. W. during the summer at Gibraltar,
                    and it blows with considerable force throughout the greatest part of the
                    day.</p><p>The explanation of the sea-breeze is the rarefaction of the air by the heat of
                    the land, and the rushing in of denser air from the sea to &gt; supply its
                    place; and as the influence of the sun decreases, this breeze dies away. The
                    land-breeze is chiefly produced by the descent of air from mountainous regions,
                    flowing, by its gravity, towards the sea, over which the atmosphere is less
                    liable to suffer extreme rarefaction and condensation than the air over the
                    land.</p><p>In temperate climates the winds are far less regular than in tropical countries.
                    The general causes which produce them act with less force and constancy; and the
                    disturbing causes, such as the vicinity of land, alteration in density from
                    moisture and dryness, act with more uncontrolled energy. The most prevalent
                    winds in Great Britain are from the S. W., especially on the western side of our
                    island. The Royal Society, registers give the following average for the winds
                    throughout the year at London.</p><p>S. W .. 112 days.</p><p>N. E 58</p><p>W 53</p><p>N.W 50</p><p>S. E 32 days.</p><p>E 26</p><p>S 18</p><p>N ...16</p><p>Or, with Professor Playfair, if we group the S. with the westerly, and the N.
                    with the easterly winds, we shall have the following results, from the Edinburgh
                    register of Playfair, and the Glasgow register of Dr Meck.</p><table><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>London</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Westerly.

                    earth; but there can be no doubt that the direction of the aerial currents is
                    often different in the upper regions of the air. The permanence of very elevated
                    clouds, their occasional movements in directions opposite to those of the winds
                    below, and the information obtained from aeronauts, all prove this point.</p><p>There are several remarkable modifications of the wind, which deserve notice in
                    this place.</p><p>.The <hi rend="italic">Sirocco</hi> of-Italy and Sicily is a S. E. or S. wind,
                    which, heated on the sandy wastes of Arabia and Libya, becomes occasionally
                    moist in its passage across the Mediterranean, and oppresses the inhabitants of
                    Italy, Malta, and Sicily with excessive languor, and a sinking of their mental
                    energies. When it sets in, it causes a very sudden and powerful rise of the
                    thermometer, and is accompanied by a haze which obscures the pure sky of those
                    southern countries; the sun appearing dimmed and shorn of his beams.</p><p>The <hi rend="italic">Solano</hi> of Spain is only a modification of the Sirocco.
                    We have experienced it as most oppressive on the eastern shores of Spain; and it
                    is greatly detested by the natives, who gravely remark, that “no animals except
                    a pig and an Englishman are insensible to the Solano.” The Italian condemnation
                    of a stupid work, “era seritto in tempo del Sirocco,” is not more pointed than
                    the Spanish adage, “<hi rend="subscript"> r</hi> no rogar alguna gracia en
                    tiempo de Solano,” not ' to ask any favour during the Solano; and both proverbs
                    sufficiently indicate the belief of the people of southern Europe in the
                    disagreeable qualities of the S. E. wind. We have observed fine dust deposited
                    from the Solano or <hi rend="italic">Levanter</hi> at Gibraltar, and to this we
                    partly attribute the haze with which it is accompanied. If this dust be brought
                    with the Solano from Africa, it is less surprising than the following instance
                    of dust carried by the easterly wind into the Atlantic. On the morning of the
                    19th January 1826, when the Clyde East Indiaman was on her voyage to London, in
                    latitude, 10. 40. N., longitude 27. 4L W., her rigging was observed to be
                    covered with an impalpable powder of a brownish colour, and on unfurling the
                    sails at two p. M. to catch the-breeze, they emitted clouds, of dust, which had
                    lodged in them during a strong gale from the E. and N.,E. In ,this case the
                    nearest land in that direction was about seven hundred miles distant. ,</p><p>The <hi rend="italic">Khamsin</hi> of Syria, the <hi rend="italic">Samiel</hi> of
                    the Turks, and the <hi rend="italic">Simûn</hi> of the Arabs, is well described
                    by Volney. It is a wind in no degree poisonous, except in as far as it is
                    dangerous from its extreme heat and aridity; qualities it derives from blowing
                    over sandy deserts intensely heated by the sun. Denon states, that it is loaded
                    with impalpable sand, which penetrates into the closest packages. These
                    winds,deriv'e their Syrian name from their prevalence during the fifty days
                    about the equinoxes. They produce difficult respiration, a slyiyel-led skin, and
                    a distressing sense of heat, Volney compares the effect of them to the sensation
                    produced by the hot air from a baker’s oven. They sometimes blow in squalls, and
                    in Egypt usually continue for about three days at a time. In that period
                    vegetation is withered, the inhabitants shut themselves up in their houses or
                    their tents; and the Simûn is dangerous to persons of a full habit, from the
                    sudden entrance of this heated and parched air into the lungs. In the sandy
                    deserts it is greatly dreaded; but fortunately its extent is not considerable,
                    and it seldom lasts long. It has been well described by Chardin, Sir John
                    Malcolm, and Badhia.</p><p>The <hi rend="italic">Harmattan</hi> of the west coast , of Africa is of the same
                    kind, and produced by the same causes. The extreme dryness of this wind has been
                    mentioned by all observers. It usually blows from the Great Sahara towards the
                    coast, from the N. E., and, like the Solano, Sirocco, and Simûn, is loaded with
                    dust. The dust which fell on the vessel just mentioned was from a violent
                    Harmattan. The only difference between the Sirocco and these other winds appears
                    to be, that the Sirocco obtains some moisture in crossing the Mediterranean; but
                    they all seem to be mere modifications of aerial currents produced by the same
                    causes.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>For an account

                    generally accompanied by thunder-storms, and usually of short duration. The
                    destructive violence of the three first has been Well described by several
                    navigators; and of the hurricane which desolated Barbadoes in the year 17S0 we

                    extent of the whirlwind is usually confined; and as it passes through a forest
                    it has been observed to form a lane or long track of inconsiderable breadth. The
                    singular columns of moving sand, described by Bruce as occurring in Africa,

                    of the cloud from which it proceeds. As this column descends to the sea, the
                    spot below it becomes agitated, and, according to some observers, the waters are
                    bodily drawn up towards the cloud. But this opinion seems to be doubtful; for it
                    is stated that the water discharged on the bursting of a waterspout is always
                    fresh, and therefore any water derived from the sea must have passed into the
                    air in the form of vapour. Besides, they generally dissolve merely into mist on
                    touching the land.</p><p>On the luminous meteors which appear in the air our space will not permit us to
                    expatiate. The <hi rend="italic">Iris</hi> is well known to be produced by the
                    refraction of white light by the spherules of water in a cloud, as has been
                    beautifully and satisfactorily demonstrated by Newton. The explanation of the
                    single and the double iris will be found in every treatise on natural
                    philosophy.</p><p>The <hi rend="italic">Aurora Borealis,</hi> and the similar luminous <hi rend="italic">Southern Meteor,</hi> are still objects of doubtful origin. The
                    brilliancy of the colours is subject to periodical increments and intervals of
                    decline; and, after a considerable period of obscuration, it has, within the
                    last few years, again begun to blaze forth with increasing splendour. We have
                    seen all the prismatic colours present in an aurora; and many years ago, in the
                    Orkney Islands, we were enabled at midnight to distinguish letters of a large
                    print by its light. From the distance to which the same aurora has been seen,
                    the meteor must often be very high above the earth, perhaps in the utmost limits
                    of our atmosphere; but at other times it appears to be nearer to the earth, and
                    we have persuaded ourselves that we have heard a noise accompanying the sudden
                    corruscations of a brilliant aurora.</p><p>The <hi rend="italic">Halo,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Parhelion,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Paraselene,</hi> are opticaI phenomena produced by refraction of

                    electricity, heat, and magnetism. As the electrical state of the atmosphere is
                    an important subject of inquiry, we beg leave to recommend to the philosophical
                    traveller some instrument for ascertaining this quality of the atmosphere; and
                    perhaps no better portable electroscope has yet been devised than the pocket
                    instrument of Cavallo.</p><p>The <hi rend="italic">Bolis,</hi><hi rend="italic">St Elmos Fire, Castor and

                    twice seen. The last time was on the 18th of September 1835, at eleven P. <hi rend="smallcaps">μ.,</hi> when at sea. The head appeared an elliptical ball of
                    the most intense, brilliant, bluish-white light; the train had a tint of azure
                    mixed with reddish, which sufficiently distinguished it on the clear sky; and
                    sparks proceeded from its tail. Its motion was nearly horizontal, from S. W. to
                    N. E., at a considerable height. It was visible for five or six seconds, and
                    disappeared in a dense cloud. It was observed by four gentlemen standing
                    together on the deck, and we thought that it emitted a crackling noise as it
                    proceeded, with a majestic uniform movement.</p><p>The more common meteor, the <hi rend="italic">Shooting Star,</hi> as it is
                    vulgarly termed, seems to be an electrical ball of fire, at a considerable
                    height in the atmosphere. Its general course is from the zenith towards the
                    horizon, which it seldom appears to reach.</p><p>The <hi rend="italic">Ignis</hi><hi rend="italic">Fatuus,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Will o</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">the Wisp,</hi> is a meteor which
                    apparently is connected with decaying animal or vegetable matter; and probably
                    is produced by the disengagement of phosphuretted hydrogene. It is frequently
                    seen in boggy grounds, as a flickering, unsteady light, in irregular motion. It
                    sometimes plays over dunghills; and has occasionally, to the extreme terror of
                    the ignorant, appeared as a lambent flame in church-yards. Dr Derham saw it once
                    playing about a dead thistle. The most extraordinary meteor of this kind is that
                    described by Signor Beccari, in the Philosophical Transactions (vol. xxxvi.). In
                    the low grounds to the north and east of Bologna, <hi rend="italic">ignes
                    fatui</hi> of remarkable splendour were at that time seen almost every dark
                    night. That in the fields of Bagnara, to the east of the city, was especially
                    brilliant. It appeared and disappeared suddenly; it rose and fell, and often
                    hovered about six feet from the ground; it sometimes contracted its volume, then
                    expanded or divided into two; would again unite, and assume the form of a wave
                    of flame; often it dropped bright scintillations, and occasionally threw as much
                    light upon the road as a large torch.</p><p>The curious meteor described by Dr Shaw<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Travels in Palestine and the East.</p></note> as running

                    counterpart, on a smaller scale, in other countries, and has often been
                    witnessed in Britain. It seems in some instances to be an electrical meteor; but
                    possibly it may also arise from the disengagement of phosphuretted hydrogene
                    from living animals, or of a luminous and unctuous matter, like that of the
                    glow-worm, or of phosphorescent marine animals.</p><p>A lambent flame has occasionally been observed to play around the heads of

                    it in contact with the ground, which has received and absorbed the incident
                    solar rays. Whilst the earth revolves on its axis, successive portions of its
                    surface are illuminated and heated by the sun; but the excessive accumulation of
                    heat in any particular place is prevented by the abstracting power of the air,
                    and by the radiation from the earth’s surface which takes place during the
                    night. These causes alone, however, could not have secured the diffusion of
                    warmth over a large portion of the earth. Had the axis of the earth been
                    perpendicular to the plane <pb break="no" facs="nls:193498146" xml:id="kp-eb0717-8146-0543"/>of its orbit, the same places would have had the
                    sun always vertical; the equatorial regions would thus have been parched with
                    intolerable heat; and much of what is now the fairest portions of the globe, the
                    seats of literature and the arts, would have been doomed to sterility and
                    desolation. The simple yet stupendous contrivance of the inclination of the axis
                    to the plane of the orbit, by bringing successive portions of the northern and
                    southern hemispheres alternately under the vivifying solar influence, has
                    rendered the largest portion of the globe the abodes of animated beings; the
                    fervour of a tropical climate is thus rendered less oppressive, and the limits
                    of the temperate regions are greatly extended. The division into five <hi rend="italic">Zones,</hi> and their denominations, give us a general idea of the
                    temperature in each; but these are very inadequate to express the diversities of
                    atmospherical temperature. Ancient geographers distributed the earth’s surface
                    into twenty-six parallel bands or <hi rend="italic">Climates,</hi> which were
                    supposed to indicate, with sufficient exactness, the differences of the heat of
                    each region, until the invention of the thermometer gave more precise
                    information.</p><p>We have already stated how multiplied and careful observations may point out the
                    mean temperature of any place, and the contrivances which have been resorted to
                    for abridging the labour of the meteorologist; and philosophers have endeavoured
                    to supply by calculation what is wanting in observation. The most ingenious of
                    these speculators was Mayer of Göttingen. From an examination of such registers
                    of temperature as he could obtain, he concluded “that the mean temperatures
                    decrease from the equator to the poles, as the squares of the sines of latitude
                    and therefore, if the mean temperature at the level of the sea under the equator
                    were ascertained, this formula would enable us to calculate the . mean
                    temperature of any given latitude. Mayer applied his formula to the equatorial
                    temperature as determined by Bouguer, = to 24° of Reaumur; but this has been
                    found by Humboldt to be too high. It should have been only 22° of that scale,
                    which is equivalent to 27° ∙5 of the centigrade, and to 81° ∙5 of Fahrenheit.
                    With these corrections, Mayer’s formulae for the three thermometers, T
                    signifying the temperature sought, will be</p><p>T = 22 <hi rend="superscript"> 0 2</hi> cos. lat. for Reaumur.</p><p>T = 27° ∙5 <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> cos. lat. for Centigrade.</p><p>T = 81*∙5 <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> cos. lat. for Fahrenheit.</p><p>Unfortunately, however, later observations have shown that Mayer’s formula is
                    worse than useless in high latitudes, and indeed is only found tolerably
                    consistent with observation in latitudes between 40° and 60° N. The
                    thermometrical registers of Scoresby, Parry, Franklin, and Ross, have proved
                    that the mean temperature of the parallel between 70° and 75° is very far below
                    what Mayer’s formula would assign, and is even far below what that empirical
                    rule would give to the pole. In low latitudes, too, it is not to be depended on;
                    and it is totally at variance with the recent but well-established fact of <hi rend="italic">meridians of greatest cold.</hi> No attempt of this kind has yet
                    been found reconcileable with observation. In the mean time, the celebrated
                    Humboldt has performed an acceptable service to science, by a more critical
                    examination of the accumulated observations of his predecessors and
                    contemporaries. The results he has given in his essay <hi rend="italic">on the
                    Distribution of Heat over the Globe;</hi> and the representation of them upon a
                    chart of <hi rend="italic">Isothermal Lines</hi> is peculiarly valuable, as
                    deductions from actual observation. An inspection of such a chart shows, that
                    these lines are neither parallel to the equator nor to each other. They are
                    higher in Europe than at 100° to the E. or W. Thus the isothermal line of
                    temperature 54° ∙5, in France passes through lat. 45° 46'; in China (long.
                    116°</p><p>E.) it is in lat. 39° 54'; and in America, on the western coast (in long. 104°
                    W.), it is in 44° 40'.</p><p>The isothermal lines descend lower in America than in Europe. Thus the line of
                    32°, or the freezing point, in Europe, lies in Lapland between 66° and 68°, but
                    in America it passes on the coast of Labrador in lat. 54°; and this difference,
                    which is small near the tropic, increases much with the latitude.

                    lat. 40° and 45°. This circumstance has justly been considered by Humboldt as
                    producing a happy influence upon the civilization and industry of the nations
                    inhabiting these parallels; because there slight changes in latitude produce
                    considerable diversity in the vegetable productions, which may become objects of
                    rural economy; and when contiguous countries differ much in their products, it
                    stimulates the industry of each, and gives vigour to commercial intercourse;
                    circumstances highly favourable to civilization. The range of the thermometer is
                    not the same under the same isothermal lines, as representing the mean
                    temperature of the year. It is greater in the New than in the Old Continent.
                    Thus, Cincinnati in America, and St Malo in France, are both on the isothermal
                    line of 54°; yet the difference between the mean heat of summer and winter is
                    40° at the former, and but 32° at the latter. Even though the difference between
                    the mean temperature of the seasons increase with the latitude, under the same
                    meridians, yet the difference at Philadelphia in America, in lat. 40°, is much
                    greater than at Copenhagen in Europe, in lat. 56°.</p><table><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"/><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Lat.</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Mean of Summer.</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Mean of Winter.</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Difference.</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Philadelphia. ...</p><p>Copenhagen</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>40°</p><p>56</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>73° ∙94</p><p>60 ∙60</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>32° ∙18</p><p>30 ∙74</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>41° ∙76</p><p>29 ∙86</p></cell></row></table><p>The remarkable fact of the influence of <hi rend="italic">longitude</hi> on
                    temperature leads to the conclusion, that on each side of the equator there are
                    two meridians, under which the mean temperature is lowest. These have been
                    termed by Sir David Brewster the <hi rend="italic">cold meridians,</hi> and
                    their extremities are the <hi rend="italic">poles of greatest cold.</hi> The
                    position of these in the northern hemisphere may be approximated from recent
                    investigations; and perhaps we shall not greatly err if we assign the longitude
                    of 95° W. for the American, and of 100° E. for the Asiatic cold meridians. The
                    apparent coincidence of the cold meridians with the general direction of Han-
                    steen⅛ lines of no variation is perhaps more than accidental, when we reflect
                    that there seem to have been, in former ages, migrations of the cold meridians
                    eastward and westward, coincident, as far as we can judge from recorded changes
                    of climate in northern countries, with similar migrations of the magnetic

                    which this takes place varies with the latitude, diminishing from the equator to
                    the poles. In climates where there is a great difference between the heat of

                    not agree with observation in high parallels. The same remark applies to
                    Kirwan’s formula,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Essay
                    on Climate.</p></note> which presupposes a gradual depression of the point of
                    congelation in receding from the equator. The requisite data for his
                    calculations are the mean temperature at the level of the sea at the equator and
                    at the given place, and the height of the equatorial point of congelation. Thus,
                    if we take the point of perpetual congelation at Humboldt’s estimate of 15,744
                    feet, and the mean temperature at the level of the sea there at 81° ∙5, the
                    difference between that mean temperature and 32° will bear the same ratio to the
                    equatorial point of congelation, as the excess of the mean temperature at the
                    given place above the freezing point, to the point of congelation at the latter.
                    Thus, if we wish to find the point of congelation in this latitude, 56°, we turn
                    to a table of mean temperatures, and find it = 49° Fahrenheit.</p><p>81∙5 — 32 = 49∙5, and 49 — 32 = 17, and 49∙5: 15744:: 17: 5407.</p><p>On this formula, then, 5407 feet would be the point of perpetual congelation in
                    our climate; and had we any mountain exceeding that elevation, its summit would
                    be covered with perennial snow.</p><p>We apprehend,, however, that no formula will apply to all latitudes; and we know
                    that Kirwan’s does not agree with observation in high latitudes.</p><p>Even when the latitude and elevation of two places do not differ greatly, they
                    may suffer very different extremes of temperature. The chief agent in effecting
                    this is the ocean. It has been found that the proximity of the sea, in all
                    climates, affects the extremes of temperature. When cold air sweeps over the
                    surface of the ocean, the caloric of the upper particles is diminished, their
                    density is increased, and they sink, while their place is supplied by fresh
                    particles from below, which becoming cooled in their turn, give rise to internal
                    motions in the ocean. As the law of <hi rend="italic">expansion</hi> during
                    cooling from 39° to 32°, which forms so singular an exception in the case of
                    fresh water, does not take place in sea-water, there is nothing to arrest these
                    internal motions in the ocean:<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Dr Hope, Transactions of the Royal Society of
                    Edinburgh.</p></note> and from its enormous mass, it is obvious that no partial
                    application of cold, in this way, can sensibly reduce its mean temperature.
                    Hence we find that the temperature of islands is not in winter so low as that of
                    continents in the same parallels. Thus the severity of winter in Britain bears
                    no proportion to that of continental regions under the same parallel. The Orkney
                    Islands are in the same latitude as St Petersburg; yet, in the former, a frost
                    of a week’s duration is a comparatively rare occurrence, whilst at the latter,
                    the wide, deep, and rapid Neva is for several months annually frozen over.</p><p>On the other hand, the ocean exerts a great influence in mitigating the excessive
                    heat of tropical climates. It is true, that when the upper particles of its
                    waters become heated, the internal motions cease; but the rarefaction produced
                    sets a current in motion to the west (as becomes apparent in the Gulf Stream),
                    the place of which is supplied by the influx of cooler waters from either pole.
                    This is not all. The increased temperature is mightily diminished by increased
                    evaporation; a process by which as much caloric is absorbed as would be capable
                    of heating an equal weight of water 942° Fahrenheit. Hence tropical islands are
                    less oppressively hot than continents in the same latitude. The summer
                    temperature of the smaller Antilles, for instance, is lower than that of the
                    same parallels in America, Africa, or Arabia. The intersection of continents by
                    arms of the sea, or by vast collections of water, tends to mitigate the fervour
                    of summer. The extended form of the old continent toward the east render’s
                    inequalities of temperature much greater in Eastern Asia than under the same
                    parallels in Europe. Thus, at Pekin, in latitude 40° N., longitude 116° 20' E.,
                    the mean temperature of summer is 78° ∙8, and of winter 23° —a difference of not
                    less than 55° ∙8, which gives rise to a frost of several months’ duration in
                    that part of China; yet Pekin is under the same parallel as the southern
                    extremity of Naples, where frost is unknown, and of the central provinces of
                    Spain, in which, though at an elevation of 2000 feet above the sea, ice is an
                    extremely rare occurrence.</p><p>The face of a country, though less important than the circumstances already
                    noticed, affects its climate. A region shrouded in primeval forests, or covered
                    with swamps and marshes, will have a different temperature when cleared and
                    drained. Marshes, by evaporation, rob the surface of much of its heat; and
                    forests, by intercepting the sun’s rays, the source of terrestrial warmth, and
                    by the increased exhalent surfaces exposed to the air, undoubtedly have some
                    effect on mean temperature. In hot climates forests tend to cool the air, and in
                    frigid regions to prevent the loss of the earth’s heat by chilling blasts. The
                    clearing of forests may thus affect the temperature, and the draining of marshes
                    increase the salubrity of particular regions; but the mere effect of cultivation
                    can never be very considerable in changing a climate.</p><p>A combination of several of the causes already noticed as affecting climate have
                    conspired to fender the North American continent colder than the same parallels
                    in Europe. Thus Nova Scotia and Canada, in latitude 47°, are in the same
                    parallel as the central provinces of France and Upper Italy. In the former, the
                    cold of winter has been observed as low as —40° Fahrenheit, or 52° below the
                    freezing point of water; and the lakes and rivers of that part of America are
                    bound up in impenetrable ice during four or five months of the year; while in
                    the latter, in ordinary seasons, the severity of winter is scarcely felt
                    Labrador and England, each in latitude 53°, differ widely in mean
                    temperature.</p><table><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"/><cell cols="3" role="data" rows="1"><p>Mean Temperature.</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"/><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Summer.</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Winter.</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>General.</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Labrador</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>51° ∙8</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>3° ∙2</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>= 27° ∙5</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>England</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>62 ∙6</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>37 ∙4</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>= 50</p></cell></row></table><p>The climate of America, however, should not be compared with that of Europe, but

                    it will probably be found that both continents approximate more nearly in mean
                    temperature than the above comparisons would seem to indicate. In fact, the

                    we yet know of California, and of the country between it and the mouth of the

                    much less, and that they approach more nearly to the climate of Europe.</p><p>The distribution of the land in high latitudes is not unimportant as regards
                    climate. Land is more easily heated than water by the sun’s rays; and where the
                    icy banders are in contact with land, there is a greater probability of their
                    being melted by the heat of summer, than where the ice extends over a large
                    surface of uninterrupted ocean. This seems to be one cause of the greater extent
                    of the southern than of the northern polar ices.</p><p>Had the globe been uniformly covered by water, the progression of climate would
                    probably have been very regular. Indeed it might be shown, that the effect of
                    the polar currents produced by equatorial rarefaction, supposing them to move
                    with a velocity of two miles per hour, or to make three annual transfers from
                    the pole to the equator, would be sufficient to produce the variations of
                    temperature which are experienced at the level of the ocean.</p><p>On the whole, the peculiarities of climate are chiefly attributable to latitude,
                    elevation, the distribution of land and water, proximity to the cold meridians,
                    the humidity or dryness of the air; to which we may add, though less important,
                    the prevalence of particular winds, the transparency or cloudiness of the sky,
                    and the state of the general surface of any country.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> IX.— <hi rend="italic">Geographical Distribution

                    Asia and Africa, and in some respects less favourable to a varied vegetation,
                    has a flora more numerous than either, and, till within a few years, superior to
                    both united. This can only be attributed to the greater diligence with which the
                    botanic riches of Europe have been explored, and may lead us to suspect that we
                    are yet far from a knowledge of all existing species.</p><p>While botanists considered plants only as belonging to artificial systems, the
                    progress of geographical phytology was inconsiderable. Tournefort, in ascending
                    Mount Ararat, had observed at its foot the plants of Western Asia; but a little
                    way up he recognised the vegetable forms of Italy; at a still higher level,
                    those of Central France; next those of Sweden; and beyond them the flora of
                    Lapland and the Alps.</p><p>Similar remarks were occasionally made by other botanists in other regions. They
                    had determined with considerable accuracy the northern boundaries of some
                    plants, especially those useful to man; but whilst the method of grouping plants
                    was merely artificial, the physical laws which regulate their distribution were
                    not perceived, and the circumstances which limit certain vegetable forms to
                    particular situations were not comprehended. Humboldt’s essay on the geography
                    of plants appeared at Paris in 1807, and contained some generalizations on the
                    succession of vegetable forms in Equinoxial America; but it is admitted on all
                    hands, that the disquisitions of Dr Robert Brown, in the-Supplement to Flinders’
                    Voyage, published in 1814, led the way to still more extensive generalizations
                    on the geographical distribution of plants, and first indicated the proportions
                    that subsist in different places between the three great divisions of the
                    vegetable kingdom. Since that period, the progress of vegetable geography has
                    been rapid, chiefly through the laboursof Von Humboldt, Brown, Wahlenberg,
                    Decandolle, Von Buch, Parrot, Hornemann, and Schouw; and this improvement is
                    ascribed, by the illustrious philosopher first named, to the adoption of the
                    natural method of Jussieu. To none of these writers are we more indebted than to
                    Von Humboldt. The ideas developed in his <hi rend="italic">Essai sur</hi><hi rend="italic">la Geographic des Plantes,</hi> and in his <hi rend="italic">Tableaux de</hi> Zα <hi rend="italic">Nature,</hi> were expanded in the <hi rend="italic">Prolegomena de</hi><hi rend="italic">Distributione

                    New Enquiries into the Laws which regulate the distribution of Vegetable Forms
                    (same Journal, vi.), contain an admirable summary of almost all we know on
                    vegetable geography.</p><p>The primary divisions of the natural arrangement are into <hi rend="italic">acotyledones,</hi> which include the ferns, fungi, lichens, mosses, sea-w ceds,
                    &amp;c.; <hi rend="italic">monocotyledones,</hi> including palms, rushes,
                    sedges, grasses, liliaceous plants, &amp;c.; <hi rend="italic">dicoylédones,</hi> which comprehend all plants not contained in the other
                    groups. The circumstances on which the geographical distribution of these
                    different vegetable forms depend, may all be comprehended in climate and soil.
                    The causes chiefly modifying climate are, latitude, elevation above the sea,
                    longitude, moisture, and insolation; particularly the first two. We shall
                    endeavour to point out very generally how vegetation is modified by these
                    circumstances; and, first, of the effect of latitude.</p><p>In proceeding from the equator towards either pole, the temperature diminishes;
                    but we have seen that the isothermal lines are not parallel to the equator, and
                    the vegetable forms which characterize them descend lower in the new than in the
                    old continent. In equatorial regions the vegetation consists of dense evergreen
                    forests, characterized by palms and arborescent ferns, mixed with Epiden-dra and
                    rigid grasses; and the lower tribes of vegetable life, such as Fungi, Confervae,
                    and Musci, are very rare; but Musaceae, Melastomaceae, Scitaminiae, Myrtaceae,
                    Piperaceae, and the larger Compositae, are very frequent. On receding from the
                    equator these tropical forms give place to Rosaceae, Coniferae, and Amentaceae;
                    verdant meadows of soft <pb break="no" facs="nls:193498185" xml:id="kp-eb0717-8185-0546"/>grasses intersperse the landscape, the epiphytal
                    Orchidiae disappear, and are succeeded by plants whose fleshy roots draw their
                    sustenance from the soil; the trunks of aged trees are clothed with mosses,
                    parasitic Fungi invest decaying vegetables, and the waters abound with
                    Confervae. On entering the frigid regions trees disappear; dicoyledonous plants
                    become more and more rare; and Gramineae, Mosses, and Lichens are the last
                    retreats of vegetable life. The northern hemisphere, with which we are best
                    acquainted, is by Humboldt divided into six isothermal bands.</p><p>1st band has a mean temperature above 77° F., and may be considered the natural
                    region of Palms, of the Banana, and the Coffee-tree. It extends northwards in
                    the old continent to lat. 32°, in the new to 23° 30'.</p><p>2d band, with a mean temperature ranging between 77° and 68°, is the proper
                    region of the Citron and its varieties. In the old continent it reaches to 37°
                    or 38°, in the new to 29°.</p><p>3d band, with a mean temperature from 68° to 59°, is the true region of the Olive
                    and the Vine. In the old continent it extends to 43° 30'; in the new, and in
                    Eastern Asia, to 32° or 33°.</p><p>4th band, with a mean temperature from 59° to 50°, produces the Vine, and in
                    perfection Wheat, and the Oak. In Europe it extends to 52° 25', in America to
                    42° 25 ’, in China to 40°.</p><p>5th band, with a mean temperature from 50° to 41°, is the region of various
                    Cerealia, and of forests of Quercus Robur. In Europe it extends to lat. 60°, in
                    America probably to 50°.</p><p>6th band, with a mean temperature from 41° to 32°, is the native region of the
                    Pine, the Birch, and the Willow, in its lowest parallels; and in its higher, of
                    alpine plants, Lichens, and Byssi. It reaches to the limits of perpetual
                    congelation. In Europe it extends to lat. 71°, in Asia to the arctic circle, but
                    in Eastern America only to 57° 8'.</p><p>But the effect of elevation above the sea is no less striking, and is capable of
                    counterbalancing or of subverting the influence of a low latitude. Wherever
                    lofty mountains occur in the torrid zone, their summits are veiled in perpetual
                    snows; and the ascent presents the flora of a vast variety of climates. This is
                    beautifully illustrated in Humboldt’s <hi rend="italic">Géographie</hi><hi rend="italic">des Plantes</hi><hi rend="italic">Equinoxiales,</hi> the chart of
                    which forms Plate CCCCXII. in this volume. He divides Equinoxial America into
                    eight regions.</p><p>1. The region of Palms, Scitaminiae, and Liliaceae. This is the habitat of true
                    Palms, of the Musa, Theophrasta, Mussaenda, Pumeria, Caesalpinia, Hymenaea,
                    Cecropia, and Cusparia. It extends from the level of the sea, under the equator,
                    to the elevation of 5700 feet. One species of tree found in this region extends
                    to the height of 6800 feet.</p><p>2. The region of arborescent Ferns, and the true Cinchona. Gigantic Ferns first
                    appear at the height of 1200 feet, and disappear at an elevation of 4900 feet.
                    The medicinal Cinchonae attain the height of 8800 feet.</p><p>3. The region of Oaks commences at 5200 feet, and reaches to</p><p>4. The region of Shrubs. Trees disappear entirely at a height of 10,800 feet, and
                    are succeeded by shrubby plants.</p><p>5. The region of plants corresponding to the alpine plants of Europe. These are
                    first found at 6100 feet above the sea, and continue to the great height of
                    12,600 feet. Amongst these the most conspicuous arc the genera Gentiana,
                    Lobelia, Ranunculus, &amp;c.</p><p>6. The region of Grasses. Here the Gramineae are the sole vegetable produce; and
                    the principal genera are Avena, Agrostis, Dactylis, Panicum, Stipa, Javara. In
                    this region snow regularly falls, and the plants enumerated continue to the vast
                    elevation of 14,200 feet.</p><p>7. The region of the Hyperoxylon, Byssi, Hepaticae, and Lichenes. These lowly and
                    hardy forms of vegetable life continue to the very verge of uninterrupted
                    winter, which in the</p><p>8. Region covers the Equinoxial Andes, from the height of 15,700 feet, to their
                    towering summits.</p><p>In the temperate climate of Europe, the changes produced by elevation, though
                    less striking, are not less important on vegetation. Μ. Ramond, in examining the
                    Pyrenees, found vegetable forms distributed into very regular zones.</p><p>1. The region of Oaks lies at the foot of the chain, and is chiefly characterized
                    by Quercus Robur, which continues to the elevation of 4800 feet above the
                    sea.</p><p>2. The zone of Beeches, characterized by the Fagus Sylvatica, commences at 1800
                    feet above the sea, and extends to 1400 feet beyond the oaks, rising to 5200
                    feet, or to a mile, in height.</p><p>3. The region of the Silver Fir, or Pinus Picea, and Yew. It commences at 4200
                    feet, and extends to the height of 6000 feet, or 600 beyond the region of
                    Beeches.</p><p>4. The region of the Pinus Sylvestris and Pinus Pumilio, commencing at 6000 feet,
                    and extending to an elevation of 6200 feet; and this is the extreme limit of
                    trees.</p><p>5. Region of dry-leaved shrubs and creeping plants, such as Rhododendron, Daphne,
                    Passerina, Globularia Repens, and two diminutive species of willow, Salix
                    Herbacea and $, Reticulata. The limit of this last is uncertain, but it rises
                    much beyond this region.</p><p>6. The region of alpine plants with perennial roots and naked stems; as Gentiana,
                    Primula, Saxifraga, Ranunculus. The extreme limit of phaenogamous plants is
                    marked by Ranunculus Glacialis, Saxifraga Cespitosa, S. Oppositi-folia, S.
                    Androsacea, and S. Groenlandica. These elegant but hardy individuals, intermixed
                    with Byssi and Lichens, reach to</p><p>7. The region of perennial snow.</p><p>As a further illustration, we may give the progress of vegetation within the
                    arctic circle from the masterly sketch of Wahlenberg. In ascending the Lapland
                    Alps, from the head of the Gulf of Bothnia, he found eight well-marked
                    zones.</p><p>1. The region of the Spruce Fir had almost ceased before reaching the mountains.
                    It had become a slender pole, with short, drooping branches. The Rubus Arcticus
                    had ceased to ripen its fruit, and the pools were no longer ornamented with
                    Arundo Phragmitis, Galium Boreale, and Carex Globularia. The upper limit of the
                    Spruce Fir is 3200 feet below the line of perpetual snow. This is the true
                    region of Tussilago Nivea; it has a mean temperature of 37° ∙5 of Fahrenheit</p><p>2. Pinus Sylvestris, or Scotch Fir, is still found; but its stem is low, and its
                    branches widely spread. In this region is the last appearance of Ledum Palustre,
                    Salix Pentandra, and Veronica Serpyllifolia. Near the upper limit of the Scotch
                    Fir the Phaca Alpina is found, and the berries of Vaccinium Myrtillus do not
                    ripen well. The upper limit of this zone is 2800 feet below the line of snow;
                    its mean temperature 36° ∙5 Fahrenheit. A little below this boundary barley
                    ceases to ripen; but grazing farms, with turnips and potatoes, are cultivated,
                    even 400 feet higher.</p><p>3. The zone of the Birch with short, thick stems and knotty branches; its lively
                    green leaves are refreshing to the eye, but the tree is diminished, so as to be
                    commanded from every eminence. The upper boundary of the Birch is 200 feet below
                    the line of snow. The Alnus Incana, Prunus Padus, and Populus Tremula, had long
                    before this disappeared; and Sorbus Aucuparia, Rubus Arcticus, and Erica
                    Vulgaris, disappear near the upper limit of this region; but the drier spots
                    produce Lichen Rangiferinus, Tussilago Frigida, and Pedicularis Sceptrum
                    Carolinum, to the upper boundary of the Birch.</p><p>4. The lower skirts of this region are covered with the <pb break="no" facs="nls:193498198" xml:id="kp-eb0717-8198-0547"/>dark foliage of
                    Betula Nana; Salix Glauca fringes the streams; every hill is covered with
                    Arbutus Alpina, and variegated with Andromeda Caerulea and Trientalis Europaea;
                    while the bogs are ornamented with Andromeda Polifolia and Pedicularis
                    Lapponica. This zone reaches to within 1400 feet of perpetual snow.</p><p>5. Brush-wood has disappeared; Salix Lanata is two feet high; Betula Nana creeps
                    along the ground; the hills abound with Azalea Procumbens and A. Lapponica. No
                    berries ripen here, except those of Empetrum Nigrum. This zone rises to within
                    800 feet of the line of snow; its mean temperature is 34° Fahrenheit.</p><p>6. Region where patches of snow remain all the year. Bare places still produce a
                    few shrubby plants, as Empetrum Nigrum, Andromeda Tetragona, and A. Hypnoides,
                    Gentiana Nivalis, G. Tenella, Draba Alpina, and Dryas Octopetala. This zone
                    reaches to within 200 feet of perennial snow, which forms</p><p>7. Zone in which, wherever a patch of soil is visible, various Saxifrages and
                    Ranunculi appear. The upper limit of this region is 4200 feet above the sea; but
                    on the higher mountains we have an</p><p>8. Region of pure snow. Yet even here, if a southern aspect chance to thaw for a
                    few days any cleft in a rock, a few hardy specimens of Ranunculus Glacialis
                    venture to bloom. The plant has been gathered even 500 feet above the last zone;
                    and Umbilicated Lichens have been seen 2000 feet above the line of perennial
                    snow. The mean temperature of the eighth region is 30° Fahrenheit.</p><p>In these instances, then, the effect of elevation is equivalent to latitude; but
                    it must be recollected, that plants will not thrive equally in places with the
                    same mean temperature. Some require a strong ephemeral heat. Hence, in judging
                    of the aptitude of any place for rearing particular plants, we must compare the
                    mean temperature of the summer, as well as of the whole year, before we decide.
                    Thus we are enabled to explain why the Pistacio-nut ripens in Pekin, but will
                    not ripen in France, where the isothermal line for the whole year is the same;
                    but though the Chinese winter be more severe than that of France, the summer
                    heat is far greater. Innumerable other instances might be adduced of the same
                    fact. The moisture of a climate has much influence upon its vegetation. Water is
                    the vehicle of the food of plants, and perhaps yields a great proportion of it.
                    If moisture be deficient, plants die; but they require water in very different
                    proportions. Those with soft, broad, smooth leaves, that grow rapidly, and have
                    many cortical pores, require much water to maintain their vitality; on the other
                    hand, plants with few cortical pores, with oily or resinous juices, and small
                    roots, will generally thrive best in dry situations.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Insolation,</hi> or exposure to light, is necessary for most
                    plants. The green colour of plants is only formed in light, as is shown by
                    etiolation; and light appears to be the cause of certain movements which are
                    remarked in the flowers of most plants, and in other parts of some delicately
                    organized individuals, which operi and close their leaves according to the
                    degree of light. This last property is chiefly seen in tropical plants. Light
                    appears to be necessary to the decomposition of carbonic acid, and the fixation
                    of carbon in their tissues; and it is indispensable to the right performance of
                    the function of reproduction.</p><p>The influence of soil on vegetables is seen in the preference which many plants
                    have for a calcareous soil; some affect siliceous sands, others clay retentive
                    of water; some plants thrive best in the clefts of slaty rocks; some delight to
                    dwell amid granitic rocks, and others on a saliferous soil. Earthy matters enter
                    largely into the composition of some<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The <hi rend="italic">Agamoe</hi> of Humboldt correspond to

                    silica is invariably found. The presence of animal matter in soils is necessary
                    to many plants, and is generally nutritive to all. Iron and copper are found in
                    small quantities in some plants. The <hi rend="italic">stations</hi> of
                    particular plants have often been determined by these peculiarities of soil; and
                    where a soil and climate are equally suitable for many <hi rend="italic">social
                    plants,</hi> we find them growing together, until the strongest obtains the
                    mastery, and chokes the others. Thus Erica Vulgaris appears to have usurped in
                    Europe a space once occupied by other genera, if we may judge by what generally
                    happens on exterminating heath; for then other plants very speedily make their
                    appearance, the seeds of which seem to have long preserved their vitality in the
                    earth, and only to have wanted room to spring into visible existence.</p><p>A combination of these causes no doubt influences the distribution of particular
                    species. Thus, in the old world, Ericeae and the Proteaceae of Southern Africa
                    are peculiar, and are replaced in Australia by Epacrideae and new genera of
                    Proteaceae. The Banksia, the Yucca, the Goodenia, and the leafless Acaciá, are
                    peculiar to the latter country. The Cinnamon, Nutmeg, and Clove are confined to
                    the Indian islands; the Thea and Camellia are indigenous to China. America does
                    not contain a single species of Erica, from one extremity to the other; nor has
                    a Paeonia ever been found in it, except a solitary one observed by Douglas to
                    the west of the Rocky Mountains. That mountain barrier divides two vegetations,
                    almost as peculiar as those of two continents. On its eastern side the forests
                    of North America are distinguished by the variety of their Oaks and Juglandes,
                    the magnificent inflorescence of the Rhododendron, the Magnolia, the Azalea, and
                    the humbler beauties of the Actea and Vaccinium; all of which are utterly
                    unknown on the western side of that ridge. America is the real habitat of the
                    Cinchonaceae and the Cacti, of the Fuschia, the Calathea, the Mustisia, and all
                    the Bromeliaceae.</p><p>One grand question in vegetable geography, first considered by Brown, has yet to
                    be noticed, viz. the numerical relations that subsist between different
                    vegetable forms. We may ask, which natural families of plants abound most over
                    the world? and give in succession the comparative numbers that are known to
                    exist. This interesting comparison has been attempted in Decandolle’s grand
                    work. But this information is less important and satisfactory than the
                    investigation of the relation which the numbers of each family bear to soil and
                    climate. The question thus becomes far more complex; and we are under the
                    necessity of comparing the ascertained number in each division with the whole
                    mass of phaenogamous plants.</p><p>It is to this last mode of studying vegetable forms that the admirable inquiries
                    of Humboldt are directed. We strongly recommend the whole of that paper to the
                    perusal of our readers. Our limits will only permit us to give his table of the
                    numerical results of his investigations of the distribution of certain extensive
                    families which exert a marked character on the vegetable physiognomy of the

                    equatorial zone, fewer Cyperaceae and Rubiaceae, but more Compositae; under the
                    temperate zone, fewer Labiatae and Cruciferae, and more Compositae, Ericeae, and
                    Amentaceae, than in the corresponding zones in the old world. The families that
                    increase from the equator to the pole, according to the method of fractional
                    indications, are Glumaceae, Ericeae, and Amentaceae. The families which decrease
                    from the pole to the equator are Leguminosae, Rubiaceae, Euphorbiaceae, and
                    Malvaceae: the families that appear to attain their maximum in the temperate
                    zone are Compositae, Labiatae, Umbelliferae, and Cruciferae.”</p><p>Botanists have attempted to divide the globe into botanical regions. The first
                    successful attempt of this kind was made by Decandolle, who divides it into
                    twenty regions, the designations of which are drawn from particular portions of
                    the earth, marked by the peculiarity of their vegetable productions. But the
                    most able and luminous exposition of this sort is the <hi rend="italic">Phyto-Geographie</hi> of Professor Schouw. The designations of each kingdom or
                    region are usually derived from some of its most characteristic vegetable
                    productions; but where we are not sufficiently acquainted with the botany of
                    certain districts, he uses a geographical designation. Schouw divides the earth
                    into twenty-two botanical regions, of which our limits will only allow a very
                    imperfect sketch.</p><p>1. <hi rend="italic">Region of Saxifragae and</hi><hi rend="italic">Musci,</hi>

                    of Animals.</hi></p><p>The slightest acquaintance with zoology is sufficient to show that animals do not
                    indiscriminately spread themselves over every part of the habitable earth. One
                    species is found to be peculiar to a certain region, and sometimes is
                    represented in another region by an analogous yet different animal. Difference
                    of climate, and the greater or less facility of procuring subsistence, are often
                    the probable causes of such limitations, when animals have the power of
                    emigration; but in numerous instances we can trace the operation to no secondary
                    cause. Why, for instance, should animals, incapable of crossing arms of the sea,
                    be found in certain insular situations, and denied to other lands, seemingly as
                    well fitted for their propagation and their maintenance ?—why should the forms
                    of organization which we find to prevail in one portion of the globe be
                    represented in another by other forms, and by a very different though not less
                    admirable structure? In this species of inquiry, one thing is demonstrable, that
                    if, in every class of animals, we compare their organization with the intended
                    residence and mode of life of each creature, with its necessities and the nature
                    of its aliment, the most admirable adaptation of means to the end is everywhere
                    perceptible; whether we consider the instinct which impels the ant and the
                    hamster to lay up stores of food for the season of scarcity, or the bee at once
                    to solve a delicate problem in practical geometry; whether we regard the
                    structure of the proboscis of the gnat or of the elephant as suited to their
                    wants; or whether we contemplate the form and position of the levers that move
                    the limbs of animals, or the exquisite mechanism of the visual organ; all
                    proclaim the handiwork of a wise and beneficent Creator.</p><p>To us it appears evident that nature has only distinguished animated beings into
                    <hi rend="italic">species,</hi> the limits of which are fixed by the capability
                    of procreating fertile progeny; and that all our divisions into <hi rend="italic">genera, orders,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">classes</hi> are more
                    or less artificial, though of high value in assisting the memory to recollect
                    individuals, or to arrange newly-discovered species, and often as leading to
                    interesting inferences respecting their habits and geographical distribution.
                    When several species resemble each other in structure and habits, we agree to
                    consider them as of one genus; when their resemblances are somewhat less
                    numerous, we consider them as belonging to the same order; and when their
                    similarity is confined to a few points, they are grouped in the same class. All
                    these divisions are but •artificial helps to our memory, whether we follow the
                    sys tem of the illustrious Swede; or, with Cuvier, found distinctions more on
                    the anatomical structure of the animals; or, with our sagacious countryman
                    Macleay, attempt to reduce all recognized animals to <hi rend="italic">quinary
                    circular groups</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> or, with Swainson, resolve these
                    circles into <hi rend="italic">ternary</hi> associations; or, with Kirby, expand
                    these groups into the magic number <hi rend="italic">seven.</hi> Some
                    arrangement is absolutely necessary in pursuing the subject of animal geography,
                    when we consider the multitude of species; and perhaps no system is so
                    convenient as that of Cuvier, from its very general reception, and its
                    sufficiently according with the geographical distribution of species.</p><p>It is not easy to give any accurate idea of the real number even of known species
                    of animals, from the difficulties thrown in the way of animal statistics, by the
                    multiplication of species, and from confounding the effects of sex and age on
                    some animals, and overlooking specific differences in others. Naturalists have
                    differed widely on this subject. The estimate of Keferstein, as exhibiting the
                    number of extinct as well as of living species, is interesting.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Die

                    organization, not less wonderful than the anatomy of the higher animals.</p><p>To these statements we may add, that Μ. Temminck has lately given the number of
                    well-ascertained <hi rend="italic">mammifera</hi> as = 930, besides 140 species
                    which he considers as doubtful; that the birds of our recent catalogues exceed
                    6000; and that Cuvier had enumerated 6000 species of fishes. With regard to
                    insects, some naturalists have stated, that at least <pb break="no" facs="nls:193498237" xml:id="kp-eb0717-8237-0550"/>twô species of
                    insects feed on every species of plant; and therefore, that as the ascertained
                    vegetable species amount to 86,000, there must be 172,000 species of
                    insects.</p><p>The evident tendency of animals to be congregated in groups peculiar to certain
                    divisions of the earth’s surface, had long been familiar to zoologists; but it
                    does not appear that any attempt was made to define the limits of those
                    zoological divisions until the appearance of the essay of Mr Swainson, in the
                    Cabinet Cyclopaedia·. The ingenious author has there shown the claims of Europe
                    to be considered as one of the grand zoological divisions of the globe, from the
                    number of the types of natural families which it possesses. Swainson contends
                    that the <hi rend="italic">birds</hi> of any district afford a fairer criterion
                    of the limits of a geographical distribution than any other class of animals.
                    Quadrupeds he believes to be too much under the dominion of man, and liable to
                    have their geographic limits disturbed by human interference; and the other
                    classes of animals are either too numerous or too few to afford the means of
                    determining the limits of such divisions; whilst birds, though seemingly fitted
                    by nature to become wanderers, are surprisingly steady in their localities, and
                    even in the limits of their annual migrations. These migrations are evidently
                    caused by scarcity of food. Thus our swallows leave us when their insect food
                    begins to fail, and they naturally pursue that route which is shortest, and
                    affords subsistence by the way. The distance from the shores of the Baltic to
                    Northern Africa is not half so great as that between England and America; and
                    during the migration over land, the winged travellers find food and
                    resting-places as they proceed to more genial climates.</p><p>The distribution of mammifera may probably be less characteristic than that of
                    birds in Europe, where the long progress of civilization, and the spirit of
                    commercial enterprise, have blended the races of the larger animals; so that it
                    would be difficult, in most cases, to trace the native country of their original
                    stock: but in most other parts of the world peculiar quadrupeds might be found
                    sufficiently characteristic of each division.</p><p>The natural associations of animals hâve suggested another division of the earth
                    into zoological <hi rend="italic">kingdoms</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and,
                    did our limits permit, it would not be difficult to subdivide these into
                    zoological <hi rend="italic">provinces,</hi> each distinguished by some less
                    considerable peculiarities of its animal productions. It is at once apparent,
                    that these divisions will not correspond to the zones of the geographer, which
                    do not coincide with marked differences in climate, nor with the supply of food,
                    nor with the configuration of the dry land; circumstances most materially
                    influencing the distribution of animals. The earth may be divided into fourteen
                    <hi rend="italic">zoological kingdoms</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> the first
                    eight belong to the old, the six last to the new world.</p><p>OLD WORLD.</p><p>1. <hi rend="italic">Palaeonarctic Kingdom.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> This
                    division includes all Europe and Asia within the 60th degree of N. lat. Many of
                    its mammifera and birds are common to it and the northern regions of America,
                    and its peculiar animals of this class are but few. The Polar Bear it has in
                    common with North America, but the Rein-Deer of Northern Europe now appears to
                    be at leasta variety differing from the Rein-Deer of North America; and
                    certainly the Elk of the former should not be considered as the same species
                    with the Moose-Deer of the latter. The Glutton, <hi rend="italic">Gulo
                    Borealis,</hi> seems to be confined to this region; as are the common Lemming
                    and the Hamster. The great Sea-Otter, <hi rend="italic">Lutra</hi><hi rend="italic">Marina</hi> of Steller, is found on both sides of the Northern
                    Pacific, as low as 50° or perhaps 45° N. lat. The Cetacea, as might be expected,
                    are common to the arctic seas of both worlds, and some of these occasionally
                    wander southwards; but the true Greenland Whale, and the Narwal, are confined to
                    the arctic seas. The birds that constantly reside in the arctic regions are very
                    few; but this region is penetrated by numerous birds well known in other parts
                    of Europe and Asia, which resort to it as their breeding-places during its
                    transient summer. These birds chiefly belong to the order of <hi rend="italic">Natatores.</hi> A single Woodpecker, <hi rend="italic">TridactyliaΗirsuta,</hi>
                    is peculiar to the palaeonarctic kingdoms; as are the Great Wood-Grouse, and
                    several other species of the genus <hi rend="italic">Tetrao.</hi> The Snowy Owl
                    and Jer-Falcon belong to this region, though occasionally they are found in the
                    north of Scotland, and occur also in North America. Yet these regions, seemingly
                    so inhospitable, are not without numerous tenants. No part of creation is an
                    absolute waste, destitute of animation. It is well known that the enormous
                    number of ducks and other water-birds which frequent the streams and lakes of
                    arctic countries, are attracted by the infinite swarms of insect food which
                    abound in them during their short summer. Scoresby found numerous butterflies
                    and other insects on the bleak shores of East Greenland; and he states that the
                    Greenland seas teem with myriads of minute animalcules, which are the food of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Balaena Mysticetus,</hi> and which, in sea-water examined
                    by him, existed to the number of 110,592 in each cubic foot, or 23,887,872 in
                    every cubic fathom of that water.</p><p>2. <hi rend="italic">Occidento-Caucasian Kingdom.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi>
                    This division is equivalent to the <hi rend="italic">European province</hi> of
                    Swainson; but that designation appears to be not very appropriate to a region
                    embracing also a part of Western Asia and of Northern Africa. The zoology of
                    this division has been more completely explored than that of any other portion
                    of the globe, and it presents to the naturalist <hi rend="italic">types</hi> or
                    characteristic species of a great number of genera in all classes of zoology. It
                    contains many imported species, some of which are domesticated, or rendered
                    subservient to the wants of man; so that it is difficult to trace its larger
                    mammifera to their parent stock. Its most characteristic quadruped is the <hi rend="italic">Aυe-rocks,</hi> or Bos Ur us. It is the animal next in size to the
                    Rhinoceros, but is not the original stock, as has been alleged, of our domestic
                    cattle. It formerly was abundant in Europe, but has fled from human persecution
                    into the pathless forests of Lithuania, and the wilds of the Carpathians and the
                    Caucasus. The Brown Bear, <hi rend="italic">Ursus Arctos,</hi> appears strictly
                    to be a denizen of this region, though it is also found in the palaeonarctic
                    kingdom. The Ibex, the Stag, and the Roe, are also among its characteristic
                    animals; and though the Fallow Deer is said also to be found in Eastern Asia, it
                    appears to be chiefly an inhabitant of the Occidento-Caucasian kingdom. The
                    Horse and Ox, though both imported, nowhere attain to greater perfection in
                    their most valuable qualities, though the former requires the occasional
                    transfùsion of Arabian blood to preserve its energies unimpaired. Its more
                    considerable characteristic birds are, the noble <hi rend="italic">Gypaete</hi>
                    or Bearded Vulture of the Alps; the Imperial and Royal Eagles of Temminck, F.
                    <hi rend="italic">imperialis</hi><hi rend="italic">anackry-saetos</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and several species of Falcons. The Red Grouse is found in
                    no part of the world except the British islands. The Great and the Little
                    Bustards are peculiar also to this division, which is particularly rich in many
                    other genera of birds. It contains about 470 species of aves, of which 310 are
                    inhabitants of Britain; in this list are seventeen <hi rend="italic">Paptores,</hi> 117 <hi rend="italic">Insessores,</hi> seventeen <hi rend="italic">Rasores,</hi> sixty-six <hi rend="italic">Grallatores,</hi>
                    ninety-three <hi rend="italic">Natatores,</hi> besides thirteen occasional
                    visitors to our shores.</p><p>3. <hi rend="italic">Oriento-Caucasian Kingdom.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> In
                    this division there is included all Asia between the Altaian and Himalayan
                    chains. It should most probably be subdivided into two provinces.</p><p><hi rend="italic">a. The Mongolian</hi> province, of which the characteristic
                    Mammalia are the <hi rend="italic">Yak, Bos Gniniens;</hi> the Argali, <hi rend="italic">Ovis Ammon,</hi> the Onager or Wild Ass; the Wild Horse, or <hi rend="italic">Aequus Hemionus</hi> of Pallas. The <hi rend="italic">Felis</hi><hi rend="italic">Onea</hi> also belongs to this region; as does the <hi rend="italic">Ursus</hi><hi rend="italic">Phibetianus,</hi> the Thibetian Musk,
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:193498250" xml:id="kp-eb0717-8250-0551"/>which is pretty widely diffused in this division; and the lively Jerboa. Its
                    birds are little known to the naturalist, except the few which have been brought
                    from Dauria.</p><p><hi rend="italic">b.</hi><hi rend="italic">Septentrio-</hi><hi rend="italic">Sinican Province.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> The little we know of the
                    zoology of China enables us only to state, that this division abounds with
                    beautiful <hi rend="italic">Phasianidae,</hi> particularly with the Golden and
                    Silver Pheasants, which were originally brought from China. The <hi rend="italic">Argus Polyplectron</hi> is said to be found in the colder regions
                    of Thibet and China; and the <hi rend="italic">Impeyan Lophophoras,</hi> which
                    we have received from the Himalayan Mountains, may probably also inhabit the
                    mountainous districts of China.</p><p>4. The <hi rend="italic">Austro-Asiatic Kingdom</hi> may be considered as bounded
                    by the 30th degree of N.lat. and the equator. It includes Southern China,
                    Cambogia, Siam, the Birman empire, Hindustan, and Ceylon. It may be
                    characterized as the native region of the Tiger, the Panther, of the Asiatic
                    Elephant, and of the Long-armed Apes; of the Peacock, the Giant Argus, and the
                    Hornbills; of the Gangetic Crocodile, the Python, and Cobra de Capello. Its
                    other remarkable animals include the One-horned Rhinoceros, the Hunting Leopard,
                    the Malayan Bear, the. Ursine Sloth; that curious animal described by Sir
                    William Jones, the Slow Lemur, or <hi rend="italic">Stenops</hi> of Illiger; the
                    Short-tailed Pangolin or Scaly Manis, the Brahmins’ Bull, the Urnch or Wild
                    Buffaloe, and the less-known wild ox of India, named the Gour, as well as the
                    <hi rend="italic">Antelope</hi><hi rend="italic">Picta</hi> or Nilghau, <hi rend="italic">A. Tragocamelus,</hi> and several other antelopes; the beautiful
                    Spotted Axis, and several other deer; the Pigmy and Indian Musks. Among its
                    characteristic birds, besides those already mentioned, we should not omit the
                    Jungle Fowl, and the Bankiva Cock, which many naturalists suppose to be the
                    stock of our domestic poultry. The genus <hi rend="italic">Buceros</hi> is the
                    representative of the Toucans of America, and has the nerves of its nose
                    distributed in its upper mandible and bony casque; the <hi rend="italic">Cicoia</hi><hi rend="italic">Argala,</hi> or gigantic Adjutant-bird, is the
                    most remarkable of its waders.</p><p>5. <hi rend="italic">Polynesian Kingdom.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> In this
                    division we include the Philippines, Borneo, the Moluccas, Celebes, Java, and
                    Sumatra. It may be considered as the native country of the great Orang-Outan,
                    and numerous Monkeys, among which the Proboscis Monkey and Cochin-China Monkey
                    are the most remarkable; of enormous Bats, of the Galeopithecus or Flying Lemur,
                    of the Indian Tapir, and of a species of Musk. It is also characterized by its
                    very magnificent birds: among these we may notice the genera <hi rend="italic">lora, Ca-lyptornena, Eurylairnus, Irena, Gracula, Lamprotomis,</hi> and its
                    very splendid <hi rend="italic">Lories.</hi> It is distinguished by the beauty
                    and splendour of the genus <hi rend="italic">Cinnyris,</hi> formerly included
                    among the Creepers; and the elegance of its <hi rend="italic">Columbidae.</hi>
                    It also contains the Argus Pheasant or Polyplectron, the Gigantic Argus, and the
                    <hi rend="italic">Lophyrus Cuvierii.</hi> Its seas abound in most beautiful and
                    valuable shells, though it is comparatively poor in fluviatile Testacea.</p><p>6. <hi rend="italic">Chaldaeo-Arabian Kingdom.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> The
                    natural boundaries of this province are well marked by seas, the river Tigris,
                    and by the cultivated part of Syria. It may be distinguished as the region in
                    which the most valuable qualities of the Horse are developed, and where the
                    Camel, and its variety the Dromedary, with the <hi rend="italic">Gazelle</hi> or
                    Antilope Dorcas, are the most conspicuous mammifera. Its ornithology is but
                    little investigated; but the deserts are traversed by the Ostrich; its
                    mountainous regions breed Pheasants and Doves; and one bird that frequents
                    Arabia, and is greatly respected by the people, is a thrush, <hi rend="italic">Turdus Seleucus</hi> of Forskal, which follows and . destroys the innumerable
                    swarms of locusts. The rarest and most beautiful shells are found in the
                    adjacent seas; and the pearl-fisheries of the Persian Gulf have been long
                    celebrated.</p><p>7. <hi rend="italic">Australian Kingdom.</hi> —If we are permitted to include in
                    this division New Holland, Papua, Van Diemen’s</p><p>Land, and New Zealand, it has one of the richest aíid most peculiar fauna of any
                    on the globe. It may be characterized as the native region of the <hi rend="italic">Kangaroo,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Crnitho-τhynchus,</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">Echidna,</hi> of the entire superb family of Birds of
                    Paradise, of the Honey-suckers, of innumerable Parrots, of the Emeu, and <hi rend="italic">Menura</hi><hi rend="italic">Superba.</hi> The absence of all the
                    larger and pachydermatous quadrupeds was common to Australia, with the islands
                    in die great Southern Ocean, at the time of their discovery, and is one reason
                    for grouping those islands in this zoological kingdom. We have, besides the
                    quadrupeds above mentioned, whole genera peculiar to this kingdom, particularly
                    the <hi rend="italic">Perameles, Plia-langer,</hi><hi rend="italic">Petaurista,</hi><hi rend="italic">Phascolomys,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Hypsiprymnus.</hi> The following genera of birds are peculiar to that region:
                    <hi rend="italic">Sericulus, Podargus, Malurus, Ptilonorhynchus, Glaucopis,
                    Pardalotus, Mellisuga, Menura, Bacelo, Megapodius, Scythrops, Bromiceius,
                    Ceriopsis,</hi> &amp;c.</p><p>8. The <hi rend="italic">African Kingdom</hi> includes that continent south of
                    Atlas, with the islands of Madagascar and the Seychelles. It is the region of
                    the Camelopard, the Hippopotamus, and the Two-horned Rhinoceros, of the African
                    Lion, the Leopard, and African Elephant, of the Zebra and Quagga, of the Pongo
                    or Black Orang, and of the larger Baboons. It abounds in a great variety of
                    Antelopes. These animals, with few exceptions, are found over a large extent of
                    Africa; but the Hyrax of the Cape, and the Tenrec of Madagascar, are more
                    limited in their range. Of the variety and beauty of its birds, some idea may be
                    formed by consulting the splendid works of Le Vaillant. The Occipital Vulture of
                    Burchill, and numerous Eagles, are found in its southern regions. The genera <hi rend="italic">Pogonius, Musopkaga,</hi><hi rend="italic">Numida, Struthio,</hi><hi rend="italic">Anastomus, Touraco, Indicator, Pomerops, Centropus,</hi>
                    contain its most remarkable birds; but the brilliancy of the <hi rend="italic">Cinnyridae</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Lamprotomidae</hi> is well known. Most of
                    the African birds brought to Europe have rich plumage. The extinct species of
                    bird, the <hi rend="italic">Bodo,</hi> belonged to this division of the earth,
                    as our early voyagers found it in the Mauritius and Isle of France. The
                    Crocodile and Cayman appear to be diffused throughout this continent. The number
                    of poisonous Serpents is considerable, and highly dangerous in its hotter
                    regions; yet in Africa, as in other parts of the earth, by far the greater
                    number of snakes are harmless. Africa is peculiarly rich in land Testacea, among
                    which is the <hi rend="italic">Acka-tina Zebra,</hi> the largest of land shells.
                    Amongst its insects, we may notice the number of its locusts, and the prevalence
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Termes Bellicosus,</hi> an insect allied to the ant,
                    which constructs a mansion of clay, equalling in size, and surpassing in
                    solidity, the simple habitations of most of the natives of Africa to the south
                    of the desert of Sahara.</p><p>new world.</p><p>The zoology of North America has been so admirably treated by Dr Richardson in
                    his memoirs in the Sixth Report of the British Association, that it ought to be
                    studied by all interested in such researches, who will not fail to consult the
                    splendid <hi rend="italic">Fauna</hi> of North America, lately published by him
                    and Mr Swainson. In most parts of America we meet with many new genera in every
                    class of animals, and find few species that are not peculiar to the new world,
                    with the exception of marine animals. The <hi rend="italic">Quadrumana,</hi>
                    which range in America between 29° on each side of the equator, have the
                    peculiarity of either wanting the thumb on the fore extremity, or having it so
                    placed, or imperfectly developed, as not to be a real opponent to the fingers;
                    while the prehensile tails of many, and the hairy buttocks of all, showing that
                    none of them sit erect, distinguish them from the individuals most resembling
                    them in the old world. The <hi rend="italic">Carnivora</hi> of America are
                    almost all peculiar to it; indeed, with the exception of some of the marine
                    carnivora, and a very few terrestrial species, all are specifically distinct
                    from those found in other parts of the <pb break="no" facs="nls:193498263" xml:id="kp-eb0717-8263-0552"/>earth. The
                    whole order of <hi rend="italic">Marsupiata</hi> arc either American or
                    Australian; and the species of one zoological kingdom are unknown in the other.
                    America exceeds every other country in the number of its <hi rend="italic">Rodentia;</hi> and there is reason to doubt whether almost any of this order
                    are common to the two worlds. The <hi rend="italic">Edentatu</hi> occur chiefly
                    in South America, but all are peculiar to the new world. Though America appears
                    at one period to hâve been rich in the number of its <hi rend="italic">Pachydermata,</hi> as their fossil remains testify, yet at its 'discovery by
                    Europeans there were not above four or five species of this order found in that
                    continent, all peculiar to America, and only one, <hi rend="italic">Dicoylxs</hi><hi rend="italic">Torquatus,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Peccari,</hi> common to its northern and southern divisions. Among <hi rend="italic">Ruminantia</hi> we consider the American Rein-Deer and the Elk as
                    peculiar species; and the identity of the <hi rend="italic">Ovis Montana</hi> of
                    the Rocky Mountains and the <hi rend="italic">Argali</hi> of Siberia as very
                    doubtful. The order of <hi rend="italic">Cetacea</hi> is probably common to both
                    worlds, with the exception of the <hi rend="italic">Manatus Americanus</hi> of
                    Cuvier, which occurs on the coast of Florida, and seems also to occur in that of
                    South America. Dr Richardson reckons, that out of 207 species of Mammifera found
                    in North America, 169 are peculiar to that country; and if we take Temminck’s
                    estimate of this class to be correct, North America contains ½th of all known
                    Mammalia. The same author gives the number of North American birds at 696
                    species, of which 54 are <hi rend="italic">Raptores,</hi> 400 <hi rend="italic">Insessores,</hi> 33 <hi rend="italic">Rasores, 8Ι</hi><hi rend="italic">Grallatores,</hi> and 122 <hi rend="italic">Natatores.</hi> Except in the last
                    two orders, the species common to die new and old worlds are few, and a great
                    many genera are wholly American.</p><p>The Alligator, the Boa Constrictor, and the Rattlesnake, are all peculiar to
                    America. The former and the latter are widely diffused over the American
                    continent; and the Rattlesnake is found even as far north as Canada. »</p><p>In the new world we begin with the</p><p>9. <hi rend="italic">Neonartic Kingdom</hi> This includes all America be tween
                    lat. 50° N. and the pole, with Greenland and the intervening islands. The
                    characteristic Mammifera are the Musk Ox, the Black American Bear, the
                    Occidental Wolf, the Wolverine, and, as we have already stated, the Rein-Deer
                    and the Moose-Deer, with several species of Marmot, Squirrel, Lemming, and other
                    animals allied to the genus <hi rend="italic">Mus.</hi> The animal discovered by
                    Scoresby in Greenland, the <hi rend="italic">Mus</hi><hi rend="italic">Groenlandicus,</hi> has since been discovered in Novaia Zembia. The Arctic Fox,
                    Arctic Hare, and the Beaver, are common to both continents. The <hi rend="italic">Mustela</hi><hi rend="italic">Erminea</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Ursus Maritimus</hi> seem identical in both.</p><p>The Raptorial birds peculiar to this region are, several kinds of hawks and owls;

                    peculiar to this region; and among the duck tribe we may notice as American

                    British possessions south of lat. 50°, New Albion, and the other country west of
                    the Rocky Mountains, betweeri Queen Charlotte’s Sound and New Mexico and all the
                    territories of the United States, as far as lat. 30° N. It may zoologically be
                    characterized as the region of the Gricsly Bear, the Bison, the Wapeti, the
                    giant of the deer tribe, and of the <hi rend="italic">Antelope</hi><hi rend="italic">Furcifer.</hi> It possesses one marsupial animal, <hi rend="italic">Didelphis Virginica,</hi> a species which ranges from the lakes of
                    Canada to the intertròpical regions of America. But ‘its most distinguishing
                    characteristic is the number of its <hi rend="italic">Rodentia,</hi>
                    amounting'to not less than fifty-</p><p>three well∙jascertained species, and only one of which, the Beaver, is found in
                    the old continent.</p><p>Its birds are numerous, and among these the Wild Turkey is the most conspicuous
                    and characteristic. Of the <hi rend="italic">Raptores</hi> it has many falcons
                    and hawks, and, among the rest, Washington’s Eagle, a magnificent bird, which is
                    found in Kentucky. ∙ Of its numerous <hi rend="italic">Insessores,</hi> the
                    greatest number are peculiar to North America. The <hi rend="italic">Trochilidae</hi> first appear in this region. A considerable number of species
                    are found in it, but only three range to the north of latitude 33°. They
                    resemble in structure the <hi rend="italic">Honey-eaters</hi> of the .
                    Australian kingdom; but we doubt the propriety of denominating the Humming-Birds
                    <hi rend="italic">suctorial</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> for, having dissected
                    a considerable number of them, we invariably found their stomachs crammed with
                    minute insects. To capture these is probably the object of their fluttering
                    about flowers, the nectar of which they were supposed to sip. Their structure,
                    too, assimilates them to insectivorous birds. The <hi rend="italic">Rosores</hi>
                    of this kingdom are all, except a single species of <hi rend="italic">Tetrao,</hi> peculiar to America. Of this genus the most remarkable are <hi rend="italic">Tetrao Cupido,</hi><hi rend="italic">T.</hi><hi rend="italic">Umbellus,</hi><hi rend="italic">T.</hi><hi rend="italic">Franklinii,</hi><hi rend="italic">T.

                    abounds in the valley of the Mississippi. Two very peculiar reptiles are there
                    found, the <hi rend="italic">Syren Lacertina</hi> of Carolina, and <hi rend="italic">Meopoma</hi><hi rend="italic">Gigantea.</hi> These have no animal
                    at all resembling them in the old world, except the <hi rend="italic">Proteus</hi><hi rend="italic">Anguinus</hi> of the subterranean lakes of

                    the Rattlesnakes, four, if not five, distinct species of which are to be found
                    in this kingdom.</p><p>11. <hi rend="italic">Equinoxial</hi><hi rend="italic">American Kingdom.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> Using this term in an extended sense, we would include
                    under it the regions between the parallels of 30° N. and S. of the equator, but
                    exclusive of the elevated valleys and table-lands of Mexicoand Bolivia, which,
                    from the peculiarities of their climates, are entitled to be considered as
                    separate zoological kingdoms.</p><p>The division under consideration is distinguished by the number of its <hi rend="italic">Quadrumana,</hi> all of which are furnished with tails, and many

                    constitute a sort of fifth hand. It is the region of the Jaguar, a beast of prey
                    of vast strength and courage, so very unlike the account of its habits in the
                    pages of Buffon, that it is now generally supposed that the French naturalist
                    confounded it with another South American <hi rend="italic">Felis,</hi> the
                    Ocelot.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See Humboldt’s
                    Personal .Narrative.</p></note> In this region, too, the Puma abounds, an animal
                    that has, far less claim to the name of <hi rend="italic">lion of America</hi>
                    than the Jaguar has to be termed the <hi rend="italic">tiger</hi> of that
                    continent. The Puma has a considerably larger range than its congeners now
                    mentioned, being found in the woods of America from Brazil to Canada. We once
                    possessed the large skin of a black Jaguar, killed in Brazil, which is now
                    deposited in the museum of the Royal Institution in Liverpool. It is of a
                    beautiful deep blackish-brown ground, on which, in certain lights, the still
                    deeper ocellated marks of the Jaguar are visible. It also abounds with the
                    Tapir, the Capybara, and the Agouti. The Orinoco and other rivers of Equinoxial
                    America swarm with, the Manati, <hi rend="italic">Trichechus Amazonius,</hi>
                    which wanders far from the sea, as does a species of Porpesse not yet
                    ascertained. It is also distinguished by the splendour of the ' plumage of its
                    birds, of which &lt; numerous genera are <pb break="no" facs="nls:193498276" xml:id="kp-eb0717-8276-0553"/>either wholly

                    Its Raptorial birds are often distinguished by t⅛eir size. To this region belong
                    the magnificent King Vulture, and a very numerous species of the same family as
                    large as a turkey, the <hi rend="italic">Vultur</hi><hi rend="italic">Uruba</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> the Destructor and Harpy Eagles, the giants
                    of their tribe, are the tyrants of the lower provinces. The <hi rend="italic">Insessores</hi> of Tropical America are very numerous. Among them the American
                    genera <hi rend="italic">Trogon, Galbula,</hi><hi rend="italic">Ampelis,</hi><hi rend="italic">Rupicoa, Procnias, Nectarinia,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Trochilus,</hi> are remarkable for the magnificence of their plumage. The
                    bell-bird, <hi rend="italic">Casma-rkynchus Carunculatus,</hi> is celebrated for
                    the deep intonation of its simple noté, which simulates the distant bell of a
                    convent; the Troupial es are distinguished by the abrupt yet pleasing contrast
                    of their colours. The enormous Goatsuckers, especially that of the cave of
                    Caripe, and the <hi rend="italic">Mo-mots</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Prionites,</hi> are peculiai' to this region. The Toucans and Aracaris are
                    conspicuous for the size and structure of their bills, in which the organs of
                    smell are conspicuously developed. Tropical America also abounds with beautiful
                    Psittacidae, among which the Ultramarine Parrot, the Scarlet and Blue, and the
                    Blue and Yellow Macaws, are the most conspicuous.</p><p>The beautiful family of <hi rend="italic">Crax</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Pauxi,</hi> of <hi rend="italic">Penelope,</hi> the singular <hi rend="italic">Phea,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Serpent-eater,</hi> are among its <hi rend="italic">Gallinaceae</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> the Boat-Bill, <hi rend="italic">Cancroma,</hi> and the remarkable species <hi rend="italic">Mycteria Americana,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Palamedea</hi><hi rend="italic">Cornuta,</hi> the Scarlet Ibis, the Trumpeter or <hi rend="italic">Psophia

                    are remarkable for their enormous size; others, like the Canine Boa, Garden Boa,
                    the Peruvian and Mourning Snakes, for the beauty or elegant pattern of their
                    colours’; others, like the Rattlesnake, <hi rend="italic">Cro-talus
                    Durissus,</hi> or the redoubted Bushmaster, <hi rend="italic">Per de Lance</hi>
                    or <hi rend="italic">Vipera</hi><hi rend="italic">Megaera,</hi> dreaded for the
                    virulence of their poison. The fluviatile fishes of this region are remarkable;
                    but we can only here notice the Electric Gymnote, the Soldier Loricaria, and the
                    <hi rend="italic">Salmo</hi><hi rend="italic">Rhombeus;</hi> the latter the
                    pest of the South American rivers. The <hi rend="italic">Papilionidae</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">Phalaenidae</hi> among its insects, are noted for the
                    splendour of their colours and their size; and the singular Lantern-fly for the
                    brilliancy of its phosphorescence. The wounds inflicted by the large <hi rend="italic">Aranea</hi><hi rend="italic">Avicularia,</hi> or Bird-catching
                    Spider, the <hi rend="italic">Scolopendra Morsitans,</hi> which there grow to an
                    enormous size, and by a small species of scorpion, are much dreaded. In these
                    Arachnidae, dissection shows a tubular offensive weapon, and a poison apparatus
                    resembling that connected with, the poison-fangs of serpents.</p><p>12. <hi rend="italic">Mexican Kingdom.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> Its animal
                    productions, though but imperfectly explored, would seem to justify the
                    inference drawn from its peculiarities of climate, that this portion of America
                    should be considered as a distinct zoological kingdom. It has been recognised as
                    the point in which the faunae of North and South America meet. There the Wolf of
                    a northern climate ranges the same forest as the Monkey of a tropical region;
                    the Bunting and the Titmouse nestle near the Parrot and the Trogon; the
                    Phalarope of the north searches for its food on the same beach with the Jacana
                    and the Boat-bill of Brazil.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Richardson, Report of the British Association, vol. v.; and

                    vast elevation of the greatest part of this region has strongly impressed its
                    fauna with peculiarities which future research will extend. In the mean time, it
                    is sufficiently characterized as the region of the <hi rend="italic">Guanaco,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Alpaca,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Vicuna,</hi> three distinct species, which have sometimes been confounded under
                    the name of Llama. They are the Camels of South America, and were almost the
                    only mammalia subdued and domesticated by the ancient Peruvians. This is the
                    peculiar region of the <hi rend="italic">Condor,</hi> a bird which, though not
                    so enormous in size as the earlier travellers reported, is still as large as the
                    Laemergeyer of the Alps, the largest of the Raptores of the old world. It loves
                    to dwell amid the snowy solitudes of the Andes, perched on pinnacles from 9700
                    to 1500 feet above the sea, whence it pounces on its prey in the subjacent
                    valleys. The fauna of these countries is still imperfectly explored.</p><p>14. <hi rend="italic">Austro-American Kingdom.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> This
                    district extends from lat. 30. S. to Cape Horn, and embraces the <hi rend="italic">Pampas</hi> of Buenos Ayres and the south of Chili. Its fauna has
                    been little explored. Amongst its quadrupeds are the numerous heads of wild
                    horses and sheep, originally introduced by the Spaniards, but now spread over a
                    great part of South America. The <hi rend="italic">Antarctic</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Chili Fox</hi> seem to be peculiar; and perhaps the <hi rend="italic">Felis</hi><hi rend="italic">Colorolo</hi> and <hi rend="italic">F.

                    many species of seals are found, especially the <hi rend="italic">Phoca</hi><hi rend="italic">Longicolis</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Fur-seal, Ph. Falklandica,

                    the natural limitation of species has been in some measure affected by human
                    agency. The domesticated animals have been by man imported from different parts
                    of Asia into Europe, and finally into America. At the discovery of that
                    continent it was without the horse, the cow, the sheep, the hog, the dog, and
                    our common poultry, all which are spread over it in innumerable herds, and in
                    some places have relapsed into the wild state in countries well suited for their
                    subsistence. The same useful animals have been by Europeans, within the last
                    half century, carried to the larger islands of the Pacific, where they were
                    previously unknown. How many insects may’ have been propagated by the cargoes of
                    oür ships in distant lands, it is easier to conjecture than to estimate; how
                    many have been imported with the cerealia, and other gramineae of Europe, into
                    newly-discovered regions, it is impossible to say. Human agency has sometimes
                    been the means of propagating in Europe disgusting or destructive species from
                    foreign regions. Thus the commerce of the Dutch wafted the <hi rend="italic">Teredo</hi><hi rend="italic">Navalis</hi> to the dyke-defended coasts of
                    Holland, to the imminent hazard of that country; the Brown Rat and the <hi rend="italic">Blatta,</hi> which now infest this country, are believed to be
                    importations from the East Indies; and the white bug that now lays waste our

                    animal fitted by nature to inhabit every possible variety of climate. His animal
                    existence is not less secured in the frozen regions of the arctic circle; or
                    under the burning climate of the equator, than in the intermediate countries;
                    and he may be said to be the only true denizen of tfi'e whole world.</p><p>The classification of Cuvier, in his <hi rend="italic">TableauElernentaire,</hi>
                    divided the human race into five varieties, viz. 1. the White Race’; 2. the
                    Lapland, Samoied,’and Esquimaux Race; 3. the Mongoliafi Race; 4. the Negro Race;
                    5. the American Race. In-his <hi rend="italic">Pègnd Animal</hi> he seeins
                    inclined to confine them to three, of which the characteristics are'very
                    strongly marked, the <hi rend="italic">White,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Yellow,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Flach</hi> Races; but he admits that the
                    <hi rend="italic">Malays</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Americans</hi> are not
                    easily distinguishable from any of the three great' varieties of mankind in the
                    ancient continent. Bhιmenbach considers the varieties as five, viz. the <hi rend="italic">Caucasian,</hi> thë' <hi rend="italic">Mongolian,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Ethiopian,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Malayan,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">American</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and this distribution,
                    though not altogether free from objection, seems one of the best hitherto
                    proposed.</p><p>1. <hi rend="italic">Caucasian Variety,</hi> is so named, because the traditioris
                    respecting the diffusion of the human race seem to point out the region between
                    the Caspian and Black Sea as the cradle of this race; from which there have been
                    numerous radiations; and the most perfect specimens, in point of beauty of form,
                    are found among the Georgians and Circassians, Still inhabiting the <hi rend="superscript"> ,</hi> native seats of their race. The characteristics of
                    the Caucasian Variety âré, the fair skin, the oval contour of the head ( soft
                    hair, varying from black to light brown or flaxen, waving or slightly curled;
                    eyes varying from blue to dark brown; cranium expanded; facial angle large; nose
                    thin, and rather aquiline or straight; small mouth, perpendicular cutting teeth;
                    lips gently recurved; chin full and rounded. In this race the intellectual
                    qualities have been more strikingly displayed than in any other. Its principal
                    branches maybe still traced by certain, though often not very obvious,
                    affinities in the structure of language. The most ancient offsets appear to have
                    been that to the south and the east.' The Southern Armenian or Syrian branch
                    seems to have been the parent stock of the Assyrians, the Chaldeans, the Arabs,
                    the Jews, the Phoenicians, and Abyssinians; The examination of the most ancient
                    mummies would lead ∙ to the conclusion that the ancient Egyptians belonged to
                    the same stock, though the Ethiopian countenances of some of their sculptures
                    have sometimes led to a different conclusion. We believe, however, that, these
                    may be transcripts of venerated originals imported with the religion of Egypt
                    from the Nubian Meröe.</p><p>The second branch appears to have given rise to the ancient Medes, the Persians,
                    the Afghans, and the higher castes of India whose language was the Sanscrit;
                    whilst another portion of it, taking á westerly direction, spread itself over
                    Asia Minor, and, under the name of Pelasgians, penetrated iri⅛b Europe. ' Jt
                    seems to have been preceded by an offset from the 'säípe’brançh, the Celts, who
                    early penetrated to the weSterri shores <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> of
                    Europe, where they were found, <hi rend="superscript"> t</hi> after thélapsç of
                    centuries, by the Teutones, a younger shoot from the saihe stock. The whole
                    nations already mentioned, and (he‘whole present inhabitants of Europe, with the
                    exception of the Satnoieds arid Laps, are derived from the Caucasian’ Variety,
                    the most scattered and most energetic of the hhmafi family; and the affinity in
                    descent will account' for the ’ strong resemblances which havè been traCed
                    between the languages of India, of ail-ciènt Media, and the principal European
                    tongues. The Scythian branch of the Caucasian race mày’be considered as the
                    ancestors of the Parthians, the Tatarians of the Taurida, the Turcomans, the
                    Finlanders’, the Hungarians, ånd the tribes about the mouths of the Danube and
                    to the north-east of the Euxine, <hi rend="superscript"> t</hi> " . ' '</p><p>2. <hi rend="italic">The Mongolian Variety</hi> seems to have had its original
                    seat in the vicinity of the Altaian chain of mountains. It is characterized by
                    an olive complexion, and black eyes, the outer 'angles’ bf which are 'pointed
                    råther upward; their hair coarse, lank, and thin, their beard scanty; the head
                    of ⅛ square fohn, with a low and narrow' forehead, a <hi rend="superscript">
                    i</hi> broad and flattened face, high chéék-bones, flat nose, a wide thoüth, and
                    thick lips. Two branches of this race are represented by the Nomade <hi rend="italic">Kalinucks</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Kalkas,</hi> whbse ancestors
                    spread devastation ’over a largé portion of the earth, Under thëîr ‘leaders
                    Attila, Zenghiz Khan, and Timûr. A third branch, the <hi rend="italic">Mantseheθu,</hi> ’ in later times had <hi rend="superscript">;</hi> conquered
                    China, of which they <hi rend="superscript"> r</hi> are still the riders. The
                    ancient Chinese; however; séëm to have belonged to the Same race; and the
                    Japanese, the Cpréäns, and people of Thibet, probably are also offsets'from the
                    great Mongolian variety. The Esquimaux of America appear from their form to
                    belong also to the Mohgoliari Variety; and may have passed into America on <hi rend="superscript"> r</hi> the arctic ices, just as fein-deer now do annually;
                    or as the ’Tschutskói have beeri frequently known to do in order tŏ attack the
                    American Indians. The Laps, the Samoieds, the TsCħutskoi, and the
                    Kamtschatkadales, bear strorig marks of their Mongolian origin, though some are
                    disposed to regard them as derived from the Scythian branch of the Caucasian
                    race. '</p><p>3. The <hi rend="italic">Ethiopian Variety</hi> owns Africa as its native region.
                    This variety is distinguished by a black or very dark skin; black eyés; woolly,'
                    crisp, coarse hair, collected into little knots; a skull laterally compressed; a
                    forehead low and narrow, a small facial angle, produced by the inordinate
                    projection of the maxillary bones, with an oblique position of the front teeth,
                    and a small chin; the nose flat and Simons; the lips, especially the upper,
                    thick; the arms long; the legs often slightly bowed. Lawrence has satisfactorily
                    shown that there is not one peculiarity of the negro race, which is hot
                    occasionally met with in some of the other racés; and that’there is no reason to
                    believe that the negro is not of the same origin as the rest of mankind. Mr
                    Browne, and other recent travellers, have stated, that the Furians and Nubians,
                    though black, have often handsome elevated features; and we have seen a jetty
                    negress, from the eastern shores of Africa, with features that might well have
                    been a model for a Grecian statue of Juno in bronze. Those variations are
                    probably from the intermixture of the Caucasian with the Negro race.</p><p>In the Malayan peninsula, in Luçoriia, and in Borneo, among the mountainous
                    districts, are found a few scattered tribes of black men, who form the chief
                    population of Papua or New Guinea. They have dark skins and woolly hair, and, if
                    we may judge from the native of Papua brought to England by Sir Stamford
                    Raffles, the <hi rend="italic">Papous</hi> do not ma <pb break="no" facs="nls:193498302" xml:id="kp-eb0717-8302-0555"/>terially differ
                    from the natives of the eastern coast of Africa,, whence probably their
                    ancestors have emigrated.</p><p>4. <hi rend="italic">The Malayan Variety</hi> ∖ <hi rend="italic">ιas&gt;</hi>
                    its native seats in the Malayan peninsula and the adjacent islands. The
                    inhabitants of Polynesia, New Holland, and, New Zealand, are believed to belong
                    to this race. , It is far less, characterized than the three races beforç
                    noticed, and perhaps might be eprisider-od as .prpcluced by their intermixture.

                    approaching to white, a? in the inhabitants of Taheite and the Marquesas, at
                    other times .very swarthy, as .in the New Zealander and. Australian. The hair i?
                    blaçk, thick, and <hi rend="italic">generally</hi> slightly curled; the head is
                    laterally compressed, the forehead rather narrow, but high; the &lt; hopes of
                    the face large; the nose full, broad at the apex, and passing gradually into the
                    cheeks; the. mouth large; the,lips rather thick; the eyes sometimes.have the
                    Mongolian cut; the hands,are small. But many of the islands are occupied by a
                    very handsome race of inhabitants. The Malay language is widely scattered over
                    the islands of the Paçific, which shows a common origin. The recent South Sea
                    voyages show the vast distances to which design or accident has carried the
                    people of one group ofislands to another in their frail çanoes, and point out
                    how those islands may have been originally peopled.</p><p>5. <hi rend="italic">The American Variety</hi> was spread over all that continent
                    at its discovery in the end of. the fifteenth century. This race, like the last,
                    is pot very distinctly characterized, but bears a very strong resemblance to,
                    some of the Mongolian tribes in the scantiness of the beard, which is general in
                    both parts of that continent. The principal peculiarities of this race, besides
                    the scanty beard, which they generally try entirely, to eradicate,, are a dark,
                    skin, with a tint of red, or, what has, not,very,happily,, beep termed a <hi rend="italic">copper-colour.</hi> The hair is black, lank, long, and coarse. The
                    skull is very similar to the Mongolian, but the, features are more prominent,
                    especially the nose; the forehead is generally low and retreating; the eyes
                    deeply set; and the face, across the cheek-bones, .broad, the mou,th large, the
                    lips rather thick. Some of the native tribes singularly flatten the head by
                    compression while in the infant state. This is particularly the case with a
                    tribe on the Columbia. One of their skulls, in the College Museum of Edinburgh,
                    is depressed in a most extraordinary degree, so that the frontal sinus seems
                    almost as high as the vertex; and the head is posteriorly and laterally
                    extended. This was the skull of a person of rank. It was procured by the late Dr
                    Gairdner, along with the skull of a slave of the same tribe, in which this
                    flattening, no doubt esteemed a great beauty, had not been practised, but which
                    exhibited, to our eyes, a much more handsome form than that <hi rend="italic">.
                    of</hi> his master.</p><p>. The peopling of America was long a problem of much difficulty; but it has of
                    late,years been elucidated in, various respects.. Strong affinities have beqn
                    discovered between the languages of America and Eastern, Asia, which confirm the
                    inferences drawn from physiognomy. Sidi Melli-melli, Tunisian envoy to' the
                    United States in 1804, on seeing the deputies of the Cherokees, the Miamis, and
                    Osages, assembled at Washington, instantly recognised their Tatar physiognomies;
                    and· Genet, when minister plenipotentiary of France, was also struck with the
                    resemblance of the Indians of America to the Asiatic Tatars, with whose
                    appearance he was familiar. The late researches of Dr Heckewelder, and other
                    American archaiologists, have reduced the supposed infinite variety of North
                    American tongues to three or four radical languages. According to this
                    authority, all the North American native tongues may be traced to the</p><p>Floridan, the Lené-Lenapé, the Iroquois, and the Che-pewyan; and the researches
                    ofiRlaproth. and other German philologists, have strengthened the belief in the
                    affinities between the native American languages and those of Eastern Asia.</p><p>The traditions of the Mexicans, and their hieroglyphical writings, trace their

                    weakened this nation in 1051; and in 1170 the <hi rend="italic">Chichimacks</hi>
                    migrated into Mexico where, eight years afterwards, the <hi rend="italic">Ano,huatlacks</hi> also arrived. This last nation consisted of seven tribes,
                    the principal of which werq the <hi rend="italic">Aztecks.</hi> This tribe
                    called their native country <hi rend="italic">Aztlan,</hi> which they left in
                    1064, according to Gama; and, uniting themselves with the Chichimacks and the
                    remnant of <hi rend="subscript"> l</hi> the, Toltecks, they founded the city of
                    <hi rend="italic">Tenochtitlμn</hi> in 1325. It was this united people whom the
                    Spaniards denominated <hi rend="italic">Mexicans,</hi> and whose empire was
                    extinguished at the capture of the capital, Tenochtitlan, by Cortez in 1521. -
                    The. Tolt¢cks appear to have pushed colonies into South America, either by the
                    Cordillera of the Andes, or by the eastern plains at their feet. When Gonzales
                    Ximenez de Quesada arrived on the table-land of Bogota, he rvas surprised to
                    find a population on∖that plateau'in a state of considerable civilization. It
                    consisted of four tribes, all clothed in cotton garments, and settled in
                    agricultural communities. The principal tribe was the <hi rend="italic">Muysea,</hi> who possessed a calendar, the intercalations of which had as
                    striking a similarity to that employed by nations on the banks of the Indus, as
                    that of the Mexicans approached the calendar of the Mant¢heous;<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">J

                    from the motions of Jupiter in the ecliptic.</p><p>Several travellers have been struck with the resemblance of the Peruvian to the
                    Malayan race; and it is possible that, by the isles of the Pacific, their
                    ancestors reached the southern Cordillera. Their architecture has a sort of
                    Egyptian character in the form of its apertures, and the squaring of its blocks
                    of stone; but their theocracy had much resemblance to that of some nations of
                    Central Asia.</p><p>Our limits preclude our pursuing this interesting subject further, or entering on
                    the consideration of the alleged causes of the varieties of the human species.
                    We must refer our readers to the <hi rend="italic">Researches</hi> of Humboldt,

                    that whilst some attribute the varieties of the human family to the
                    long-continued action of climate, foot], and the external condition or habits of
                    life, others have regarded them as the consequences of accidental peculiarities
                    transmitted to the posterity of the individuals affected by them; and a third
                    class have considered the three' great varieties of the human race as directly
                    derived from the individual qualities of the sons or Noah. But whatever view we
                    take, it will not be found the less difficult to account for the marked national
