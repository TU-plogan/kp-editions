                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> term Pathology, in its widest signification,
                    comprehends all the knowledge which we possess relative to the state of Disease.
                    For the facility of teaching and of studying, it has been found convenient to
                    make various divisions of this extensive science. By the French, the terms of
                    <hi rend="italic">external</hi> and <hi rend="italic">internal</hi> pathology
                    have been employed as synonymous with what in this country are denominated the
                    principles and practice of surgery and physic; the purpose of this division
                    obviously being to separate the objects of medical doctrine and practice into
                    two departments, and to assign each of these to a particular class of
                    cultivators and practitioners. Another very important division of pathology
                    which has long been recognised, is that into <hi rend="italic">special</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">general;</hi> the first, or special pathology, being intended
                    to comprehend the consideration of particular diseases, as they occur in nature;
                    and the second, general pathology, to include, in the first place, the more
                    general facts or principles that have been ascertained relative to the primary
                    elements of diseases, as comprehending the <hi rend="italic">causes,
                    phenomena,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">effects</hi> of the various derangements
                    to which the animal economy is subject; and, in the second place, those more
                    general facts or principles relative to the more obvious analogies of diseases,
                    and the natural groups to which they admit of being referred, which medical men
                    have deduced from the comparison of particular diseases with one another. Unlike
                    the division into internal and external, that into special and general makes no
                    partition of the subjects of pathological inquiry; for both survey the whole of
                    these subjects, though under different aspects. General pathology, though in its
                    investigation obviously resting, as we had formerly occasion to show (see
                    article <hi rend="smallcaps">Medicine),</hi> upon a knowledge of the special,
                    has, in teaching, been found to form a convenient and appropriate introduction
                    to it; just as, in other sciences, it is convenient to give a general view of
                    the principles which have been established, before entering upon the particular
                    details the knowledge of which has led to the establishment of these principles,
                    but of which details these principles, when once ascertained, very materially
                    facilitate the comprehension and acquisition.</p>
                <p>Under whatever point of view we consider the derangements of the human economy,
                    whether, with the clinical physician, we regard them as they present themselves
                    in individual cases, or, with the special pathologist, as constituting
                    particular genera or species of diseases; or whether, with the general
                    pathologist, we endeavour to reduce them to their primary elements; in each
                    case, they offer precisely the same subjects for our investigation. These are,
                    <hi rend="italic">first,</hi> the morbid phenomena or symptoms by which we
                    become aware that derangements have actually occurred in the economy; <hi
                    rend="italic">second,</hi> the morbific agents, by which derangements of the
                    economy are liable to be produced; <hi rend="italic">third,</hi> the more
                    immediate seats of the derangements to which the economy is liable, and the
                    peculiar nature of each of these derangements; <hi rend="italic">waå.,
                    fourth,</hi> the morbid alterations discoverable in the dead body, in those who,
                    during life, had exhibited derangements in the performance of their functions,
                    whether these perceptible alterations stand in the relation of cause or of
                    effect to the derangements of function.</p>
                <p>It is in the mode of considering these several subjects, therefore, rather than
                    in the subjects themselves, that the distinction between general and special
                    pathology must be looked for. In special pathology, symptoms, morbific agents,
                    proximate causes, and organic lesions, are respectively considered in those
                    combinations in which they give rise to, or occur in, particular diseases; and
                    attention is directed to them only in as far as they are calculated to elucidate
                    the natural history of the particular disease that may be at the time under
                    consideration. In general pathology, on the other hand, the consideration of
                    symptoms, of morbific agents, of proximate causes, and of organic lesions, or
                    those branches of medical science which have been termed symptomatology or
                    semeiotics, actiology, pathogeny, and morbid anatomy, constitute so many
                    separate portions of pathological doctrine, in which the whole of the subjects
                    falling under each department are methodically arranged, and considered in
                    reference to one another.</p>
                <p>It may perhaps tend to place the distinction between general and special
                    pathology in a clearer light, if we endeavour to illustrate it by a particular
                    example.</p>
                <p>It not unfrequently happens, that an individual exhibits a combination of <hi
                    rend="italic">symptoms</hi> of the following kind. He has pain in some part of
                    the chest, his respiration is difficult, and he is subject to cough; and these
                    symptoms, all of them obviously referrible to some derangement in the
                    respiratory organs, are attended with others of a;more general character,—with
                    those symptoms which are denominated febrile, that is, with increased frequency
                    of pulse, with increased heat of skin, and with disturbance of several of the
                    other functions of the body. Now the first object of the special pathologist, in
                    respect of this combination of symptoms, is to distinguish it as constituting a
                    particular disease which he terms pneumonia (or inflammation of the lungs), from
                    other combinations of symptoms which may bear a certain degree of resemblance to
                    it,—to establish its <hi rend="italic">diagnosis,</hi> or distinction from other
                    analogous diseases. And even in the several cases which present the combination
                    of symptoms that has been mentioned, the special pathologist may be able to
                    detect certain differences of character which will lead him to establish more or
                    fewer divisions of his particular disease; differences, for example, in the
                    condition of the pulse, and in the characters of the pain and of the cough.
                    Thus, of the disease in question, nosologists, or those who treat expressly of
                    the divisions, definitions, nomenclature, and arrangement of diseases, have been
                    led to recognise three principal forms, under the names of peripneumony,
                    pleurisy, and bastard peripneumony. The special pathologist, <hi
                    rend="subscript"> r</hi> in his consideration of the symptoms of pneumonia,
                    besides, distinguishing it from other diseases, and marking the more probable
                    diversities in which it may present itself, traces its characteristic symptoms
                    throughout the whole course of the disease, and marks the diversities which
                    these assume in its different stages, and the other less distinguishing symptoms
                    with which they are accompanied; in short, he applies his knowledge of the
                    morbid phenomena, or symptoms of this disease, to determining its definition,
                    its diagnosis, and its history.</p>
                <p>All of those symptoms which have been mentioned as occurring in and
                    characterizing pneumonia, fall under the consideration of the general as well as
                    of the special pathologist; but the view which the former takes of them is
                    considerably different from that which we have just endeavoured to sketch as
                    being taken by the latter. By the general pathologist, these symptoms fall to be
                    considered, not in the combinations in which they present themselves in nature,
                    but each of them as an abstract existence, and in its relations to the other
                    morbid affections of the organ or function of which it indicates the
                    derangement. Thus the general pathologist has occasion to consider the symptom
                    of <hi rend="italic">quickness of pulse,</hi> in the general view that he takes
                    of the different morbid phenomena which result from derangements<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193492673" xml:id="kp-eb0717-2673-0122"/> of the function of
                    circulation. An opportunity is thus afforded him of conisderingthis symptomof
                    increased frequency of pulse, not only in relation to the healthy state of this
                    phenomenon, but in relation also to the other morbid states to which it is
                    subject, whether as regards its frequency, its strength, or its regularity. By
                    studying, in this manner, the morbid conditions of the pulse as a general
                    pathological doctrine, medical men are furnished with a body of information of
                    most important practical application in the investigation, not of one particular
                    disease only, but of many different diseases. The morbid phenomenon or symptom
                    of <hi rend="italic">cough,</hi> in like manner, is obviously capable of being
                    considered as a particular subject of investigation in reference to the other
                    morbid derangements of function to which the respiratory organs are liable, and
                    particularly in reference to the various modifications which this symptom may
                    itself exhibit.</p>
                <p>Secondly, a similar difference may be traced in the manner in which the special
                    and the general pathologist consider the <hi rend="italic">morbid alterations of
                    structure</hi> that are discoverable in the body after death. In pneumonia these
                    morbid alterations consist of more or less extensive marks of inflammatory
                    action in the contents of the cavity of the chest. The special pathologist
                    considers these morbid alterations in reference to the particular combination of
                    symptoms that characterize pneumonia, or may accompany its progress. He examines
                    into the condition of the contents of the chest, with a view to throw light on
                    the phenomena which the disease exhibits during life, to trace the
                    correspondence of the morbid appearances with the nature, degree, and progress
                    of the external symptoms. The general pathologist likewise has occasion to
                    direct his attention to those morbid alterations of structure to which we have
                    alluded; but, in the view which he takes of the diseased economy, they present
                    themselves to his attention, not, as they do to the special pathologist, in
                    their connection with a particular disease, but as constituting one of the forms
                    of morbid alteration of structure to which the respiratory organs are liable,
                    the whole of which he passes successively in review, simply as a department of
                    the natural history of the economy in its diseased conditions.</p>
                <p>Thirdly, when the special pathologist, in endeavouring to discover the <hi
                    rend="italic">morbific agencies</hi> by the operation of which pneumonia has
                    been excited, is led to ascribe its production to the influence of cold, he pays
                    no further regard to that morbific agent, than in its relation to this
                    particular disease; he considers merely the conditions under which cold must be
                    applied to the economy in order to produce pneumonia, the length of time that
                    intervenes between its application and the appearance of the symptoms, and such
                    other points as bear directly upon the agency of the particular cause in
                    producing the particular effect. By the general pathologist, on the other hand,
                    this morbific agent, cold, falls to be considered as a special subject of
                    investigation, along with the various changes that are liable to occur in the
                    different physical conditions, and particularly in the temperature, of the
                    atmosphere; and not as giving rise to one particular combination of symptoms or
                    disease, but, generally, in its injurious operation on the several functions and
                    organs of the body.</p>
                <p>Lastly, as regards the consideration of the <hi rend="italic">proximate
                    cause</hi> of pneumonia, the special pathologist is led, by a consideration of
                    the symptoms which he has observed during life, of the morbid changes which he
                    has found after death, and of the morbific agent to which he has traced the
                    production of the disease, to conclude that the more immediate seat of
                    derangement is in the substance or in the membranes of the lungs, and that the
                    particular mode in which these parts are affected is that usually termed
                    inflammation. He is contented, therefore, with having detected the proximate
                    cause of pneumonia as being inflam mation of the lungs. But the general
                    pathologist, in considering proximate causes as a particular department of
                    inquiry, endeavours to go farther back in the succession of morbid changes, and
                    to ascertain, from an investigation of the circumstances which attend the
                    development of inflammation in different parts of the body, what are the more
                    intimate conditions of the economy to which that morbid state is referrible, in
                    whatever organ or texture it may occur.</p>
                <p>There can, we conceive, be little doubt, that a much more complete and
                    satisfactory view must be obtained of each symptom, morbific agent, proximate
                    cause, and organic lesion, when treated of systematically, in connection with
                    other analogous phenomena, than when noticed incidentally in those varying
                    combinations in which they present themselves to the special pathologist, in
                    tracing and in describing the histories of particular diseases. And if we
                    reflect upon the circumstances under which the several subjects of pathological
                    investigation actually present themselves to the attention of the student of
                    pathology, in the consideration of a particular disease,—morbid functions,
                    morbid structures, morbific agents, and proximate causes of disease, all of them
                    combined in one whole, the relations of the several parts of which it is
                    necessary for him, as if intuitively, to comprehend,—it must be obvious, that
                    unless he shall previously have had an opportunity of taking a systematic view
                    of each of these branches of pathological inquiry by itself, such as is afforded
                    in the study of general pathology, he cannot fail to be lost among the
                    multitudinous and imperfectly understood matters which, simultaneously, as it
                    were, press themselves upon his attention.</p>
                <p>The pathologist, indeed, is in a great measure in the same situation as the
                    chemist, who meets in nature, for the most part, with objects which consist, not
                    of one, but of several different elements, and which have been produced and are
                    maintained in their combinations by the action, not of one, but of several
                    different forces. To be able to understand the constitution of such a compound
                    object, and the share which each physical and chemical force has had in its
                    production and maintenance, it is necessary that the chemist should be well
                    acquainted with those elements into which compound bodies are found to be
                    reducible. And he must also be acquainted with those few powers or forces which,
                    by their operation on the several elements of matter, enable it to enter into
                    those multitudinous combinations that give rise to the great diversity of
                    substances of which the globe consists. In short, the special pathologist has to
                    do with particular diseases, the general pathologist with the elements of
                    diseases—elements which can be ascertained only by analytical examination,
                    founded on long-continued observation and experience; but a knowledge of which,
                    when once acquired, is of primary importance in those synthetical operations by
                    which the special pathologist endeavours to arrive at the establishment and
                    distinction of particular diseases.</p>
                <p>The limits which we are obliged to prescribe to ourselves in the following
                    article render it impossible to take a satisfactory view of the various subjects
                    which fall under the province of general pathology; and, at the same time, we
                    are unwilling to occupy the pages of this work with a bare enumeration of the
                    topics which, in a systematic consideration of this department of medical
                    science, would properly claim our notice. We shall confine ourselves, therefore,
                    to some general observations relative to the state of disease; the distinctions
                    between this state and that of health; the primary seats of diseased actions or
                    diseased conditions in the animal economy; and the more essential differences
                    existing among those simple pathological states, morbid conditions, or primary
                    elementary derangements<pb break="no" facs="nls:193492686"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0717-2686-0123"/> in the structure and functions of the different
                    parts of the human economy, on which the series of morbid phenomena constituting
                    particular diseases depend—those states, in short, to which the name of
                    proximate causes of disease has very generally been applied. The topics which we
                    have now enumerated are those the consideration of which is usually included
                    under the branch of general pathology termed <hi rend="italic">Pathogeny.</hi> A
                    slight view of them, we hope, may be rendered both interesting and instructive
                    to general readers; and, at the same time, will prepare the way for a review of
                    the difficulties to which medical men are exposed in endeavouring to determine,
                    in individual cases, the nature of the maladies with which their patients are
                    affected, which we purpose to sketch in the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Physic,
                    Practice of.</hi></p>
                <p>The first duty of the pathologist seems obviously to be, to define that which
                    professedly forms the object of his inquiries and speculations, viz. the state
                    of disease. The definitions of this term, which have been proposed by
                    pathologists, have differed, not only in the precise language in which they have
                    been expressed, but in the general principles on which they have been
                    constructed. Some have been merely what are called verbal definitions, that is,
                    substitutions of synonymous expressions; such, for example, is the definition
                    which represents disease as a change from the natural to a preternatural state,
                    natural and preternatural being nothing more than synonymous expressions for
                    healthy and diseased. It is needless to insist on the obvious fact, that no
                    possible benefit can result to medical science from definitions of this
                    kind.</p>
                <p>In others of the definitions that have been given of the term disease, an attempt
                    has been made to found this upon the supposed final cause of the phenomena which
                    that state presents. Thus disease has been said by some pathologists, including
                    the illustrious Sydenham, to be an extraordinary effort undertaken by nature,
                    for the purpose of throwing out from the system, by the motions excited, some
                    morbific or noxious matter, and of thereby averting from it death and
                    corruption. The attempt to establish the final cause of any phenomenon obviously
                    implies a persuasion of our being acquainted, as far as the particular object is
                    concerned, with the views and intentions of the Author of nature, in obedience
                    to whose will the universe is conducted. The ends or purposes of some of His
                    arrangements seem sufficiently obvious to justify us in deducing them; but there
                    are others of these arrangements in which this is far from being the case, and
                    in attempting to establish the final causes of which, we run the risk of
                    substituting some crude conception of our own minds for the wisdom of the
                    Creator. That there is great risk of doing so in respect of disease, might
                    easily be established, by the various and even contradictory views of its end or
                    purpose which have been taken by those who have endeavoured to derive their
                    definition of this state from its final cause.</p>
                <p>In a third set of definitions of the term disease, an attempt has been made to
                    explain what has been called its real essence; as when disease has been said to
                    consist in a disproportion of the four humours, or in an excess or deficiency of
                    the principle of excitability. It would be easy to show that the definitions <hi
                    rend="italic">of</hi> disease which have been framed upon the principle of
                    explaining its real essence, have varied with the prevailing medical doctrine of
                    the period in which they have been proposed, inasmuchjas they have necessarily
                    borne a relation to the views entertained by medical men respecting the powers
                    by which the functions of the human economy are carried on in the state of
                    health, in whichever of the various forms of mechanical, chemical, animistic, or
                    vital doctrines, these powers may have been sought for.</p>
                <p>How, then, is disease to be defined? Precisely, it is conceived, upon the same
                    principles that every other object which admits of definition ought to be
                    defined. By an enumeration of circumstances obvious to all, and acknowledged by
                    all, to appertain to it; an enumeration not depending for its reception on the
                    speculative opinions of the person to whom it isaddressed, but recognised as
                    valid, whatever decision we may come to on certain controverted points of
                    physiological or pathological doctrine; whether, for example, we suppose the
                    functions of the animal economy to be executed conformably to, or in a manner
                    subversive of, the physical and chemical laws of inorganized matter; whether we
                    admit or reject the agency of a rational soul, or that of a peculiar principle
                    of life, in regulating its healthy and morbid phenomena; whether we affirm or
                    deny that dynamical derangement must in all instances be preceded by organic
                    alteration; whether or not we suppose mental derangement to be in all cases
                    dependent on corporeal affection; and whether or not we admit that the fluids
                    may be the primary seats of disease. Health and disease must be defined in
                    reference to one another. It is certainly the occurrence of disease that
                    suggests to the mind the idea of health; but this idea is the rule or standard
                    by which we fix our notions of the state of disease. They are both states of
                    living beings; and the respects in which they differ seem to be, that in the
                    state of health living beings maintain their ordinary structure, and are capable
                    of exercising all their functions with ease, regularity, and harmony; whilst in
                    the state of disease there is an obvious change in the structure or organization
                    of some of the solid parts of which the living beings consist, or in the
                    composition of some of their fluids; or there is a considerable deviation from
                    the easy, regular, and harmonious performance of one or more of their
                    functions.</p>
                <p>This definition, it is conceived, is applicable to any being, or class of beings,
                    of which health and disease can be predicated. The structure of living beings is
                    more or less complicated, and the functions they perform are more or less
                    numerous, according to the place they hold in the scale of organized existence.
                    Consequently the number of particulars falling within the two terms, health and
                    disease, must vary. In the human subject these terms must be understood as
                    having reference to the exercise of the mental faculties or functions, as well
                    as of the corporeal; but the definitions above suggested are, we conceive,
                    equally applicable to the simplest and to the most complicated of organized
                    beings. The definition which we have given of disease makes provision also for
                    those slighter diversities in the manner in which different persons, or the same
                    persons under different circumstances, exercise their functions, which, though
                    not consistent with perfect health, are still too inconsiderable to amount to
                    absolute disease; diversities which are usually included by pathologists under
                    the term of the latitude of health.</p>
                <p>Having pointed out the principles which should guide us in the definition of the
                    term disease, and the elements of which that definition should consist, we shall
                    now proceed to offer some general observations on what are called the proximate
                    causes of diseases, or, in other words, those morbid states or pathological
                    conditions of the different portions of the economy to which the morbid
                    phenomena or symptoms of diseases are ultimately referrible. As we had formerly
                    occasion to advert to the relations in which symptoms and proximate causes stand
                    to one another, we shall not at present dwell on this subject farther than to
                    remark, that general readers as well as students of pathology are exceedingly
                    liable to be puzzled by the great variety of synonymous terms which have been
                    employed by different pathologists to designate respectively the proximate
                    causes of diseases, and the concourses of symptoms to which they give rise. Thus
                    Professor Sprengel, in his <hi rend="italic">Institutiones</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Mcdicae,</hi> iv. 19, with the purpose of marking the distinction between these
                    two distinct constituent parts <pb break="no" facs="nls:193492699"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0717-2699-0124"/>of disease, has proposed to employ the term “<hi
                    rend="italic">morbus,”</hi> or disease, to denote the internal morbid
                    conditioner proximate cause, and the term “<hi rend="italic">affectio,”</hi>
                    affection or passion, to mark the attendant combination <hi rend="italic"
                    >of</hi> external symptoms. “Whatever,” he remarks, “is perceptible by the
                    senses of the patient himself, or of his attendants, is to be considered as the
                    passion or affection, but the internal state is the true disease.” By others of
                    the German pathologists, and particularly by Gmelin of Tubingen, and by the late
                    Professor Hartmann of Vienna, it has been proposed to mark the same distinction
                    between the internal morbid states and the external symptoms of diseases, by the
                    employment of the terms <hi rend="italic">disease,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >form of disease</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> the term disease being applied by
                    them, as it is by Sprengel, to the morbid or pathological condition or
                    conditions of the economy in which particular diseases essentially consist;
                    whilst, by the term form of disease, they wish to designate the combinations of
                    morbid phenomena occurring in concourse and succession which manifest themselves
                    in the progress of particular diseases, and which Sprengel has included, as we
                    have just seen, under the ambiguous and equivocal term of“affectio.’* Besides
                    the terms to which we have alluded, a considerable variety of other appellations
                    have been employed more particularly to designate the internal morbid conditions
                    of the economy considered as the states on the existence of which, singly or in
                    combination, the phenomena or symptoms of particular diseases depend. For in
                    different pathological works these internal morbid conditions are treated of
                    under the various appellations of primary elements of diseases, primary morbid
                    states or pathological conditions, and of simple morbid affections or simple
                    diseases (morbi simplices). Chomel speaks of them as the essences of diseases;
                    they form the internal morbid conditions of Broussais, the simple affections,
                    the internal alterations, and common principles of diseases, of Buffalini; and
                    the <hi rend="italic">“internoe indoles</hi><hi rend="italic">morbi”</hi> of
                    Friedlander. Some pathologists have denominated them <hi rend="italic"
                    >pathological,</hi> in contradistinction to <hi rend="italic">nosological</hi>
                    diseases; the term nosological being applied in the same sense as the “<hi
                    rend="italic">morbi forma,”</hi> or form of disease, of the later German
                    writers, to those combinations of morbid phenomena or symptoms occurring in
                    concourse and succession, by which particular diseases are externally manifested
                    and are characterized in our systems of nosology.</p>
                <p>In speaking of the proximate cause of any disease, it is necessary to keep in
                    recollection, that under this title may be comprehended everything that goes on
                    in the economy between the application to it, or action upon it, of the morbific
                    agent which disturbs its physiological or healthy condition, and the manifest
                    derangement of function which results. Frequently the change from the healthy to
                    the morbid state does not consist in a single event, but in a succession of
                    events. Thus, when the effect of a blow inflicted upon the head is to induce the
                    concourse of symptoms that are comprehended under the nosological disease
                    apoplexy, the first effect may have been the rupture of an artery within the
                    cranium; as a consequence of this rupture there occurs an extravasation of
                    blood; and, as a consequence of this extravasation, a particular state of the
                    brain, whether or not we may admit it to be of the nature of compression. We may
                    regard all this series of events combined, as constituting the proximate cause
                    of the apoplectic attack; or we may restrict this term either to the last event
                    in the series which we are able to trace as preceding the production of the
                    symptoms, or to the event or change which first succeeds to the operation of the
                    morbific cause.</p>
                <p>A curious topic of inquiry relative to those primary morbid states or
                    pathological conditions which constitute the proximate causes of diseases,
                    relates to their seats, or the parts of the economy in which the changes from
                    the healthy to the inorbíd condition, on which the production of morbid
                    phenomena or symptoms depends, may occur. We formerly noticed the division of
                    proximate causes into the organic or structural, and the dynamic or functional
                    (article <hi rend="smallcaps">Medicine).</hi> This is a division as to the
                    propriety of which much disputation has taken place amongst pathologists. If it
                    were to be understood as drawing an absolute line between pathological states
                    arising out of altered conditions of the organic structure of the different
                    textures, systems, and organs of the body, and pathological states anting out of
                    altered conditions of the properties or powers by which the functions are
                    executed, independently of any altered conditions of the organic structure, the
                    distinction would obviously be fallacious. The properties or powers by which the
                    functions of the body at least are performed, have no existence independently of
                    its material organization. And accordingly we cannot conceive any change to
                    occur in the condition of these properties, without its being preceded by a
                    corresponding change in the condition of the material organization. The proper
                    signification to be attached to the terms organic and dynamic proximate causes
                    seems, therefore, to be, that in the former there occurs an <hi rend="italic"
                    >apparent</hi> alteration in the structure of some part of the frame; whilst in
                    the latter, no alteration of structure is <hi rend="italic">discoverable,</hi>
                    the change in the condition of the material organization being of too subtile a
                    nature to be appreciable by the senses.</p>
                <p>The next question relative to the seats of the proximate causes of diseases that
                    presents itself for consideration is, whether, when the mental functions betray
                    evidence of a deranged performance, this is to be considered as having its
                    primary origin in morbid conditions of the mind itself, or in changes,
                    perceptible or imperceptible, in the material organization. It is allowed on all
                    hands, that it is by no means infrequent, in cases of mental derangement, to
                    find marks of organic alteration of structure in the brain, whilst in other
                    cases no such appearances are discoverable. Of these dissimilar, not to say
                    contradictory results, those who contend for and those who oppose the dependence
                    of mental derangements on morbid conditions of the material organization are
                    equally prepared to give explanations. Those who oppose this dependence aver
                    that when morbid appearances are present, they are to be regarded as concurrent
                    effects of the condition which produces the symptoms of mental aberration, and
                    not as the causes of the mental disturbance; and hold that the independence of
                    mental upon bodily derangements is proved by those cases in which all appearance
                    of organic alteration is wanting. The pathologists who contend for this
                    dependence allege, on the other hand, that whatever may be thought of the morbid
                    appearances observable in the first class of cases, it is quite possible to
                    conceive respecting the second, that changes in the material organization
                    actually exist, although they are of too subtile a nature to be discovered; in
                    short, that mental derangements may be dependent on dynamical and not on
                    structural alterations of the material organization.</p>
                <p>Setting aside, then, as inconclusive, the arguments deduced on either side from
                    the results of anatomical investigations, the opposed partisans appeal to the
                    morbific agents by which mental derangements are liable to be induced, and to
                    the means by which their removal is best promoted, for corroboration of their
                    respective views. The advocates for the independence of the mind refer to cases
                    in which mental derangement has been produced or removed by moral or purely
                    mental causes; whilst the advocates for its dependence allege that almost every
                    morbid affection of the mind succeeds to the action of certain physical and
                    vital causes, which can be supposed to operate on the mind only through the
                    intervention of the organization, and particularly of the brain; and they
                    enforce the importance of attention to the state of the corporeal organs in <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193492712" xml:id="kp-eb0717-2712-0125"/> by. the treatment
                    of insanity. This contrariety of opinion ob- ~ ʹ viously rests on the opposite
                    views that have been propounded relative to the connection of the mind and the
                    body in the state of health; a subject into which we feel indisposed here to
                    enter, not from the apprehension that any conclusion at which we could arrive
                    regarding it would be inconsistent with that belief in the future existence of
                    the soul which forms the groundwork of all religion, but from a conviction that
                    it is a question to the solution of which the human faculties are
                    incompetent.</p>
                <p>There is still another question relative to the seats of - the proximate causes
                    of diseases, which it is necessary for the general pathologist to consider and
                    determine, viz. it being admitted that the different fluids of the body are
                    liable to morbid alterations in their physical and chemical qualities, whether
                    such morbid conditions of the fluids are capable of constituting in themselves
                    real proximate causes of diseases; or, in other words, whether the fluids are
                    ever the seats of those morbid conditions or pathological states on which the
                    external phenomena or symptoms of diseases depend.</p>
                <p>Against the supposition of morbid conditions of the fluids ever being the
                    proximate causes of diseases, it has been argued, first, that the morbid
                    alterations to which they are liable depend on previously existing morbid
                    conditions of the solids, and are to be regarded in the light of effects rather
                    than as causes. When, for example, the secretion of the kidneys contains some of
                    its ordinary constituents in undue proportion, or contains an element not
                    usually found in it, this morbid condition of the urine, it is urged, must be
                    supposed to depend on a previous morbid condition of the kidneys. To estimate
                    the force of this argument, it is necessary to consider the fluids of the body
                    as belonging to two classes; first, the blood, and the fluids out of which it is
                    formed, the chyme and chyle; and, second, the fluids formed out of the blood,
                    including the various secretions, as the saliva, the bile, the urine, &amp;c.
                    Now, without any morbid action of the organs of digestion, and merely in
                    consequence of the introduction of unsuitable food into the stomach, we may
                    suppose the chyme and chyle, and consequently the blood into which they are
                    converted, to be vitiated. Again, in passing through the lungs, the blood may be
                    acted on in such a way as to produce important changes in its physical and
                    chemical constitution, by elements contained in the inspired air, and
                    independently of any morbid condition of the solids. The blood being vitiated in
                    either of the ways supposed, or in others that might be mentioned, the fluids
                    secreted from it may be conceived to participate in its noxious qualities
                    likewise, without any previous morbid condition of the solids. But if, on the
                    other hand, the blood be in a healthy state, and the fluids formed from it be
                    diseased, we must suppose this to depend on some morbid condition of the
                    secretory organ, whether of a structural or dynamical character. From this view
                    it appears that morbid states of the fluids, though they in some instances
                    proceed from morbid conditions of the solids, in others occur independently of
                    any such conditions.</p>
                <p>But it has been argued, secondly, that when there exists any noxious principle in
                    the fluids, and particularly in the blood, whether preceded or not preceded by
                    morbid conditions of the solids, it is not immediately on the altered state of
                    the blood, but on a change which it induces in the solid parts, that any morbid
                    phenomena or symptoms which manifest themselves depend; that the blood serves
                    merely as a vehicle for bringing certain noxious agents in contact with those
                    parts on which they most readily exert their action; so that the blood, when it
                    has undergone any morbid alteration, ought to be regarded rather in the light of
                    a remote or occasional, than as a proximate cause of disease. Thus, for example,
                    when, in consequence of extir-.</p>
                <p>pation or disease of the kidneys, urea accumulates in the blood, this acts as a
                    poison upon the nervous system. Here, it is said, the blood can only be regarded
                    as a vehicle of the urea, which acts as a morbific agent upon the brain; and it
                    is in the brain that the change takes place which constitutes the proximate
                    cause of the comatose affection that succeeds.</p>
                <p>In this argument a fact seems to be overlooked, to which we formerly adverted,
                    viz. that between the first action of a morbific agent upon some part of the
                    economy, and the manifestation of those phenomena or symptoms which ultimately
                    result, there usually occurs a <hi rend="italic">succession</hi> of morbid
                    changes. Is the term proximate cause to be understood as embracing the whole of
                    these changes, or as being confined to one only? and if to one, does it apply to
                    the first change which we can detect as being produced in the economy, or to the
                    last of the series which we are able to trace, as immediately producing the
                    development of the symptoms? If we include the whole series of changes under the
                    term proximate cause, then morbid states of the fluids must, we conceive, be
                    admitted as forming a constituent element of some proximate causes. Or if we
                    restrict the term to the change in the economy thatjs first produced, then we
                    must admit that this occurs frequently in the states of the fluids. So that it
                    could only be by restricting the term proximate cause to the last change which
                    we are able to trace in the economy, previously to the manifestation of the
                    symptoms, that we could be supposed justified in denying that morbid conditions
                    of the fluids act occasionally as the proximate causes of diseases.</p>
                <p>The question, whether preternatural conditions of the fluids, and of the blood in
                    particular, can be regarded as capable of constituting the. proximate causes of
                    diseases, or indeed are themselves entitled to the appellations of morbid or
                    diseased states, has been supposed to depend on the judgment that may be formed
                    relative to the vitality of the fluids, or their possession of life; it being
                    argued, that unless endowed with life, they cannot be subjects of disease. There
                    seems to us to be great fallacy in this argument. We cannot concur in the
                    physiological doctrine which would represent life as a peculiar property, with
                    which certain bodies are endowed; nor are we any more disposed to regard it as a
                    single definite result. The phenomena of the human economy are no more effected
                    by the agency of a single property, power, or force, than are those of a
                    steam-ship; and it would, in our estimation, be as reasonable to suppose that
                    the admission of a <hi rend="italic">principle of propulsion</hi> is necessary
                    and sufficient for the explanation of the latter class of phenomena, as that the
                    former can be explained by the assumption of a <hi rend="italic">principle of
                    life.</hi> The propulsion in the one case, and the life in the other, are the
                    effects of the conjunct operation of several properties or powers, and do not
                    constitute in themselves either simple powers or simple results. The expression
                    of the life being in the blood, seems to be obviously a metaphorical expression,
                    of the same character as would be a poet’s invocation to steam as the principle
                    of propulsion.</p>
                <p>We shall now proceed to take a summary view of the different forms of morbid
                    states, pathological conditions or proximate causes, from the existence and
                    operation of which severally, or more or fewer in conjunction, in the different
                    parts of the human economy, the various concourses of symptoms, or nosological
                    diseases, to which that economy is subject, seem to originate. We shall, in the
                    first place, pass in review organic or structural proximate causes, or, in other
                    words, the visible morbid changes that are discoverable in the physical and
                    structural conditions of the different textures, systems, organs, and cavities
                    of the body.</p>
                <p>The greater degree of attention that is now bestowed on the examination after
                    death, of the morbid changes which are liable to take place in the structure of
                    the different parts <pb break="no" facs="nls:193492725"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0717-2725-0126"/>of the body, must be regarded as one of the
                    circumstances that most strikingly distinguish the medical investigations of the
                    present period from those of former times. Indeed, the result of these
                    investigations has been the creation of an entirely new branch of medical
                    science, designated by the name of pathological anatomy, a branch the knowledge
                    of which is every day becoming more and more important, from the discoveries
                    that are continually making in it, and from the light these discoveries have a
                    tendency to throw upon the phenomena, the nature, the effects, and the treatment
                    of diseases. It may justly, indeed, be said, that it is to the zeal and success
                    with which morbid anatomy has been cultivated during the last half century, that
                    we principally owe the recent rapid progress and advancement of pathological
                    knowledge, and much of all that is most solid and exact in medicine considered
                    as a science.</p>
                <p>Pathological anatomy has been said by the late Professor Lobstein, in his work on
                    that subject, to have three objects to accomplish. In the first place, it
                    describes the changes which occur, in regard to the position, form, size, and
                    intimate structure of each organ in the state of disease, and considers every
                    such organ in its relations to the other parts with which it is connected by
                    more or less immediate sympathies. The second object of pathological anatomy is
                    to explain, as far as this may be possible, the morbid changes that occur in
                    different organs; to point out the manner in which these changes are effected;
                    and to ascertain under what influences, and according to what laws, they are
                    produced. These inquiries comprehend all questions relative to the origin,
                    formation, and development, of organic diseases. In the third place, it is the
                    province of pathological anatomy to compare organic alterations with the morbid
                    phenomena or symptoms that manifest themselves during the course of a disease,
                    to analyse these phenomena with care, and to determine to what degree they are
                    dependent on the alterations of structure by which they are accompanied.</p>
                <p>It is in the second of these points of view only that we have occasion at present
                    to consider this department of medical science, as elucidating the origin,
                    formation, and development of the various visible structural alterations which
                    occur in the different organs of the body. As the morbid changes of structure
                    that are liable to occur in different parts of the body are all referrible to a
                    certain number of specific elementary forms, which exhibit the same general
                    characters, in whatever textures or organs they may be seated, great advantage
                    is derived from studying these elementary forms of morbid,alterations of
                    structure abstractedly, before proceeding to consider them as they are observed
                    to occur in the particular organs of the body. This view of the elementary forms
                    of diseased alterations of structure might, perhaps, without impropriety, be
                    considered as forming a branch of pathogeny, the more peculiar province of
                    morbid anatomy being, as we conceive, to consider, what Professor Lobstein has
                    marked out as its first object, the primary morbid changes as taking place in
                    the structure of each of the different textures, systems, and organs of the body
                    individually.</p>
                <p>The morbid changes of structure that occur in the different textures and organs
                    of the body may be temporary, disappearing after a longer or shorter period of
                    time, and leaving the parts which they attack in their original healthy
                    condition. Hence it is that in many diseases not of a fatal nature, it is only
                    from death occurring accidentally during their continuance, or in a short time
                    after their termination, that we have an opportunity of ascertaining the morbid
                    changes of structure by which they are accompanied. In other instances, again,
                    the morbid changes are of a more permanent nature, and when the disease in the
                    course of which they arise does not prove fatal, they may either continue to
                    exist without materially disturb ing the economy, or they may prove the cause of
                    new diseases.</p>
                <p>The first physical change in the condition of the body to which we shall allude,
                    as giving rise to morbid phenomena or symptoms, is the presence of air in
                    situations in which it does not naturally exist, or its excessive accumulation
                    in situations in which it is usually met with. This occurrence it has been
                    proposed to designate by the name of Pneumatosis. The presence of air in the
                    subcutaneous cellular substance, sometimes occurring as a consequence of injury,
                    and in other instances independently of injury, has been long known to surgeons
                    by the name of emphysema. In the sacs of the pleurae, a quantity of air
                    occasionally collects, producing great disturbance of respiration, an occurrence
                    to which the name of pneumo-or pneumato-thorax has in recent times been applied.
                    It is well known, too, that in some cases of sudden death occurring during
                    surgical operations, air has been found in the cavity of the heart. In the
                    cavity of the alimentary canal there is always present a quantity of air or gas,
                    but under certain circumstances the quantity becomes greatly augmented, giving
                    rise to the state of the abdomen termed by medical men tympanites. It belongs to
                    the general pathologist to ascertain the different seats in which a
                    preternatural accumulation of gases is liable to occur, and their chemical
                    characters in these various situations; and to endeavour to determine the
                    sources from which, in each situation, they maybe supposed to have been derived;
                    whether the particular form of pneumatosis under observation has depended on the
                    introduction of atmospheric air by natural or accidental passages; on the
                    putrefactive decomposition of solid or fluid substances; on mechanical
                    obstruction to the free passage of gases in parts which naturally contain them;
                    on the perforation of organs naturally containing gases, and the consequent
                    escape of these into other parts; or whether a gas is ever exhaled from the
                    surface of a cavity or canal in the human body in consequence of diseased
                    action.</p>
                <p>A second change that sometimes presentsitself to those, engaged in tracing the
                    pathological conditions of the body, and one which, according to its particular
                    seat, may give rise to the symptoms of various diseases, is a deficiency of
                    blood either in the vascular system generally (in which case its most obvious
                    indications are to be found in a peculiar paleness of the face, and particularly
                    of the lips and of the gums), or in the vessels of some particular textures or
                    organs. To this state medical men give the name of anaemia, or bloodlessness. It
                    belongs to the general pathologist to inquire into the various situations in
                    which anaemia is liable to be met with; and into the circumstances in which it
                    may be supposed to originate, whether from absolute deficiency, or from vitiated
                    qualities of the nutritious fluid.</p>
                <p>A third morbid condition, which gives rise to symptoms of much importance and of
                    considerable variety according to the particular seat which it may occupy, is
                    the reverse of that last mentioned, consisting in a turgescence of the whole, or
                    of particular portions of the vascular system. This is the morbid condition
                    which medical men have denominated congestion, and to which the terms active or
                    passive are affixed, according as it is supposed to depend on an increased
                    propulsion of blood into a particular texture or organ, by the powers which
                    maintain the circulation; or on an obstruction, which prevents the blood that
                    has been sent to a part in due quantity, from being returned with proper freedom
                    to the heart. When the state of vascular turgescence is general, in consequence
                    of an excessive production of blood, the vascular system is said to be in a
                    state of plethora; so that plethora is general congestion, and congestion is
                    partial plethora. When the blood is sent to some particular part of the body in
                    increased<pb break="no" facs="nls:193492738" xml:id="kp-eb0717-2738-0127"/>
                    quantity, without the morbid condition of inflammation being produced, or, in
                    other words, when there occurs active local congestion, English pathologists
                    apply to this morbid state the name of determination, and French pathologists
                    that of fluxion. It forms by no means an unimportant object of pathological
                    inquiry, to determine the characters by which local congestion occurring during
                    life may be distinguished, in the examination of dead bodies, from similar
                    appearances originating during the agony of death, or subsequently to that
                    event, principally in obedience to the laws of dead matter.</p>
                <p>Another morbid condition, and one nearly allied to congestion, is that in which
                    the contents of the sanguiferous system escape from the vessels in which they
                    circulate, and are discharged either on the surface of a cavity or canal, or
                    into the substance of an organ. This constitutes the state termed haemorrhage.
                    We have examples of haemorrhage occurring on the surface of a cavity or canal in
                    the discharge of blood from the lungs, termed haemoptysis by medical men, or
                    from the stomach in haematemesis; and of haemorrhage occurring into the
                    substance of an organ we have examples in many cases of apoplexy, in which a
                    larger or smaller quantity of blood is discharged into the substance of the
                    brain. Like congestion, haemorrhage may be active or passive, that is to say, it
                    may depend either on the blood being propelled into a particular texture or
                    organ in greater quantity or with more force than is usual, or on some
                    obstruction to its return to the heart. To that state of the sanguiferous system
                    on which active haemorrhage depends, pathologists give the name of the <hi
                    rend="italic">molimen</hi><hi rend="italic">haemorrhagicurn.</hi> It belongs to
                    the general pathologist to inquire into the various seats in which haemorrhage
                    is liable to occur; the conditions of the blood, and of the blood-vessels on
                    which it may be supposed to depend; the modes in which the blood escapes from
                    the vessels in cases in which no visible solutions of continuity can be
                    detected; whether this takes place by dilatation of open terminations of
                    blood-vessels, or what is usually called sanguineous exhalation; or whether by
                    dilatation of pores in their coats, a theory of haemorrhage which is intended to
                    be expressed by the terms sanguineous transudation. The changes which
                    extravasated blood produces on the surrounding tissues, and those which it
                    itself undergoes in various situations subsequently to its being extravasated,
                    constitute inquiries of very considerable importance to the pathologist,
                    particularly the question, whether, in any instances, extravasated blood is
                    capable of becoming organized.</p>
                <p>In the state of health there occurs an effusion of a watery fluid into the
                    cellular texture lying beneath the skin, or entering into the composition of
                    parenchymatous organs, and into those cavities of the body which are lined by
                    serous membranes; but the removal of this fluid by absorption seems to go on as
                    rapidly as its secretion, so that the quantity never becomes considerable. In
                    disease, however, an accumulation of watery or serous fluid is liable to occur
                    in the various situations that have been mentioned, producing a pathological
                    state which has long been known to pathologists, under the name of dropsy, as a
                    fertile source of morbid phenomena. It has been supposed that an accumulation of
                    serous fluid occurring in disease, might depend either on the secretion being
                    increased without a proportionate increase in the power of absorption, or on a
                    diminished power of absorption not attended with a corresponding diminution in
                    the power of secretion. It is well ascertained, that in a large proportion of
                    the cases in which dropsical effusion occurs, there exists, as in passive
                    congestion, an impediment to the free return of the blood to the heart. Such,
                    for example, seems to be the case in those organic diseases in the course of
                    which dropsy is so apt to supervene, such as the organic diseases of the liver,
                    or of the heart itself. An impediment to the capillary or venous circulation
                    does not however appear to be essential to the production of dropsy. In certain
                    inflammatory conditions of the membranes by which serum is naturally secreted,
                    dropsical effusion is liable to take place, constituting what may be called
                    inflammatory or active dropsy; and it would appear from modern investigations,
                    that in certain diseased conditions of the kidneys, dropsy occurs, without there
                    being any reâson to suspect mechanical impediment to the capillary or venous
                    circulation. Under certain circumstances, an effusion of a serous fluid takes
                    place from membranes of a mucous character; but in this case the fluid, instead
                    of accumulating in the body as in serous dropsy, is discharged externally.</p>
                <p>There is no morbid state to which the economy is liable, of greater importance,
                    in respect of the number of diseases of which it serves as the foundation or
                    which it complicates in,their progress, or in respect of the severity of these
                    diseases, and the frequency of their occurrence, than that of inflammation.
                    Every thing combines to prove that it is in the capillary vessels that this
                    morbid state has its immediate seat; but much diversity of opinion subsists
                    among pathologists as to the precise condition of these vessels, in respect of
                    increased or diminished action, in the state of inflammation. From its frequent
                    occurrence on the surface of the body, as in inflammation of the skin or of the
                    eye, the phenomena of inflammation are more generally known to non-professional
                    readers, than those of any other morbid condition to which the body is subject.
                    But the pathologist is aware that these phenomena undergo very considerable
                    modifications, according to the texture in which the inflammation may happen to
                    occur.</p>
                <p>The state of inflammation sometimes disappears entirely from an organ or texture
                    that has been affected by it, leaving in them no trace of its having existed. In
                    this case it is said to undergo resolution. Sometimes, again, it becomes
                    associated with, or leaves behind it, various morbid conditions, which have been
                    denominated the terminations, local effects, or consequences of inflammation. Of
                    these terminations, some manifest themselves in the effusion either of an
                    increased quantity of the fluids that are naturally secreted, or in the
                    formation of preternatural fluids from surfaces, or into the substance of
                    organs. When boiling water, or a blister, is applied to the skin, the
                    scarf-skin, in a longer or shorter time, rises in vésications; and if it be
                    pierced, a quantity of watery fluid exudes. This is an illustration of
                    inflammation terminating in an effusion of serum. If a part of the body be
                    removed by a cutting instrument, and after a short time the surface thus
                    produced be examined, it will be found to be covered by a glutinous fluid.
                    Again, if a fluid be injected into the cavity of the abdomen, the serous
                    membrane which lines that cavity, and covers the intestines, will in no great
                    length of time be found coated with a similar glutinous matter. These are
                    examples of the termination of inflammation in effusion of coagulable lymph; an
                    occurrence, as we shall presently see, of equal importance, whether we regard
                    its salutary or its noxious effects in the economy. Every one knows, more or
                    less, what is meant by an abscess, viz. a collection of what is called purulent
                    matter in some texture or organ of the body. The effusion of purulent matter,
                    whether into the substance of an organ or texture, or on the surface of a
                    membrane, is uniformly preceded by inflammation, and constitutes what is
                    denominated its suppurative process, or termination in suppuration.</p>
                <p>In many instances, the state of inflammation is followed by the removal or
                    disappearance of a larger or smaller portion of the substance of the body, in
                    consequence of a morbid absorption. We have illustrations of such a morbid
                    absorption, first, in the formation of ulcers on the surface of the body; this
                    may be called <hi rend="italic">ulcerative</hi> absorption: second, <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193492751" xml:id="kp-eb0717-2751-0128"/> in that process
                    by which an abscess that may be seated at a considerable depth from the surface
                    of the body, gradually approaches towards it, and at last is discharged
                    externally; in which and similar cases, the absorption is said to be <hi
                    rend="italic">progressive</hi>: and, third, in the mode in which parts of the
                    body that have become dead are separated from the living, or what has been
                    called <hi rend="italic">disjunctive</hi> absorption.</p>
                <p>The death of a part is another event which is liable to occur as a termination of
                    inflammation, particularly when very intense in its character. This state has
                    been variously designated. By applying to the whole progress of this consequence
                    of inflammation, from its commencement to its conclusion, the name of
                    mortification, pathologists are enabled to mark out two important stages, the
                    first extending to the period when the mortified part loses its vitality, which
                    stage has been named gangrene; and the second designating the state in which the
                    part is perfectly dead, the stage or state of sphacelus.</p>
                <p>As some of the terminations of inflammation are destructive, so others of them
                    are reparatory. We have already noticed the effusion of coagulable lymph as
                    being frequently of this character. If the two surfaces of an incised wound
                    covered with coagulable lymph be brought into apposition, they will adhere, and
                    in a short time become united by the passage of blood-vessels from one surface
                    to the other. This is called the termination of inflammation in adhesion. But if
                    the surfaces of a wound be not brought into apposition, the layer of coagulable
                    lymph effused upon them will in a short time exhibit a number of granular
                    eminences, which acquire a bright red colour, from their becoming penetrated
                    with blood-vessels. To this process is given the name of granulation. In a
                    longer or shorter time, the granular surface becomes covered with a bluish-white
                    layer, and being considerably diminished in extent by its own contraction and
                    the elongation of the surrounding integuments, it comes to be again skinned
                    over, or, in the language of surgeons, it undergoes cicatrization. Similar
                    processes take place in the interior parts of the body. Should a person on the
                    serous surface of whose bowels an effusion of coagulable lymph has taken place,
                    survive the violence of the inflammatory attack, the lymph, in becoming
                    organized, will produce adhesion of the different folds of intestines to one
                    another, and to the inner surface of the walls of the abdomen; and an ulcer on
                    the inner surface of the stomach or intestinal canal may undergo the processes
                    of granulation and cicatrization, just in the same way as an ulcer on the
                    skin.</p>
                <p>In the progress of the various inflammatory processes which we have enumerated,
                    the different textures and organs in which they occur are liable to undergo
                    alterations in their consistence, becoming in some cases harder, and in other
                    instances softer, than natural. There seems reason to believe, however, that
                    these changes of induration and softening sometimes occur in particular organs
                    or textures, independently of any inflammatory action, and simply from morbidly
                    increased interstitial deposition, or morbidly increased interstitial
                    absorption. Much attention, for example, has recently been paid to a state of
                    softening occurring in the brain, in cases in which there is no reason to
                    believe it to have been connected with inflammation. A peculiar softening of the
                    coats of the stomach, first particularly noticed by Mr John Hunter, and
                    attributed by him to the solvent action of the gastric juice after death, has
                    been supposed by some pathologists to be a product of disease, taking place
                    during life, and characterized by a peculiar concourse and succession of
                    symptoms. As softening is a change liable to occur in the putrefactive
                    decomposition which the different parts of the body undergo after death,
                    considerable care is requisite to avoid confounding pseudo-morbid with truly
                    morbid softening of the textures.</p>
                <p>The different textures and organs of the body sometimes undergo an alteration in
                    the amount of their natural substance, capable of modifying very considerably
                    the exercise of their functions, and consequently of constituting the proximate
                    causes of diseases. Sometimes the substance of the texture or organ is in
                    excess, in which case it is said to be in a state of hypertrophy. In other
                    instances there occurs a diminution in the amount of substance, or what has been
                    called atrophy, or, more properly, perhaps, oligotrophy. Every one is aware how
                    much the bulk of the voluntary muscles depends upon the degree of exercise to
                    which they are subjected. A similar principle is applicable to the involuntary
                    muscles; and accordingly it is found, that when by any cause impeding the free
                    motion of the blood in either circulation, the action of one or other ventricle
                    of the heart requires to be performed with increased vigour, it takes on the
                    state of hypertrophy. The same change is liable to occur in the urinary bladder
                    when there exists a mechanical impediment to the discharge of its contents.
                    Under certain circumstances, one of the kidneys becomes incapable of effecting
                    its natural secretion. In this case, the bulk of the organ very frequently
                    diminishes, or, in other words, the kidney passes into a state of atrophy;
                    whilst its neighbour, taking upon itself, as it were, the duties of both,
                    becomes enlarged in bulk, or passes into a state of hypertrophy. The only
                    explanation we are able to give of the production of this class of organic
                    changes is, that the nutritive vessels of the texture or organ which experiences
                    them act with increased or with diminished vigour.</p>
                <p>In a large number of cases of morbid alteration occurring in the different
                    textures and organs of the body, there is found replacing more or less of their
                    natural substance, or disseminated through it, a substance of a nature entirely
                    foreign to it. Sometimes this new or foreign substance resembles more or less
                    closely one of the natural textures of the body, as when a mass of fat, or
                    portions of cartilage or of bone, are formed in situations which they do not
                    naturally occupy. To such productions of natural textures in preternatural
                    situations the name of homoioplastic formations has been applied. In other
                    instances, the new formations consist of substances altogether foreign to the
                    natural organization of the body, as when masses of hard or of soft cancer (the
                    <hi rend="italic">scirrhus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">fungus haematodes</hi> of
                    pathologists) are developed in one of the various situations in which they may
                    occur. Such formations receive tlue general denomination of heteroplastic.
                    Various other divisions have been made by pathologists, of the different new
                    growths to which the textures, systems, and organs of the body are subject,
                    according as they are symptomatic or idiopathic, cystic or sarcomatous, &amp;c.;
                    but that which is perhaps of most practical importance is, their division into
                    the mild and the malignant. The latter of these terms is applied to such new
                    growths as manifest more or fewer of the following characters; first, that at no
                    period of their development are they susceptible of resolution, that is, of
                    being removed by natural processes of the economy; second, that they are very
                    apt to appear in different textures and organs of the body simultaneously, or in
                    succession; and, third, that when they are removed by operation, growths of the
                    same character are very apt to recur in the same situation, or to develope
                    themselves in some part not previously affected. It is obvious, that in the
                    production both of the homoioplastic and of the heteroplastic formations, the
                    nutritive vessels of the part must be supposed to secrete a matter different
                    from that which they habitually furnish; with this distinction, that in the
                    first class the secreted matter is analogous to that which the same vessels in
                    the state of health furnish to other textures, whilst in the second, the matters
                    are totally different from those formed in any part of the economy in a healthy
                    condition.</p>
                <p>The morbid products that have hitherto been mentioned as occurring in the
                    different parts of the body, are either <pb break="no" facs="nls:193492764"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0717-2764-0129"/>inorganized, as in the cases of pneumatosis,
                    dropsy, and some of the new growths; or, if organized, it is by a vascular
                    communication with the body in which they exist. But it sometimes happens that
                    separate living beings are met with in different textures and organs,
                    constituting what by naturalists are termed entozoa. The entozoa most familiarly
                    known are intestinal worms, which, as every one is aware, give rise to a great
                    variety of morbid phenomena or symptoms. Sometimes the entozoon, instead of
                    having the general characters of a worm, consists of a nearly transparent bag
                    filled with serous fluid, in which case it is termed an hydatid. The disease
                    occurring in sheep, named the sturdy in some parts of this country, depends on
                    the existence of hydatids in the brain; and entozoa of the same generic
                    character have now been found in the substance of almost every organ and tissue
                    of the human body, and even in the fluids contained in the transparent cavities
                    of the eyeball. Entozoa are different from any species of animals that are found
                    <hi rend="italic">out of</hi> living bodies; and nothing is more perplexing to
                    naturalists than to explain the manner in which they are produced and
                    propagated. It has been ascertained that some genera and species of entozoa are
                    confined to particular animals, whilst others are distributed pretty widely over
                    the animal kingdom.</p>
                <p>It sometimes happens that a secreted fluid deposits a portion of the solid matter
                    which it contains, and this by accumulation comes to form one or more masses of
                    various dimensions, which may either remain in the situation in which they were
                    first formed, or may make their way into other situations. These masses, of
                    which we have examples in the depositions that occur from the urine, from the
                    bile, from the saliva, and sometimes even from the tears, are called
                    concretions, calculi, or stones, by pathologists. A singular form of concretion
                    is not unfrequently met with in certain veins of the body, particularly the
                    uterine and pelvic, to which, from their position, the name of phlebo-lites has
                    been given. In these several instances, we may suppose the deposition to have
                    depended either on a deficient quantity of the dissolving menstruum in which the
                    solid matters were contained, or on an excess of the saline, &amp;c.
                    ingredients; or it may in some cases have depended on the presence of a foreign
                    ingredient in the fluid, producing precipitation of some of its natural
                    principles. In the alimentary canal, concretions are occasionally formed by an
                    agglutination of matter introduced along with the food, and the viscid
                    secretions of the mucous surface of the stomach or intestines. Thus it has been
                    found, that in those districts in which oatmeal forms a large portion of the
                    diet of the labouring classes, such concretions are liable to be formed by the
                    inner beards of the oats; and an excessive employment of magnesia as an antacid
                    medicine has been known to produce an analogous result. In horses, alvine
                    concretions, formed chiefly out of their food, sometimes attain a very large
                    size; and in those animals which are in the habit of licking with their tongues
                    their own hides, or those of their young, balls of hair, curiously fashioned,
                    are very frequently met with.</p>
                <p>Sometimes the several hollow organs of the body, without any appearance of change
                    in the textures of which they consist, are found to have undergone an alteration
                    in their capacity, which may either extend over a considerable portion, or be
                    limited to a single point. In some instances the cavities or canals referred to
                    are more capacious than natural, or in a state of dilatation; in other instances
                    they are less capacious than natural, or in a state of contraction; and
                    sometimes contraction occurring in the course of a canal may approach, if not
                    amount, to obliteration. Contraction, as occurring in a canal, constitutes
                    simple organic stricture. It not unfrequently happens that the states of
                    contraction and dilatation are met with in differ ent parts of the same organ;
                    for if a portion of the alimentary canal, for example, become contracted, so as
                    to retard the passage of its contents through it, the portion above the
                    contraction will be very liable to become dilated by distention. The arteries
                    are liable to undergo two different forms of dilatation, the one consisting in a
                    preternatural and permanent enlargement of the whole circle of the canal, the
                    other in a partial or lateral distention of its coats. To a dilatation of the
                    second kind the name of an aneurismal sac is given by pathologists, and much
                    controversy has existed as to the conditions of the coats of the vessels in
                    which it is formed. Permanent dilatation of the veins, produced by the
                    accumulation of blood in their cavities, constitutes what has been called varix.
                    In some instances contraction at a particular portion of a canal, or stricture,
                    seems to be congenital. Of this there is a curious illustration in a contraction
                    that has been repeatedly met with in the aorta, or great artery of the systemic
                    circulation, at a very short distance from its origin in the heart. Congenital
                    stricture, sometimes amounting to obliteration, is not unfrequently met with at
                    the lower extremity of the intestinal canal.</p>
                <p>Very serious morbid phenomena occasionally result from textures or organs having
                    undergone changes in their natural position. Thus it sometimes happens that a
                    portion of the lining membrane of the gullet is protruded between the layers of
                    muscular fibres which surround it, and in this way a pouch or bag is produced,
                    which may occasion great impediment to deglutition. Again, it sometimes happens
                    that a portion of the intestinal canal slips down, as it were, into the portion
                    immediately below it, forming an <hi rend="italic">invagination,</hi> as it is
                    termed, and causing, so long as it lasts, more or less obstruction of the
                    bowels; or a portion of bowel may escape from within the cavity of the abdomen,
                    through an aperture, natural or preternatural, in its parietes, constituting
                    what surgeons term a <hi rend="italic">rupture,</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >hernia,</hi> and requiring, in many instances, the performance of a delicate
                    surgical operation for its replacement or <hi rend="italic">reduction.</hi> To
                    alterations in the relative position of the parts constituting a joint, viz. the
                    socket, and the lever which moves upon it as a fulcrum, surgeons, as is well
                    known, give the name of <hi rend="italic">dislocations.</hi></p>
                <p>Lastly, morbid phenomena are found to be referrible,in some cases, not to any
                    structural alterations occurring in the progress of life, but to imperfections
                    in the original organization of the individual,—to what are called malformations
                    or monstrosities. These imperfections or malformations seem sometimes to consist
                    in the absence or incomplete development of a particular organ or set of organs,
                    as if the natural process of development had been arrested or retarded during
                    the early stages of the growth of the foetus. In other instances they consist in
                    reduplication of one or more of the parts of the body; and in others, again, the
                    process of development seems to have taken a perverted or vicious direction, so
                    as to produce anomalies not referrible to either of the two heads that have just
                    been „mentioned. Of malformations compatible with life, but laying a foundation
                    for disease, we have examples in certain conditions of the heart, and large
                    vessels immediately connected with it, which allow a portion of the blood to
                    pass from the right side of the heart to the left, without passing through the
                    lungs, and consequently without undergoing that depuratory process which it is
                    the purpose of. respiration to effect. In this case the extremities of the
                    fingers, the lips, and other external parts of the body, have more or less of a
                    blue colour, giving rise to the affection denominated cyanosis, or blue
                    disease.</p>
                <p>Such seem to be the principal sensible alterations that are liable to occur in
                    the animal frame, and which, as giving origin to various combinations of morbid
                    phenomena or symptoms, we regard as proximate causes of diseases.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193492777" xml:id="kp-eb0717-2777-0130"/>
                <p>We have, in the next place, to consider those proximate causes of disease,
                    pathological states, or morbid conditions, which are not attended with any
                    sensible alterations in the textures or organs of the body, recognisable during
                    life or after death; and the occurrence of which is inferred solely from the
                    disturbance that takes place in the exercise of particular functions. Thus,
                    under certain circumstances, the action of the heart may become irregular, and
                    yet after a time resume its wonted regularity, showing that no <hi rend="italic"
                    >organic</hi> alteration had occurred in it; or this fact may be still more
                    decidedly established, in case of accidental death, by the actual inspection of
                    the parts. The secretion of the kidneys may, in like manner, be very materially
                    altered in respect of its quantity or composition, without these organs having
                    undergone any discoverable change in their anatomical constitution. In our
                    inability to refer such derangements of function to perceptible organic changes,
                    we attribute them to changes or alterations in the peculiar powers, forces, or
                    principles, with which the parts are endowed, that enter into the composition of
                    the texture or organ the function of which is deranged; and it is in this
                    respect that these derangements are properly termed <hi rend="italic"
                    >dynamical.</hi></p>
                <p>In judging of the <hi rend="italic">structural</hi> changes which disease is
                    liable to induce in the several textures, systems, and organs of the body, it is
                    obviously of primary importance that we should be well acquainted with their
                    healthy structure and appearances, and with the changes which these are liable
                    to undergo subsequently to death, from putrefactive decomposition, and other
                    causes. The more extensive and accurate our knowledge of these matters becomes,
                    the better must we be qualified to recognise the presence of structural
                    alterations, and to determine in what they actually consist. In like manner, in
                    considering the <hi rend="italic">dynamical</hi> derangements which are liable
                    to occur in the human economy, it is essential to have determined what powers
                    are concerned in the production of its various healthy phenomena. The full
                    consideration of this subject obviously falls under the province of the
                    physiologist; but as it is one respecting which considerable confusion of ideas
                    seems to us to prevail, and the correct determination of which is not less
                    important to the pathologist than to the physiologist, we shall venture to offer
                    a few remarks with regard to it.</p>
                <p>In entering on this inquiry, it is necessary to keep in mind, that all the
                    phenomena of the human economy, as far as they are corporeal, are produced by
                    the reciprocal action of certain external agents, and of the different parts of
                    the organized frame, upon one another. It is necessary also to keep in mind,
                    that all which is meant by ascribing to any substance the possession of a
                    particular property, is, that when a certain other substance is present, a
                    particular change will take place in the condition of one or other, or of both
                    of them. In stricter language, we substitute the term <hi rend="italic"
                    >susceptibility</hi> for that of property, in those cases in which the change is
                    most obvious in the substance to which we ascribe the property; and we use the
                    term <hi rend="italic">power</hi> in those cases in which the change is most
                    obvious in the substance that is brought into relation with that to which we
                    ascribe the property. It is equally a property of water to be solidified by a
                    certain degree of cold, and to dissolve salt; but, in accurate expression,
                    susceptibility is applicable to water in respect of the former, and power in
                    respect of the latter, of these phenomena. When the pathologist, therefore,
                    speaks of derangements or diseased conditions of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >powers</hi> or <hi rend="italic">properties</hi> of the human economy, as
                    contrasted with morbid conditions of the structure of the body, he does not mean
                    to allege that changes have taken place in certain mysterious agencies or
                    spirits lurking in certain textures of the body; but he means that changes not
                    recognisable by our senses have occurred in these textures, in consequence of
                    which they differently affector are differently affected by, external agents,
                    from what is habitual to them. It is of these differences in the mode of
                    affecting and of being affected that we, by observation, obtain a knowledge; and
                    it is by reasoning back from these that we infer the occurrence of those changes
                    in the conditions of the particular textures of the animal frame, of which, in
                    the application to them of the term dynamical, we avow that we cannot obtain any
                    more direct information.</p>
                <p>Understanding the term power in this signification, we may remark, that it is not
                    peculiar to organic textures to undergo changes in their powers or properties,
                    without any perceptible change of their interior physical conditions. When a bar
                    of iron, on being struck with a hammer, is rendered magnetic, or deprived of its
                    magnetic power, according to the direction in which it is previously placed (see
                    the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Magnetism),</hi> no change can be detected in
                    the characters of the mass, or of the particles of which it consists. The only
                    knowledge we obtain of any change having taken place in the bar of iron, is
                    derived from its evincing or not evincing magnetic properties.</p>
                <p>What, then, are the properties concerned in the production of the various
                    phenomena of the human economy, so far as these are of a corporeal nature?</p>
                <p>•The learned and the unlearned all concur in recognising a particular class of
                    beings under the title of living or organized, and in distinguishing this from
                    another class of beings, which they designate as inorganized, lifeless, or dead.
                    There is likewise a pretty general concurrence in acknowledging that the
                    prominent characters or outstanding phenomena by which living beings are
                    distinguished from those that are dead, are, <hi rend="italic">first,</hi> the
                    conversion of foreign matters into their own substance, which is continually
                    going on within them; and, <hi rend="italic">second,</hi> their invariably
                    taking their origin from a part which had previously belonged to another being
                    of exactly the same nature with themselves. For accomplishing these two ends
                    (the processes of assimilation and reproduction, as they are termed), it is
                    found that certain determinate series of phenomena are executed by living
                    beings, to which the name of vital or organic functions is assigned, such as the
                    functions of circulation, of respiration, of secretion, &amp;c. The question,
                    therefore, as to the properties concerned in producing the various corporeal
                    phenomena of the human economy, resolves itself into the inquiry, what powers or
                    agencies are concerned in the execution of each of these vital functions? Are
                    the phenomena of which each of them consists, and which, as has been said,
                    result from the reciprocal action of external agents, and of the different parts
                    of the body, on one another, when analysed and separately examined, of the same
                    nature as the phenomena observed to occur in the inorganized world; or are they
                    of a nature specifically distinct from these; or is there a correspondence in
                    some and a diversity in others? It is on the determination of these questions,
                    obviously, that our judgment must be founded, how far it is necessary to
                    attribute to the different parts of the body powers, principles, or properties,
                    distinct from those of inorganized matter, or, shortly speaking, vital or
                    organic properties, since such properties, if recognised, can be considered only
                    as general expressions for determinate groups of phenomena, identical in
                    themselves, and different from any which can be observed to occur in the
                    inorganized world.</p>
                <p>And here we may remark, that, in modern times particularly, there has very
                    generally prevailed among physiologists a great disinclination to admit an
                    identity in the various phenomena of living beings and resembling phenomena of
                    inorganic matter; or, in other words, to admit the operation, in the production
                    of the phenomena of living beings, of those physical and chemical properties to
                    which the various mutations that dead matter is liable to <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193492790" xml:id="kp-eb0717-2790-0131"/>undergo are usually ascribed.
                    Accordingly, physiologists very generally maintain that the agencies by which
                    the characteristic phenomena of living beings are produced, are essentially
                    different from those on which the phenomena of inorganic matter depend. It is
                    not denied that there is a general correspondence in the material phenomena
                    exhibited by the two classes of beings; that in each of them there is evidence
                    of the occurrence both of motions in the sensible masses, and motions in the
                    insensible elements, of matter, —of both physical and chemical changes. But
                    there is a great disposition to allege, that notwithstanding this general
                    correspondence, there exist such special differences between the physical and
                    chemical phenomena of organized and of inorganized bodies, as to render it
                    necessary to admit the operation, in the production of the former, of powers or
                    properties distinct from those which operate in producing the latter; that vital
                    physics and vital chemistry are distinct sciences from inorganic physics and
                    inorganic chemistry, acknowledging different and even contradictory laws. Before
                    proceeding to consider what grounds actually exist for this strong
                    disinclination to recognise the operation in the animal economy of the physical
                    and chemical properties of inorganic matter, we may remark, that it may probably
                    be traced in a great measure to two sources, <hi rend="italic">first,</hi> the
                    abuse of physical and chemical explanations of the phenomena of the animal
                    economy which was practised by the mathematical and the chemical sects of
                    physicians; and, <hi rend="italic">second,</hi> the wish which the cultivators
                    of any branch of knowledge generally entertain to establish for it an
                    independent character. It is not impossible that, in the present instance, this
                    latter feeling may be increased by the pride of man rendering him averse to
                    recognise an identity, even in his corporeal operations, with those of brute
                    matter.</p>
                <p>The opinions of physiologists respecting the operation in the corporeal functions
                    of the human economy, of powers different from those which regulate the changes
                    of inorganic matter, may perhaps be advantageously reduced to the three
                    following heads.</p>
                <p>Hi, That all the phenomena of this economy are under the guidance of a single
                    property, by whatever name this may be designated, which is capable of
                    subverting, and indeed is in a perpetual struggle with, the physical and
                    chemical laws of inorganic matter.</p>
                <p>2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>, That each function of the economy is under the
                    guidance of a particular or special principle; and,</p>
                <p>3rf, That in certain animal textures, independently of, or superadded to, the
                    physical and chemical powers of inorganic matter, there are implanted powers
                    specifically distinct from these, which have an important share in the
                    production of most or of all the phenomena of the animal economy.</p>
                <p>To the two first of these doctrines there present themselves objections of
                    precisely the same nature. They confound complex with simple results; and refer
                    to the agency of a common power, a number of phenomena which, though they may be
                    considered as all tending to a common end, are widely different in their
                    essential nature from one another. The function of respiration, for example,
                    comprehends a number of distinct phenomena, some physical and some chemical,
                    understanding by these terms respectively the motions of the sensible masses and
                    of the insensible elements of matter; and to suppose that science can be
                    advanced by attributing all this variety of phenomena to the agency of a common
                    principle, is a strange deviation from the ordinary laws of philosophical
                    inquiry. If this observation be just in regard to one function, it must
                    certainly acquire additional force the greater the number of functions, and
                    consequently the greater the diversity of phenomena, the production of which is
                    referred to the agency of the supposed principle.</p>
                <p>The advocates of the third doctrine recognise the important influence of those
                    physical and chemical powers to which the phenomena of inorganic matter are
                    attributed, in producing the phenomena of the several functions of the animal
                    economy, so far as these are corporeal. But an analysis of these functions leads
                    them to believe that, besides the inorganic powers, there must be others
                    concerned in their production, seeing that some of their phenomena are of a
                    nature specifically distinct from those exhibited by any form of dead matter.
                    They do not content themselves with the general conclusion that the function of
                    digestion, for example, is totally different from any process which occurs in
                    inorganic beings, and that it is consequently incumbent upon us to admit the
                    existence of a peculiar vital principle of digestion; but analysing, as far as
                    they are able, the various phenomena which, in combination and succession,
                    constitute this function,—tracing the series of antecedents and consequents by
                    which it is effected,—they endeavour to determine what are the precise phenomena
                    which do, and what are those which do not, admit of being referred to the
                    ordinary properties of inorganic matter, and are thus led to judge what
                    phenomena, from not being referrible to these properties, require the
                    recognition of powers peculiar to living beings in general, or to the animal
                    economy in particular.</p>
                <p>There are obviously two sources of error in the judgments which may be forméd on
                    these points. Isí, Our imperfect knowledge of the phenomena respecting which we
                    are called on to judge; our inability to trace the successive series of changes
                    by which the obvious result is ultimately effected. How much of the knowledge
                    requisite for enabling us to refer the phenomena of digestion, to resume our
                    former example, to their respective causes, is of very recent attainment? how
                    much perhaps still remains to be acquired? But, 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>, our
                    knowledge of the laws which preside over the physical and chemical changes of
                    inorganic matter is likewise still very imperfect. There are doubtless very many
                    phenomena going on in the inorganic world, which have not even been observed,
                    far less generalized. These may have their resembling phenomena in the economy
                    of living beings; and, from our ignorance of the one, we may fail to observe the
                    other; or, in observing them, we may erroneously suppose them to depend on
                    principles or properties peculiar to the economy in which they present
                    themselves to our notice. The observations and experiments of Mr Brown
                    respecting the motions of molecular particles, those of Dutrochet relative to
                    Endosmosis and Exosmosis, and those of Professor Graham relative to the
                    transmission of gases, have brought to light in our own days a number of
                    phenomena occurring in the inorganic world, which may very possibly have their
                    resemblances in the economy of organized beings; and other sources of motion and
                    change in inorganic matter may yet remain to be discovered. And even in respect
                    of those physical and chemical agencies, with the operation of which, in the
                    inorganic kingdom, we are more or less familiar, it is quite possible that they
                    may be taking a share in producing the phenomena of organized beings, though we
                    do not recognise their operation. Thus a very strong belief has been entertained
                    by many physiologists that electricity or galvanism exerts a very important
                    influence in the performance of several of the functions of the animal economy;
                    and that, in like manner, as this economy possesses within itself the power of
                    generating <hi rend="italic">heat,</hi> so it is provided with an apparatus
                    capable of evolving electricity or galvanism. It is not necessary to enter here
                    into a consideration of the circumstances which have led to the belief that the
                    brain is such an apparatus, and the nerves the conductors of the electrical or
                    galvanic fluid. But we may suggest, that if this opinion could be proved to be
                    correct, many of those phenomena which seem at present irreconcileable <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193492803" xml:id="kp-eb0717-2803-0132"/> with the ordinary
                    properties of inorganic matter, and consequently to require the recognition of
                    peculiar vital powers, might find their explanation in the agency of this
                    powerful source of physical and chemical changes.</p>
                <p>If these views relative to the powers concerned in producing the phenomena of
                    living economies be correct, it follows, that it is the duty of the pathologist,
                    in tracing the dynamical derangements to which the different parts of the animal
                    frame are subject, to keep in mind the variations which may occur in the
                    ordinary physical and chemical properties of the solids and fluids of which that
                    frame consists, as well as in those properties which are peculiar to itself;
                    seeing that modifications of these inorganic principles must necessarily have
                    great influence in inducing pathological phenomena.</p>
                <p>With this caution we shall notv proceed to consider what are the ultimate or
                    simple phenomena occurring in the animal economy, which seem to be specifically
                    different from phenomena observable in the inorganic kingdom, and to require the
                    recognition of peculiar vital properties, and to what pathological conditions
                    these properties seem to be subject. The vital properties most usually
                    recognised by physiologists and pathologists seem to be Irritability, Tonicity,
                    Sensibility, Nervous Energy or Innervation, Sympathy, and Vital Affinity.</p>
                <p>Whatever differences may exist in the views which physiologists entertain
                    respecting the other agencies by which the various functions of the animal
                    economy are executed, they universally agree in admitting muscular irritability,
                    or the power which muscular fibres possess of shortening on the application of
                    certain agents, which physiologists term <hi rend="italic">stimuli,</hi> as a
                    property of great influence in the production of the physical motions observable
                    in the economy, and as one to which nothing strictly analogous, so far as is
                    known, has been discovered in any other portions of nature’s works. There are
                    few, indeed, if any, of the corporeal functions of the animal economy, natural,
                    vital, or animal, in the exercise of which muscular fibres, and the principle of
                    irritability with which they have been endowed, are not more or less immediately
                    concerned. And, consequently, the dynamical morbid conditions of these fibres,
                    or the morbid conditions of the principle of irritability, enter largely into
                    the explanations which the pathologist endeavours to give of the derangements to
                    which the different organs of the body are liable in the exercise of their
                    functions.</p>
                <p>The deviations from healthy action to which the principle of irritability is
                    subject, seem referrible to three principal heads, viz. <hi rend="italic"
                    >first,</hi> increased, <hi rend="italic">second,</hi> diminished, and, <hi
                    rend="italic">third,</hi> perverted or vitiated action.</p>
                <p>In respect of irritability, physiologists distinguish between the <hi
                    rend="italic">facility</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">force</hi> with which
                    muscular fibres contract, or the <hi rend="italic">mobility</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">vigour</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and the same distinction must
                    be kept sight of in pathology. Irritability may be excessive in <hi
                    rend="italic">facility,</hi> or, in other words, muscular fibres may be
                    excessively <hi rend="italic">mobile,</hi> a slight stimulus producing a
                    contraction to which it would have been quite inadequate in health; or
                    irritability may be deficient in <hi rend="italic">facility,</hi> or muscular
                    fibres preternaturally <hi rend="italic">immobile</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >torpid,</hi> a stimulus which would have called a muscle into action in the
                    state of health being now insufficient to effect this. Of preternatural mobility
                    of muscular fibres we have an example in the readiness with which, in particular
                    states of disease, the muscular coats of certain canals, as the gullet and
                    urethra, are excited to contraction by the introduction into these canals of
                    foreign bodies which, in their healthy state, would pass through them without
                    exciting any perceptible muscular contraction. Of preternatural immobility or
                    torpidity, throughout all its possible degrees, we have examples in the state of
                    palsy, both in the voluntary muscles and in involuntary muscular organs.</p>
                <p>Again, irritability may be excessive in <hi rend="italic">force,</hi> a given
                    amount of stimulus producing a more forcible contraction . than in health; as
                    frequently happens to the voluntary muscles in cases of mania, when the patient
                    manifests a degree of physical strength greatly beyond his natural powers; and
                    as seems to occur in respect of the action of the vascular system on the
                    circulating blood, in what is called the phlogistic or inflammatory diathesis.
                    Irritability may likewise be deficient in force, as is well known to happen to
                    the voluntary muscular system in some diseases, as fevers at a very early stage
                    of their progress, and as happens in all diseases, sooner or later, in the
                    course of their progress. Of deficient force of irritability in involuntary
                    muscular organs, we have an example in the action of the sanguiferous system in
                    the state of collapse, or sinking.</p>
                <p>It may be remarked, that the states of diminished force or vigour, and increased
                    facility or mobility of contraction, are frequently combined in the same muscles
                    or muscular organs; so that although a small amount of stimulus is sufficient to
                    call them into action, their action is not powerful. This fact is often
                    exemplified in the contractions of the heart, which may be very frequent in
                    number, and at the same time very feeble in force.</p>
                <p>Besides increased and diminished force and facility of action, there are other
                    morbid conditions to which the power of muscular irritability is liable, that
                    may be referred to the head of altered or vitiated action. In the ordinary
                    circumstances of the economy, the contraction of a muscle, succeeding to the
                    application of a stimulus, is speedily followed by a state of relaxation, and
                    this even though the stimulus which produced the contraction continues to be
                    applied. But there is a morbid state of the contraction of muscles that is not
                    disposed spontaneously to alternate with relaxation, and in which, too, the
                    fibres do not easily yield to any extending powers that may be applied. Such a
                    state of contraction, which may occur either in voluntary muscles, or in
                    involuntary muscular organs, is called a state of spasm. Most persons have had
                    experience of those local spasms which, under various circumstances, occur in
                    the muscles of the extremities, particularly of the calves of the legs, and to
                    which the name of cramps is familiarly given. That singular affection which has
                    been termed catalepsy, in which a part of the body retains for a great length of
                    time the-position in which it may be placed, however disagreeable or fatiguing
                    it might be to the person when in health, furnishes us with an example of a
                    tendency to spasmodic contraction pervading the whole of the voluntary system of
                    muscles. The various muscular canals, as the gullet, the intestines, the
                    gall-ducts, the urethra, &amp;c. are frequently the seat of spasmodic affection,
                    producing an inorganic form of <hi rend="italic">stricture.</hi></p>
                <p>A second morbid condition of irritability that may be referred to the head of
                    vitiated or altered action, is that in which muscles and muscular organs are
                    excited to contraction by preternatural causes, and are contracted with unusual
                    velocity and force, and in which, especially, the contractions alternating with
                    relaxation are frequently and preternaturally repeated. Contractions of this
                    kind are observable in the greater part of the muscles of voluntary motion, in
                    the fits or paroxysms of the disease termed epilepsy; and to the same class
                    belong the agitatory motions observable in different parts of the body in
                    chorea, or St Vitus’s dance, and in hysteria. These contractions have sometimes
                    been called <hi rend="italic">clonic</hi> spasms, whilst the epithet of <hi
                    rend="italic">tonic</hi> spasms has been applied to contractions not alternated
                    with relaxations. But the terms tonic and clonic spasms are now very generally
                    laid aside by pathologists, and the two different kinds of muscular contraction
                    formerly designated by them are now usually distinguished from one another by
                    the simple names of spasms and convulsions. Though <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193492816" xml:id="kp-eb0717-2816-0133"/>spasm and convulsion be in
                    themselves distinct phenomena, it would be easy, by a reference to particular
                    diseases, to illustrate the truth of Dr Cullen’s remark, that “many, and indeed
                    most, of the diseases considered as spasmodic affections, are, in respect of
                    tonic and clonic contractions, of a mixed kind.” (Sect. 1753.)</p>
                <p>A wide difference of opinion has subsisted among physiologists as to the nature
                    of the power by which the relaxation of a muscle succeeding to its contraction,
                    consequent on the application of a stimulus, is effected; some conceiving that a
                    sufficient explanation of this phenomenon is to be found in the simple
                    elasticity of muscular substance, whilst others maintain that it can be
                    accounted for only by recognising in muscles an active power of expansion as
                    well as of contraction. Nor is it muscular tissue only which has been supposed
                    to be endowed with an active principle of expansion or dilatation. By many the
                    expansion which is liable fo occur under peculiar circumstances, in what has
                    been called the erectile tissue, is supposed to have its primary origin in an
                    active distention of that tissue itself, and not in its mere passive dilatation
                    by fluids propelled into it from behind, or accumulating in it in consequence of
                    obstruction to their further course (Chaussier, Adelon, Stieglitz, &amp;c.):
                    whilst by others it is conceived, that to explain the state of <hi rend="italic"
                    >orgasm,</hi> as it is called, we must pre-suppose the existence of an increased
                    vital affinity between the blood and the tissue of the organ which is capable of
                    distention (Müller). The phenomena in question are certainly highly deserving of
                    investigation; but we confess we are not at present prepared to acknowledge the
                    necessity of admitting a peculiar vital property as being concerned in their
                    production.</p>
                <p>Many physiologists have' admitted the existence in the animal economy of another
                    form of contractile power besides irritability, distinct from any observable in
                    inorganic matter, to which they have given the name of tonicity. There has been
                    great vagueness, however, in the attempts which have been made to define the
                    peculiar characters of this property, so as to distinguish it from the
                    elasticity of inorganic matter on the one hand, and from muscular irritability
                    on the other, as well as to determine by what textures it is possessed.</p>
                <p>Many phenomena seem to prove, that in living and healthy animals, the muscular
                    fibres, both of the voluntary muscles, and of involuntary muscular organs, have
                    a constant tendency to become shorter, and, but for counterbalancing powers,
                    such as antagonist muscles or distending liquids, would actually become so.
                    Thus, if any joint be bent by external force, the flexor muscles contract
                    spontaneously without any exertion of the will. If a muscle be divided
                    transversely by the knife of the surgeon, a considerable degree of retraction
                    takes place in the separated portions, and the antagonist muscle also contracts.
                    That the retraction in this latter case is not attributable to the stimulus of
                    the knife, appears from the fact, that “the separate portions which have been
                    retracted,” as Mr Mayo remarks, “if excited, shorten further, and then again
                    become elongated to their last dimension.” Besides, when the tendon of a living
                    muscle is cut across, the muscle instantly contracts, and continues of its
                    diminished length. In fracture of the patella, the rectus muscle of the thigh
                    contracts sometimes to a very great extent; and in most cases of fracture there
                    occurs similar retraction, which, though it may be in part explicable by the
                    irritation of splintered pieces of bone, cannot be wholly attributed to that
                    cause. It is found, also, that the arteries arc always nearly accommodated to
                    the quantity of blood contained in them. When a ligature is placed upon an
                    artery of a living animal, the part of the artery beyond the ligature becomes
                    gradually smaller, and is emptied to a certain degree, if not completely, of the
                    blood it contained. It has been observed, too, that some hours after death the
                    arteries are much diminished in size, and this occasionally to such an extent as
                    to be rendered impervious.</p>
                <p>By some physiologists it has been imagined that these phenomena may be explained
                    on the principle of simple elasticity, it being conceived that in the living
                    body muscles are stretched out or extended beyond their natural state as dead
                    elastic substances. “To the elastic nature of the muscles generally,” says Dr
                    Bostock <hi rend="italic">(Elem. Syst. of Physiology,</hi> i. 160-1), “as
                    consisting of a compound of fibre and membrane, I should refer the <hi
                    rend="italic">natural contraction</hi> of Whytt, those actions which Cullen, and
                    many physiologists since his time, have called tone or tonicity, and which
                    Bichat has classed under the head of contractility from texture, in which, after
                    a part has been distended by any cause, when the distending force is withdrawn,
                    it gradually recovers its natural form and dimensions.” But the supposition that
                    muscles are stretched, in the living body, beyond their natural elasticity, is
                    opposed by the fact, that when a dead muscle is cut out of the body, before it
                    has begun to putrefy it will be found to extend farther than from its origin to
                    its insertion, as is particularly evident in a long muscle, such as the
                    sartorius.</p>
                <p>There are other circumstances, too, which seem to show that this constant
                    tendency of muscular fibres to contract depends on their connection with the
                    nervous system, on a constant and regular action of the nervous system on the
                    muscular, a fact which does not seem reconcileable with the notion of its being
                    simple elasticity. When the portio dura (or muscular nerve) of one side of the
                    face is divided, the muscles of the opposite side of the face contract to such a
                    degree as to draw the cheek of the affected side over to it; and the same thing
                    is liable to occur as a consequence of cerebral apoplexy. It is usual to explain
                    this phenomenon by saying that the muscles of the affected cheek, having lost
                    their tonicity, no longer counterbalance those of the sound side, which, in
                    consequence, being left to the uncontrolled influence of their own tonicity,
                    undergo contraction; nor does there appear to be any mode of accounting for it,
                    either on the hypothesis of simple elasticity or of irritability. We may perhaps
                    also regard the pathological condition of relaxation of the sphincter muscles
                    occurring in particular states of the nervous system, as evidence of the
                    dependence of tonicity upon that system. It is proper, however, to keep in mind
                    a fact which seems to have been ascertained by Bichat, viz. that when a muscle
                    is transversely divided, the retraction is equally prompt and energetic, whether
                    the nerves of the part have been previously cut through or not.</p>
                <p>If, then, we recognise irritable contractility and tonic contractility, or
                    irritability and tonicity, as two distinct vital properties, the following seem
                    to be the characters by which they must be distinguished from one another: <hi
                    rend="italic">First,</hi> tonicity is the tendency which certain parts of the
                    animal frame have to contract, independently of the agency of stimuli;
                    irritability is the tendency of muscular fibres to contract in consequence of
                    the agency of stimuli: <hi rend="italic">second,</hi> the contractions dependent
                    on irritability are alternated with relaxation; those dependent on tonicity are
                    not so alternated. Asa <hi rend="italic">third</hi> distinctive character, it
                    has been alleged that while the contractions of irritability are instantaneous,
                    those arising from tonicity are very gradual and slow.</p>
                <p>While the existence of tonicity as a separate power has been a matter of
                    considerable doubt and discussion to physiologists, the language that has been
                    used by pathologists would seem to imply that they were fully persuaded of its
                    existence and very extensive operation in the animal economy; for there is no
                    explanation of morbid phenomena more familiarly in use with the learned or the
                    unlearned, than that of ascribing them to loss of tone, or the state of <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193492829" xml:id="kp-eb0717-2829-0134"/> atony. And,
                    certainly, no class of remedies enjoys a higher degree of popularity than those
                    which, under the designation of tonics, are supposed to possess the power of
                    restoring or increasing the tone of the several organs of the economy, and
                    particularly of the digestive. In examining these expressions with any degree of
                    accuracy, however, we shall find that all which is in general meant to be
                    implied by the use of the term tone, whether applied to the economy generally,
                    or to particular parts of it, is merely vigour of action, without any
                    consideration being paid to the question, whether this depends on a single and
                    peculiar power, or is the result of the combined operation of several distinct
                    powers.</p>
                <p>Even in regard of the voluntary muscles, it may be a matter of no small
                    difficulty to decide, when a particular class of muscles are in a state of
                    preternatural contraction, whether this depends on what we have called <hi
                    rend="italic">spasmodic</hi> irritable contraction of their own fibres,
                    overcoming the resistance of their antagonists, or on their <hi rend="italic"
                    >tonic</hi> contraction, consequent on a loss of tone on the part of their
                    antagonists. In wry-neck, for example, is the primary affection, so far as the
                    muscles are concerned, in those on the side towards which, or in those on the
                    side from which, the head is turned? or may it in some instances depend on one
                    of these causes, and in other instances upon the other cause, affording what Dr
                    Good has designated the two varieties of loxia <hi rend="italic">irritata,</hi>
                    or spastic wry-neck, from excess of muscular action on the contracted side; and
                    loxia <hi rend="italic">atonica,</hi> or atonic wry-neck, from direct atony of
                    the muscles on the yielding side?</p>
                <p>In involuntary muscular organs, however, it must be a matter of infinitely
                    greater difficulty to trace the influence of pathological conditions of the
                    property of tonicity, in consequence of the more concealed and more limited
                    field of its operations. One of the pathological phenomena occurring in an
                    organic function which seems most to favour the hypothesis of tonicity as a
                    distinct power from irritability, is the state of the arteries in inflammation.
                    Notwithstanding the increased velocity with which, in some cases at least, the
                    small or capillary arteries of an inflamed part propel their contents, they are
                    in a state of distention. Dr Thomson, in his experiments on the effects produced
                    by applying various substances to the web of the frog’s foot, found that the
                    state of the capillary vessels thus excited that bore the greatest resemblance,
                    in outward appearance, to the state of inflammation, was that which occurred on
                    the application of a saturated solution of common salt. In this case, the
                    arteries, instead of being contracted, as he found to happen when ammonia is
                    applied, were actually and sensibly dilated. “The part of the web to which the
                    salt was applied became of a red colour, and this redness, which was visible to
                    the naked eye, lasted in general for a period of from three to five or more
                    minutes. It was impossible to view with the naked eye the part to which the salt
                    had been applied, without conceiving it to be inflamed.” As in some cases the
                    application of the salt produced an increased velocity in the circulation
                    through the dilated larger and smaller arteries and capillary vessels to which
                    it was more immediately applied, the vascular distention, obviously, could not
                    be attributable to mechanical obstruction.</p>
                <p>Whether the distended state of the capillary arteries in inflammation, a state
                    which, it thus appears, can be so readily imitated, if not induced, by the
                    action of salt upon the web of the frog’s foot, be attributable to a loss of
                    tone in their parietes, seems a question fairly open for the consideration of
                    pathologists. The idea seems to receive countenance from an interesting
                    observation of Dr Alison’s, who found that when, subsequently to death, an
                    artery going to an inflamed limb is compared with the corresponding artery going
                    to an uninflamed limb, it is of larger calibre, and possesses less power of
                    re-acting upon a distending fluid. <hi rend="italic">(Edm. Med. and Surg.
                    Journ.</hi> χ∣v. 98.)</p>
                <p>On the whole, it may, we believe, without injustice be affirmed that, to
                    determine the propriety of recognising such a peculiar vital property as
                    tonicity at all, and, in the.event of its recognition being found necessary, to
                    ascertain the particular phenomena, physiological and pathological, which ought
                    to be referred to its agency, would require a much more precise method of
                    analytical investigation than has ever yet been brought to bear oħ the
                    elucidation of this subject.</p>
                <p>The next vital property which we have to mention as generally recognised by
                    physiologists, is sensibility. As voluntary motion consists of an affection of
                    the mind succeeded by an affection of certain parts of the organic frame, viz.
                    the voluntary muscles; so sensation consists of an affection of certain parts of
                    the organic frame, viz. the organs of sense, succeeded by an affection of the
                    mind. In both cases we have reason to believe that the nerves are the media of
                    communication between the brain as the organ of the mind and the other parts of
                    the body. In speaking of sensibility as a vital property, it is necessary to
                    keep in mind the twofold character of sensation, as a corporeal and as a mental
                    phenomenon. We presume that those agents the application of which to certain
                    parts of the body is ultimately followed by those states of mind which we
                    designate sensations, produce some change in the state of the nervous
                    extremities, and that some corresponding changes subsequently ensue in the
                    nervous cords, and ultimately in the brain; just as we presume that, in
                    voluntary motion, the affection of the mind acts in some way on the brain, and
                    that the change induced in this organ is propagated along the nerves to the
                    ìnuscular fibres.</p>
                <p>Although the property of irritability is liable to be called into play in a large
                    class of muscles, by the particular state of mind termed the will or volition,
                    yet, in the assistance which it gives in effecting a number of the functions of
                    the animal economy the mind has no share, these functions being purely
                    corporeal. Different names have been given to the irritability of muscular
                    fibres, according as it is called into operation by one or other of these
                    causes, viz. the will or material stimuli, and amongst these the names of animal
                    and organic contractility. Some physiologists have conceived that a similar
                    distinction may be established in respect of sensibility; that, besides what is
                    called animal sensibility, or that property of the nervous system in virtue of
                    which impressions produced on particular parts of the body by external agents,
                    or by peculiar conditions of its own textures, are communicated through the
                    brain to the mind, there is an organic sensibility, in virtue of which the
                    different textures themselves become sensible of the action upon them of
                    external agents; “la faculté,” says Μ. Cailliot, “qu’ont les parties des corps
                    animes de recevoir des impressions quelconques, qui produisent des changemens
                    proportionnés à ces impressions.” So completely independent of mind did Bichat,
                    the great advocate of organic sensibility, consider this property to be, that he
                    ascribes it to vegetables. “Nature,” says he, “has endowed each portion of a
                    vegetable with the faculty of feeling the impression of the fluids with which
                    the fibres are in contact.” (zbzai. <hi rend="italic">Génér.</hi> i. xli.) But
                    if this application of the term sensibility be legitimate, we do not see how it
                    can be confined to the phenomena of organic beings. A piece of marble may with
                    equal propriety be said to be sensible of the impression of the acid which
                    resolves it into its constituent elements; and a detonating powder sensible of
                    the impression of the blow which occasions its explosion. The word sensibility,
                    which is intended to denote a peculiar form of susceptibility, a form the
                    essential peculiarity of which consists in its terminating in the production of
                    a particular state of mind, would in this way be rendered synonymous<pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193492842" xml:id="kp-eb0717-2842-0135"/> with
                    susceptibility in genera]. It is probable that the idea of an organic
                    sensibility may arise in part from the belief entertained by physiologists,
                    that, in many instances, external agents, in acting upon our corporeal organs,
                    do not act upon them directly, but through the intervention of the nerves, the
                    same channels by which sensible impressions are conveyed to the brain as the
                    organ of the mind. But even this point of analogy, if fully established, would
                    not warrant us in connecting the name of sensibility with a phenomenon with
                    which the mind is in no way related.</p>
                <p>In respect of sensibility, we know that, independently of any perceptible
                    alterations in the organization of the several parts concerned in the exercise
                    of that function (from that part upon which the impression is primarily made, to
                    that by which it is transferred as it were to the mind, so as to become an
                    object of consciousness), morbid variations are liable to occur, both as regards
                    the intensity of the sensations produced by a given amount of impression, and as
                    regards the qualities of the sensations. Under a variety of circumstances more
                    or less perfectly understood by us, our sensations (both those depending on the
                    impression of external objects, and those which result from processes going on
                    within the body, or our sensations of impression and of consciousness, according
                    to the distinction recognised by Dr Cullen) are liable to become more intense
                    than they are in the state of health. In other circumstances, these sensations,
                    particularly those of impression, become less distinct than natural, or are not
                    at all produced; a state variously designated by nosologists, according to the
                    seat which it may occupy, but which, from its frequent coincidence with
                    diminished muscular irritability, has often been improperly included under the
                    term of paralysis or palsy.</p>
                <p>The various morbid conditions of sensibility which cannot be referred to the two
                    heads of increased and diminished, and which are therefore included under that
                    of vitiated or perverted, seem referrible to the three following: Isí, The
                    perception of objects that do not exist, as when those appearances which have
                    been called <hi rend="italic">museae</hi><hi rend="italic">volitantes</hi> are
                    seen floating in the air like dark or luminous spots, lucid ribbons, &amp;c.;
                    2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>, the perception of external objects otherwise than
                    they really are or appear to others, whether as respects their number, form,
                    size, colour, or state of motion or rest; and, 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>, the
                    perception of the qualities of bodies different from what is usual to us, as
                    when those substances which in health are agreeable to us, become disagreeable,
                    or the reverse.</p>
                <p>When these various conditions of sensibility occur as dynamical affections, it is
                    by no means easy for the pathologist in all instances to ascertain in what
                    portion of the nervous system the dynamical affection has its more immediate
                    seat; whether in the extremities of the nerves on which the impression is first
                    received, or in the nervous cords by which it is conducted to the brain, or in
                    the brain itself, in which we presume that some change must be produced
                    previously to the affection of the mind which completes the function of
                    sensation. When, for example, the sense of sight is lost, as in amaurosis, and
                    no perceptible change of structure can be discovered capable of explaining the
                    morbid phenomenon, are we to seek for the seat of the dynamical affection in the
                    retina, in the optic nerve, or in the part of the cerebral mass with which that
                    nerve is more immediately connected?</p>
                <p>Before passing from the consideration of the properties of irritability and
                    sensibility, we may observe, that nothing can mark more strongly the extreme
                    difficulty which exists in obtaining the general recognition of the clearest and
                    best established truths of science, than the frequent proposals that have been
                    made, since the differences in the characters of these two vital, or, more
                    correctly speaking, animal properties, irritability and sensibility, were fully
                    demonstrated by Haller, to re-unite them as one property· under a common
                    denomination, such as that of excitability, &amp;c. That there is a coincidence
                    in some of their laws, may be admitted; so is there in some of the laws of heat
                    and light, which, too, frequently occur in combination. But the physiologist has
                    no stronger reason for alleging identity in the one case, than the natural
                    philosopher for alleging it in the other; and nothing, we are persuaded, can be
                    conceived more calculated than this confusion to retard the progress of medical
                    science. It has frequently, indeed, been argued in favour of this identity, that
                    irritability implies sensibility; that everything which is irritable must be
                    sensible, in order that it may perceive the stimulus which calls it into action.
                    But, as has been already shown in speaking of organic sensibility, we might as
                    well say that every thing which is inflammable must be sensible, in order that
                    it may perceive the impression of heat; that gunpowder must be sensible of the
                    spark which inflames it.</p>
                <p>A strong belief has existed among medical men that the several organs of the body
                    are greatly dependent, for the <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> suitable exercise
                    of their functions, on an influence or energy communicated to them by the
                    different parts of the nervous system; some organs being supposed to be more
                    immediately under the control of its cérébro-spinal, and others under that of
                    its ganglionic portion.</p>
                <p>This belief has had its origin in the interruption to the exercise of the
                    different functions which has been found to be occasioned by division of the
                    nerves of their respective organs, or by the removal or destruction <hi
                    rend="italic">of</hi> particular portions of the nervous system, as well as in
                    the functional derangements that are observed to occur under the influence of
                    diseases of that system, or under the operation of certain agents, such as
                    opium, upon it.</p>
                <p>But though the facts that have been alluded to seem to warrant the general
                    inference that the central portions of the nervous system exercise, through the
                    medium of the nervous cords, an important influence on the performance of the
                    several organic functions, as well as of those in which consciousness is
                    involved, it must be confessed that we are still unable, from the results of
                    physiological experiments, numerous as these have been, or of pathological
                    observations, to say in what particular manner this influence is brought to bear
                    upon the organic functions, and in what manner it operates. Those who recognise
                    the operation, in the animal economy, of a peculiar principle, to which, from
                    its source, the name of innervation has been given, are not able to say whether
                    it produces or concurs in producing phenomena of a physical or of a chemical
                    character; whether its mode of operation be the same in all the different
                    functions, as the notion of its being a special agent or principle would lead us
                    to conclude, or peculiar in each. Thus, for example, physiologists have very
                    generally concurred in admitting that an influence derived from the nervous
                    system is essential to the performance of the function of digestion, seeing that
                    the division of the par vagum, or the destruction of particular portions of the
                    brain or spinal marrow, put a stop to its continuance. But there is very far
                    from being a like concurrence of opinion as to the particular process or part in
                    the performance of this function, with which that nervous influence is more
                    immediately connected, and the interruption of which causes the discontinuance
                    of the whole function; whether the nervous influence be essential to the
                    conveyance of blood to those secreting organs by which the fluids of the stomach
                    are elaborated; or whether it assists these secreting organs in the performance
                    of their task; or whether it aids in those reciprocal chemical actions which
                    take place between the gastric fluids and the food introduced into the stomach;
                    or whether, by maintaining the peristaltic motion of the stomach, it contributes
                    to the physical removal of the portion of food that has been acted <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193492855" xml:id="kp-eb0717-2855-0136"/> on by the gastric
                    juices, and to the bringing of a new surface of the food in contact with them;
                    or, lastly, whether it may not be that several or all of these successive
                    phenomena of the function of digestion depend on the influence which the stomach
                    derives from the central portions of the nervous system, the ganglionic as well
                    as the cerebro-spinal, through the nerves which ramify in its parietes.</p>
                <p>At one time there seemed reason to believe that physiologists had ascertained the
                    nature of the influence communicated by the nervous system to the several organs
                    of the body—and were thus put in a fair train for· ascertaining its mode of
                    operation. When it was found that the interruption to the process of digestion,
                    occasioned by the division of the par vagum, could be obviated by connecting the
                    lower extremity of the nerve with a galvanic battery, or even by allowing its
                    divided extremities to approach within a small distance of one another, it was
                    scarcely possible to resist the conclusion, that galvanism was the active
                    principle essential to the exercise of digestion, of which the division of its
                    nerves deprived the stomach. More recent observations, however, have suggested
                    doubts as to the correctness of this conclusion, and threaten to deprive us of
                    the simple solution of the problem of innervation which it seemed to afford.</p>
                <p>Some physiologists, indeed, doubt altogether the production in the central
                    portion of the nervous system, and propagation along the nervous cords, of an
                    energetic power or principle aiding the several organs in the exercise of their
                    particular functional phenomena; and conceive, that in respect of the organic
                    functions the nervous system acts as a medium of communication between their
                    organs and the stimuli or impressions by which they are called into action.
                    According to this hypothesis the food introduced into the stomach produces a
                    particular impression on the extremities of the gastric nerves, which is
                    propagated along the nervous cords to the nervous centres, and the nervous
                    centres being in some way affected by the impression, react, through the same
                    medium of communication, upon the organs in which a change is to be produced;
                    as, for example, upon those which secrete the gastric fluids, or upon those
                    which effect the peristaltic motion of the stomach. If this can be proved to be
                    the correct explanation of the manner in which the nervous system operates in
                    promoting the performance of the organic functions, it may be right to employ
                    some appropriate term to designate it; but, for the reasons already assigned, we
                    must avoid giving to this intervention of the nerves the denomination of
                    sensibility, even with such a qualifying appellation as <hi rend="italic"
                    >or-game.</hi></p>
                <p>With the physiological doctrine of innervation in a state of so much
                    embarrassment and uncertainty, it cannot be expected that in pathology it should
                    be possible to make any very precise or extensive application of it to the
                    explanation of morbid phenomena. It is obvious, however, that many of the facts
                    on which the doctrine of innervation rests are of a pathological nature. And it
                    is by availing himself of the experiments which nature as it were performs to
                    his hand,—by noting, in cases of organic diseases of the different portions of
                    the nervous system, the changes which occur in the action of the several organs,
                    that the pathologist may hope to contribute his share to the elucidation of this
                    difficult subject.</p>
                <p>In recognising variations in the condition of this vital power, as a probable
                    source of morbid derangements in the exercise of the functions, the pathologist
                    must be careful not to give to this source of morbid actions an overwhelming
                    preponderance, to the ‘ exclusion of variations in the other powers, inorganic
                    or organic, that are concerned in the production of the various phenomena of the
                    animal economy. With some pathologists, dynamical derangement of function and
                    innervatory derangement seem to be regarded as synonymous expressions, as if,
                    whenever an organ, in which no structural alteration is discoverable, performs
                    its function in an irregular manner, this must depend on some disturbance of its
                    innervatory influence. But this is by no means the case. Of the three conditions
                    of the economy, for example, described by Μ. Andral, in which palpitation of the
                    heart is liable to occur, independently of organic lesion, viz. a state of
                    plethora, a state of anemia, and a state unattended with either of these
                    conditions of the vascular system, it is in the last only, in which we conclude
                    that the nervous centres are themselves affected, that we are entitled to
                    attribute the palpitation of the heart to a <hi rend="italic">lesion of
                    innervation.</hi></p>
                <p>From the nature of the connection which subsists between the nervous system and
                    the several organs of the body, it follows that a <hi rend="italic"
                    >dynamical</hi> affection of an organ,— that is to say, a morbid exercise of its
                    function, unattended with any perceptible alteration in its own structure,— may
                    depend on an <hi rend="italic">organic</hi> affection of some distant part of
                    the nervous system; and it is particularly by tracing such dependencies that
                    pathological anatomists have diminished or sought to diminish the number of
                    diseases previously regarded as ultimately dynamical.</p>
                <p>There is still another form of nervous conduction to which, under the name of
                    sympathy, pathologists frequently refer in their explanations of morbid
                    phenomena, and which, without being in itself a new source of such phenomena,
                    occasionally modifies in a very important manner the'relations between proximate
                    causes of disease and the symptoms by which they manifest their existence.</p>
                <p>, There are, perhaps, few terms under which a greater diversity of phenomena have
                    been sought to be comprehended than that of sympathy, owing in a great measure
                    to the very imperfect analyses with which medical inquirers too frequently
                    content themselves, of the succession of events by which an obvious result is
                    preceded. To us it appears, that in medical language the term sympathy ought
                    strictly to be confined to denote the arising of sensations, motions, or other
                    vital changes, in the animal economy, suddenly and without the intervention of
                    the will, from external or internal impressions made upon, or irritations
                    excited in parts distinct or at a distance from, those in which these
                    sensations, motions, or changes, actually occur; and in pathology more
                    particularly to denote a certain co-suffering or condolence of different parts,
                    in consequence of which, when one part is morbidly affected, either all the
                    other parts of the body, or some particular and different part, is
                    simultaneously affected, either in the’ same or in some different but obvious
                    manner. When the sympathetic morbid affection extends to all parts of the body,
                    as when the state of fever is produced by a wound, it is said to depend on the
                    general sympathy of the economy. When, again, the sympathetic affection is
                    limited to some particular part, as when the presence of stone in the bladder
                    gives rise to itchiness and pain at the extremity of the urethra, it is said to
                    depend upon a particular sympathy.</p>
                <p>The great variety of pathological phenomena which have been regarded as
                    sympathetic, may perhaps be referred to two general classes, sympathetic
                    sensations and sympathetic motions. According to the general definition that has
                    been given of pathological sympathetic phenomena, it obviously follows that
                    sympathetic sensations are those which we experience in a part distinct from
                    that to which the exciting cause is applied; as when the sensation of itchiness
                    of the nose is occasioned in children by the presence of worms in the
                    intestines. Sympathetic motions, in like manner, are those that occur in
                    particular muscles or muscular organs, in consequence of the application of a
                    physical stimulus to a part distinct from that to which they immediately belong,
                    and with which they cannot be shown to have a <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193492868" xml:id="kp-eb0717-2868-0137"/>direct nervous communication;
                    as when cramps occur in different muscles, particularly those of the lower
                    extremities, from the presence of acid or of bilc in the alimentary canal; or
                    when disturbance of the action of the heart is produced by the same causes.</p>
                <p>In every sympathetic phenomenon, two distinct parts of the body must be
                    considered as being concerned; Is?, that on which the primary impression of the
                    external agent is made; and, 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>, that in which the
                    sympathetic effect is manifested. In speaking, therefore, of the sympathies of
                    any organ, as the stomach, for example, we may consider it either, Is?, as being
                    the part primarily acted on by an external impression; or, 2<hi rend="italic"
                    >d</hi>, as being the seat in which the operation of the external impression
                    becomes apparent to us by the production of the sympathetic effect. It has been
                    to mark this distinction that the terms active and passive sympathies have been
                    employed; an organ being said to have an active sympathy with another organ,
                    when an impression made on the first is folloived by a sympathetic affection of
                    the second organ, while, in this case, the second organ is said to have a
                    passive sympathy with the first.</p>
                <p>“In endeavouring to discover some general principle or principles capable of
                    accounting for the phenomena of sympathy, medical men have been led to believe
                    that sympathetic connections exist principally between parts bearing a close
                    resemblance to one another in their structure, or having a community of
                    function, and between parts connected with one another by means of vessels and
                    nerves, or situated in the vicinity of one another. Finding that the two former
                    of these circumstances, resemblance of structure and similarity of function, did
                    not lead to any satisfactory explanation of the phenomena of sympathy, attention
                    was more particularly directed to the two last of the circumstances mentioned,
                    especially to the communication existing between parts, whether near to or
                    remote from one another, through the medium of nerves. It was soon observed that
                    there are four ways in which a connection may be established between distinct or
                    distant parts, through the medium of nerves; Is?, the same nerve may in its
                    course pass through different parts; 2c?, a nerve may send branches to different
                    parts; 3c?, two or more nerves going to different parts may arise from the same
                    portion of the central part of the nervous system,—the brain and spinal marrow;
                    <hi rend="italic">⅛th,</hi> two or more such nerves, though arising from
                    different portions of the common sensory, may be connected with one another in
                    their course by anastomosing branches. These possible different modes of nervous
                    communication suggested to physiologists the further inquiry, whether, when a
                    sensation, motion, or other vital action arises in some part of the body, in
                    consequence of an impression made on some other distinct part, the impression
                    must first be communicated from the part primarily affected, to the brain, and
                    from thence be transmitted to the part in which the resulting sensation or
                    action occurs; or whether the impression may pass directly from the part on
                    which the external agent operates, to the part ultimately sympathetically
                    affected, without passing through the brain.”</p>
                <p>Physiologists are accustomed to assert, with very considerable confidence, that
                    the chemical processes or operations which take place in organized beings are
                    regulated by laws not only different from, but opposed to, those that preside
                    over the chemical changes which occur in inorganic bodies; and that it is
                    consequently necessary to admit the agency, in their production, of a principle
                    different from any recognised in inorganic chemistry. To this principle, when
                    regarded as distinct from the general vital principle of some physiologists,
                    they give the name of vital affinity. The arguments alleged in favour of the
                    existence of such a principle are threefold: <hi rend="italic">First,</hi> that
                    we are unable to render an explanation of many of the chemical processes
                    occurring in organized bodies; <hi rend="italic">second,</hi> that in living
                    systems, chemical combinations are effected, or organic compounds are formed, to
                    which nothing analogous is met with in dead matter, and which the chemist is
                    unable to imitate; and, <hi rend="italic">third,</hi> that elements remain
                    combined in living systems, which, under the ordinary laws of chemical affinity,
                    would speedily separate from one another, so as to produce decomposition of
                    their compound products. Notwithstanding the confidence with which these
                    arguments have been urged, and the assent which they have very generally
                    received, to us, we confess, it appears that if there really exist in living
                    economies any principle or principles capable of producing chemical combinations
                    and decompositions different from those of inorganic chemistry, both its general
                    character, and the particular phenomena which depend upon its agency, remain yet
                    to be discovered.</p>
                <p>It is no way impossible that nature may employ in living economies a peculiar
                    principle of chemical action, just as, in the case of irritability at least, she
                    employs in the animal kingdom a peculiar principle of physical action. But,
                    supposing this to be the case, from the harmony which we find to prevail through
                    all parts of nature’s works, we may be assured that this chemicovital principle,
                    if it actually exists, must be supplementary and additional to, and not
                    inconsistent with or subversive of, those other principles which regulate the
                    phenomena of chemical combination and decomposition.</p>
                <p>In regard to the first argument which we have mentioned in favour of the
                    existence of a particular principle of vital affinity, it would not, we believe,
                    be difficult to show that our inability to render an explanation of many of the
                    chemical processes that go on in the animal economy, is owing to our ignorance
                    of the phenomena as they actually occur—to our seeing the results only, and not
                    the means by which they are brought about; that, so far as we are acquainted
                    with the chemical phenomena of the animal economy, they do not exhibit anything
                    inconsistent or irreconcileable with the ordinary laws of chemical affinity as
                    manifested in the inorganic world; and that the better we become acquainted with
                    the circumstances under which chemical actions take place in living bodies, the
                    more are we enabled to explain them conformably with these laws.</p>
                <p>In regard to the second argument, it might, we conceive, be shown, that it is not
                    universally true that organic compounds cannot be imitated exterior to living
                    economies, as is shown by the preparation of oxalic acid, of sugar, of camphor,
                    of allantoic acid, and of urea, in the laboratory of the chemist; and that even
                    though the chemist were unable to imitate organic chemical products, this would
                    not be a conclusive argument in favour of the existence of a distinct vital
                    chemical principle, unless we could show that the means employed by him in his
                    attempts to effect this were, in every other essential, analogous to those which
                    nature employs in the living economy.</p>
                <p>The third argument which we have mentioned, is that upon which the supporters of
                    a principle of vital chemical affinity have most confidently relied. They appeal
                    triumphantly to the changes which an organized body undergoes subsequently to
                    death, as exhibiting the natural tendencies of the elements of which its several
                    parts consist, under the ordinary laws of chemical affinity; and represent the
                    prevention of these during life as the effect and the evidence of a peculiar
                    chemicovital principle. But it is strange that they should overlook how
                    materially any one portion of an organized body, which they may mark as
                    undergoing putrefaction subsequently to death, is altered in its circumstances
                    from its condition during life, by the cessation of the processes of absorption,
                    nutrition, exhalation, &amp;c. And it is, perhaps, still more strange, that they
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:193492881" xml:id="kp-eb0717-2881-0138"/>should think
                    it necessary to invoke a peculiar agent for the explanation of an effect, viz.
                    the prevention of putrefactive decomposition, which, in the casks of the curer,
                    or the jars of the anatomist, they may see effected by products of inorganic
                    chemistry.</p>
                <p>On the whole, we conclude, that the physiologist in prosecuting his investigation
                    of the changes of combination and decomposition which occur in the animal
                    economy in the state of health, and the pathologist in endeavouring to ascertain
                    the deviations to which these are subject in the state of disease, are entitled
                    to proceed on the belief, that whatever differences there may be in the
                    resulting products, their formation is regulated by the same laws to which the
                    chemical changes of inorganic substances are subjected; and that where these
                    laws seem inadequate to the explanation of any particular phenomenon, they may
                    be certain that the circumstances of that phenomenon are still imperfectly
                    understood.</p>
                <p>We must here terminate the view which we have attempted to sketch of the vital
                    powers that are concerned, conjointly with the powers common to all forms of
                    matter, in producing the corporeal phenomena of the animal economy, and of the
                    variations to which these powers are liable in the state of disease. Though very
                    imperfect, we trust this view has been sufficient to show how little is as yet
                    actually known of what may be called the mechanism of the functions, or the
                    agencies engaged in the performance of their several parts; and how little,
                    consequently, medical men are prepared to analyse and reduce to their primary
                    elements those deviations from healthy exercise which the different functions
                    experience in the various states of disease, independently of structural
                    alterations. Hence it happens, that the pathologist is frequently compelled to
                    stop short, in framing his proximate causes, at the general functional
                    derangement of which he obtains evidence, instead of attempting to trace this
                    back to the particular dynamical condition or conditions upon which it may
                    depend; to be content with saying of a secretory organ, for example, that its
                    <hi rend="italic">action</hi> is excessive, deficient, or vitiated, instead of
                    attempting to determine whether it is in its organic or in its inorganic forces,
                    and in which of these respectively, that the primary source of derangement has
                    its seat.</p>
                <p>Before concluding, we shall only farther remark, that it is impossible to review
                    the different sensible alterations of structure which have been enumerated in a
                    former part of this article, as constituting the proximate causes of the various
                    forms of organic diseases, without being satisfied that in very few instances
                    are these the <hi rend="italic">immediate</hi> results of the action of morbific
                    agents on the several parts of the body; and that previous to the occurrence of
                    those changes which render structural proximate causes perceptible to the
                    senses, dynamical or imperceptible changes must have taken place, the nature of
                    which can be for the most part only a matter of inference. The application of a
                    ligature to a limb, or some other impediment to the return of the blood to the
                    heart by the veins, may produce congestion, dropsy, or perhaps haemorrhage, as
                    its direct effect; but in those cases in which these morbid conditions occur in
                    what is called an active form, their appearance must have been preceded by a
                    dynamical affection of some portion of the circulatory system. Hence the opinion
                    of those who maintain that the first changes towards disease are always
                    dynamical, is correct, provided it be understood that this term signifies merely
                    changes of action, independently of perceptible changes of structure; changes of
                    action which must primarily originate in the injurious operation of morbific
                    agencies on the insensible conditions of the several textures, systems, and
                    organs of the body. <hi rend="smallcaps">(l. l. l. l.)</hi></p>
