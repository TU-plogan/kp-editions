                    Roman pontilis. In the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Rome</hi> we shall exhibit a
                    view of the rise and progress of that great state which, first as a republic,
                    and subsequently as an empire, obtained the command of the western world The
                    present article will be limited to a view of the temporal dominions of the
                    sovereign pontiff, in the state in which they actually exist.</p><p>This territory is situated in the centre of Italy, being bounded by the Adriatic
                    Sea on the eastern, and the Mediterranean on the western side. It extends in
                    north latitude from 41. 9. 8. to 44. 49. 54., and in east longitude from 10. 26.
                    2. to 12. 49. 30. The whole is connected together, with the exception only of
                    two small portions. One of these is the dukedom of Benevento, which is
                    surrounded by the Neapolitan province of Principato Ulteriore; and the other the
                    principality of Pontecorvo, enclosed within the province of Terra di Lavoro,
                    belonging to the same state. The papal dominions are bounded on the
                    north-western side by the Austrian kingdom of Venetian Lombardy, on the
                    northeastern by the Adriatic Sea, on the south-eastern by the kingdom of Naples,
                    on the south-western by the Mediterranean Sea, and on the west by part of the
                    grand duchy of Tuscany and a portion of the duchy of Modena. As the two seas,
                    which form partly the eastern and western boundaries of the papal dominions,
                    afford supplies of food, and might be made the means of considerable foreign
                    trade to a more active and enterprising people, they deserve to he noticed. A
                    short description of the shores, the harbours, and the bays, may also be of
                    interest.</p><p>The western coast of the pope’s dominions is by far the shortest. It commences a
                    little to the south-east of Orbi-tello, in the Tuscan territory, and proceeds by
                    a bay, not deep, to Civita Vecchia. It has no towns on the shore; but about
                    three miles inland, and visible from the sea, are the cities of Montai to and
                    Corneto, neither of which has any foreign trade. Civita Vecchia is the principal
                    seaport on this side. It is well fortified with good walls and ditches, several
                    half-moon batteries, and various other works; and upon a peninsula is a fine
                    castle, from which a mole is projected, whilst another mole about 180 fathoms in
                    length is carried into the sea. Between these two is the harbour, having
                    seventeen feet of* water at one of the entrances, and twelve feet at the other.
                    Ships are safe everywhere within the harbour, and have twenty feet ¾f water.
                    Proceeding to the south-east of this port, the church of St Peter’s at Rome is
                    visible nearly the whole of the course, but more distinctly after passing the
                    Cape Linaro. There are only a few miserable villages upon the shore; but the
                    small towns of Marinella, Palo, and Montcrone, about two miles from the sea, are
                    visible. The river Tiber has two outlets to the sea, which are divided by the
                    Isola Sacra, a tract of land about half a league in breadth. Of these, the first
                    or northernmost is called the Bocca del Fiumc-cino, and the second Bocca de
                    Fiumara. All the land near and about the mouths of the Tiber is low and marshy,
                    and not easily distinguishable from the water; which renders the approach
                    dangerous, especially when, as is often the case, it is covered with dense fogs.
                    The only mouth of the Tiber for vessels is the Bocca del Fiumecino. It has a bar
                    at its mouth, with seven or eight feet of water, and within it from two to four
                    fathoms. The Bocca de Fiumara has only two feet of water on its bar, and
                    consequently can be entered by nothing larger than boats. There is good
                    anchorage at the distance of from three to six miles from the shore, where there
                    is a depth of water of from six to thirteen fathoms, with good holding ground of
                    stift* mud.</p><p>From the mouths of the Tiber the land continues low and marshy, and it has no
                    town, but a few houses and towers at intervals; and, like the rest of the
                    Campagna di Roma, of which it forms a part, is frequently so obscured by haze
                    and fog, that the objects on the shore are not easily distinguishable. At the
                    distance of about thirty miles from the Tiber, near a projecting headland called
                    Cape d’Anzo, is the port and mole of Nettuno or Neptune. The mole projects 200
                    fathoms into the sea, and, by means of a bend towards the termination, forms a
                    harbour, in which there is a secure anchorage, with a depth of water of from
                    fifteen to twenty feet. The town is small, but ancient. About two miles from the
                    mole, on the sea-shore, and around it, are several vaults, grottos, baths, and
                    pillars, hewn out of the rocks, with other monuments of ancient magnificence. At
                    twenty miles from Nettuno is Cape Circeoor Circello, which forms a deep* bay,
                    with a low marshy coast, near to which good anchorage, in six or seven fathoms
                    water, is found; but there is no shelter against winds from the south-east. At
                    ten miles from thence is Terracina, the last town of the ecclesiastical
                    territory on the Neapolitan frontier. It was Anxur, the capital of the Volsci,
                    in ancient times. The harbour, once of celebrity, is now choked up; and the
                    town, though fortified, is inconsiderable. The country around is fruitful, but
                    marshy and unwholesome.</p><p>The eastern sea-coast of the Papal States, bordering on the Adriatic Sea, extends
                    about 120 miles in length. It commences to the south at the river Tronto (the
                    ancient Truentus), by which it is divided from the territory of Naples, and
                    extends to the southern mouth of the river Po, where the Austrian state of
                    Lombardy commences. From the Tronto towards the north there are along the shore
                    a number of* small towns and villages, defended by towers, but no harbour or
                    place of shelter, and the coast generally is low and sandy. The names of the
                    principal places are Termoli, Vasto, Ortona, Francavifla, Pescara, and
                    Giulianova. Next to these is the town of Fortore, where there is a great
                    storehouse, in the form of a tower, which may be seen a long way off. To this
                    storehouse merchandise is sent from the inland towns to be shipped; and there is
                    good anchorage near it, with a depth of water of from six to seven fathoms, on
                    sandy ground. About forty-five miles from the Tronto, the land trending north by
                    west half west, is Monte Conero, or the Mountain of* Ancona; but this whole line
                    of coast is low. At seven miles north-west by north from the foot of the
                    mountain is the mole of the city of Ancona, a surprising work, by which <pb break="no" facs="nls:193491139" xml:id="kp-eb0717-1139-0004"/> the
                    harbour is formed. This mole is 2000 feet in length, 100 feet in breadth, and
                    sixty-eight feet in height. On its point there are a battery and a lighthouse,
                    and near it a triumphal arch of white marble, erected in honour of the Emperor
                    Trajan, and considered as one of the most perfect remains of Roman magnificence
                    now existing. The port has a lazaretto, where the quarantine regulations are
                    very strict. The city is defended by a strong fort, in a low situation, on the
                    south side. Ancona is a free port, and vessels may lie in its harbour secure
                    from all winds, as the mole towards its termination has a turn to the west,
                    forming a hook; it is, however, too full of shoals ever to be of consequence as
                    a naval port. Three or four frigates may be well sheltered within the
                    lighthouse, moored by the head and the stern; but in no part of the harbour
                    could ships of that class swing to their anchors. The city is walled, and
                    contains about 20,000 inhabitants. It has the best arsenal in the Roman
                    dominions. The trade is considerable, arising chiefly from the exportation of
                    corn, wool, and silk. The most appropriate merchant-ships for Ancona are those
                    not drawing more than sixteen feet of water.</p><p>From Ancona to Rimini, a distance of about fifty miles, the coast is of moderate
                    height, and the shore is of sand. The chief towns are Sinigaglia, Fano, Pesaro,
                    and Rimini; but at none of these is there a harbour for shipping. Sinigaglia has
                    only a mole to protect small craft; but a great fair is held here, to which many
                    of the Greeks resort, and exchange honey, wax, tar, and other articles, for
                    hemp, wheat, and silk. It is said to contain 10,000 inhabitants. Fano and Pesaro
                    possess little or no trade, but are ancient places, each furnished with a great
                    number of churches. Rimini is a small, decayed, but still elegant place,
                    situated on the south point of the river Marecchia, near the mouth of which
                    there is good anchorage, on muddy ground, in seven fathoms water; but there is
                    no shelter from the sea-winds. Under the French government, Rimini was the
                    capital of the department of the Rubico, and contained 16,000 inhabitants. At
                    four leagues farther to the north there is good anchorage opposite the town of
                    Ce-senatico a place inhabited for the most part by fishermen. It is connected by
                    a canal with the modern town of Cer-</p><p>via, around which there is an extensive plain, used in summer for the production
                    of salt by natural evaporation. Upon the river Montone, about five miles distant
                    from the sea, stands the city of Ravenna, once an important place, and the seat
                    of government, but now fallen into decay, though still containing 16,000
                    inhabitants, and possessing several silk manufactories, and a considerable
                    commerce. The river Montone is navigable for small vessels only, and its
                    entrance is denoted by a beacon or moat, on which a light is hoisted at night.
                    At the tower of Volano is the little port of Goro, the westernmost branch of the
                    river Po, within which ships may enter and be secure in six fathoms water; and
                    at four leagues from that point the Roman territory is terminated at Punta della
                    Maestro, the outer point of the main stream of the Po. The alluvial matter of
                    the different branches of that powerful stream has formed numerous shoals, which
                    extend to a considerable distance from the shore, and the bank extends outwards
                    to the distance of two leagues. Within the shoals vessels may haul up, and do so
                    occasionally, in from six to ten fathoms water. The mouths of the Po present a
                    figure much resembling those formed by the Mississippi in America. The river,
                    from its source in the Alps, has a course of nearly 280 miles to the sea, and is
                    augmented by many smaller rivers which fall into it, most of its branches being
                    navigable by small vessels. The current is very strong, and great injury has
                    often been done by inundations. To prevent this, strong dikes have been
                    gradually raised on its banks, and its bed has in consequence become so elevated
                    that the level of its waters, especially in the lower part of its course, are
                    several feet above that of the neighbouring lands.</p><p>On the whole of the eastern coast, which has been here surveyed, there are a
                    great number of small streams running to the sea. They have their source in the
                    range of the Apennines, at no great distance, and are consequently of short but
                    rapid course. Many of them are dry or nearly so in the summer, at which season
                    the whole district suffers very severely from the want of fresh water.</p><p>The present division of the States of the Church is as follows :—</p><table><row role="data" rows="1"

the government in 1834 to make an
                    enumeration, returned the po pulation as somewhat greater, namely, as 2,592,329;
                    and these were classed in the following manner: <pb break="no" facs="nls:193491152" xml:id="kp-eb0717-1152-0005"/>Agricultural

                    respectively, are the following :—</p><p>Rome (in 1836) 152,457 persons.</p><p>Bologna (in 1832) 69,000</p><p>Perugia 30,000</p><p>Ancona 24,000</p><p>Ravenna 24,000</p><p>Ferrara 24,000</p><p>Fermo 19,000</p><p>Faenza 18,500</p><p>Rimini 17,000</p><p>Forli 16,000 ...</p><p>Macerata 15,600</p><p>Foligno 15,400</p><p>Cesana .^ 15,000</p><p>Fano 15,000</p><p>Benevento 14,000</p><p>Pesaro 13,900</p><p>Viterbo 13,000 ...</p><p>Osimo 12,300</p><p>Urbino 12,000</p><p>The population of all these cities, including that of Rome itself, does not
                    exceed one fifth of the whole number of inhabitants. Many of the inhabitants of
                    those cities are more or less dependent upon agriculture, and those of the
                    smaller cities and towns are chiefly so. It may in this way be estimated, that
                    the labour of three fourths of the inhabitants on the soil is required to
                    produce a sufficiency of food for the whole number of consumers. The density of
                    the population may be taken as one human being to four acres and a half of
                    land.</p><p>According to the Marquis Vanni, the land is appropriated in the following
                    manner:</p><p>Under the plough 242,000 rubbie.</p><p>Vineyards 14,600</p><p>Feeding land 162,000</p><p>• Garden culture 1,400</p><p>Woods and forests 170,000</p><p>590,000</p><p>The rubbia is a measure of land nearly equal to four English statute acres.</p><p>The face of the Roman territory, with the exception of those parts on the north
                    which form part of the valley of Po, and the portion to the south on the banks
                    of the Tiber, is hilly, and much of it mountainous. The chain of the Apennines,
                    after forming the boundary between the Bolognese and Tuscany, enters the States
                    of the Church near St Sepulchre, and runs through them, in the direction of
                    north-west and south-east, at nearly an equal distance from the Mediterranean.
                    and Adriatic Seas; and then is continued through the Neapolitan provinces of the
                    Abbruzzi, embracing in their course the valley in which the city of Rome stands.
                    From this range of mountains spurs project on both sides, some of them extending
                    to the Mediterranean Sea, and others to the Adriatic; and between these
                    projections are to be found valleys of much beauty, and of the highest degree of
                    fertility. Without any visible communication with this ridge of mountains stand
                    the lofty elevations of the Sorriano and Fogliano in Viterbo, and the St Oreste
                    and Monte Cave in Frosinone. The mountains here are as naked and as desolate as
                    those in Tuscany and in the vicinity of Genoa, but much more lofty. The highest
                    of the Velino, to the north-west of Rome, rises 7870</p><p>feet above the level of the sea; Monte della Sibylla, on the border of the
                    Abbruzzi, is 7058 feet; and the Somma is 6800 feet. The promontories are much
                    lower. That of Gennaro, near Rome, is only 3924 feet, Monte Cave 2923, and Monte
                    Rocca di Papa only 2230 feet in height.</p><p>The summit of these mountains is composed of granite, in which are found imbedded
                    portions of talc, gneiss, and schist. The offshoots consist in some parts of
                    calcareous stone, and in others of volcanic tuffa, basalt, and lava. The
                    promontories appear to be for the most part of volcanic origin, the product of
                    that matter which seems to extend under the south of Italy. The great northern
                    plain, which is bounded by the Apennines, the river Po, and the Adriatic Sea,
                    has the same character as the plains of Austrian Lombardy. It is covered with a
                    rich marshy soil, which, near Commachio, terminates in an almost useless and
                    always insalubrious swamp. Along the south-western coast extend vast swamps,
                    which are occasionally flooded by the sea. They are scarcely habitable, though
                    sometimes shepherds resort to them. The pestilential volcanic air, impregnated
                    with sulphur, causes them to be avoided. These districts, from the mouth of the
                    river Astura to Terracina, contain the Pontine Marshes, which neither the
                    emperors of ancient nor the popes of modern Rome have been able to render of any
                    value. What Pope Pius VI. performed has been of no avail; and these pestiferous
                    swamps seem to be constantly extending.</p><p>The Mediterranean Sea receives the water of but one considerable river in the
                    Papal States. The celebrated Tiber rises in the Apennines, near St Albonigo, in
                    the duchy of Tuscany, enters the Roman territory at the town of Sepulchro, and,
                    taking a south-westerly direction, after a course of nearly 150 miles, and
                    passing through Rome, falls into the sea at Ostia. It is only navigable for the
                    last fifteen miles between the metropolis and its mouth. The tributary streams
                    of the Tiber are the Topia and the Chiana, which originate in Tuscany, and a few
                    small brooks and rivulets. The principal river of the Roman States is that which
                    forms one of its boundaries, the Po. From the Roman States its water is
                    augmented by the streams of the Panaro, the Reno, the Riolo, the Porotto, the
                    Idice, the Santerno, the Senio, and the Lamone. These various streams are, for
                    the most part, united by canals, and rendered navigable; and they also greatly
                    contribute to cultivation, by affording easy means of irrigating the fields near
                    them. Besides the Po, the other streams which empty themselves into the Adriatic
                    from the papal territory are the following: The Montone, which runs into the sea
                    near Ravenna; the Savio, which empties itself near Forli; the Uso, a small
                    stream near Forli, which has become celebrated from the pope having decided, in
                    1756, that it was the Rubico, though the inhabitants still maintain that the
                    Piscatella, a small river near it, is that at which Julius Caesar hesitated; the
                    Matauro, which runs by Fano; the Cessano, near Urbino; the Musone, the Leta, the
                    Asone, and the Tronto, which last forms the boundary between the Roman States
                    and the territory of Naples.</p><p>There are several lakes in the Papal States. The largest of these is that of
                    Perugia and Trasimeno, celebrated for the victory obtained there by Hannibal
                    over the Romans. On the latter there are three islands. It is well stored with
                    fish, and the outlet is into the Tiber. The lake of Bolsena is a little to the
                    north-west of Viterbo, and was known in ancient times by the name Vulsinius. It
                    has two islands. There is another lake near to it, that of Bracciano, which was
                    formerly called Sabatinus. Besides these three lakes, there are many smaller,
                    such as the charming Lago d’Albano and Lago di Remi, in the vicinity of Rome;
                    Lago Pie di Luca, in Uieti; the lakes of Fogliana, of Monaco, of Crapolace, and
                    Caressa, in the Pontine Marshes; and those of the valley of Commachio.</p><pb break="no" facs="nls:193491165" xml:id="kp-eb0717-1165-0006"/><p>The mountainous parts of this territory abound in mineral springs of various
                    degrees of medicinal celebrity. Those most frequented are the acid springs near
                    Rome, the baths of Bracciano, the baths of Stigliano near Tolfa, the baths of
                    Palazzi near Civita Vecchia, the warm baths and acid springs of Viterbo, the
                    baths of Giosinelli near Montefiascone, the baths of Porretta in Bologna, and
                    the Lago di Bagni, of tepid water, from which alum and sulphur are obtained, and
                    which is much used for immersion.</p><p>The climate of the Ecclesiatical States varies much, according to the local
                    position of the several parts. Some of those produce the orange in perfection,
                    whilst others are covered with snow during great part of the year. The tops of
                    the Apennines are clothed with snow in October, and it generally remains till
                    May. The northern part, in the valley of the Po, has the climate of Lombardy,
                    and the environs of Rome that of Sicily; whilst at Terracina the heat of the
                    Antilles is felt, without the refreshing tradewinds. There the dates ripen, and
                    the gardens are enclosed with fences formed by the aloe. The heat is but
                    slightly tempered by breezes from the sea; and these parts are subject to the
                    visitation of the dreaded sirocco. The air upon and between the Apennines is
                    generally favourable to health; but on the Pontine Marshes, and near the mouths
                    of the Po, as well as near to Rimini, the marshes are gradually extending, and
                    their pestiferous influence is observable in the increase of dense fogs, and the
                    rapid diminution of the population.</p><p>The description of the agriculture of Lombardy, given under that head in the
                    present work, will apply to the portion of the territory of the Church near the
                    Po, in the four delegations of Bologna, Ferrara, Ravenna, and Forli. In the
                    other parts the art is most negligently exercised, as well in the Apennines as
                    in the plains of Rome itself. The Roman States produce a sufficiency of corn for
                    their own consumption; for if some districts are deficient, the others are more
                    than sufficient. Wheat, maize, and barley, are the chief grain; but the great
                    mass of the poorer people eat but little bread, and, especially in the
                    Apennines, substitute chestnuts, onions, garlic, and beans instead of it. A
                    great part of their food consists of fruits, culinary vegetables, and salads.
                    They rarely taste animal food, except a little bacon or sausages. Flax and hemp
                    are raised in sufficient quantities to supply the inhabitants; and saffron is
                    produced to such an extent that it has become an article of export. Some cotton
                    is raised, and the growth of it is rapidly extending. In some parts many plants
                    are raised that are applied by the perfumers to their preparations, such as
                    spikenard, annis, and others. The olive grows everywhere, but is almost
                    exclusively destined to domestic consumption.</p><p>Wine is generally cultivated, but the management of the vines is careless, and
                    the selection of the kinds of them very negligent and injudicious. The best wine
                    is made about Montefiascone, Orvieto, and Monte Cave; but the greater part of
                    the common wine is very indifferent. Some little of a moderate quality is made
                    about Bologna and Ravenna, part of which finds a market in Venice. The land
                    produces a great variety of fruits. In the plain of Rome, oranges, citrons,
                    pomegranates, and figs ripen; and amongst the Apennines there is an abundance of
                    almonds, pistachio-nuts, and walnuts, and especially of chestnuts. The forests
                    produce wood for fuel, and some little is sent to the l§le of Elba to supply the
                    iron-works. On several parts of the coast much soda is prepared. The woods of
                    Terracina have many cork-trees, the bark of which becomes an article of foreign
                    commerce.</p><p>Formerly the breeding of horses was carefully attended to, but of late it has
                    been negligently pursued; and the celebrated race known by the name of Borghese
                    has deterio rated, and nearly disappeared. On the Apennines asses and mules are
                    used as beasts of burden, for riding, and for the plough. Oxen are almost
                    universally employed. The breed of cows is very fine; and they roam about the
                    Campagna di Roma almost without attendance. The milk is not converted into
                    cheese or butter, but the profit they yield to the proprietors, some of whom
                    have herds of nearly two thousand, arises from the sale of the calves, and of
                    the mothers when fattened. Sheep are very numerous, especially on the shores of
                    the Mediterranean. There are two distinct races. One of these, called <hi rend="italic">negretti</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> i</hi> are small, with
                    very strong and very white wool, as fine as that of Aragon, whence the race, as
                    well as the name they bear, has been derived. They give abundance of milk, from
                    which much cheese is made. These flocks, like their ancestors in Spain, are
                    migratory. In the month of May they march from the plains near Rome to the
                    mountains of Norcia and Abbruzzi, and return again in Oötober. The other race of
                    sheep, called <hi rend="italic">pouille,</hi> are inferior in their wool,, and
                    are stationary on the Apennines, and the lands situated on the Adriatic shore.
                    Goats ate very numerous, both on the plains and on the Apennines. They yield
                    abundance of milk, which is converted into cheese; but much of it serves to
                    sustain the swine, of which large herds are bred and fattened upon some of the
                    most extensive farms. The culture of silk is one of the most important objects
                    in Roman agriculture, and gives occupation to almost every member of certain
                    families for the season. The soil is favourable to the growth of the white
                    mulberry, the leaves of which yield the finest silk; that of the best quality,
                    collected near Fossombrone, is chiefly exported to England and Germany.</p><p>The manufacturing operations of the Ecclesiastical States are very confined, and
                    chiefly adapted to domestic consumption. The chief seat of the silk manufactory
                    is Bologna, which formerly had the monopoly of the trade in crapes, but now
                    divides it with the fabrics of other parts of Europe. Linen and wbollen cloths
                    are made, some good paper is produced, and leather is made in several parts;
                    also glass, pottery, rosanies from Loretto, artificial flowers, tallow, and
                    wax-candles, with a variety of small articles.</p><p>There are no mines worked within the Roman territory, but considerable quantities
                    of excellent alum and of sulphur are furnished, and some saltpetre; and on the
                    coast there are lagunes, from which culinary salt is made by the natural
                    evaporation of the sun’s rays.</p><p>The subjects of the Roman pontiff all adhere to the Catholic church, with the
                    exception of 16,000 Jews. The states have six archbishops, seventy-two bishops,
                    1824 religious houses for monks, and 612 nunneries, and 2098 parochial
                    divisions. The civil government is in the hands of the college of cardinals, and
                    the executive is administered by the Cardinal Vicarius, who is a kind of prime
                    minister. The universities in actual operation are but three, viz. Bologna, with
                    680 students; Rome, with 460; and Perugia, with 200. Besides these, four others
                    have been decreed in Camerino, Fermo, Macerata, and Ferrara, but are not as yet
                    established. In most of the cities there are schools of the fine arts, which
                    tend to keep alive the attachment to music, painting, statuary, and antiquities,
                    for which, with architecture, Italy has long been celebrated. The education of
                    the poorer classes is less attended to than in some other parts of Europe.</p><p>The military force of the Holy See, as regulated by a decree of the 29th of
                    December 1834, consists of ten battalions of native and two of foreign infantry,
                    one regiment of dragoons, one of carabineers, two of sharp-shooters or riflemen,
                    and a corps of artillery, the whole amounting to 17,372 men, and 1524 horses.
                    There is at present no marine force of any description.</p><p>The finances of the Roman States are not clearly known.</p><pb break="no" facs="nls:193491178" xml:id="kp-eb0717-1178-0007"/><p>The public debt is calculated to exceed eight millions sterling, and to be
                    annually increasing, although the taxes levied are said to be heavier in
                    proportion to the wealth of the community than they are in any of the other
                    European states. <hi rend="smallcaps">(g.)</hi></p></div></body></text></TEI>
