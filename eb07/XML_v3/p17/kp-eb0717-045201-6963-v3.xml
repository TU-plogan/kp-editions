                <p><label type="entry">PHOENIX</label>, the great palm or date-tree. There is only
                    one species, viz. the <hi rend="italic">dactylifera,</hi> or common date-tree, a
                    na tive of Africa and the eastern countries, where it grows to fifty, sixty, and
                    a hundred feet in height. The trunk is round, upright, and studded with
                    protuberances, which are the vestiges of the decayed leaves. From the top issues
                    forth a cluster of leaves or branches eight or nine feet long, extending all
                    around like an umbrella, and bending a little towards the earth. The lower part
                    produces a number of stalks like those of the middle, but these seldom shoot so
                    high as four or five feet. The stalks, according to Adanson, diffuse the tree
                    very considerably, so that, wherever it grows naturally in forests, it is
                    extremely difficult to open a passage through its prickly leaves. The date-tree
                    was introduced into Jamaica soon after the conquest of that island by the
                    Spaniards. There are, however, but few of them in the island at the present
                    time. The fruit is somewhat in the shape of an acorn. It is composed of a thin,
                    light, and glossy membrane, somewhat pellucid and yellowish, which contains a
                    fine, soft, and pulpy fruit, that is firm, sweet, and somewhat vinous to the
                    taste, esculent, and wholesome; and within this is enclosed a solid, tough, and
                    hard kernel, of a pale gray colour upon the outside, and finely marbled within
                    like the nutmeg. For medicinal use dates areto be chosen large, full, fresh,
                    yellow on the surface, soft and tender, not too much wrinkled; such as have a
                    vinous taste, and do not rattle when shaken. They are produced in many parts of
                    Europe, but never ripen perfectly there. The best are brought from Tunis; they
                    are also very fine and good in Egypt, and in many parts of the East. Those of
                    Spain and France look well; but they are never perfectly ripe, and very subject
                    to decay. They are preserved three different ways; some pressed and dry; others
                    pressed more moderately, and again moistened with their own juice; and others
                    not pressed at all, but moistened with the juice of other dates, as they are
                    packed up, which is done in baskets or skins. Those preserved in this last way
                    are much the best. Dates have always been esteemed moderately strengthening and
                    astringent.</p>
                <p>Dates afford wholesome nourishment, and have a very agreeable taste when they are
                    fresh; the Arabs, however, eat them without seasoning. They dry and harden them
                    in the sun to reduce them to a kind of meal, which they lay up in store to
                    supply themselves with food during the long journeys which they often undertake
                    across their deserts. This simple food is sufficient to nourish them for a long
                    time. The inhabitants of the Sahara also procure from their dates a kind of
                    honey, which is exceedingly sweet. For this purpose they choose those which have
                    the softest pulp; and having put them into a large jar with a hole in the
                    bottom, they squeeze them by placing over them a weight of eight or ten pounds.
                    The most fluid part of the substance, which drops through the hole, is what they
                    call the honey of the date. Even the stones, though very hard, are not thrown
                    away, but given to their camels and sheep as food, after they have been bruised
                    or laid to soften in water.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Phoenix,</hi> in <hi rend="italic">Antiquity,</hi> a famous
                    bird, which is generally regarded by the moderns as fabulous. The ancients speak
                    of this bird as single, or the only one of its kind. They describe it as of the
                    size of an eagle, having its head finely crested with a beautiful plumage, its
                    neck covered with feathers of a gold colour, and the rest of its body, except
                    the tail, purple, and the eyes sparkling like stars. They hold that it lives
                    five or six hundred years in the wilderness; that when thus advanced in age, it
                    builds itself a pile of sweet wood and aromatic gums, which it fires with the
                    wafting of its wings, and thus bums itself; and that from its ashes arises a
                    worm, which in time grows up to be a phoenix. Hence the Phoenicians gave the
                    name <hi rend="italic">phoenix</hi> to the palm-tree, because, when burned down
                    to the root, it rises again fairer than ever.</p>
