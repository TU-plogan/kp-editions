                    significant corrections to the OCR text, predominantly in cases of confusing "c"
                    and "e." Isolates 90 entries that were mistakenly included at the end of prior
                    entries in v1 and v2. Normalizes ordinal numbers. Separates metadata in
                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                <p><label type="entry">PARA</label>, a province of Brazil, in South America, of
                    immense extent, and of such surprising fertility that it is characterized as at
                    once the paradise of the Indies and of Brazil. It is a region of endless
                    luxuriance, one where every rood of ground would maintain its man; and
                    sufficiently capacious to receive all the redundant population of Europe; for
                    the dwellings of man are scattered over it so thinly that they have been
                    compared to islands in a vast ocean. It is situated to the south and south-east
                    of Guiana, being separated from it by the river Amazons. The river Madera, or
                    Madeira, the great tributary of the Amazons, separates it on the north-west and
                    west from the province of Solimaens and the territory of Peru. A line drawn
                    nearly parallel with the ninth degree of south latitude separates it from the
                    province of Matto Grosso on the south; Maranham bounds it on the east; and a
                    considerable part of its northern limits is washed by the Atlantic Ocean. Its
                    greatest length, from the Atlantic to the borders of Peru, is above fourteen
                    hundred miles; at the broadest it is more than five hundred miles across, but it
                    narrows towards either extremity, lying east and west. This vast tract of
                    country is, to a considerable extent, a <hi rend="italic">terra incognita,</hi>
                    and it is supposed that at least two thirds of it are yet in possession of the
                    aboriginal Indians. Cazal divides it into four large districts, viz. Para
                    proper, a flat and wooded country, extending west of Maranham two hundred miles
                    to the river Toecantines or Toeannos, which in this quarter traverses its whole
                    extent from south to north; Xingutania, lying between the Toecantines and the
                    river Xingu or Ghingu, which falls into the Amazons, near its mouth; Tapajonia,
                    extending from the latter river to the Tapajos, which joins the Amazons about
                    two hundred and twenty miles higher up than the Xingu; and Mun-drucania, so
                    designated from the Mundrucu Indians, who inhabit it, extending from the Tapajos
                    to the Madera, which unites with the Amazons about the same distance above the
                    Tapajos that the latter river is above the confluence of the Xingu. Indeed, in
                    examining a good map of the country, nothing appears more striking than the
                    manner in which the province of Para is divided into four portions by the rivers
                    above named, all nearly of equal size, with the exception of Para proper, which
                    is much smaller than the others. Of these rivers, the Amazons and the Madera
                    have already been described in this work; and they constitute the leading
                    hydrographical features of the country. The Toecantines is also a very large
                    stream, in one part expanding to ten miles in breadth; and it is beautified with
                    numerous islands. The Xingu and Tapajos are likewise considerable streams,
                    originating in a cordillera of moderate elevation, which runs from north to
                    south in the province of Matto Grosso. The upper courses of these rivers have
                    never been explored, and the country which lies between them, and also between
                    the Tapajos and Madera, where it joins with Matto Grosso, is consequently known
                    only by the reports of the Indians. There are a number of other rivers, but none
                    which requires specific mention, except the Annapu, which falls into the estuary
                    of the Amazons between the rivers Toccantines and Xingu. Several islands lie at
                    the mouth of the Amazons, one of which, called Majora, is a hundred miles in
                    circumference, and so situated as to divide the river into two unequal branches.
                    The island of Majora is a low, flat, alluvial formation, covered with brushwood
                    and grass, and abounding in cattle and horses, with which it supplies Para. It
                    is overrun with alligators, snakes, and wild beasts; and during the rainy season
                    it is much flooded, and rendered very unhealthy when the watershave quitted it,
                    and the sun has begun to exhale the malaria.</p>
                <p>The geology of Para presents but little variety or novelty, and is precisely
                    similar to that of Maranham. The soil upon which the city of Para stands is
                    composed of clay and sand. The beds of clay are very extensive, and frequently
                    thirty or forty feet in depth. There is scarcely any rock, and that only in
                    particular and isolated masses; it is a coarse dark iron sandstone, with
                    numerous particles of quartz imbedded in it. This is the only stone, and it is
                    used as a building material. This species of sandstone, with fragments of white
                    quartz, is observable at Maranham, and is the predominating formation at St
                    Paul’s, a little to the southward of Rio. The beds of clay at Para are of
                    various qualities, some being admirably adapted for bricks, tiles, and coarse
                    pottery; whilst others, again, are very fine, and capable of forming utensils
                    which might vie in beauty with the celebrated Wedgewood ware. Beds of yellow
                    ochre are abundant, and it is much in use for painting the houses externally.
                    Limestone is imported from Portugal, granite from Rio, and slabs and sills from
                    Europe. A gold mine is said to have been found in a mountainous hill on the
                    coast near Selina No organic remains have as yet been discovered in these parts.
                    The larger portion of the soil of Para is of extraordinary fertility, as will be
                    seen by the account of the vegetable productions, remarkable alike for their
                    variety and luxuriance. Situated immediately beneath the equator, the climate is
                    hot and sultry; the thermometer averaging throughout the day from 84° to 89° in
                    the shade. At night it occasionally falls as low as 75°, with very heavy and
                    copious dews, particularly upon the river, drenching such boats as may be upon
                    it, as if a shower of rain had descended. The river water is tepid, generally
                    about 84&lt; <hi rend="superscript"> o</hi>. As the air cools in the evening, it
                    chills the surface of the water, and in doing so a humid vapour is emitted.
                    There is no difference of temperature throughout the year, the mean degree of
                    heat being 84°. There are two seasons, the wet and the dry. The rainy season
                    commences in the latter part of December, and continues until July, raining more
                    or less every day, without intermission, for many hours. The air continues
                    sultry and oppressive, with light variable winds, and occasional squalls from
                    various points of the compass, accompanied by thunder and lightning of the most
                    appalling description, whilst the rain at the same time descends in torrents.
                    The thunderstorms take place most frequently in the afternoon, about two or
                    three o’clock; and the same is observable at Rio and other places. It generally
                    begins to rain about eleven o’clock in the forenoon, and continues until nine or
                    ten at night. The country is flooded in many parts during this season, and
                    vessels are often detained several weeks, not being able to take on board their
                    cargoes. The dry season at Para occupies the remaining portion of the year, from
                    July to December. But even during this period rain frequently falls, and
                    thunder-storms occur in the afternoon. This is also the peculiar season <hi
                    rend="italic">of</hi> winds, which blow fresh from the north-east during the
                    day, with a light breeze only in the evening. Lightning is frequent in the
                    horizon every night. Of course the days and nights in this “region of the sun”
                    are nearly of equal length throughout <pb break="no" facs="nls:193491750"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0717-1750-0051"/>the year. For a country situated within the torrid
                    zone, Para cannot be considered as unhealthy, although it was formerly reckoned
                    so. But since the woods were thinned, and cattle were introduced, a material
                    improvement has taken place. It is exempted from endemic diseases; but
                    intermittent fevers or agues attack those who have newly arrived in the country,
                    and they become more common as the river is ascended. Those employed in the
                    gathering of sarsaparilla are very frequently attacked with fever, and numbers
                    of the natives die of it. Dysentery, tetanus, and some other diseases, common to
                    various parts of Brazil, prevail in Para. In 1825, the small-pox is said to have
                    carried off five thousand persons in the capital.</p>
                <p>This province is unusually rich in vegetable productions, particularly such as
                    are called, <hi rend="italic">par excellence,</hi> botanical. There is an
                    inexhaustible supply of timber of the very best quality, and almost of every
                    variety, so that there is abundance of fuel. The palms are amongst the most
                    conspicuous and useful products of the vegetable kingdom. They afford the
                    inhabitants food, drink, and even raiment; for the pith of some of these species
                    of trees produces an edible substance resembling sago, the pericarp of others
                    yields a pleasant beverage, and the leaves afford a covering for houses, as well
                    as materials for making hats and baskets. Some furnish them with oil; and canoes
                    and boats are hollowed out of the trunks of others. The palms are of various
                    species; one, called the areca, reaches a hundred and thirty feet in height.
                    Indeed there is to be found here timber for every purpose for which man can
                    require it, from the soft cork-wood of the <hi rend="italic">ochroma
                    sayopus,</hi> to the dense hard iron wood. There is the <hi rend="italic"
                    >cedrela</hi><hi rend="italic">odorata,</hi> or soft cedar wood, very handsomely
                    veined; the white cedar or <hi rend="italic">bignonia leucoxylon,</hi> and an
                    abundance of other bignonias; the balsam copaiva tree, which affords good
                    timber, besides its medicinal product; ornamental woods of every hue and grain,
                    including rose-wood, satin-wood, yellow wood, ebony, and others; the <hi
                    rend="italic">bertholletia</hi><hi rend="italic">excelsa,</hi> a lofty spreading
                    tree, producing a woody capsule three inches in diameter, so heavy, hard, and
                    solid that it requires a powerful blow of a sledge-hammer to break it (the bark
                    of this tree, when beaten into flakes, is used in place of oakum or hemp); the
                    <hi rend="italic">lecythis ollaris,</hi> or pot-tree (so called from the
                    seed-vessel resembling a rusty iron pot with a lid), the nuts of which are
                    esteemed as of a very superior quality, and are sent as presents from the
                    interior; the <hi rend="italic">carapa guareoides,</hi> or anderaba, the seeds
                    of which yield an oil that is put to a variety of uses, and amongst others as a
                    lamp-oil, and for making soap; the calabash, which furnishes the natives with
                    many utensils; excellent woods for ship-building, equal to the teak of India;
                    and a vast variety of trees and plants which yield dye-stuffs of the finest
                    quality. Amongst these may be mentioned arnotta, of which there are three
                    species; indigo; crajaru, or the juice of a plant <hi rend="italic"
                    >{bignonia),</hi> formed into cakes of a bright red. It is prepared by the
                    Indians, and is a capital and very durable oil colour. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >amomum</hi><hi rend="italic">sylvestre</hi> yields a blue colour. Para is
                    exceedingly rich in oils, including turtle-oil, procured from the fat of the
                    turtle. Turtles frequent the upper part of the river in immense numbers; and no
                    less than six thousand jars of their oil, each containing seven gallons, are
                    annually received at Para. Besides these, may be mentioned the azeite mammona,
                    or castor oil, for lamps, and common lamp-oil; the unctuous substance of cacao,
                    which is used in the manufacture of soap; a fine sweet oil resembling that of
                    the olive, obtained from the patacia, a species of palm; thebacova, a species of
                    palm oil; the common cocoa-nut oil; and that of the anderaba, already mentioned.
                    These oils can be procured in the greatest abundance, at a very cheap rate, and
                    may be rendered an object of considerable commercial importance. Amongst the
                    medicinal plants and drugs are sarsaparilla, balsam copaiva, tonquin beans,
                    procured in vast quantities, and which yield, by distillation with spirits or
                    with water, an odorous essential oil; arnotta vanilla, which perfumes the woods,
                    and creeps up the trees like alarge and elegantly-leaved ivy; gum copal of a
                    spurious quality; gum caju, or the gum of the cashew apple; the pod of the <hi
                    rend="italic">cassia</hi><hi rend="italic">fistularis,</hi> and the leaves of
                    several of the cassias, which are as good as senna; the <hi rend="italic"
                    >port-landia hexandria,</hi> which is an emetic, a cathartic, a febrifuge, and a
                    tonic; the <hi rend="italic">mirabilis</hi><hi rend="italic">jalapa,</hi> or the
                    jalap of the country, very common in Para; besides many others, which it is
                    unnecessary to enumerate. Not a few of the trees of this province yield a milky
                    juice, the fig-trees in particular, and they are very numerous. One of the most
                    remarkable of these is the <hi rend="italic">vaccodendron</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >lactifera,</hi> or milkbearing cow-tree as it has been called, from its
                    extraordinary property of yielding milk, similar, it is said, to that of a cow.
                    The tree is one of the loftiest in the forest, being above a hundred feet in
                    height. The fluid which it yields appears to bear the nearest resemblance to
                    animal milk of any vegetable product. It is a rich white bland fluid, without
                    odour, and of the taste and flavour of common milk, as a substitute for which it
                    is extensively used. Amongst the useful and curious products of the province,
                    the <hi rend="italic">siphonia</hi><hi rend="italic">elastica</hi> or cahuchuc
                    requires particular mention. It is the tree which produces the well-known
                    elastic gum or India rubber, and is amongst the largest of the forest. It
                    abounds to such an extent as to form one of the staple articles of commerce, and
                    Para is the great emporium for supplying Europe with this article. Very strong
                    and durable shoes, and other articles of wearing apparel, are manufactured from
                    it. Amongst the spices and aromatics, this province produces turmeric, ginger,
                    black pepper, cayenne, native nutmeg, <hi rend="italic">laurus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">cinnamomoides,</hi> clove bark (having precisely the flavour of
                    cloves, and used as such), some aromatic amomums, several species of pepper,
                    piper amalayo, and ginger pepper. There are also laurels, cinnamon, cloves, and
                    allspice cultivated for sale; and the tobacco raised is reported to be the
                    genuine Orinoco.</p>
                <p>Para yields great abundance of fruits, and also of farinaceous grains and roots.
                    Rice, Indian corn, and the favourite mandioc root, supply the inhabitants with
                    flour and tapioca. Cocoa is plentiful, and coffee and sugar are cultivated for
                    exportation. Amongst the fruits of the province are several varieties of the
                    most exquisite pine-apples, remarkably large and fine oranges, limes, sweet
                    lemons, custard apples, cherimoyas, alligator pears of an immense size, very
                    fine quality, and forming a part of the food of the common people; the fruits of
                    the passiflora, tamarinds, guavas, pawpaws, superb melons, plantains, and
                    bananas, mangoes in profusion, several species of the achras, and palm drupas;
                    thebucari, ingas, rose-apple, bread-fruit, and jacks; figs, sapodillas, abiu,
                    macoubea, and abrico, similar in flavour to the aprico. There is a small crop of
                    grapes three times a year. The marauta, or arrow-root genus, affords several
                    edible roots; and, with regard to vegetables, there are abundance of cucumbers,
                    pumpkins, lettuce, chilis, potatoes, cabbages, a variety of beans, yams of
                    several kinds, tornatas, and the egg-apple, besides others. Without adverting to
                    the Flora of this province, farther than stating generally that it is
                    exceedingly beautiful and various, the foregoing account of the vegetable
                    kingdom of Para will sufficiently show that, in the abundance, variety, and
                    luxuriance of its products of this description, it is not surpassed by the most
                    favoured spots upon the globe.</p>
                <p>Para is equally prolific in wild animals, abounding in monkeys, snakes, and
                    lizards. The vampires fly about at night in great numbers, and are exceedingly
                    annoying; and the vampire bat, in particular, is notorious in the country for
                    its blood-sucking powers. The guano tribe is numerous, but harmless and timid as
                    hares; and there are numbers of <pb break="no" facs="nls:193491763"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0717-1763-0052"/>tapirs 'and ounces. The river-banks are infosted
                    with alligators, the island of Marajo being their rendezvous. The electrical eel
                    attains to a considerable size, and sometimes kills a horse that is wading in
                    the streams. Such is its power, that by one stroke of its body it knocks the
                    animal down and kills it. There is an abundant supply of fish, both from the
                    river Amazons and from the ocean; but they do not keep well. The dorado is the
                    most esteemed. There are two large fishes of the silurus kind, which yield
                    isinglass; but a better sort is procured from the guru-juda, a fish somewhat
                    like a sturgeon in appearance, and caught at the mouth of the river. The pereiba
                    is a very large fish, from five to six feet in length, and of a sharklike
                    aspect. The pirarucoa is likewise a very large fish, which the inhabitants salt;
                    and there are various kinds of small fish, which it is unnecessary to enumerate.
                    The birds of these regions are well known, being famous for their beauty and
                    splendour; and insects are so multitudinous that, according to a writer who has
                    visited the country, “the ants alone would be the labour of a person’s life to
                    detail; in every fruit, on every flower, there is almost a peculiar ant.”<note

                    bushes, flashing their meteoric wings, and then vanishing in a moment. Some of
                    the spiders are extremely large and venomous; and Para is noted for snakes,
                    amongst which is the gigantic boa-constrictor, that kills an ox and immediately
                    gorges the animal.</p>
                <p>The city of Para stands on a low part of the right bank of the eastern branch of
                    the river Para, about fifty miles from its mouth. As seen from vessels in the
                    river, it presents nothing particularly attractive or conspicuous except its
                    numerous churches. No lofty ranges of buildings are to be seen in this city of
                    the western world; and, being environed by wood and the waters of the river, and
                    built on somewhat low ground, it has altogether a humble appearance. It extends
                    about two thirds of a mile along the Para, and is about half a mile in breadth;
                    the highest point of ground, that on which the church of St Anne is situated,
                    being about seventy feet above the surface of the river. Directly opposite to
                    it, and about two miles distant, is the large island of Oncas, with several
                    smaller ones lower down the river. Rather more than a league below the city
                    there is an insulated rock, on which a fort called Serra is built, and to which
                    all vessels inward or outward bound are obliged to send a boat with papers
                    before they are allowed to proceed to or depart from the city. Somewhat less
                    than a league above the city is the mouth of the river Guama, up which
                    passengers to Maranham are said occasionally to proceed in an easterly
                    direction, and, crossing a narrow neck of land, embark in boats on the sea,
                    keeping close in along the coast. It is probably on account of the facility
                    which this and other rivers, particularly the Toccantines, afford for a
                    communication with the interior of Brazil, that the present site of Para was
                    chosen. Between the mouth of the river Guama and the city there is the naval
                    arsenal, at which large vessels are built. The city is protected by two forts,
                    both placed on steep and rocky but not elevated points. The streets of Para are
                    laid out at right angles to each other, but they are not remarkable for their
                    breadth, and only some of them are paved. The houses in general are about two
                    stories high, and well built, having latticed blinds for windows, which adds to
                    the sombre appearance of the city Para has little of that bustle of business
                    observable in most commercial towns, but is dull, noiseless, and cheerless. The
                    principal building in Para is the palace, a large square, two stories in height,
                    having an open balcony at the second story, ornamented with large wooden figures
                    at the outer part, and palm-trees between the windows. Several of the government
                    offices are in the palace, and it is the abode of the president. Internally it
                    is well but not gaudily fitted up; and altogether it is a handsome and
                    commodious building, every way worthy of the purpose to which it is
                    appropriated. On the north, east, and west sides the ground is open, and there
                    the troops were wont to be paraded every morning. Adjoining the palace are the
                    walls and several arches of what was intended for a theatre; but although the
                    design was good, the whole has proved a failure. There are a cathedral and eight
                    churches; and there either are or were four or five convents. The cathedral is
                    built in the form of a Latin cross; and its structure and decorations, without
                    being gaudy, have a pleasing effect. The interior is neat, and is of sufficient
                    size to accommodate a large audience. The bishop’s palace is in the cathedral
                    square, and stands opposite to that building. It is a large and plain but
                    respectable edifice; and appended to it is a church or chapel for the domestic
                    service of the bishop and his establishment. In the same square there is a
                    comfortable hospital. The remaining part of it is filled up with
                    dwelling-houses. In the middle of the city is the church of St Anne; close to
                    the water is the church of Los Mercez, and adjoining to it are the custom-house
                    and the prison. These three form the most conspicuous range of buildings in the
                    city, but they are nevertheless by no means remarkable. The custom-house is
                    large, well built, and apparently commodious. It has a distinct quay, with a
                    broad flight of wooden stairs leading to it; and immediately opposite to it
                    stands one of the forts.</p>
                <p>The streets of Para have little or nothing that is attractive about them. The
                    shops and warehouses are numerous, and are tolerably well supplied with
                    merchaftdise; but there is a deficiency of taste and elegance in their
                    arrangement. The markets are held close by the water-side, near the church of
                    Mercez, where women with vegetables and fruit congregate for the most part of
                    the day; but butcher-meat is not to be obtained after ten in the forenoon, a
                    very salutary regulation, on account of the great heat of the place. Cattle and
                    horses are brought from Marajo and some of the neighbouring islands, where they
                    run wild, but belong to individuals, some of whom are the proprietors of whole
                    islands, and all the cattle upon them. The horses are not large nor powerful;
                    and in the wild state they are valued at about five dollars each. They are
                    occasionally exported to the islands of the West Indies. Although Para possesses
                    few attractions as a city, the environs contain numerous beautiful shady walks
                    and cool retreats. There is one public walk in the city, much resorted to in the
                    evening, for the delightful promenade which it affords. The others are
                    principally formed by rows of lofty silkcotton trees, which bear no little
                    resemblance to the elegant horse-chestnut of Britain. The country in the
                    immediate vicinity of Para is very beautiful, and the outlets to it are
                    abundant. In the suburbs of the city there are several elegant little villas,
                    with extensive gardens attached to them, rich in all the varieties of tropical
                    produce. The road to the Nazaré church, distant about a mile from the city, is a
                    favourite resort of the people of Para. The church, which is built on a small
                    scale, like that of a village, is simple and neat, and most romantically
                    situated on the skirts of a wood, with a small open area in front. Here, in the
                    month of October, a scene of grand festivity takes <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193491776" xml:id="kp-eb0717-1776-0053"/>place, called the fair of St
                    Nazaré, over which the clergy preside, and it is attended by every inhabitant of
                    Para. Frolic and feasting, the usual business of fairs, with the general custom
                    of gambling, continues for a fortnight, and the scene closes with high mass,
                    performed in the most imposing style. Para is lamentably deficient in public
                    institutions for education. The whole town can only boast of one school, which
                    is under the direction of the clergy. There is not, it is said, a bookseller’s
                    shop in Para; so that gross ignorance is the rule, not the exception. There is
                    indeed a weekly gazette published, but it is chiefly as a channel through which
                    the edicts of government are circulated. The laws are bad, and they are also
                    badly administered; indeed justice is so tardy, that criminals may sometimes lie
                    in prison till they rot, before being brought to trial. Para stands in longitude
                    48. 39. 45. west from Greenwich, and latitude 1. 28. south.</p>
                <p>Notwithstanding the natural riches and the superabundant advantages of Para, it
                    is a very poor city, and receives a subsidiary stipend from the neighbouring
                    province of Maranham, amounting to L.8000 annually, to defray the expenses of
                    its government. In consideration of this gratuity, Para receives the goods
                    imported into Maranham duty free, and likewise defrays the expenses of the
                    packets and men of war on the station. The currency of the province is a good
                    criterion of its general poverty. Copper is the only circulating medium, and
                    even that is of the basest description. Besides, it is, or at least was a few
                    years ago, liable to be called up by the government at pleasure, and restamped,
                    by which operation it became of twice its former value. “It would appear,” says
                    Mr Webster, “that this province is the very sink of the empire in respect to
                    currency, as all the base copper coin which is not passable in the other parts
                    of the empire finds here a ready circulation. No better idea of it can be given
                    than the fact, that what passes for one hundred pounds in copper coin, is really
                    and intrinsically worth only eight pounds. Silver was at a premium of
                    twenty-five per cent.; and the very sight of a dollar, when we were there, was
                    quite a rarity. Hence the necessaries of life are cheap. House-rent is moderate,
                    and there are no direct taxes.” In mentioning the price of articles, this writer
                    observes, that “horses are worth sixteen shillings each, and are generally fed
                    with rice chaff”. Foreign produce is by no means high at Para, the wines of
                    Portugal and the manufactures of England being comparatively cheap.” With regard
                    to trade, he observes, “it is said that it was the miserable policy of the
                    Marquis de Pombal, not only to keep foreigners, but the Portuguese themselves,
                    ignorant of the value of this province; a policy which was realizing the
                    character of the dog in the manger illustrated by the fable. He did every thing
                    in his power to degrade and keep it in the back ground. The situation of it is
                    well adapted for rendering it the dépôt of an extensive and lucrative trade; but
                    the commerce, in consequence of such short-sighted policy, is extremely small, a
                    kind of petty retail rather than any extensive or liberal trade. A merchant is
                    obliged to buy, from time to time, small scraps and parcels; such, for instance,
                    as a pound or two of isinglass, by which means he is long in accumulating a
                    stock.” All the produce is brought to Para in canoes, from a distance of six or
                    seven hundred miles in the interior. Cocoa is the staple article of commerce,
                    and it is produced in vast quantities; but being now so much depreciated in the
                    foreign markets, it will not defray the expense of freight. There is, in fact,
                    no demand for it, and the aroba, or thirty-two pounds of cocoa, is sometimes
                    worth only twenty pence. Rice is very abundant, but cotton is scarce.
                    Sarsaparilla, which is principally exported to Lisbon, and thence to London,
                    balsam copaiva, tonquin beans, vanilla, farina, oils, and Indian rubber, are the
                    chief articles of exportation.</p>
                <p>Those principally imported consist of flour, spermaceti candles, soap, shoes, and
                    other goods, from the United States; cotton goods and hardware from England; and
                    wines, vinegar, olive oil, limestone, drugs, chestnuts, and some few other
                    articles, from Lisbon. The manufactures of Para are ladies’ combs, polished with
                    the leaf of the <hi rend="italic">curatella Americana</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi> good leather, made of the skins of the goats or hares of the country;
                    coarse and bad pottery; chocolate, coarse hammocks, straw and palm hats, lace,
                    salt-fish, and jerked beef. The Indians bring down from the interior elegant
                    wands of beautiful feathers, called sceptros, besides superbly ornamented
                    hammocks, feather dresses, bows and arrows, and stained calabashes. The
                    Brazilian tribes about Para appear to be a very fine, healthy, and
                    well-conditioned race of people. Their skin is of a good firm copper colour,
                    without a tinge of black; they have long jetty hair, with rubicund faces and
                    intelligent features, in which a general expression of mildness predominates.
                    “The superiority of the Brazilians over the poor African tribes of slaves at
                    Para,” says Mr Webster, “is particularly remarkable; and the contrast is sadly
                    against the latter. It is customary for the negro slaves to come down in groups
                    every morning to the riverside, to purchase various articles of produce brought
                    down from the interior by the native canoes. At this usual morning rendezvous,
                    some bring coffee ready made for breakfast, while others bring a favourite
                    liquor called ‘ wassa-ree,’ an infusion of a small kind of palm. This beverage
                    has the colour of port wine, and when sweetened is highly esteemed by these
                    people. In fact, with a banana, or alligator pear, it forms the principal fare
                    of many, while others prefer the farina of the cassada with it.” The city of
                    Para was built by the Jesuits in the year 1615, and, before the revolt of the
                    negroes, contained about 20,000 inhabitants. The population of the entire
                    province was estimated in 1830 at 190,000.</p>
                <p>The only other town of any consideration in Para proper is Bragança, formerly
                    Cayte or Cahcte, and the capital of a short-lived captaincy. It is distant about
                    twenty miles from the sea, and nearly one hundred miles eastnorth-east of Para.
                    It is a port at which coasters touch on their way from Maranham to the capital,
                    and is one of the oldest towns in the province, with a population of about 2000
                    inhabitants. Villa Vicoca, or Cameta, is the largest town in the whole province
                    next to Para. It is situated on the left bank of the Toccantines, about forty
                    miles from its mouth, and ninety miles south-west of the capital, with which it
                    has a distinct water communication, by means of a natural canal, navigable with
                    the tide. This place is a mart between Para and Goyaz, and contains about 6000
                    inhabitants. The river Toccantines here expands to ten miles in breadth, and the
                    tide extends twenty-six leagues higher up, to the registry of Fort Alcobaça, the
                    navigation being thus far uninterrupted by either rocks or rapids.</p>
                <p>The colony of Para was originally an offset from that of Maranham. In the year
                    1615, Francisco Caldeiro sailed from St Luiz with two hundred men in three
                    caravels, intrusted with the project of selecting an eligible situation for a
                    settlement more immediately within the vicinity of the river Amazons, with a
                    view to promote the navigation of that river, and to frustrate the attempts of
                    any other nation to form settlements in this direction. The Dutch at one time
                    had establishments upon both banks of the river, but they were expelled by the
                    Portuguese about the year 1622. The early history of the province exhibits the
                    same nefarious system of slave-hunting* that was practised in almost all the
                    captaincies; but it was carried on in Para with peculiar cruelty. An end,
                    however, was at length put to the captivity of the Indians, none but negroes
                    being permitted to be sold as slaves; and under <pb break="no"

                    became more numerous than that of the eastern provinces. The evil consequences
                    of their expulsion were more perceptible here than in any other part of Brazil,
                    says Mr Southey, “because nowhere had so many <hi rend="italic">aldeias</hi>
                    been established, nor had they anywhere else been in so flourishing a state.”
                    The city of Para was recently the scene of a fearful revolt of the native
                    Indians. The cause of quarrel was the confinement of an Indian charged with
                    having committed some offence. His brother, having vainly solicited his
                    liberation, assembled a body of about three hundred of his countrymen, and
                    attacked the city on the 14th of August 1835. The assault was at first
                    unsuccessful, and the contest continued for several days without any result; but
                    the insurgents having gradually gained possession of the most favourable
                    positions, the inhabitants were seized by a panic, and the Indians, rushing in
                    through the by-lanes and narrow streets, commenced an indiscriminate slaughter,
                    at the same time sacking and pillaging the city. An expedition sent against them
                    proved unsuccessful; but they voluntarily abandoned the city, and the imperial
                    troops entered it on the 13th of May 1836. When Para fell into the hands of the
                    insurgents, it was said to have contained British property to the amount of
                    L.300,000, but after the capture of the place scarcely a vestige of it remained.
