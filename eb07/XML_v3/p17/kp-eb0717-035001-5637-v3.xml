                <p><label type="entry">PHILISTINES</label> were the ancient inhabitants of
                    Palestine, well known in sacred history. These people are sometimes called in
                    Scripture Cherethites and Caphtorim. The earlier part of their history is, like
                    that of most other nations, very obscure and uncertain. The authors of the
                    Universal<pb break="no" facs="nls:193495650" xml:id="kp-eb0717-5650-0351"/>
                    History inform us that they were descended partly from the Casluhim, and partly
                    from the Caphtorim, both being of the progeny of Mizraim, the son of Ham, the
                    son of Noah. Moses tells us that they drove out the Avim or Avites even to Azzah
                    or Gazah, where they settled; but when this happened cannot be determined. Upon
                    the whole, however, our learned authors are clearly of opinion, that the
                    Casluhim and Caphtorim, from whom the Philistines were descended, came
                    originally from Egypt, and called the country which they had conquered by their
                    own name. Many interpreters, however, think that Caphtor was but another name
                    for Cappadocia, which they imagine to have been the original country of the
                    Philistines. But Calmet, in a particular dissertation prefixed to the first book
                    of Samuel, endeavours to show that they were originally from the island of
                    Crete. The reasons which led him to think that Caphtor is the island of Crete
                    may be shortly stated. The Philistines were strangers in Palestine, as appears
                    from various parts of Scripture; and hence the Septuagint always translate this
                    name <hi rend="italic">strangers.</hi> Their proper name was Cherethim; for
                    Ezekiel, speaking against the Philistines, says, “I will stretch out mine hand
                    upon the Philistines, and I will cut off the Cherethim, and destroy the remnant
                    of the sea-coast.” Zephaniah, inveighing against the same people, says, “Woe
                    unto the inhabitants of the sea-coasts, the nation of the Cherethites.” And
                    Samuel says, that the Amalekites made an irruption into the country of the
                    Cherethites, that is, of the Philistines, as the sequel of the discourse plainly
                    proves. The kings of Judah had afterwards foreign guards called the Cherethites
                    and Pelethites, who appear to have been Philistines. The Septnagint, under the
                    name of Cherethites, understood the Cretans; and by Cherith they understood
                    Crete. Besides, the Scripture says that the Philistines came from the isle of
                    Caphtor. Now we know of no island in the Mediterranean in which the marks
                    whereby the Scripture describes Caphtor and Cherethim agree better than in the
                    island of Crete. The name Cretim or Cherethim is the same with that of
                    Cretenses; and the Cretans are a most ancient and celebrated people, who
                    inhabited the islands of the Mediterranean, pretending to have been originally
                    produced out of their own soil. This island was well peopled in the time of the
                    Trojan war. Homer calls it the island of the hundred cities. The city of Gaza in
                    Palestine went by the name of Minoa, because Minos, king of Crete, coming into
                    that country, called this ancient city by his own name.</p>
                <p>Herodotus acknowledges that the Cretans were originally barbarians, and did not
                    come from Greece. Homer says, that a different language was spoken in the island
                    of Crete; that there were Greeks there, but also true or ancient Cretans, and
                    Pelasgians. The ancient Cretans are the same as the Cherethites, and the
                    Pelasgians as the Philistines or Pelethites of the Scripture. Their language was
                    the same with that of the Canaanites or Phoenicians, that is, Hebrew; and they
                    were descended, as well as Canaan, from Ham, by Mizraim. The manners, arms,
                    religion, and gods of the Cretans and Philistines were the same. Both used only
                    bows and arrows; and Dagon the god of the Philistines was the same as the
                    Dictymna of the Cretans.</p>
                <p>Whether these arguments are convincing, it is not for us to determine. Wells does
                    not think they are, being of the same opinion with the authors of the Universal
                    History, who say that Coptus, the name of an old city of Egypt, is a corruption
                    of the ancient Caphtor. It is not, however, of great importance to determine
                    whether they came from Crete, from Cappadocia, or from Egypt. They had certainly
                    been a considerable time in the land of Canaan when Abraham arrived there in the
                    Jyear of the world 2083. They were then a very powerful people, governed by
                    kings, and in possession of several considerable cities. The race of kings then
                    in power were honoured with the title of <hi rend="italic">Abimelech.</hi> This
                    race, however, was of short duration; for their monarchy became an aristocracy
                    of five lords, who, as far as we can discover,∣were partly independent of one
                    another, though they acted in concert for the common cause. This form of
                    government was again succeeded by another race of kings, distinguished by the
                    title of <hi rend="italic">Achish,</hi> though they also bore that of Abimelech.
                    The kings were always subjected to great limitations. The Philistines appear to
                    have been a very warlike people, industrious, and lovers of freedom; they did
                    not circumcise, and in the early periods of their history held adultery in the
                    greatest abhorrence. “Their character,” say the authors of the Universal
                    History, “must be considered at different periods; for we may say they were not
                    always the same people. In the days of Abraham and Isaac, they were without all
                    doubt a righteous and hospitable nation; but afterwards a revolution in
                    government, religion, and morals, may have ensued. From thenceforward they
                    became like the other idolatrous nations; the same enormities crept in and
                    prevailed amongst them. They are constantly mentioned in Scripture as strangers;
                    and though possessed of a very considerable part of the Land of Promise, yet God
                    would never suffer them to be driven out, they being Egyptians by descent, and
                    not original natives, whose land only was promised to Abraham and his seed.
                    Their arrogance and ambition were great; and so irreconcileable was their enmity
                    to the Israelites,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>“From
                    a passage in Chronicles, where it is said, that ‘ the men of Gath slew the
                    children of Ephraim, who would have taken their cattle from them,’ it is guessed
                    to have been of very ancient date. This incident is nowhere else to be found;
                    and there are various notions concerning the sense in which we must take this
                    passage. As to the time of the transaction, most people allow it to have been
                    while the children of Israel were sojourners in Egypt. It plainly appears, by
                    the next verse, that Ephraim himself was living at that period. _ The Targum
                    supposes his children miscomputed the time they were to serve in Egypt, and
                    began too early an attempt upon their promised land.” .</p></note> that one
                    would be almost tempted to think they were created on purpose to be a thorn in
                    their sides; for though the hand of God was evidently against them several
                    times, and particularly when they detained the ark, yet they hardened their
                    hearts and closed their eyes against conviction. They seem to have entertained a
                    very great veneration for their deities, in which they persisted, though they
                    were eye-witnesses of the shame and ignominy which befell them in the presence
                    of the captive ark; nay, they were so biassed in their favour, as to imagine
                    that their gods might prevail against Him who had in so glaring a manner put
                    them to shame and disgrace. They were much, engaged in trade, which, considering
                    their situation, they may have exercised from the beginning; but, by the
                    accession of the fugitive Edomites in David’s time, they rose to so great a
                    reputation as merchants, that the Greeks, it seems, preferred them to all other
                    nations in that respect, and from them called all the country bordering upon
                    theirs <hi rend="italic">Palestine.</hi> Their language was not so different
                    from that spoken by the Hebrews as to cause any difficulty for them to converse
                    together, as will be perceived by their intercourse with Abraham and Isaac; so
                    that, in all this region, the several nations spoke one and the same tongue,
                    perhaps with some variation of dialect. They had doubtless the arts and sciences
                    in common with the most learned and ingenious amongst their contemporaries, and
                    perhaps some of them in greater perfection. They had giants amongst them; but
                    whether these were originally of the breed of the Anakim, who retired hither
                    when they were expelled from Hebron, or were sprung from accidental births, is
                    not easily determined. We must not forget, that the invention of the bow and
                    arrow is ascribed to this people.</p>

                <p>“Their religion was different at different times; under their first race of
                    kings, they used the same rites with the Hebrews. Abimelech, in the sin he had
                    like to have committed with Sarah, through Abraham’s timidity, was favoured with
                    a divine admonition from God; and, by his speech and behaviour at that time, it
                    seems as if he had been used to converse with the Deity. In after times, they
                    fell into endless superstitions, and different kinds of idolatry; nay, each of
                    the principal or five cities seemed to have an idol of its own. Marna, Marnas,
                    or Marnash, was worshipped at Gaza, and is said to have migrated into Crete, and
                    to have become the Cretan Jupiter. Dagon was worshipped at Azotus; he seems to
                    have been the greatest, the most ancient, and most favourite god they had; to
                    which may be added, that he perhaps subsisted the longest of any that did not
                    straggle out of the country. To him they ascribed the invention of bread-corn,
                    or of agriculture, as his name imports. We cannot enter into the common notion
                    of his being represented as a monster, half man, half fish; nor consequently
                    into another, almost as common, that he is the same with the Syrian goddess
                    Derceto, who, we are told, was represented under some such mixed form. Our
                    opinion is, that this idol was in shape wholly like a man; for we read of his
                    head, his hands, and his feet. He stood in a temple at Azotus, and had priests
                    of his own, who paid him a very constant attendance. Next to Dagon was
                    Baalzebub, the god of Ekron. In the text of the New Testament he is called <hi
                    rend="italic">Beelzebub,</hi> and the ‘ prince of devils.’ His name is rendered
                    <hi rend="italic">lord of flies,</hi> which by some is held to be a mock
                    appellation bestowed on him by the Jews; but others think him so styled by his
                    worshippers, as Hercules Apomyios and others were, from his driving those
                    insects away; and urge, that Ahaziah, in his sickness, would scarcely have
                    applied to him, if his name had carried in it any reproach. But it must be
                    remembered, it is the sacred historian that makes use of that contemptuous term
                    in derision; whereas the idolatrous monarch, who was one of his votaries, might
                    call him by his common name, supposed to have been <hi rend="italic"
                    >Baal-zeboath,</hi> ’ the lord of armies,’ or <hi rend="italic"
                    >Baal-shamin,</hi> ’ lord of heaven,’ or some other bordering on Baal-zebub. How
                    or under what form he was represented is uncertain. Some place him on a throne,
                    and attire him like a king; others paint him as a fly. Not to dwell on this
                    obscurity, it appears that he became an oracle of the highest repute for
                    omniscience and veracity; that he had priests of his own; and that he, in the
                    middle times at least, was much sought after by those who were anxious about
                    futurity. Derceto we take certainly to have been the goddess of Ascalon; but we
                    are supported by profane authority, without the least countenance from
                    Scripture. Gath is seemingly the only city of all the five unprovided with a
                    deity; wherefore, as the Scripture declares, that Ashtaroth, or Astarte, was
                    worshipped by this people, we are ready to place her at Gath, and the rather, as
                    this of all their cities may have had most communication with Sidon. To speak in
                    general concerning their religious rites and ceremonies, which is all we can do,
                    they seem to have erected very large and spacious temples, or very wide halls,
                    for the celebration of their solemn seasons and festivals (for such they surely
                    had); their religious offices were attended with much pomp, and a great
                    concourse from all parts; and they presented their gods with the chief part of
                    their spoil, and carried them about with them when they went to war. We do not
                    find in Scripture that they sacrificed their children; and yet the Curetes are
                    said to be their descendants.”</p>
                <p>With respect to the history of this extraordinary people, we find from the above
                    extract, that they were not comprehended in the number of nations devoted to
                    extermination, and whose territory the Lord had abandoned to the Hebrews; nor
                    were they of the cursed seed of Canaan. However, Joshua did not forbear to give
                    their lands to the Hebrews, and to set upon them by command of the Lord, because
                    they possessed a country which was promised to the people of God. But these
                    conquests of Joshua must have been ill maintained, since under the Judges, under
                    Saul, and at the beginning of the reign of David, the Philistines oppressed the
                    Israelites. It is true that Shamgar, Samson, Samuel, and Saul, made head against
                    them, but did not reduce their power; and they continued independent down to the
                    reign of David, who subjected thereto his government.</p>
                <p>They remained in subjection to the kings of Judah down to the reign of Jehoram,
                    the son of Jehoshaphat, that is, for about 246 years. However, Jehoram made war
                    against them, and probably reduced them to obedience; because it is observed in
                    Scripture that they revolted again under Uzziah, and that this prince kept them
                    to their duty during the remainder of his reign. During the unfortunate reign of
                    Ahaz, the Philistines made great havoc in the territories of Judah; but his son
                    and successor Hezekiah subdued them. Lastly, they regained their full liberty
                    under the latter kings of Judah; and, by the menaces denounced against them by
                    the prophets Isaiah, Amos, Zephaniah, Jeremiah, and Ezekiel, we find that they
                    had brought a thousand hardships and calamities upon the children of Israel, for
                    which cruelties God threatened to punish them. Esarhaddon besieged Ashdod or
                    Azoth, and took it; and, according to Herodotus, Psammeticus king of Egypt took
                    the same city, after a siege of twenty-nine years. There is great probability
                    that Nebuchadnezzar, when he subdued the Ammonites, Moabites, Egyptians, and
                    other nations bordering upon the Jews, also reduced the Philistines. After this,
                    they fell under the dominion of the Persians, and then under that of Alexander
                    the Great, who destroyed the city of Gaza, the only city of Phoenicia which
                    ventured to oppose him. After the persecution of Antiochus Epiphanes, the
                    Asmonaeans subjected to their sway several cities of the Philistines; and
                    Tryphon gave to Jonathan Maccabaeus the government of the whole coast of the
                    Mediterranean, from Tyre as far as Egypt, thus including all the country of the
                    Philistines.</p>
