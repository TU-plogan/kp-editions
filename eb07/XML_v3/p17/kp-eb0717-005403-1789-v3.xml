                    Aureolus</hi></label><hi rend="smallcaps">Theophrastus,</hi> a famous alchemist
                    and enthusiast of the sixteenth century, was born in 1493, at Einsiedeln, a
                    small town of the canton of Schwitz, distant some leagues from Zurich. His
                    father, who practised medicine at Villach in Carinthia, was a near relative of
                    George Bombast de Hohenheim, who afterwards became grand-prior of the order of
                    Malta; so that Paracelsus was not sprung from the dregs of the people, as his
                    sworn enemy, Erastus, pretends. His early education appears to have been
                    neglected, and he passed a part of his youth leading the life of a strolling
                    schoolman of that period; in other words, he wandered from country to country,
                    predicting future events by inspecting the stars and the lines of the hand,
                    conjuring up the dead, and repeating various operations in alchemy and magic,
                    into which he had been initiated either by his father, or by different
                    ecclesiastics, amongst whom he mentions the abbot Trithcim, and several German
                    bishops. As Paracelsus everywhere shows himself ignorant of the most common and
                    elementary parts of knowledge, it is not probable that he had ever seriously
                    studied in the schools. He contented himself with visiting the universities of
                    Germany, France, and Italy; and although he boasts of having been the ornament
                    of these schools, there is no evidence of his having legitimately acquired the
                    title of doctor, which he chose to assume. All we know is, that he laboured for
                    a long time in the house of a certain rich man, named Sigismond Fugger de
                    Schwatz, in order to learn from him the secret of the philosopher’s stone.
                    According to the usage of the alchemists, Paracelsus travelled into the
                    mountains of Bohemia, Sweden, and the East, to inspect the labours of the
                    miners, get himself initiated into the mysteries of the oriental adepts, and
                    observe the wonders of nature, particularly the celebrated magnetic mountain. He
                    is also said to have traversed Spain, Portugal, France, Prussia, Poland, and
                    Transylvania, communicating not only with the physicians, but also with the old
                    women, quacks, and magicians of these different countries. It is even believed
                    that he extended his travels as far as Egypt and Tartary, and that he
                    accompanied the son of the Khan of the Tartars to Constantinople, in order to
                    learn of a Greek who resided in that capital the secret of the tincture or
                    elixir of Trismegistus. This vagabond life naturally left Paracelsus very little
                    time for reading; and, in fact, he has himself stated, that during the space of
                    ten years he .did not open a single book, and that all his medical library
                    consisted of about a dozen pages. Nor did his desire of knowledge increase with
                    his years; for an inventory made after his death shows, that the only books
                    which he left behind him were a Bible, a Concordance, a New Testament, the
                    Commentaries of St Jerome on the Gospels, a volume on medicine, and some seven
                    manuscripts.</p>

                <p>It is not known at what period he returned to Germany; but it appears that, about
                    the age of thirty-three, several remarkable cures, which he wrought on persons
                    of distinction, gave him such celebrity, that in 1526, he was, on the
                    recommendation of Oecolampadius, called to fill the chair of physic and surgery
                    in the university of Basil. Here Paracelsus commenced his career by burning
                    publicly in the hall the works of Avicenna and Galen; assuring his auditors,
                    that his shoe-ties knew more than these two physicians, that all the
                    universities, and all the writers united, were less instructed than the hairs of
                    his beard, and that he should be regarded as the sole monarch of physic. The
                    novelty of his doctrine, the confidence with which he spoke of his success, the
                    power to which he pretended of prolonging life, and curing the most inveterate
                    diseases, and the use of the vulgar tongue in his discourses, attracted to Basil
                    a crowd of credulous persons, equally indolent and enthusiastic. The prelections
                    which he delivered on practical medicine have fortunately been preserved; they
                    are in a mixed jargon of German and barbarous Latin, and contain nothing but a
                    multitude of empirical remedies, indicated with the greatest pretension. So much
                    impudence, however, far from diminishing his renown, served only to increase it,
                    insomuch that Erasmus, who had long suffered from gravel, applied to Paracelsus;
                    and this circumstance led to a correspondence (which has been preserved) between
                    these two men, who enjoyed such opposite kinds of celebrity. But even at Basil
                    people soon began to discover that the new professor was an impudent and
                    presumptuous quack. Scarcely had a year elapsed when his prelections were
                    deserted. As soon as the novelty wore off, his jargon was found to be
                    incomprehensible, and his empiricism a mere cloak for ignorance. But what
                    contributed more than any other cause to ruin his reputation was the crapulous
                    life which he led. According to Oporin, who lived two years with him, he almost
                    never appeared in his lecture-room without being half drunk, and seldom dictated
                    to his secretaries except under the influence of wine. If called to visit a
                    patient, he rarely did so without having first gorged himself with liquor. He
                    had the custom of sleeping in his clothes, and sometimes passed whole nights in
                    low taverns drinking with peasants, so that in the morning he had not the
                    slightest recollection of what had passed during the night. On one occasion,
                    however, having exceeded the ordinary license of his orgies, he assailed a
                    magistrate with the grossest abuse; and, dreading punishment for such an
                    outrage, found himself under the necessity of decamping from Basil, towards the
                    end of the year 1527. He took refuge in Alsace, whither he was followed by his
                    secretary Oporin, with all his chemical apparatus, and then resumed the same
                    kind of strolling life which he had led in his youth.</p>
                <p>Being thus cast loose again upon the world, he appeared at Colmar in 1528, at
                    Nuremberg in 1529, at Saint-Gall in 1531, at Pfeffers in 1535, and at Augsburg
                    in 1536. He then made some stay in Moravia, where he once more compromised his
                    reputation by the loss of some distinguished patients, and was in consequence
                    obliged to take his departure for Vienna. From that capital he passed into
                    Hungary, and, in 1538, appeared at Villach, where he dedicated his <hi
                    rend="italic">Chronicle</hi> to the states of Carinthia, in gratitude for the
                    favours which they had bestowed on his father. But his stay here appears to have
                    been short; for, in 1540, we find him at Mindelheim, whence he pro- <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> ceeded to Saltzburg, the ultimate term <hi
                    rend="italic">of</hi> all his wanderings. On the 24th of September 1541 he died
                    in the hospital of St Stephen at that place, in the forty-eighth year of his
                    age, and in a state of abject poverty; notwithstanding he pretended to the
                    possession of the double secret of transmuting metals, and prolonging life even
                    to the extent of several centuries.</p>
                <p>The life of this man forms a curious chapter in the history of self-delusion and
                    imposture. Yet in order to judge rightly of Paracelsus, as well as of the reform
                    which he wished to effect in medicine, it is necessary to dismiss all prejudice,
                    and to disregard alike the hostility of Erastus and the exaggerations of Murr.
                    It is also proper to keep in view the predominant spirit of the age in which he
                    lived, and to remember that this epoch was famous for the reign of astrology and
                    alchemy, the abuse of all sorts of superstitious practices, the apparition of
                    spectres, ghosts, and hobgoblins, frequent demoniacal possessions, and the
                    juggleries of a crowd of seers and fanatics, who, throughout all Europe, and
                    particularly in Germany, practised on the credulity of the people. Such were the
                    causes which prepared the way for the system of Paracelsus, and inflicts ed a
                    severe blow on that of Galen. To speak in a vulgar language, to write rather for
                    the people than for the learned, to introduce the cabbalistical art into
                    medicine, as a substitute for that knowledge which is only acquired by study, to
                    employ a crowd of mystical and barbarous terms, which make the greater
                    impression on the multitude the less they are understood; such were the means of
                    which Paracelsus availed himself, and which, but for his own indiscretion and
                    misconduct, would most probably have been attended with triumphant success.</p>
                <p>His philosophical and medical system is curious, even by reason of its absurdity.
                    He takes as his primary supports religion and the sacred books. He assures us
                    that the contemplation of the perfections of the Deity is sufficient to procure
                    all knowledge and all wisdom; that the Holy Scriptures conduct to all kinds of
                    truth; that the Bible furnishes a key to the theory of diseases; and that
                    magical medicine can only be learned by the study of the Apocalypse. The man who
                    blindly obeys the will of God, and who succeeds in identifying himself with the
                    celestial intelligences, possesses the philosopher’s stone; he can cure all
                    diseases, and can prolong his life at pleasure, because he holds in his
                    possession the tincture which Adam and the patriarchs employed before the Deluge
                    to prolong the term of human existence to eight or even nine centuries.
                    Paracelsus professed the grossest pantheism. He admitted the existence of pure
                    spirits without souls. According to him, all beings, even the minerals and
                    fluids, take aliments and drink, and expel faeces. His physiological theory, a
                    confused mass of the most incoherent ideas, is founded on the application of the
                    law of the cabbala to the demonstration of the functions of the human body. The
                    Sun has an influence on the heart, the Moon on the brain, Jupiter on the liver,
                    Saturn on the spleen, Mercury on the lungs, Mars on the bile, and Venus on the
                    kidneys and the organs of generation. Before attempting to explain the
                    functions, or to cure diseases, the physician should know the planets of the
                    microcosm, their meridian, their zodiac, their rising and setting; and it is by
                    means of this knowledge that he attains to the discovery of the most hidden
                    secrets of nature. The body is formed by the concourse of sidereal, that is,
                    immaterial salt, sulphur, and mercury. Each of the elements may admit of all
                    qualities, so that there may be dry water and cold fire. Another of his
                    doctrines related to the <hi rend="italic">archeus,</hi> a species of demon,
                    which performed in the stomach the function of an alchemist, separating the
                    poisonous matter contained in the aliments from that which serves the purpose of
                    nutrition.</p>
                <p>Nor was Paracelsus less absurd in his pathological theory. Returning always to
                    magic, he assures us that it is the art of arts, and that from it all knowledge
                    of medicine must be derived. He glories in passing for a magician, and even
                    boasts that he had received from hell letters written by Galen, and had
                    maintained, in the vestibule of that dreary region, keen disputes with Avicenna
                    on porta <pb break="no" facs="nls:193491815" xml:id="kp-eb0717-1815-0056"/>ble
                    gold, the elixir of the philosophers, the quintessence, the mithridate, and the
                    philosopher’s stone. He attributes diseases to five general causes, which he
                    names <hi rend="italic">entities,</hi> and which have relation to the
                    astrological system; so that, instead of observing symptoms, a physician should
                    consult the planets, in order to distinguish if the entity be divine, or astral,
                    or natural, or spiritual, or poisonous. He declares that there is an essential
                    difference between the diseases of men and those of women, because the <hi
                    rend="italic">uterus,</hi> as a microcosm within a microcosm, performs an
                    important part in all the affections of women. To the menstrual blood he
                    attributes the most extraordinary properties, particularly a poisonous quality.
                    He explains each malady in particular by the help of his three principles of
                    chemical entities, which he substitutes instead of the four elements of the
                    ancients. In therapeutics and in materia medica his theory is altogether
                    cabbalistical. He regards gold as a specific in all cases where the heart is the
                    primary seat of the malady; recommends the study of anatomy and chiromancy in
                    order to discover the virtues of vegetables; and states that, before employing
                    any medicament, it is indispensable to observe the state of the constellations.
                    In surgery he altogether rejected the use of cutting instruments, caustics, and
                    even sutures, and pretended to cure fractures without bandages, by means only of
                    comfrey. He employed the magnet in cases of haemorrhage, hysteria, epilepsy, and
                    the greater part of the spasmodic affections; and extended more than ever the
                    abuse of talismans. But amidst all this absurdity and extravagance, Paracelsus
                    had the undoubted merit of attempting to introduce into medicine the use of
                    antimonial, mercurial, and ferruginous preparations, which have so efficacious
                    an action upon our organs; and it is equally certain that alchemy, which ruined
                    so many adepts, proved advantageous to the medical sciences, by reason of the
                    important discoveries which incidentally resulted from the numberless
                    experiments made by its professors.</p>
                <p>Paracelsus published very few works in his lifetime, and those which are
                    attributed to him exhibit so many contradictions that several of them have been
                    ascribed to his disciples. It would be a useless waste of space to enumerate the
                    titles of all his works; we shall therefore content ourselves with indicating
