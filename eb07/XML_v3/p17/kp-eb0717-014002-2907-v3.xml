                    of those first fathers who lived towards the beginning of the world, and became
                    famous by their long lines of descendants. Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and bis
                    twelve sons, are the patriarchs of the Old Testament; Seth, Enoch, and others,
                    were antediluvian patriarchs. The authority of patriarchal government existed in
                    the fathers of families, and their first-born after them, who exercised all
                    kinds of ecclesiastical and civil jurisdiction in their respective households;
                    and to this government, which lasted till the time when the Israelites sojourned
                    in Egypt, some have ascribed an absolute and despotic power, extending even to
                    the punishment of death. In proof of this is produced the curse pronounced by
                    Noah upon Canaan but it must be observed, that in this affair Noah seems to have
                    acted rather as a prophet than a patriarch. Another instance of supposed
                    despotic power is Abraham’s turning Hagar and Ishmael out of his family; <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 2</hi> but this can hardly be thought to furnish evidence of
                    any singular authority vested in the patriarchs, as such, and peculiar to those
                    early ages. The third instance brought forward to the same purpose is that of
                    Jacob’s denouncing a curse upon Simeon and Levi, <hi rend="superscript"> 3</hi>
                    which is maintained by others to be an instance of prophetic inspiration rather
                    than of patriarchal power. The fourth instance is that of Judah with regard to
                    Tamar, <hi rend="superscript"> 4</hi> in reference to which it has been
                    remarked, that Jacob, the father of Judah, was still living; that Tamar was not
                    one of his own family; that she had been guilty of adultery, the punishment of
                    which was death by burning; and that Judah on this occasion might speak only as
                    a prosecutor, not as a judge. Upon the whole, however, it is difficult to say
                    which of these opinions is most agreeable to truth. Men who believe that the
                    origin of civil government, and the obligation to obedience, arise from a
                    supposed original contract, either real or implied, will be naturally led to
                    weaken the authority of the patriarchs; and those, again, who consider
                    government as a divine institution, will be as apt to exalt that authority to
                    the highest pitch that either reason or Scripture will permit them. It cannot be
                    denied, that authority existed in fathers, and descended to their first-born, in
                    the primitive ages of the world; and it is neither unnatural nor improbable to
                    imagine, that the idea of hereditary power and hereditary honours was first
                    taken from this circumstance. Bu <hi rend="subscript"> s</hi> t whether
                    authority has descended through father and son in this way to our times, is a
                    circumstance that cannot in one instance be asserted, and may be denied in a
                    thousand. The real source of the dignity and of the authority of modern times
                    seems to have been skill in the art of war, and success in. the management of
                    conquests.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Jewish</hi><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Patriarch,</hi> a
                    dignity, respecting the origin of which there have been a variety of opinions;
                    some thinking it of very ancient institution, whilst others contend that it is
                    not older than the time of Nerva, the successor of Domitian. It seems probable
                    that the patriarchs were of the Aaronic or Levitical race; the tribe of Judah
                    being at that time too much depressed, and too obnoxious to the Romans, to be
                    able to assume any external power. But of whatever tribe they were, their
                    authority came to be very considerable. Their principal business was to instruct
                    the people; and for this purpose they instituted schools in several cities.
                    Having gained great reputation for extraordinary learning, zeal, and piety, they
                    might, in time, not only have brought a great concourse of other Jews from
                    foreign parts, as from Egypt and other western provinces of their dispersion,
                    but likewise have proved the means of their patriarchal authority being
                    acknowledged there. From these they at length ventured to levy a kind of
                    tribute, in order to defray the charges of their dignity, and of the officers
                    under them, whose business it was to carry their orders and decisions through
                    the other provinces of the dispersion, and to see them punctually executed by
                    all, that some shadow of union at least might be kept up amongst the western
                    Jews. They likewise nominated the doctors who were to preside over their schools
                    and academies; and these were in process of time styled <hi rend="italic"
                    >chiefs</hi> and <hi rend="italic">princes,</hi> in order to raise the credit of
                    their dignity, or to imply the great regard which their disciples were to pay to
                    them. These chiefs became at length rivals of the patriarchs; and some of them
                    possessed both dignities at once, an usurpation which not only caused great
                    confusion, but oftentimes very violent and bloody contests. However, as the
                    Jewish Rabbin have trumped up a much older era for this patriarchal dignity, and
                    have furnished us with a succession of patriarchs down to the fifth century, in
                    which it was abolished, it may not be amiss to give our readers the substance of
                    what they have written on the rise and progress of this order of men; at the
                    same time showing the absurdity and falsehood of the pretended succession to
                    this imaginary dignity.</p>
                <p>According to the Rabbin, the first patriarch was Hillel, surnamed the <hi
                    rend="italic">Babylonian,</hi> because he was sent for from thence to Jerusalem
                    about a hundred years before the ruin of their capital, or thirty years before
                    the birth of Christ, to decide a dispute about the keeping of Easter, which on
                    that day fell upon the Sabbath-day; and it was on account of his wise decision
                    that he was raised to that dignity, which continued in his family till the fifth
                    century. He was likewise looked upon as a second Moses, because, like the Jewish
                    legislator, he lived forty years in obscurity, forty more in great reputation
                    for learning and sanctity, and forty more in possession of this patriarchal
                    dignity. They reckon him little inferior to that lawgiver in other excellencies,
                    as well as in the great authority he gained over the whole Jewish nation. The
                    wonder is, how Herod the Great, who was naturally so jealous, could suffer a
                    stranger to be raised to such a height of power, barely for having decided a
                    dispute which must in all likelihood have been adjudged by others long before
                    that time.</p>
                <p>However, Hillel was succeeded by his son Simeon, whom many Christians consider to
                    have been the venerable old person of that name who received the divine infant
                    in his arms. The Jews give him but a very obscure patriarchate, although the
                    authors above quoted make him, also, chief of the Sanhedrim; and Epiphanius
                    says, that the priestly tribe hated him so much for giving testimony to the
                    divine <hi rend="superscript"> l</hi> Genesis, ix. 25. <hi rend="superscript">

                <p>child, that they denied him the rites of common sepulture. But it is hardly
                    credible that St Luke should have so carelessly passed over his twofold dignity,
                    if he had been really possessed of such, and have given him no higher title than
                    that of a just and devout man.</p>
                <p>He was succeeded by Jochonan, not in right of descent, but of his extraordinary
                    merit, which the Rabbin, according to custom, have raised to so surprising a
                    height, that, according to them, if the whole heavens were paper, all the trees
                    in the world pens, and all the men writers, they would not suffice to record all
                    his lessons. He enjoyed his dignity but two years according to some, or five
                    according to others; and was the person who, observing the gates of the temple
                    to open of their own accord, cried out, “0 temple, temple, why art thou thus
                    moved? We know that thou art to be destroyed, seeing Zechariah hath foretold it,
                    saying, ‘ Open thy gates, O Libanus, and let the flames consume thy cedars.’”
                    Upon this he is further reported to have complimented Vespasian, or rather, as
                    some have corrected the story, Titus, with the title of king; assuring him that
                    it was a royal person who was to destroy that edifice, on which account they
                    pretend that the Roman general gave him leave to remove the Sanhedrim to
                    Japhne.</p>
                <p>The Jewish writers add, that he likewise erected an academy there, which
                    subsisted until the death of Akiba; that this was likewise the seat of the
                    patriarch, and contained three hundred schools, or classes of scholars. Another
                    he erected at Lydda, not far from Japhne, and where the Christians buried their
                    far-famed St George. He lived an hundred and twenty years, and being asked what
                    he had done to prolong his life, he returned this curious answer: <hi
                    rend="italic">“</hi><hi rend="italic">I</hi> never made water nearer a house of
                    prayer than four cubits; I never disguised my name; I have taken care to
                    celebrate all festivals; and my mother has even sold my head ornaments to buy
                    wine enough to make me merry on such days, leaving me at her death three hundred
                    hogsheads of it to sanctify the Sabbath.” The doctors who flourished in his time
                    were no less considerable, both for their number and character, particularly the
                    famed Rabbi Chanina, of whom the Bath Col was heard to say, that the world was
                    preserved for the sake of him; and Nicoemus, whom they pretend to have stopped
                    the course of the sun, like another Joshua.</p>
                <p>He was succeeded by Gamaliel, a man, according to them, of insufferable pride,
                    and yet of so universal authority over all the Jews, not only in the west, but
                    throughout the whole world, that the very monarchs suffered his laws to be
                    obeyed in their dominions, not one of them offering to obstruct the execution of
                    them. In his days flourished Samuel the Less, who composed a prayer full of the
                    bitterest curses against heretics (meaning the Christians), which are still in
                    use to this day. Gamaliel was no less an enemy to them; and yet both have been
                    challenged, the former as the celebrated master of the great apostle of the
                    Gentiles, the other as his disciple in his unconverted state.</p>
                <p>Simeon II., his son and successor, was the first martyr who died during the siege
                    of Jerusalem. The people so regretted his death, that an order was given,
                    instead of ten bumpers of wine, which were usually drank at the funeral of a
                    saint, to drink thirteen at his, on account of his martyrdom. These bumpers were
                    in time multiplied, they tell us, to such shameful height, that the Sanhedrim
                    was forced to make some new regulations for preventing so great an abuse.</p>
                <p>These are the patriarchs which, the Rabbin tell us, preceded the destruction of
                    the temple; and we need no farther confutation of this pretended dignity than
                    the silence of the sacred historians, who not only make not the least mention of
                    it, but assure us all along that they were the high priests who presided in the
                    Sanhedrim, and before whom all cases relating to the Jewish religion were
                    brought to be decided. It was the high priest that examined and condemned our
                    Saviour, that condemned St Stephen, that - forbade the apostles to preach in
                    Christ’s name, and that sat as judge on the great apostle at the head of that
                    supreme court. The same may be urged from Josephus, who must needs have known
                    and mentioned this pretended dignity, if any such had existed; and yet he is so
                    far from taking the least notice of it, that, like the evangelists, he places
                    the pontiffs alone at the head of all the Jewish affairs, and names the high
                    priest Ananus as having had the care and direction of the war against the
                    Romans; an evident proof that there were then no such patriarchs in
                    existence.</p>
                <p>To all this let us add, that if there had been any such remarkable succession,
                    the Talmudists would have preserved it to future ages; whereas neither they, nor
                    any of the ancient authors of the Jewish church, make any mention of it, but
                    only some of their doctors, who wrote a considerable time afterwards, writers to
                    whom little credit can be given in points of this nature, especially as there
                    are such insurmountable contradictions amongst them, as no authors, either
                    Jewish or Christian, have, with all their pains, been hitherto able to
                    reconcile.</p>
                <p>Upon the whole, it appears that, however much Jewish pride may have prompted them
                    to falsify, and to claim an origin more ancient than it really was, they cannot
                    be traced much farther back than the time of Nerva. Nor have the Jews been
                    faithful in giving an account of the authority of these men. They have indeed
                    exaggerated their power beyond all bounds, in the hope of repelling the
                    arguments of Christians; for their power was far more showy than substantial. In
                    time, however, they certainly imposed upon the people; and what power they did
                    possess in such matters as were connected with religion, they exercised with
                    great rigour. In particular, their pecuniary demands became very exorbitant; and
                    this was the cause of their final suppression in the year 429.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Patriarchs,</hi> amongst Christians, are ecclesiastical
                    dignitaries, or bishops, so called from their paternal authority in the church.
                    The power of patriarchs was not the same in all, but differed according to the
                    different customs of countries, or the pleasure of kings and councils. Thus the
                    patriarch of Constantinople grew to be supreme over the patriarchs of Ephesus
                    and Caesarea, and was called the oecumenical or universal patriarch; and the
                    patriarch of Alexandria had some prerogatives which no other patriarch but
                    himself enjoyed, such as the right of consecrating and approving every single
                    bishop under his jurisdiction.</p>
                <p>The patriarchate has ever been esteemed the supreme dignity in the church. The
                    bishop had only under him the territory of the city of which he was bishop; the
                    metropolitan superintended a province, and had for suffragans the bishops of his
                    province; the primate was the chief of what was then called a diocese, and had
                    several metropolitans under him; but the patriarch had under him several
                    dioceses, composing one exarchate, and the primates themselves were under
                    him.</p>
                <p>Usher, Pagi, De Marca, and Morinus, attribute the establishment of the grand
                    patriarchates to the apostles themselves, who, according to the description of
                    the world then given by geographers, pitched upon the three principal cities in
                    the three parts of the known world, Rome in Europe, Antioch in Asia, and
                    Alexandria in Africa, and thus formed a trinity of patriarchs. Others maintain
                    that the name patriarch was unknown at the time of the council of Nice; and that
                    for a long time afterwards patriarchs and primates were confounded together, as
                    being all equally chiefs of dioceses, and equally superior to metropolitans<pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193492933" xml:id="kp-eb0717-2933-0142"/>, who were only
                    chiefs of provinces. Hence Socrates gives the title patriarch to all the chiefs
                    of dioceses, of whom he reckons ten. Indeed it does not appear that the dignity
                    of patriarch was appropriated to the five grand sees of Rome, Constantinople,
                    Alexandria, Antioch, and Jerusalem, till after the council of Chalcedon in 451;
                    for when the council of Nice regulated the limits and prerogatives of the three
                    patriarchs of Rome, Antioch, and Alexandria, it did not give them the title of
                    patriarchs, though it allowed them pre-eminence and privileges as such; and
                    hence, when the council of Constantinople adjudged the second place to the
                    bishop of Constantinople, who till then was only a suffragan of Heraclea, it
                    said nothing of the patriarchate. Nor is the term <hi rend="italic"
                    >patriarch</hi> found in the decree of the council of Chalcedon, by which the
                    fifth place is assigned to the bishop of Jerusalem; nor did these five
                    patriarchs govern all the churches.</p>
                <p>There were, besides, many independent chiefs of dioceses, who, far from owning
                    the jurisdiction of the grand patriarchs, called themselves <hi rend="italic"
                    >patriarchs</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> such as that of Aquileia; nor was
                    Carthage ever subject to the patriarch of Alexandria. Mosheim<note

                    of pre-eminence over the rest of their order, were distinguished by the Jewish
                    title of patriarchs in the fourth century. The authority of the patriarchs
                    gradually increased, till about the close of the fifth century, when all affairs
                    of moment within the compass of their patriarchate came before them, either at
                    first hand or by appeals from the metropolitans. The consecrated bishops
                    assembled yearly in council the clergy of their respective districts; pronounced
                    a decisive judgment on those cases where accusations were brought against
                    bishops; and appointed vicars or deputies, clothed with their authority, for the
                    preservation of order and tranquillity in the remoter provinces. In short,
                    nothing was done without consulting them; and their decrees were executed with
                    the same regularity and respect as those of the princes.</p>
                <p>It deserves to be remarked, however, that the authority of the patriarchs was not
                    acknowledged throughout all the provinces without exception. Several districts,
                    both in the eastern and the western empire, were exempted from their
                    jurisdiction. The Latin church had no patriarchs till the sixth century; and the
                    churches of Gaul, Britain, and other countries, were never subject to the
                    authority of the patriarch of Rome, whose authority only extended to the nearer
                    provinces. There was no primacy, no exarchate nor patriarchate, owned here; but
                    the bishops, with the metropolitans, governed the church in common. Indeed,
                    after the name of patriarch became frequent in the west, it was attributed to
                    the bishops of Bourges and Lyons; but it was only in the primary signification,
                    namely, as heads of dioceses. Du Cange says, that there were some abbots who
                    bore the title of patriarchs.</p>
