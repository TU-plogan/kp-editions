                <p><label type="entry">PELEW <hi rend="smallcaps">Islands</hi>, or <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Palaos</hi></label>, a cluster of islands, mostly small, in the
                    western part of the Pacific Ocean, situated between the Philippine and the
                    Caroline Islands, and chiefly between the seventh and eighth degrees of north
                    latitude, and the 134th and 135th of east longitude. These islands are eighteen
                    in number, and their names are, Oroolong, Emungs, Emilleguc, Artingal, Corooraa,
                    and Pelelew. These islands were first visited by the Spaniards from the
                    Philippines, and received from them the appellation of the Palaos Islands, from
                    the tall palm trees with which they are covered, and which at a distance have
                    the appearance of ships’ masts, as the term indicates. The largest of these
                    islands is named Baubelthanap, and is about sixty miles in circumference; the
                    smaller islands are to the south. The latter are well covered with trees of
                    various kinds and sizes; some of them of the largest dimensions, and sufficient
                    for forming a canoe capable of holding thirty persons. Amongst the variety of
                    trees found here is the ebony, and a tree from which, when pierced by a gimblet,
                    there exudes a thick white liquid of the consistence of cream. A species of tree
                    also grows here, the sap of which blisters the skin. There is another singular
                    tree, the branchingof which is not unlike our cherry-tree; but its leaves
                    resemble the myrtle. It has no bark, having only an outward coat about the
                    thickness of a card, darker than the inside, though equally close in texture. It
                    has the colour of mahogany in the interior, and is so extremely hard that no
                    tool can work it. The other trees are the cabbage-tree, and a tree the fruit of
                    which resembles the almond; the ca-rimbola, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193493427"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0717-3427-0180"/>and the wild bread-fruit tree; the cocoa-nut tree,
                    the fruit of which is one of the chief articles of subsistence; and the
                    betel-nut tree, which is in great abundance. Plantains, bananas, oranges,
                    lemons, and sugar-canes, abound; likewise the turmeric, which the natives use as
                    a dye, and with which they stain their skins. On none of these islands, when
                    they were visited by the English, was there any kind of grain, or any quadruped
                    except some brownish-gray rats, which ran wild in the woods, and a few lean
                    cats, which were seen in some of the houses, and had probably escaped to the
                    shore from some wreck or drift-wood. The common domestic fowls, such as cocks
                    and hens, abound in the woods, though they are not domesticated; and, previous
                    to the arrival of the English, they were not used for food by the natives, who
                    reared pigeons for this purpose. Along the shores fish in great variety are
                    found, with many shell-fish, particularly the large Kima cockle, which they
                    procure by diving, and which, like other barbarous nations, they eat raw. Many
                    of the other birds are distinguished alike by the beauty of their plumage and
                    the variety and melody of their notes. There were several small birds of very
                    melodious notes, especially one whose notes resembled those of a flageolet, and
                    which sings morning and evening.</p>
                <p>These islands, when seen from the sea, appear of a rugged mountainous aspect, and
                    covered with wood; the interior parts being mountainous, and the valleys
                    extensive and beautiful, opening into prospects of picturesque beauty. A reef of
                    coral surrounds the shore, which is about five or six leagues broad, and in no
                    case less than three. The soil is in general rich, and produces luxuriant
                    herbage, which, as there is no cattle to eat it, grows high, and is scorched and
                    burned with the heat of the sun. The, climate, as in all tropical countries, is
                    divided into the two seasons, the wet and the dry. There is nothing in these
                    islands which deserves the name of a river; and the inhabitants derive their
                    supplies of fresh water from small rivulets and ponds.</p>
                <p>From the accounts given of these islands by Captain Wilson, commander of the
                    Antelope packet, in the service of the East India Company, who was wrecked on
                    them, and by other navigators, the inhabitants appear to have made but little
                    progress in civilization. They are not, indeed, as they had been represented,
                    irreclaimable savages, inhuman and barbarous, and feeding on human flesh; but,
                    on the contrary, hospitable, friendly, and humane in their dispositions, though
                    ignorant of the arts and manners of civilized life. They are, however,
                    industrious, and every part of the island bears marks of cultivation. Yams and
                    cocoa-nuts are the chief articles of subsistence, and to the rearing of these
                    their attention was chiefly directed. They are a stout and well-made people,
                    rather above the middle stature; and their complexions are not black, though of
                    a deeper shade than the Indian copper-colour. They have long flowing hair,
                    rather disposed to curl, which they form into one large loose coil round their
                    heads. Some of the women, who have remarkably long hair, allow it to hang down
                    their backs. The men go entirely naked; the women wear a slight covering of two
                    little aprons, or rather thick fringes, one before and one behind, about ten
                    inches deep and seven wide; these are made of the husks of the cocoa-nut,
                    stripped into narrow slips, and dyed with different shades of yellow. Both men
                    and women have the savage practice of tattooing, which operation takes place
                    when both sexes arrive at maturity. One ear of the men is bored, and in the
                    women both ears, and beads are worn in the perforated car by the men; but the
                    women put some leaf through, or an ear-ring of tortoise-shell inlaid. They also
                    perforate the cartilage between the nostrils in both sexes, through which they
                    frequently put a little sprig or blossom of some plant or shrub that pleases
                    their fancy.</p>
                <p>Like most barbarous nations, both sexes are expert swimmers, and appear to be as
                    perfectly at ease in the water as on land. In diving their skill is also
                    remarkable; and the men, if they saw any thing at the bottom of the sea which
                    attracted their attention, would instantly jump overboard and bring it up. They
                    mix no salt nor any other seasoning in any thing they eat; and the milk of the
                    cocoa-nut forms their usual beverage. They had no method of measuring time but
                    by the height of the sun, though they had some knowledge of the stars, having
                    names for several of them, which they pointed out to their English visitors.
                    Their houses were of a rude construction. They were raised about three feet from
                    the ground, and placed on large thick and oblong stones, as if cut from the
                    quarry. Their fishing-tackle was, however, well manufactured. The hooks were
                    made of tortoise-shell; and their twine, their cord, and all their fishing-nets,
                    were well manufactured from the husks of the cocoa-nut. They form the mats on
                    which they sleep, and which they throw over them when at rest, out of the
                    plantain leaf. They use the plantain leaf at their meals instead of a plate; the
                    shell of the cocoa-nut they polish very nicely, and it serves them as a cup to
                    drink out of. Their best knives are made of a piece of mother-of-pearl
                    oyster-shell. They make vessels of earthen ware, in which they boil their fish
                    and yams; and their hatchets are made of the Kima cockle ground to a sharp edge.
                    Their principal weapons are spears twelve feet long, made of bamboo, pointed
                    with some hard wood, and darts and slings. They carry on a maritime warfare with
                    each other in canoes, which they make from the trunk of a tree, with an
                    outrigger, and furnished with lateen sails made of mattine.</p>
                <p>The government of these islands is monarchical. The king has the supreme
                    authority, and, though divested of all external decorations of royalty, he is
                    honoured with every mark of personal distinction. The nobles approach him with
                    the greatest respect; and his common subjects, whenever they pass him, or have
                    occasion to address him, use every mark of the meanest servility, crouching
                    towards the ground in his presence, or even before any place where he is
                    supposed to be. The officer who approaches nearest to the king in power is his
                    brother, who is generalissimo of all the forces. The king is always attended by
                    a particular officer, who does not appear to possess any hereditary, but rather
                    a delegated authority. He is first consulted in all public affairs, and has
                    other marks of high dignity; but whether his office and character were religious
                    or civil, the English could not exactly learn. Polygamy prevails in these
                    islands, but in general the natives have not more than two wives, though the
                    king had five, who lived in separate dwellings. They have little or no religion,
                    and no outward observances that the English could perceive whilst they resided
                    amongst them. The king became much attached to the English who were shipwrecked
                    on these islands, and showed them great kindness. Indeed, so highly did he
                    esteem Captain Wilson, that he intrusted his second son, Prince Lee Boo, to his
                    care, to accompany him to England. This young prince was of the most amiable
                    dispositions, anxiously desirous of knowledge, and capable of receiving it. He
                    died of the small-pox, at Captain Wilson’s house in London, in 1784, at the age
                    of about twenty years. In return for the kindness shown by Abba Thulle, the
                    prince of Pelew, to the crew of the Antelope wrecked on the island of Oroolong
                    in 1783, the East India Company sent him, in the year 1791, a present of four
                    young cows in calf, two young bulls from Sebojee, and ten ewes and two rams of
                    the Bengal breed, eight she-goats and two rams of the Surat breed, with sows,
                    boars, geese, ducks, hens, and turtle-doves, besides European swords and
                    hardware, arms, and ammunition. In 1791, the captain of the Panther, a Bombay
                    cruizer, was so much pleased <pb break="no" facs="nls:193493440"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0717-3440-0181"/>with the manners of the natives, that he resigned
                    his command, with a view of spending the remainder of his days amongst them. But
                    he soon wearied of being amongst savages, and returned in his pinnace to Macao.
                    Several Europeans have been in the habit of residing here for the purpose of
                    collecting biche de mer, tortoise-shell, and shark fins, for the China market.
                    The Jesuits of Manilla, in the Philippines, endeavoured, in 1696, to reduce
                    these islands, and effected a landing in 1710. But those who landed were never
                    more heard of; and the ship from which they disembarked, after waiting long for
                    them in vain, was at length compelled to depart, and to leave them on the
                    island. Long, between 134. 5. and 134. 40. E. Lat. between 6. 54. and 8. 12.
