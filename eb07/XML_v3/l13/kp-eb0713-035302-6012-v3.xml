                    Scotish poet of high reputation, descended from a younger branch of the family
                    of Lord Lindsay of Byres, was the eldest son of David Lindsay, who possessed the
                    estate of Garmylton in the county of Haddington, and that of the Mount in the
                    county of Fife. The honour of the poet’s birth belongs to Fifeshire,<note

                    preface to the Danish translation of Lindsay’s poems, informs us that he was
                    born in the county of Fife. “Hand vaar födt i Skotland vdi Fyff
                    Stict.”</p></note> but the date has not hitherto been ascertained. It appears
                    that a student of the same name was admitted at St Andrews in the year 1505: if
                    we suppose this to be the same individual, and further suppose him to have been
                    admitted at the age of fifteen, his birth is thus referred to the year 1490.
                    This youth, whoever he may have been, was still a member of the university in
                    1508. Lindsay’s father was then dead, and had left five sons. One of his
                    biographers has sent him, after completing his academical studies, to prosecute
                    his travels through England, France, Italy, and Germany;<note anchored="true"

                    than historical evidence. He himself informs us that he had travelled through
                    divers countries, and he particularly mentions the appearance of the ladies in
                    Italy; but that he had visited those countries in his youth, is neither stated
                    by himself, nor by any early writer with whom we are acquainted. When first
                    employed in the king’s household, he appears to have been still a very young
                    man: in a poem addressed to James the Fifth, he takes occasion to state that he
                    had entered into his majesty’s service on the very day of his nativity, that is,
                    on the 12th of April 1512. In the following year, we find him described as a
                    “special servant” to that prince’s father; whom he attended at Linlithgow when a
                    supposed apparition warned the devoted monarch of his approaching fate.<note

                    first described as usher to the prince, and afterwards, for several successive
                    years, as the king’s master usher. His wife, Janet Douglas, had for many years
                    the charge of the king’s linen.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>The Treasurer’s Accounts contain many notices of Lindsay and
                    his wife. Under the date of 1522, we find the following entry: “Item to Jonet
                    Douglas, spous to Dauid Lindesay, maister ischeare to the king, for sewing of
                    the kingis lvnning claithis, de mandato domini gubernatoris, xxiiij. li.” And
                    under that of 1526; “Item gevin that samyn to Dauid Lyndsays wife to sew the
                    kingis sarkis V dowble hankis gold, 1. s.” She is then mentioned as “Jonet
                    Dowglas, semestair of the kingis lynyng claithis.” In 1537 she still had the
                    charge of “the kingis sarkis;” for under that date occurs the subsequent “Item,
                    to Jonet Douglas, the spous of Dauid Lindesay of the Month, at the kingis grace
                    command, as the precept beris, xl. li.”</p></note> In the dedication of his
                    Dreme, he reminds James of the faithful services which he had rendered him in
                    the tender years of his infancy; and in the “Complaynt directit to the Kingis
                    Grace,” he prosecutes the same topics.</p>
                <p>Lindsay was afterwards dismissed from his office; and this event is supposed to
                    have taken place in the year 1524, when the earl of Angus, who had married the
                    queen dowager, regained his influence at court, and introduced such changes as
                    were most conducive to his private views. His former services were not however
                    forgotten, for he acknowledges that his pension continued to be regularly <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193206025" xml:id="kp-eb0713-6025-0354"/> paid. Not
                    satisfied with such a remuneration, be took occasion to bring his own merits
                    under the king’s review, and to acquaint him with his disposition to accept of
                    any better preferment. In the Complaynt to which we have already referred, he
                    contrived to convey a hint how a peerage might be very suitably bestowed. It is
                    therefore sufficiently evident that this poet was not deaf to the calls of
                    ambition, and that any addition to his rank or fortune would have been very
                    acceptable. As he seems to have inherited a competent estate, and was not
                    burdened with the maintenance of a numerous family, it is not easy to feel any
                    deep sympathy for his disappointments and mortifications. The wants of a
                    courtier, placed in such circumstances, are of so artificial and factitious a
                    kind, that he must generally be left to bewail his own misfortunes. His
                    remonstrances were not however ineffectual; he at length obtained an office of
                    some dignity and emolument, that of chief herald, quaintly denominated lion king
                    at arms. He afterwards received the honour of knighthood. In his new capacity,
                    he was connected with various embassies. In the year 1531, he was employed in a
                    mission to the emperor Charles the Fifth, whom he found residing at Brussels:
                    this mission had a reference to the commercial intercourse between Scotland and
                    the Netherlands. When the king afterwards became anxious to find a suitable
                    consort, Lindsay repeatedly visited the continent: in 1535 he was connected with
                    one embassy, which solicited a princess of the imperial family, and in the
                    ensuing year with another, which solicited a daughter of the duke of Vendôme;
                    but neither of those negotiations was followed by a treaty of marriage. The
                    young and handsome prince next repaired to France as the bearer of his own
                    proposals; and having soon attracted the warm regard of the king’s daughter
                    Magdalene, he married this sickly princess, who died within forty days after her
                    arrival in Scotland.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The

                    and on this melancholy event Lindsay composed a poem entitled “The Deploratioun
                    of the Deith of Quene Magdalene.” She died on the seventh of July 1537, and
                    after an interval of eleven months James received another wife from the same
                    country.</p>
                <p>The reformation was now advancing with gradual steps; and Sir David Lindsay may
                    certainly be classed among those who contributed to accelerate its progress: his
                    writings tended to prepare the public mind for a systematic attempt to overthrow
                    the papal superstition, and to introduce a more pure and rational form of
                    worship. *A species of devotion which rather engages the senses than the
                    understanding, and which substitutes unmeaning observances for the vital power
                    of religion, must always be regarded as having proceeded through a pollutèd
                    channel. But the lives of the ecclesiastics were not less exposed to
                    animadversion than their creed; nor was Lindsay destitute of skill in selecting
                    proper topics of ridicule. His satire, and particularly his dramatic satire,
                    must have had no inconsiderable effect in fostering the rising spirit of
                    contempt for the clergy and their doctrines; and the papists were long disposed
                    to number him among their most formidable enemies.<note anchored="true"

                    was his ridicule entirely confined to his compositions. The king being one day
                    surrounded by a numerous train of nobility and prelates, Lindsay declared
                    himself a candidate for an office that had lately become vacant. “I have,” said
                    be, “servit your grace lang, and luik to be rewardit as others are; and now your
                    maister taylor, at the pleasure of God, is departit; wherefore I wald desire of
                    your grace to bestow this little benefite upon me.” The king replied that he was
                    amazed at such an application from a person who could neither shape nor sew.
                    “Sir,” rejoined the poet, “that maks nae matter; for you have given bishoprics
                    and benefices to mony standing here about you, and yet they can nouther teach
                    nor preach; and why may not I as weill be your taylor, tbocht I can nouther
                    shape nor sew, seeing teaching and preaching are nae less requisite to their
                    vocation than shaping and sewing to ane taylor.” James immediately perceived the
                    object of his application, and did not scruple to amuse himself at the expense
                    of the indignant prelates.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                <p>Of the king he always speaks in terms of affection, though his admonitions are
                    sometimes not very ceremonious. He was one of the few courtiers who witnessed
                    the melancholy termination of his short career: oppressed by that sickness of
                    heart which arises from a consciousness of fatal misconduct, James expired in
                    the royal palace of Falkland on the 14th of December 1542, when he had only
                    attained the thirty-first year of bis age. The earl of Arran was soon afterwards
                    appointed regent of the kingdom; and Lindsay is enumerated among those who
                    adhered to him while he continued to act in conformity to the principles which
                    they avowed. He was a member of parliament for the borough of Cupar in 1543, and
                    the three succeeding years; and in 1544 he was again sent on an embassy to the
                    emperor, for the purpose of delivering into his hands the insignia and statutes
                    of the order of the Golden Fleece, which had been conferred on the late king.

                    Copenhagen, but at St Andrews by John Scott. John Machabaeus, whose family name
                    was Macalpine, was driven from Scotland by the persecution (Knox, p. 20.), and
                    having sought refuge in Germany, he prosecuted his studies at Wittemberg and
                    Cologne. At the suggestion of Melanchthon he adopted the name of Machabaeus
                    AÌpinas. He took the degree of B.D. at Cologne; and on being appointed professor
                    of divinity at Copenhagen in 1542, he took the degree of D. D. Here he died in

                <p>Sir David Lindsay had decidedly espoused the cause of the reformers before they
                    had become very formidable to the government; and it may perhaps be considered
                    as remarkable that he escaped every species of persecution. In the year 1546,
                    Cardinal Beaton, a prelate whose glaring vices were redeemed by very few
                    virtues, was murdered in his own castle by a band of conspirators, who were
                    partly instigated by private animosity, partly by public spirit, and who must
                    all have been accustomed to contemplate without compunction this desperate
                    method of inflicting punishment or perpetrating revenge. They were possessed of
                    sufficient resources to garrison the castle of St Andrews, and to defend it
                    against the royal forces for the space of fourteen months. To this strong hold
                    John Knox repaired at Easter 1547; and at a conference which was there held,
                    Lindsay was one of those who recommended the ordination of this distinguished
                    individual,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Knox’s

                    penetration had doubtless discovered that energy of mind which qualified him for
                    the arduous task that he was destined to perform.</p>
                <p>The period of Lindsay’s decease has not been ascertained. On the 17th of January
                    1555 we find him holding a chapter of heralds, for the purpose of investigating
                    certain charges against a messenger-at-arms. He appears, according to one
                    account, to have died between this period and the year 1558. As he died without
                    issue, his estates descended to his brother Alexander; and they have long ceased
                    to be inherited by the family of Lindsay.</p>
                <p>Beside his poetical works, the chief foundation of his fame, he composed several
                    others of less general interest. The nature of his office directed his attention
                    to a species of knowledge which human folly has dignified with the name of
                    science; and on the subject of heraldry he has left two different productions,

                    Lindsay, the knight of the Mount, and other individuals, as those from whom he
                    had derived private information. Dr Leyden supposes Lindsay to be the author of

                    was in a great measure neglected in England. An English critic of unquestionable
                    taste has remarked that “the interval between the reigns of Henry V. and Henry
                    VIII. which comprehends near a century, although uncommonly rich in Scotch poets
                    of distinguished excellence, does not furnish us with a single name among the
                    natives of England deserving of much notice.’'<note anchored="true"

                    produced only obscure versifiers, Scotland could boast of King James, Henry the
                    Minstrel, Henryson, Dunbar, Douglas, Lindsay, and various other writers of
                    genius. Sir David Lindsay has written so many verses that they cannot always be
                    expected to reach a very high standard: his works indeed exhibit considerable
                    inequalities; but where they are not distinguished by any superior force of
                    imagination, they are often entertaining by their strokes of humour, or
                    instructive by their views of life and manners. He was evidently a man of sense
                    and observation, with serious impressions of virtue and piety; nor was he
                    destitute of those higher powers of mind which enable a writer to communicate
                    his ideas with effect. He frequently displays no mean vivacity of fancy; and the
                    extensive and continued popularity to which he attained, must have rested on
                    some solid foundation. Many of his poems have a satirical tendency; and the
                    freedom with which he exposes vice, even when it belongs to royalty, has stamped
                    his works with the character of intrepid sincerity. Of the state of society and
                    manners, Lindsay presents us with many curious pictures; and although his
                    delineations are sometimes extremely coarse, they are not on that account to be
                    considered as less faithful. In this respect, his writings possess a peculiar
                    value, and ought to be carefully examined by those who particularly direct their
                    attention to the history of that period. The author’s talents seem to have been
                    cultivated with considerable assiduity: he was much conversant in history and
                    divinity; and his knowledge of Latin writers, ancient as well as modern, was
                    apparently respectable. His acquaintance with Grecian literature may perhaps be
                    called in question: he denominates Hesiod the sovereign poet of Greece; a
                    character which he could scarcely be expected to receive from any person
                    acquainted with the language of Homer. Lindsay’s versification is generally
                    distinguished by its ease and fluency. His style often rises to a considerable
                    degree of elegance, but on many occasions is overloaded with extraneous terms.
                    This vicious taste was indeed too prevalent in both kingdoms: Hoccleve, Lydgate,
                    and other successors of Chaucer, who possessed but a small portion of Chaucer’s
                    genius, endeavoured to render their diction poetical by the easy expedient of
                    garnishing it with affected words, chiefly polysyllables of Latin origin; and
                    the manner in which those words were applied, imparted a vague and tautological
                    character to their most elaborate compositions. Dunbar, Douglas, and Lindsay
                    were all infected with the prevailing taste, and have all exhibited specimens of
                    this vitiated style. “It does not,” says Dr Nott, “occur so frequently in
                    Lindsay as in his contemporaries, because perhaps his subjects were mostly those
                    of common life. Still, as it is to be found in those passages which aspire to
                    elevation of thought, we must conclude him to have considered it the proper
                    language of the higher walks of poetry.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    enumerated by these literary historians. His son Christian Machabaeus, born at
                    VVittemberg in 1541, published several Latin works in prose and verse. His last
                    preferment was a prebend at Lund, where he died in 1598.</p>

                <p>The longest of his poems is entitled “Ane Dialog betwix Experience and ane
                    Courteour, of the miserabill Estait of the Warld.” This poem, which is otherwise
                    described as the Monarchie, is indeed of great length: it is not however, as has
                    sometimes been asserted, a tedious detail of well-known events, but a work
                    replete with various learning, and enlivened by the remarks of an acute and
                    reflecting mind. It appears to have been composed when the author had reached an
                    advanced age, and may therefore be regarded as the result of much reflection on
                    human life. It has been unfaithfully characterized as a meagre compendium of
                    universal history: the poet’s principal object is not to detail events, but, by
                    referring to the great occurrences recorded in sacred and profane history, to
                    illustrate general positions; and notwithstanding the great extent of his work,
                    he can seldom be considered as languid or tedious. A Latin translation of the
                    Monarchie was undertaken by David Carnegie of Aberdeen, who did not however live
                    to complete the task.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    Copenhagen in the year 1591. The process of converting Lindsay’s compositions
                    into this language was somewhat peculiar: they were first translated into Latin
                    prose by Andrew Robertson, and were afterwards translated into Danish verse by

                    Cardinall, and the Deploratioun of Quene Magdalene. Robertson has prefixed a
                    preface, which is chiefly derived from that of Charteris; and he has adopted the
                    Scotish printer’s Adhortatioun, with some slight adaptations to the Danish
                    public. From the peculiar process followed in this translation, we can scarcely
                    expect it to be uniformly correct. Charteris, in his preface, mentions the
                    execution of “the vicar of Dolour, Freir Kelour,” and others. Friar Kelour was
                    no doubt translated by Robertson <hi rend="italic">Frater</hi> Kelour; Mattssön
                    has translated it “hans Broder Kelour,” and thus we have the vicar of Dollar and

                    studies in the university of Copenhagen. He is the author of some Latin poems,
                    which have escaped the notice of Nyerup. (Al-nιendeligt Litteraturlexico for

                <p>Lindsay’s Dreme, which is supposed to be his earliest, has likewise been regarded
                    as his most poetical composition. In the opinion of Warton, the prologue to this
                    poem evinces strong talents for high description and rich imagery. His
                    Compìaynt, which is likewise addressed to the king, is a valuable and
                    interesting production: it exhibits some lively sketches of the author’s
                    personal fortunes, of the prevalent manners of the times, and of the early
                    history of James the Fifth. The mode in which the tender age of this hopeful
                    prince was corrupted by the designing profligacy of his attendants, is painted
                    in striking colours; and although the information is conveyed in rhyme, it seems
                    to be nearly allied to historical accuracy. James was possessed of superior
                    talents, and of a disposition capable of receiving a virtuous direction; but his
                    education was interrupted at a critical period, and he was early initiated in
                    vice by those who by every tie of decency were bound to inculcate the lessons of
                    virtue. The king was himself a lover of poetry, and his court was frequented by
                    poets: Lindsay and Bellenden belonged to the royal household; and he had
                    sufficient discernment to appoint Buchanan the tutor of one of his natural sons.
                    From Lindsay’s “Answer to the Kingis Flyting,” it appears that James was a
                    writer of verses: he begins by stating that he had read his majesty’s <hi
                    rend="italic">ragment,</hi> and proceeds to compliment him on his “ornate
                    meter,”-proclaiming him the prince of poetry.</p>
                <p>The “Supplication directit to the Kingis Grace, in con-temptioun of side
                    Taillis,” is at least conspicuous for the author’s zeal as a reformer of
                    manners. He seems to have contemplated long trains and veiled faces with an
                    unnecessary degree of alarm; but, like a good Christian, he recollected that a
                    long train proceeds from pride, and pride from the devil. He is chiefly
                    scandalized at observing nuns and other religious persons followed by
                    train-bearers. Nor is he less offended with the “muzzled faces” of the ladies.
                    The queen is the only female whom he proposes to exempt from the necessity of
                    shewing her face and curtailing her gown. Kitteis Confession, another of his
                    satirical poems, contains many happy strokes of humour. It is directed against
                    auricular confession, a copious source of priestly influence; and the practice
                    is exposed with equal pungency and good sense. The damsel remarks that her
                    ghostly instructor gave her no injunctions to lead a holy life, and to confide
                    in the merits of Christ, but only to follow certain external observances, of
                    which she ventures to doubt the efficacy:</p>
                <p>Botgave me pennance ilk ane day, And Ave Marie for to say, And frydayis fyve na
                    fische to eit— Bot butter and eggis ar better meit; And with ane plak to by ane
                    messe Fra drunkin Schir Jhone Latynlesse.</p>
                <p>The sanctified lasciviousness of the father confessor is. depicted with no
                    unskilful pencil. But the impurities of the Romish church were exposed to a more
                    formidable attack, in “The Testament and Compiaynt of our So-verane Lordis
                    Papingo;” a singular performance, in which he admonishes the king and his
                    courtiers, and exposes the corrupt doctrines and vicious lives of the clergy.
                    “In the course of the poem before us,” says Mr Warton, “an allegory on the
                    corruptions of the church is introduced, not destitute of invention, humour, and
                    elegance; but founded on one of the weak theories of Wickliffe, who, not
                    considering religion as reduced to a civil establishment, and because Christ and
                    his apostles were poor, imagined that secular possessions were inconsistent with
                    the simplicity of the gospel.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    149.</p></note> But if we recollect what precious fruits both Wycliffe and
                    Lindsay had seen produced by this civil establishment of religion, it is by no
                    means wonderful that they should have adopted such a theory. The clergy enjoyed
                    a very large proportion of the wealth of both kingdoms, and they doubtless
                    exhibited different degrees of piety and learning; but it cannot be denied that
                    their profligacy bore some proportion to their opulence, and that true and vital
                    religion, that religion which affects the heart and influences the conduct, was
                    in a great measure supplanted by idle and unavailing ceremonies. In the Tragédie
                    of the Cardinall, this zealous reformer still prosecutes the same design. The
                    plan of the poem <pb break="no" facs="nls:193206064"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0713-6064-0357"/>bears some resemblance to that which was
                    afterwards adopted in the Myrrour for Magistrates. As the author, after the hour
                    of prime, is sitting in his oratory and reading the work of Boccaccio <hi

                    to commit his tragic story to writing; and on his assenting to this proposal,
                    the woe-begone cardinal begins a relation of the principal events of his wicked
                    life; but the story is not told with much elegance or energy.</p>
                <p>Lindsay has evinced his humour and good sense in ridiculing practices of another
                    kind. One of the most barbarous usages connected with chivalry was the
                    exhibition of tournaments, in which it frequently happened that the valiant
                    knights displayed their courage and address at the expense of their lives; and
                    the ladies of the middle ages attended these spectacles with nearly as little
                    compunction as the ladies of the present age attend the representation of a
                    tragedy at Drury Lane. It was however during the decline of chivalry that
                    Lindsay produced his facetious account of “The Justing betwix Watsoun and
                    Barbour.” He represents this justing to have taken place at St Andrews between
                    two gentlemen of the king’s household: they are both described as adepts in
                    physic; and as envy is apt to arise among those who follow the same calling, the
                    subject of the poem was probably suggested by the feuds and jealousies which
                    subsisted between these gentle leeches.</p>
                <p>One of the author’s most entertaining works is the Historie of Squyer Meldrum,
                    which is to be considered as a tale of chivalry, although the champion and the
                    poet flourished at the same period. Lindsay professes to have derived some part
                    of his information from the hero of his story; and the romantic adventures of
                    William Meldrum were yet fresh in the recollection of his countrymen. By
                    assimilating him to the heroes of classical antiquity and of more recent
                    romance, he has imparted to his work a certain air of fiction. With the romantic
                    he has occasionally blended a sufficient mixture of the ludicrous. It is
                    nevertheless to be presumed that much of his narrative is substantially true;
                    and some parts of it can be verified from other authorities. After the exploits
                    of his youth, the heroic squire fixed his residence in Fife, where he possessed
                    an estate, and was appointed the deputy of Patrick Lord Lindsay, sheriff of that
                    county. Here he is said to have administered justice in an exemplary manner, and
                    to have dispensed physic as well as law to the poor. The desperate wounds which
                    he himself had received directed his attention to the healing art; and as ardour
                    was the essence of his character, he seems to have engaged in this new pursuit
                    with his wonted enthusiasm. It is therefore evident that the squire was a person
                    of a very singular character, and his exploits have furnished his friend, the
                    knight of the Mount, with materials for a long and entertaining poem. In the
                    course of his adventures, Meldrum arrives at a castle in Stratherne, and falls
                    in love with its beautiful! owner, a young widow, who had been married to his
                    own relation, apparently a cousin. Being conducted to his bedchamber, he
                    continues to meditate on her charms, and at length begins to vent his passion in
                    loud ejaculations: from her own apartment the lady overhears this soliloquy of
                    her heroic guest, and speedily arrives at the conclusion that such ardent love
                    ought to be duly requited. We learn from Lindsay of Pitscottie that she bore him
                    two children, and their marriage was only deferred till they should obtain a
                    dispensation from the pope; for her deceased husband was related to the squire
                    within the prohibited degrees.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>In the civil law there were various fluctuations with
                    respect to the marriages of cousins-german; and the reader, who is desirous of
                    prosecuting such researches, will find ample information in the dissertation of
                    Gothofredus, De Nuptiis Consobrinorum, subjoined tohis edition of Philostorgii
                    Historia Ecclesiastica, Genevae, 1G43, 4to, and in Otto’s Dissertationes Juris
                    Publici et Privati, p. 79. Traj. ad Rhen. 1723, 4to. The law of Justinian stood
                    thus: “Duorum autem fratrum vel sororum liberi, vel fratris et sororis, jungi
                    possunt.” (Inst. lib. i. tit. 10. § 4.) The canon law has adopted a different
                    doctrine: prohibitions introduce the necessity of dispensations; dispensations
                    increase the influence and the emoluments of the church. It even prohibits the
                    marriage of third-cousins; and, as we have seen in the case of Squire Meldrum,
                    extends its rule to affinity as well as consanguinity. To this discrepancy
                    between the civil and the canon law, as Dr Wood has suggested, we may trace the
                    origin of a vulgar notion, still prevalent in this kingdom, that first-cousins
                    may marry, but second-cousins may not. (Institute of the Civil Law, p. 47.) In
                    computing the degrees of consanguinity in the transverse line, the civil and the
                    canon law follow very different methods. The rule of the civil law is, that
                    there are as many degrees as persons, exclusively of the common stock; that of
                    the canon law, that degrees of consanguinity are to be reckoned by the number of
                    descents in one line; and where the lines are unequal, the canonist takes the
                    longer of the two. The canon law prohibits marriages in the fourth, the civil
                    law permits them in the same degree; or, in other words, the one law prohibits
                    the marriages of third-cousins, and the other permits the marriages of
                    first-cousins. It may not be superfluous to mention that the earlier'canonists
                    differed from each other in one point: “Alii namque patrem in primo gradu,
                    filios in secundo ponunt. Alii primum gradum filios appellant.” (Decretum, p. 2.
                    c. 35. qn. 2 &amp; 3. § 21.) But the decision of pope Alexander the Second, that
                    two degrees in the civil law make one in the canon law, has been generally
                    adopted by later writers. “Qui tamen parens,” says Canisius, “graduni non
                    efficit, sed ipsius filius et filia primum gradum constituunt; et ex his filius
                    et filia secundum gradum.” (Sumina Juris Canonici, lib. ii. tit. xii. § 9.) This
                    decision is however overlooked by Dr Taylor, who describes first-cousins as
                    standing in the third degree of consanguinity, according to the computation of
                    the canon law. (Elements of the Civil Law, p. 331.)</p></note> It does not
                    however appear that the dispensation was ever obtained; and in the mean time “a
                    gentleman called Luke Stirling, envied this love and marriage betwixt thir two
                    persons, thinking to have the gentlewoman to himself in marriage, because he
                    knew the laird might not have the pope’s licence by the laws: therefore he
                    solisted his brother’s son, the laird of Keir, with a certain company of armed
                    men, to set upon the laird of Binns, to take this lady from him by way of deed;
                    and, to that effect, followed him betwixt Leith and Edinburgh, and set on him
                    beneath the Rood chapel with fifty armed men; and he again defended him -with
                    five in number, and fought cruelly with them, and slew the laird of Keir’s
                    principal servant before his face, defending himself, and hurt the laird, that
                    he was in peril of his life, and twenty-six of his men hurt and slain; yet,
                    through multiplication of his enemies, he was overset and driven to the earth,
                    and left lying for dead, bought of his legs, and stricken through the body, and
                    the knops of his elbows stricken from him. Yet, by the mighty power of God, he
                    escaped the death, and all his men that were with him, and lived fifty years
                    thereafter.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Lindsay’s
                    Hist, of Scotland, p. 129. Edinb. 1723, fol—This fair lady was “called the Lady

                    before and he were sib.”</p></note></p>
                <p>But the most remarkable of Lindsay’s productions still remains unnoticed; namely,
                    his “Satyre of the thrie Estaits, in commendation of vertew and vituperation of
                    vyce.” Of the genuine Scotish drama this is the earliest specimen that is now to
                    be found. It does not appear that he was the author of any other work of this
                    description, though it is probable that the same play was somewhat modified for
                    different representations. This play is said to have been acted at Cupar in the
                    year 1535; and it appears to have <pb break="no" facs="nls:193206077"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0713-6077-0358"/>been acted before the king and his court at
                    Linlithgowin the year 1539. It was likewise “playit beside Edinburgh, in
                    presence of the quene regent and ane greit part of the nobilitie, with ane
                    exceiding greit nowmer of pepill, lestand fra nyne houris afoir none, till six
                    houris at euin.” Spectators who retain their places for the space of nine hours,
                    must certainly meet with no slight degree of entertainment; but it appears from
                    one of the stage-directions that the play was divided into two parts, and that
                    they had thus an opportunity of taking some refreshment during a short pause in
                    the representation. Lindsay’s Satyre of the thrie Estaits is a morality,
                    containing a mixture of real and allegorical characters, and cannot therefore be
                    expected to exhibit a succession of very probable incidents. It however exhibits
                    some curious germs of the dramatic art; and in reference to those to whom it was
                    originally addressed, it must be regarded as a powerful satire. The principal
                    burden of his satire falls upon the ecclesiastics. It contains an extraordinary
                    mixture of piety and obscenity; and without approaching to the model of a
                    regular drama, it furnishes many unequivocal proofs of the author’s ingenuity.
                    As a dramatic composition, it is not necessary to specify its defects, which are
                    indeed sufficiently obvious: Lindsay must however be compared, not with the
                    poets of a later age, but with those of his own; the contemporary history of
                    English poetry presents to us no dramatic work equal to the Satyre of the thrie
                    Estaits. Of this play there is an appendage, apparently written by the same
                    author, which yet remains to be noticed: it is entitled the “Proclamatioun of
                    the Play, maid be Dauid Lindsay.” This proclamation is itself a dramatic
                    entertainment, consisting of a few pages, and intended to announce that the play
                    was to be acted on the castle-hill of Cupar on a particular day. Newspapersand
                    play· bills were not then invented; and this was evidently a device for
                    collecting a crowd of people on the market-day, in order to disperse the
                    intelligence.</p>
                <p>Sir David Lindsay has now maintained his popularity for the space of three
                    hundred years, and his works have been printed in a great variety of forms. The
                    last edition, which makes very extraordinary pretensions to general erudition
                    and to particular accuracy, was published by Mr George Chalmers. Lond. 1806, 3
                    vols. 8vo. The editor displays a modesty of disposition and an elegance of
                    taste, which are only surpassed by the suavity of his manner and the profundity
                    of his learning. All these topics might afford scope for illustration, but we
                    shall at present confine ourselves to the subject of his erudition, which has
                    been highly extolled by writers nearly as learned as himself. The following line
                    occurs in Ketteis Confession.</p>
                <p>Thocht Codrus kyte suld cleue and birst.</p>
                <p>“I know not,” says the accomplished editor, “if there be any allusion here to
                    either of the Codruses, who are feigned by poets: Lindsay may have alluded to
                    Urceus Codrus, an Italian professor, and poet, of a singular character, who
                    died, in 1500.” Vol. ii. p. 214. But if his classical studies had ever proceeded
                    so far as the seventh eclogue of Virgil, he would have had no difficulty in
                    discovering to which “of the Codruses” the poet alludes.</p>
                <p>Pastores, hedera crescentem ornate poetam, Arcades, invidia rumpantur ut ilia
                    Codro.</p>
                <p>In vol. i. p. 81. we find the subsequent remarks: “Coeburn’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Meditatio</hi> was printed at St Andrews, by Jhone Scot, in 1555. He calls
                    himself Johannis Scot, in the titlepage, and Johannes Scott, in the colophon.”
                    This change from <hi rend="italic">Johannis</hi> to <hi rend="italic"
                    >Johannes</hi> we can undertake to explain: the title bears “ex typographia
                    Johannis Scot,” and the colophon, “excudebat Joannes Scott.” The numerous works
                    of this writer betray such a radical ignorance of the Latin language, that we
                    have no doubt of his intending to express his surprise at the variation of the
                    genitive from the nominative case. In another publication, he enumerates
                    “Cicero’s Epistles de Senectute, de Amicitio; Terence’s Comedies and Elegies;
                    Ovid’s Tristium.” After meeting with these specimens of his scholarship, we are
                    sufficiently prepared for his commentary on another passage of Lindsay, which
                    alludes to the pretensions of the pope.</p>
                <p>His style at lenth gif thow wald knaw, Thow moste ga luke the cannon law: Baith
                    in the Sext and Clementene His staitlie style thair may be sene.</p>
                <p><hi rend="superscript"> u</hi> The allusion,” he is pleased to inform his
                    readers, “is to the Works of Pomponius Sextus, the great jurist of the 3d
                    century.” Vol. iii. p. 89. Pomponius did not flourish in the third, but in the
                    second century: if however he had actually written in the third century, how
                    could he have illustrated the temporal power and splendour of the pope, before
                    Christianity was established in the Roman empire? The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Sext</hi> to which Lindsay alludes is “Liber <hi rend="italic">sextus</hi>
                    Decretalium,” a portion of the <hi rend="italic">Corpus Juris</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Canonici.</hi> See above, vol. vi. p. 94. A further specimen of
                    this editor’s acquaintance with literary and ecclesiastical history occurs in
                    the following passage: “We may infer, that the Calvinists were not yet known, as
                    a sect.” Vol. i. p. 425. Certainly we may infer that the Calvinists were utterly
                    unknown as a sect in 1535, inasmuch as Calvin, the founder of that sect, did not
                    become a minister and professor at Geneva till the ensuing year.<note
