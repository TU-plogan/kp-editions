                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                <p><label type="entry">LOLLARDS</label>, in <hi rend="italic">Ecclesiastical
                    History,</hi> a religious sect, which arose in Germany about the beginning of
                    the fourteenth century, and was so called, as many writers have thought, from
                    Walter Lollard, who began to dogmatize in 1315, and was afterwards burned at'
                    Cologne; though others think that Lollard was no surname, but merely a term of
                    reproach applied to all heretics who concealed the poison of error under the
                    appearance of piety.</p>
                <p>The monk of Canterbury derives the origin of the word Lollard amongst us, from
                    <hi rend="italic">lolium,</hi> a tare; as if the Lollards were the tares sown in
                    Christ’s vineyard. Abelly says that the word Lollard signifies praising God,
                    from the German <hi rend="italic">loben,</hi> to praise, and <hi rend="italic"
                    >herr,</hi> Lord; because the Lollards employed themselves in travelling about
                    from place to place, singing psalms and hymns. Others, again, derive <hi
                    rend="italic">lollhard, lullhard,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">lollert,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">lullert,</hi> as it was written by the ancient Germans, from the
                    old German word <hi rend="italic">lullen,</hi><hi rend="italic">lollen,</hi> or
                    <hi rend="italic">lallen,</hi> and the termination <hi rend="italic">hard,</hi>
                    with which many of the Dutch words end. <hi rend="italic">Lallen</hi> signifies
                    to sing with a low voice, and therefore Lollard is a singer, or one who
                    frequently sings; and in the vulgar tongue of the Germans it denotes a person
                    who is continually praising God with a song, or singing hymns in his praise. The
                    Alexians or Cellites were called <hi rend="italic">Lollards,</hi> because they
                    were public singers, who made it their business to inter the bodies of those who
                    died of the plague, and sang a dirge over them in a mournful and indistinct tone
                    as they carried them to the grave. The name was afterwards assumed by persons
                    who dishonoured it; for we find that, amongst those Lollards who made
                    extraordinary pretences to piety and religion, and spent the greater part of
                    their time in meditation, prayer, and such acts of piety, there were many
                    abominable hypocrites, who entertained the most ridiculous opinions, and
                    concealed the most enormous vices under the specious mark of this extraordinary
                    profession.</p>
                <p>Many injurious aspersions were propagated by the priests and monks against those
                    who assumed this name; so that, by degrees, any person who covered heresy or
                    crime under the appearance of piety was called a <hi rend="italic">Lollard.</hi>
                    Thus the name was used not to denote any one particular sect, but was formerly
                    common to all persons and all sects who were supposed to be guilty of impiety
                    towards God or the church, under an external profession of extraordinary piety.
                    However, many societies, consisting both of men and women, under the
                    denomination of <hi rend="italic">Lollards,</hi> were formed in most parts of
                    Germany and Flanders, and were supported partly by their manual labours, and
                    partly by the charitable donations of pious persons. The magistrates and
                    inhabitants of the towns where these brethren and sisters resided, gave them
                    particular marks of favour and protection, on account of their great usefulness
                    to the sick and needy. They were thus supported against their malignant rivals,
                    and obtained many papal constitutions, by which their institute was confirmed,
                    their persons exempted from the cognizance of the inquisitors, and subjected
                    entirely to the jnrisdiction of the bishops; but as these measures were
                    insufficient to secure them from molestation, Charles duke of Burgundy, in the
                    year 1472, obtained a solemn bull from Sixtus IV. ordaining that the Cellites or
                    Lollards should be ranked amongst the religious orders, and delivered from the
                    jurisdiction of the bishops; and in the year 1506 Julius II. granted them still
                    greater privileges. Mosheim informs us that many societies of this kind still
                    subsisted at Cologne, and in the cities of Flanders, though they had evidently
                    departed from their ancient rules.</p>
                <p>Lollard and his followers rejected the sacrifice of the mass, extreme unction,
                    and penances for sin; arguing that Christ’s sufferings were all-sufficient. He
                    is likewise said to have set aside baptism, as a thing of no effect; and
                    repentance, as not absolutely necessary.. In England, the followers of Wickliffe
                    were by way of reproach called Lollards, from the affinity there existed between
                    some of their tenets and those of that sect; though others are of opinion that
                    the English Lollards came from Germany.’ The Lollards were solemnly condemned by
                    the archbishop of Canterbury and the council of Oxford.</p>
