                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">LICTORS</label>, amongst the Romans, were officers
                    established by Romulus, who always attended the chief magistrates when they
                    appeared in public. The duty of their office consisted of three parts: 1. <hi
                    rend="italic">Suhmotiο,</hi> or clearing the way for the magistrate they
                    attended. This they did by word of mouth; or, if there was occasion, by using
                    the rods they always carried along with them. 2. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Animadversio,</hi> or causing the people to pay the usual respect to the
                    magistrate, as to alight, if on horseback or in a chariot; to rise up, uncover,
                    make way, and the like. 3. <hi rend="italic">Proeitio,</hi> or walking before
                    the magistrates. This they did not confusedly, or altogether, nor by two or
                    three abreast, but singly, following one another in a straight line. They also
                    preceded the triumphal car in public triumphs; and it was a further part of
                    their office to arrest criminals, and to act as public executioners. Their
                    ensigns were the <hi rend="italic">fasces</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >securis.</hi> As to the number of lictors allowed each magistrate, a dictator
                    had twenty-four, a master of the horse six, a consul twelve, a praetor six; and
                    each vestal virgin, when she appeared abroad, had one.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">liddel, Duncan,</hi> professor of mathematics and of
                    medicine in the university of Helmstadt, was born in the year 1561, at Aberdeen,
                    where he received the elementary part of his education in languages and
                    philosophy. About the age of eighteen he repaired to the University of
                    Frankfort, where he spent three years in a diligent application to the
                    mathematics and to philosophy. From Frankfort he proceeded to WTatislau or
                    Breslau in Silesia, where he is said to have made uncommon progress in his
                    favourite study of mathematics, under the direction of a very eminent professor,
                    Paulus Wittichius. Having studied at Breslau for the space of one year, he
                    returned to Frankfort, and remained there for three years, giving the most
                    intense application to the study of physic. A contagious distemper having broken
                    out at that place, the students were dispersed, and Liddel retired to the
                    university of Rostock. Here he renewed his studies, rather as a companion than
                    as a pupil of the celebrated Brucaeus, who, though an excellent mathematician,
                    did not scruple to confess that he was instructed by Liddel in the more perfect
                    knowledge of the Copernican system, and other astronomical questions. In 1590 he
                    returned once more to Frankfort; but having there heard of the increasing
                    reputation of the Academia Julia, established at Helmstadt by Henry duke of
                    Brunswick, Mr Liddel removed thither; and soon after his arrival was appointed
                    to the first or lower professorship of mathematics. From this, however, he was
                    promoted to the second and more dignified mathematical chair, which he occupied
                    for nine years, with much credit to himself and to the Julian Academy. In 1596,
                    he obtained his degree in physic, was admitted a member of the faculty, and
                    began publicly to teach physic. By his teaching and his writings he was the
                    chief support of the medical school at Helmstadt, was employed as first
                    physician at the Court of Brunswick, and had much practice among the principal
                    inhabitants of that country. Having been several times elected dean of the
                    faculties both of philosophy and physic, he had in the year 1600 the honour of
                    being chosen protector of the university. But neither academical honours, nor
                    the profits of an extensive practice abroad, could make Dr Liddel forget his
                    native country. In the year 1604 he took a final leave of the Academia Julia;
                    and after travelling for some time through Germany and Italy, he at length
                    settled in Scotland, where he died in the year 1613, in the fifty-second year of
                    his age. By his last will he bestowed certain lands purchased by him near
                    Aberdeen upon the university there, for the education and support of six poor
                    scholars. Amongst a variety of regulations and injunctions for the management of
                    this charity, he appointed the magistrates of Aberdeen his trustees, and
                    solemnly denounced the curse of God against any person who should abuse or
                    misapply it. His works are, 1. <hi rend="italic">Disputationes Medicinales,</hi>
                    Helmstadt, 1603, 4to; 2. <hi rend="italic">Ars Medica succincte</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">et</hi><hi rend="italic">perspicue explicata,</hi> Hamburg, 1607,
                    8vo, dedicated to James VI. and divided into five books, viz. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Introductio</hi><hi rend="italic">in</hi><hi rend="italic">totam
                    Medicinam,</hi><hi rend="italic">de</hi><hi rend="italic">Physiologia,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">de</hi><hi rend="italic">Pathologia, de Signorum Doctrina, de
                    Therapeutica;</hi> 3. <hi rend="italic">De Febribus Libri tres,</hi> Hamburg,
                    1610, 12mo; 4. <hi rend="italic">Tractatus de Dente Aur</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >co,</hi> Hamburg, 1628, 12mo. This last production Dr Liddel published, in
                    order to refute a ridiculous story then current, of a poor boy in Silesia, who,
                    at seven years of age, having lost some of his teeth, produced a new tooth of
                    pure gold. The imposture was discovered to be a thin plate of gold, skilfully
                    drawn over the natural tooth by an artist of that country, with a view to excite
                    the public admiration and charity. He was also the author of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Artis</hi><hi rend="italic">Conservandi Sanitatem Libri</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >duo,</hi> Aberdeen, 1651, 12mo; a posthumous work.</p>
