                <p><label type="entry">LANCASHIRE</label>, a great commercial and manfacturing
                    county in the north-west of England. This district, which is situated between
                    long. 2. 18. and 3. 7. W., and lat. 53. 23. and 54. 24. N., has Cumberland and
                    Westmoreland on the north-east and north, Yorkshire on the east, Cheshire on the
                    south, and the Irish Sea on the west. Its extreme length is about seventy-four
                    miles, and its greatest breadth forty-four and a half; but the boundaries being
                    very irregular, its outline is about 342 miles, which comprehends an area of
                    1765 square miles, or 1,129,600 acres. Lancashire forms part of the northern
                    circuit, is situated within the province of York and diocese of Chester, and is
                    divided into sixty-one parishes. The other divisions are hundreds, of which
                    there are six, namely, Lonsdale on the north; Amounderness, Blackburn, and
                    Leyland, in the middle; and Salford and West Derby on the south. Most of these
                    are again popularly subdivided, according to their relative situation, or the
                    names of their towns.</p>
                <p>The greater part of this county, from Rossall Point on the north, to the Mersey
                    on the south, except where it is indented by the estuary of the Ribble on the
                    west, lies tolerably compact, in the form of an irregular square. To the north
                    of Rossall Point, till it meets the county of Westmoreland, it is very narrow,
                    with a sinuous boundary <pb break="no" facs="nls:193202081"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0713-2081-0052"/>on all sides; and to the north-east there is a
                    considerable tract called Furness, separated from the rest by extensive sands,
                    where the river Ken, from Westmoreland, discharges itself into the Bay of
                    Morecombe. Opposite the south point of Furness is the island of Walney, and
                    other seven, of which the largest is Old Barrow. On the northeast and north much
                    of the surface is occupied with hillsand moors, particularly in Furness, where
                    the highest grounds have the name of <hi rend="italic">Fells</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> and also on the east, where it is bounded by Yorkshire; but
                    the south and west quarters spread out for the most part into low and fertile
                    tracts, though not without being interrupted by pretty large fields of moss.
                    Chat Moss, near Worsley, and Pilling Moss, farther to the north, are the most
                    extensive; but many other, though smaller, tracts occur in various parts. Along
                    the coast there is also a considerable extent of sandy marsh land, particularly
                    towards the north, near Lancaster and Warton, at the estuaries of the Leven and
                    Duddon, in the north-east or Furness district, and about the banks of the island
                    of Walney.</p>
                <p>The climate of Lancashire is chiefly distinguished for its humidity. According to
                    a register kept at Liverpool from 1784 to 1792, the least quantity of rain
                    yearly was twenty-four and an eighth inches in 1788, and the greatest fifty-four
                    and a fourth in 1792. At Lancaster, in the latter year, the quantity of rain was
                    nearly sixty-six inches. Four inches have been known to fall in the course of a
                    night. The mean heat at Lancaster, from 1784 to 1790, was 51° 8'. The prevailing
                    winds are from the south, south-west, and north-east. As fogs are not frequent,
                    nor the stagnant waters of any considerable extent, the climate is not
                    insalubrious.</p>
                <p>The soils of this extensive district are necessarily various. The higher grounds,
                    covered with heath and broken with rocks, have a sterile moorish soil; but
                    towards their base, and in the valleys which they form, it is for the most part
                    of the nature of holme. Loam and clay of various degrees of consistence prevail
                    on the flat grounds, with portions of sand, gravel, and moss; and on the banks
                    of the rivers, and at their estuaries, there are large tracts of an alluvial
                    description. The under stratum of the heathy grounds is sandstone or freestone
                    of different colours; a blue rock, popularly called whinstone, is more common in
                    the fell tracts of Furness. Limestone prevails on the north-west, and towards
                    the eastern boundaries. This and the freestone rock occasionally come in contact
                    with one another in a very remarkable manner, a striking instance of which
                    occurs near the town of Chipping, at the termination of the high ridge of
                    Long-ridge Fell. In some places towards the eastern border, coal approaches so
                    near the surface, as to constitute the substratum of the soil, and may be seen
                    cropping out at Townley Park, and on the rising grounds on both sides. Marl is
                    frequently found below the soil in the low grounds, and also under the mosses.
                    Much of the vale land consists of rich pastures and meadows; what part of it is
                    under tillage is very productive, and in many instances or a quality to yield
                    turnips and other green crops, as well as grain. A strong clayey loam, however,
                    appears to be the predominant soil throughout the low grounds on the south and
                    west, which, with the wetness of the climate, renders cultivation more difficult
                    and hazardous than in many other districts.</p>
                <p>The principal mineral substances are coal, copper, lead, and iron. The first, and
                    in a manufacturing district by far the most important, of these, is in great
                    abundance in several parts of the county. The great coal tract commences below
                    Prescot on the south, and, crossing the county in a north-east direction, passes
                    into Yorkshire; but coal abounds farther to the south-east, near Manchester, and
                    also to the north above Lancaster. Its quality, as well as the thickness of the
                    beds, and the depth at which it is wrought, has considerable diversity; but it
                    is chiefly of a bituminous description. Cannel coal is found near Wigan, and at
                    other places, and sometimes in contact with the black coal, or a little mixed
                    with it, as at the pits near Layton Hall. Copper is met with in the rough barren
                    mountains, towards the northern extremity of the high Furness or Fell district,
                    particularly at Coniston, Muckle Gill, and Hartriggs; but has not been found to
                    the south of Lancaster Sands in such quantities as to be wrought with advantage.
                    Lead occurs towards the north and north-east parts of the county, but in no
                    great quantity. Iron is wrought to the north of Lancaster Sands, in the liberty
                    of Furness. Though found in other quarters, it is not in such abundance, so as
                    to make the working of it profitable. In the northern part of the high Furness
                    tract, quarries of blue slate have been opened. Sandstone is wrought in most
                    parts of the county south of the Sands, and limestone, though it is found also
                    in the Furness district, is most abundant on the Lancaster side. The main tracts
                    of this rock are in the northern divisions above Lancaster, and near Chipping
                    and Clitheroe, towards the borders of Yorkshire. More to the south, that is,
                    throughout the larger and more valuable portion of the county, it occurs but
                    seldom, and not to a great extent.</p>
                <p>Lancashire is naturally well supplied with waters, of which its inhabitants have
                    industriously availed themselves in their manufacturing establishments, and in
                    facilitating the transport of their products of all kinds. The principal rivers
                    are the Mersey, the Irwell, the Ribble, and the Loyne or Lune. The Mersey, after
                    receiving the Etherow and the Goyt from Cheshire, and the Tame from Yorkshire,
                    becomes a large river at the town of Stockport, and, after a winding course
                    between this county and Cheshire, enters the Irish Sea a little below the town
                    of Liverpool. By means of an artificial cut, it has been made navigable for
                    vessels of sixty or seventy tons from Liverpool to the mouth of the Irwell, up
                    which river the navigation is continued to Manchester.</p>
                <p>The Irwell, which has its source amongst the hilly ranges to the south of
                    Haslingden, also receives several streams, and flowing through a part of
                    Manchester, where it is advantageously employed by the different manufactories,
                    especially those of spinning, dyeing, and calico printing, falls into the Mersey
                    a little below Fíixton. The Ribble is a large river, which intersects the county
                    from east to west. It enters Lancashire from Yorkshire, above the town of
                    Clitheroe, and, flowing through the beautiful vale of Ribblesdale, joins the
                    Irish Sea a little below the town of Preston, to which it is navigable for small
                    vessels. The Loyne or Lune, also a large river, has its source in the fells of
                    Westmoreland, and comes into Lancashire a little below Kirkby-Lonsdale, and,
                    passing by the town of Lancaster, afterwards expands into a broad estuary, and
                    empties itself into the Irish Sea, The Alt, the Douglas, the Wyer, the Winster,
                    the Leven, the Crake, and the Dudden, are also considerable streams; and many
                    others, though in a general description not worthy of notice for their size,
                    afford the most important facilities to the manufactories established on their
                    courses. There are several pieces of water in the county, known by the names of
                    lakes, waters, meres, and tarns. Of these the most considerable is Coniston Lake
                    or Thurston Water, and Esthwaite Water, both in Furness. With these may be
                    mentioned the Lake of Windermere, which, though not properly belonging to
                    Lancashire, enters it by its southern point, and forms its boundary for eight or
                    ten miles. Mineral springs have been found at Cartmel, Fluke-borough, Wigan,
                    Latham House, near Ormskirk, and other places.</p>
                <p>Of the canals by which a great part of this county is traversed in almost every
                    direction, it would be difficult to <pb break="no" facs="nls:193202094"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0713-2094-0053"/>give an intelligible description without
                    references to a map, and the limits of this article admit only of noticing them
                    very generally. The great importance of an interior communication by water had
                    been recognised in this quarter a considerable time before any attempt was made
                    to form one entirely artificial. The first object was to render some of the
                    rivers navigable, as in the instance of the Mersey and Irwell, already
                    mentioned, to effect which, acts of parliament were obtained in 1719 and 1720.
                    But the droughts and tides which affect the navigation of these and other rivers
                    have been found to occasion so much inconvenience, that more recently a
                    preference has been given to channels of communication formed wholly by human
                    labour. The first work of this description in Lancashire, and probably in
                    England, was the Sankey Canal, from the Mersey to near St Helen’s, which,
                    including its branches, extends nearly twelve miles. It was finished about sixty
                    years ago. Besides this canal, the county is intersected by nine others, four of
                    which communicate with the populous town of Manchester. Of these we can only
                    notice the more considerable. The Duke of Bridgewater’s Canal, in as far as it
                    belongs to Lancashire, commences in the suburbs of Manchester, and terminates at
                    Pennington, near the town of Leigh. Under the town of Manchester a portion of it
                    passes into arched tunnels, from one of which coals are hoisted up out of the
                    barges below, through a shaft, and delivered into a large coal-yard in the main
                    street. Before it reaches the coal-works at Worsley, it is carried under ground
                    for three quarters of a mile. The Lancaster Canal commences at Kirkby-Kendal in
                    Westmoreland, and terminates at West Houghton, to the eastward of Wigan, after a
                    course of 75^ miles. The principal object in executing this great work was to
                    open a ready communication between the coal and limestone districts, and between
                    the port of Lancaster and the populous towns on the north and south. It is on an
                    average seven feet deep, and is navigable by boats of sixty tons burden. The
                    Leeds and Liverpool Canal is of still greater length. It extends between the
                    towns of Liverpool and Leeds, along a line of 107^ miles, and communicating at
                    the latter place with the Aire, which is navigable to the German Ocean, and at
                    the former with the Mersey, which falls into the Irish Sea; the navigation is
                    thus completed between the eastern and western seas. On this canal flats of
                    forty-two tons are employed in the coal trade between Leeds and Wigan, and
                    passage-boats are in constant use between these towns. The other canals, though
                    works of great importance when each is considered by itself, are much inferior
                    to those we have mentioned.</p>
                <p>A considerable portion of the territory of this county belongs in property to his
                    majesty, as Duke of Lancaster. The greater part of this consists of what is
                    called <hi rend="italic">forest lands,</hi> all of which are situated in the
                    most northern parts. It is held in general on leases for thirty years, and
                    yields but an inconsiderable revenue. A few other estates are also of
                    considerable extent; but, generally speaking, landed property is much
                    subdivided, and hence Lancashire has a greater number of land-owners than any
                    other county in England, Middlesex excepted; many of the estates not affording a
                    rental of L.200 a year, and not a few being below L.50.</p>
                <p>Lancashire does not excel in its agriculture. Only about a fourth of its surface
                    is computed to be under corn and other tillage crops, the other three fourths,
                    subject to a deduction for wastes, roads, &amp;c. being chiefly occupied in
                    grazing and for the purposes of the dairy; and it has been estimated that it
                    does not raise corn sufficient for the support of its population for more than
                    three months in the year. All the different sorts of corn, however, are
                    cultivated, and, where the soil is naturally fertile, the crops are often
                    abundant; but turnips and other ameliorating crops are not in general use, nor
                    always, where grown to some extent, properly attended to. Potatoes, however, are
                    cultivated not only upon a large scale, but with great care and success; this
                    root, with oatmeal, forming the principal food of the working classes. They were
                    introduced into this county from Ireland, and are said to have been cultivated
                    here long before they had found their way into most other parts of England.
                    Lancashire was long noted for its breed of horned cattle, but a variety of other
                    breeds have been introduced, particularly the Holderness, or short-horned, which
                    are preferred to the Lancashire in the milk dairies near the town, and sometimes
                    also in those at some distance, where the principal object is butter. The native
                    breed is the kind more commonly kept for the cheese dairies, farther into the
                    interior. A cow yields, upon an average throughout the year, from eight to
                    twelve quarts of milk daily, or from four to six pounds of butter in the week,
                    or from three to four hundredweight of cheese in the year. A considerable number
                    of good horses are bred and reared, but its sheep stocks are inconsiderable, and
                    seldom of a valuable description. Farms are in general small, and held either on
                    short leases or without any lease at all, so that a tenant has no encouragement
                    to invest capital in the improvement of the soil.</p>
                <p>This district, however, is greatly distinguished by its manufactures and
                    commerce, which afford employment to three fourths of its crowded population. Of
                    the former, that of cotton, which is here conducted in all its branches on the
                    most extensive scale, has long been the most considerable. The town of
                    Manchester, where it seems to have had its origin in England, is still its
                    principal seat, though several of the other towns, such as Preston, Garstang,
                    Blackburn, Clitheroe, Middleton, Burnley, Wigan, Bury, Bolton, and Ashton, have
                    a considerable share of it; and, indeed, it is more or less spread over the
                    greater part of the county. At Ravenhead, near Prescot, plate-glass and mirrors
                    are made to a considerable extent; brass, pewter, and copper works are carried
                    on at Wigan and at St Helen’s; Warrington has manufactures of sail-cloth,
                    linens, and checks, with the making of pins and glass, and iron-founderies; and
                    Rochdale and Ashton furnish a variety of the coarser articles of woollen.</p>
                <p>From the great extent and variety of its manufactures, it is natural to infer
                    that its commerce must be upon a scale proportionally extensive, and it is so.
                    Liverpool, as a commercial town, is now perhaps second only to London; and to
                    this rank it has attained from a very low beginning little more than a century
                    ago. In prosperous times, the enterprise of its merchants exchanges the products
                    of British capital and industry with those of almost every climate; and, at all
                    times, it carries on an extensive commerce with America and the West Indies, and
                    with Ireland; to which has been recently added a large share of the East India
                    trade. The ports of Preston, Poulton, Warrington, Ulverston, and Lancaster, the
                    county town, are chiefly employed in the coasting trade.</p>
                <p>As a considerable portion of the people of Lancashire are employed in working up
                    goods for a foreign market, the condition of the labouring classes, in
                    particular, is much affected by the changes which occur from time to time in
                    that market, and which it is not always possible to anticipate. They are
                    sometimes in the receipt of wages more than sufficient for their comfortable
                    subsistence, and at other times many are thrown out of employment altogether,
                    and the rest retained at wages confessedly inadequate to their support. This is
                    true in an especial manner of its great staple, the cotton manufacture. From
                    this cause, and perhaps also owing to the inconsiderate habits and want of
                    foresight which such fluctuations are apt to engender, the poor-rates of this
                    county amounted, in 1815, to about L.400,000, whereas, forty years before, they
                    were <pb break="no" facs="nls:193202107" xml:id="kp-eb0713-2107-0054"/>little
                    more than L.50,000. Since that period up to the present time (1836), though the
                    whole number of the inhabitants has increased nearly half a million, there has
                    not been a corresponding increase on the assessments for the poor, but, on the
                    contrary, a diminution, nor, except in the year 1832, has the amount quite
                    reached that of 1815 and 1816.</p>
                <p>The whole population of the county, at the three decennial enumerations, has been
                    as follows :—In 1801, 672,731; in 1811, 828,309; in 1821, 1.052,859; and in
                    1831, 1,335,800; thus showing a doubling of the inhabitants in thirty years. The
                    burials, including both the registered and unregistered, appear, between the
                    years 1821 and 1833, to have been one in forty-five of the whole of the number
                    then living. The illegitimate births bear a higher proportion to the whole
                    births than in any other county of England, except Hereford and Shropshire,
                    where, as in this county, they are one in thirteen, whereas in the whole of
                    England they are only one in twenty.</p>
                <p>According to the laborious production of Mr Rickman, the occupation of the people
                    is thus described.</p>

                <p>By the law of 1832, called the reform bill, the borough of Newton, in this
                    county, was disfranchised, and CIitheroe, which had two members, was reduced to
                    one. By the same bill, the towns of Ashton, Bury, Rochdale, Salford, and
                    Warrington, have been created boroughs, with the right of choosing one member
                    each; and Manchester, Bolton, Blackburn, and Oldham, with the right of electing
                    two each.</p>
                <p>The county is formed into two divisions, for the purpose of elections. These are
                    denominated the North, whose pollingplaces are Lancaster, Hawkeshead, Ulverston,
                    Poulton, Preston, and Burnley; and the South, whose polling places are, Newton,
                    Wigan, Manchester, Liverpool, Ormskirk, and Rochdale.</p>
