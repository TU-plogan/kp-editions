                <p><label type="entry">LAWRENCE, <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir Thomas</hi></label>, a
                    celebrated English painter, was born at Bristol, on the 13th of April 1769. His
                    father, who kept an inn, first in Bristol, and afterwards in Devizes, made some
                    pretensions to literary taste, and was in the habit of reciting poetry; an
                    accomplishment which his son acquired at a very early age, as well as that of
                    taking likenesses with striking fidelity. One of the earliest instances recorded
                    of young Lawrence’s genius is to be found in an incident which occurred to Lord
                    and Lady Kenyon, some years previous to the time when the former was elevated to
                    the peerage. Happening to remain for a day at the inn of the elder Lawrence,
                    they were introduced by Boniface to his son, who, he said, “although then only
                    in his fifth year, could recite them poetry or speeches, or take their
                    likenesses.” The visitors agreed that the boy’s skill with the pencil should be
                    put to the test; and the future president having been lifted on the table, and
                    seated in an arm-chair, took their likenesses, with a rapidity, a spirit, and a
                    correctness, which astonished them. With the exception of a few lessons in Latin
                    and French, obtained through a private channel, all the education which young
                    Lawrence received, he acquired between his sixth and eighth year; but his was a
                    mind capable of educating itself, and long ere the young artist attracted public
                    attention, he had treasured up a more than ordinary stock of knowledge. But
                    drawing, particularly taking likenesses, chiefly occupied his attention until he
                    was ten years of age, when he began of his own accord to attempt original
                    compositions of the highest class. The subjects which he chose were of the most
                    ambitious description, such as Peter denying Christ, Haman and Mordecai, and the
                    like. His fame as an artist now spread amongst the fanjilies of distinction in
                    the surrounding counties; and not long afterwards, the Honourable Daines
                    Barrington noticed him in his <hi rend="italic">Miscellanies,</hi> as a striking
                    instance “of early genius in children.” The elder Lawrence having failed in
                    business, removed to Bath, where he placed his son for some time with a
                    celebrated crayon painter, under whom he made surprising progress. At this time
                    he executed, at half a guinea each, likenesses of the fashionables of Bath; and
                    this initiatory exercise in drawing individuals in high life, arrayed in their
                    gay and elegant costume, had, doubtless, considerable influence in forming the
                    style of the artist, and preparing him to become the painter of patricians. He
                    now numbered amongst his warm admirers and patrons persons of rank and fortune;
                    but the mostjemarkable incident in his early career, was his receiving the great
                    silver pallet from the Society of Arts, with a present of five guineas. These
                    marks of distinction were conferred upon him for executing in crayons the
                    Transfiguration of Raphael, when he was only thirteen years of age. His large
                    crayon drawings became in great request; and in Oxford, Salisbury, and other
                    places which he visited, he obtained considerable employment for his pencil.
                    When in his sixteenth year, he conceived a strong desire to appear upon the
                    stage; but the remonstrances of his friends induced him to abandon this project;
                    and about a year afterwards, he made his first attempt in oil painting. In 1787
                    he removed to London, where he availed himself of the public institutions for
                    instruction in his art, and commenced that career which terminated so
                    triumphantly. He was received at the house of Sir Joshua Reynolds, and
                    encouraged by the great head of the English school of art. His admission as a
                    student at the Royal Academy, and his first appearance in the exhibition at
                    Somerset House, soon followed his arrival in the metropolis. Each succeeding
                    year he increased the number of the performances which he sent in; and his
                    reputation growing apace, he was elected an associate of the Royal Academy on
                    the 10th of November 1791.</p>
                <p>The death of Sir Joshua Reynolds in 1792 opened up a fair field of competition
                    for aspiring genius; and although Mr Lawrence was then only in his twenty-third
                    year, it soon became apparent that he was destined to bear away the palm from
                    the most gifted artists with whom he had to contend. The Dilettanti Society
                    unanimously chose him as their painter in the room of Sir Joshua; and his
                    majesty George III. also appointed him to succeed the deceased president, as his
                    principal painter in ordinary. On the 10th of February 1794&lt;, Mr Lawrence was
                    elected a royal academician; and employment now flowed upon him from all
                    quarters. He made the most rapid progress in his profession, and his reputation
                    grew steadily until he came to be generally considered as the first portrait
                    painter of the age. An enumeration of the works of this description which he
                    executed would comprehend all the rank, fashion, and intelligence which
                    distinguished the times in which he lived, including those of most of the
                    crowned heads of Europe. The royal family, the nobility and gentry,
                    distinguished men of letters and statesmen, actors and actresses, all sat for
                    their portraits to Lawrence. It may be justly said of him as it was said of Sir
                    Joshua Reynolds, that “he painted three generations of beauties.” In 1815 the
                    Prince Regent conferred on him the honour of knighthood; and in 1818, at the
                    request of the same illustrious individual, he was induced to proceed to
                    Aix-la-Chapelle, to take likenesses of the most distinguished statesmen who had
                    there assembled for diplomatic purposes. Having executed his mission at
                    Aix-la-Chapelle, Sir Thomas proceeded to Vienna, and thence to Rome, where he
                    had an opportunity of contemplating for the first time the great masterpieces of
                    ancient art. During the whole of his residence on the Continent, he was received
                    by the sovereigns of the different countries he visited, and entertained with
                    marked distinction; and the propriety and elegance of his deportment made an
                    impression highly favourable to his character as an English artist and
                    gentleman. After an <pb break="no" facs="nls:193203407"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0713-3407-0154"/>absence of eighteen months, he returned to
                    England; but, before reaching his native country, he had been unanimously
                    elected to succeed Mr West as president of the Royal Academy; and this office he
                    continued to hold till his death, which took place on the 7th of January
                    1830.</p>
                <p>In portrait-painting, the branch of art which he made his profession, Sir Thomas
                    Lawrence was the most distinguished artist of the day. He was one of the few
                    English painters who attained a proficiency in their art before visiting Italy,
                    or without studying the old masters; a circumstance which must be attributed to
                    his strong native genius and exquisite taste. The distinguishing characteristic
                    of his style was the power of conveying a faithful resemblance, with, at the
                    same time, a singularly delicate sense of beauty, grace, elegance, and dignity.
                    An able writer thus speaks of him: “No painter who ever lived seemed to have
                    dived more deeply into individual character, as conveyed by the conformation of
                    the visage, and the expression of the features; and none knew more skilfully how
                    to avail himself of the changeful appearances which they betrayed in those
                    conversations which were dexterously introduced during the sitting, and which
                    destroyed or relaxed a rigidity of muscle assumed on such occasions, and which
                    frequently baffles the utmost ingenuity of the artist. In his female portraits
                    (the great test of talent) he had more grace and a greater variety of attitude
                    than Vandyke, although he certainly did not equal him in colouring. It is a
                    general opinion also, among painters, that he had less nature and less breadth
                    than Sir Joshua Reynolds; and that opinion is probably well founded. Sir Thomas,
                    especially in the latter periods of his practice, exhibited more detail in his
                    portraits, and appeared to paint with a smaller pencil, than his illustrious
                    predecessor, who in his effects of light and shade seemed to take Correggio as
                    his model. The hair in Sir Thomas’s pictures was painted in fine masses, in a
                    way peculiar to himself; and his eyes, to the splendour of which he sometimes
                    made great sacrifices, were divine. The late Mr Fuseli, who was by no means a
                    thorough-going admirer even of Sir Thomas, has been heard to say of him, ‘ But
                    he paints eyes better than Titian.’”</p>
                <p>His drawing was admirable, and some of his chalk sketches are considered by the
                    best judges as fine as Michel Angelo or Raffaelle 'could have executed. Sir
                    Thomas did not confine himself to portrait-painting alone, but executed
                    paintings of a far higher order of art. Of these it has been observed by Mr
                    Westmacott, “His illustrations of Cato, Coriolanus, and Hamlet, may be
                    considered historical works, and examples of his creative genius, possessing a
                    vigour of imagination, a propriety of sentiment, a breadth and chasteness of
                    composition, worthy to be ranked with the classical and distinguished efforts of
                    the sixteenth century; whilst his more comprehensive powers were displayed in
                    the admirable picture of Satan: all eminent proofs that he possessed talents
                    equal to the accomplishment of the highest designs in the art.” In private life
                    Sir Thomas Lawrence was most exemplary, being-kind and liberal to artists, and
                    ready to encourage rising merit. In discharge of his duties connected with the
                    high station which he filled in relation to the academy, he displayed
                    unremitting diligence and zeal; “and no man,” says an academician, “died with
                    better claims to the respect of his brother members.” <hi rend="smallcaps"

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Lawrence,</hi><hi rend="italic">St,'</hi> a river of North
                    America, and one of the largest in the world. It takes its origin in the
                    magnificent basin of Lake Superior, in Upper Canada, and has a course to the sea
                    of nearly 3000 miles. It is the grand outlet by which the immense Lakes
                    Superior, Huron, Michigan, Erie, and Ontario, pour their surplus waters into the
                    ocean through the Gulf of St Lawrence. The remotest spring of this great river
                    is the stream called St Lewis, in lat. 48. 30. N. and long, about 93. W. From
                    its source the general direction through Lakes Superior and Huron is south-east
                    to Lake Erie, nearly due east from that lake, and then north-east to the sea. It
                    receives in its vast course almost all the rivers that rise in the extensive
                    range of mountains to the northward, called the Land’s Height, which separate
                    the waters falling into Hudson’s Bay from those that descend into the Atlantic,
                    together withall the rivers that have their sources in the ridge which commences
                    on its southern bank, running nearly south-west to where the ridge falls on Lake
                    Champlain. In different parts of its course this great river is known by
                    different names. From the sea to Montreal it is called <hi rend="italic">St
                    Lawrence;</hi> from thence to Kingston in Upper Canada, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cataraqui</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Iroquois</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi>

                    Superior, the distance is called the <hi rend="italic">Narrows</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">Falls of St Mary.</hi> There is thus formed an uninterrupted
                    connection of upwards of 2000 miles. It is navigable for ships of the line to
                    Quebec, about 400 miles; and to Montreal, a distance of 580 miles from the sea,
                    for ships of 600 tons burden. The distance from Montreal to Lake Ontario is
                    about 200 miles. The breadth of the river between Montreal and Quebec is from
                    half a mile to four miles, the average breadth being about two miles. Below
                    Quebec it gradually widens till it enters the gulf, where, from Cape Rosier to
                    the Mingan settlement on the coast of Labrador, it is about 105 miles in
                    breadth. The St Lawrence discharges annually into the ocean about 4,277,880
                    millions of tons of fresh water, of which 2,112,120 millions of tons may be
                    reckoned melted snow; the quantity discharged before the thaw comes on being
                    4512 millions of tons per day for 240 days, and the quantity after the thaw
                    begins being 25,560 millions per day for 125 days, the depth and velocity when
                    in and out of flood being duly considered. Hence, a ton of water being nearly
                    equal to fifty-five cubic yards of pure snow, the St Lawrence frees a country of
                    more than 2000 miles square covered with it to the depth <hi rend="italic"
                    >of</hi> three feet. The embouchure of this mighty stream is that part of the
                    Gulf of St Lawrence where the island of Anticoti divides the mouth of the river
                    into two branches. The solid contents of the St Lawrence, embracing Lakes
                    Superior, Huron, Michigan, Eric, and Ontario, have been estimated at
                    1,547,792,360,000 cubic feet, and the superficial area being 72,930 square
                    miles, the water therein would form a cube of nearly twenty-two miles on each
                    side. The river, and the whole country, from the lowest parishes to Quebec,
                    unfold scenery, the magnificence of which, in combination with the most
                    delightful physical beauty, is certainly unequalled in America, and probably in
                    the world. As the eminence is ascended, over which the post-road passes, or in
                    sailing up or down the St Lawrence, there are frequently prospects which open a
                    view of from fifty to one hundred miles of a river from ten to twenty miles in
                    breadth. The imposing features of these vast landscapes exhibit lofty mountains,
                    wide valleys, bold headlands, luxuriant forests, cultivated fields, pretty
                    villages, and settlements (some of them stretching up along the mountains);
                    fertile islands overspread with cottages, pastures, and flocks; rocky islets,
                    and tributary rivers, some of them rolling over precipices, and one of them,
                    Saguenay, like an inland mountain lake, bursting through a perpendicular chasm
                    in the granitic chain; whilst, on the surface of the St Lawrence, majestic
                    ships, large brigs, and vessels and boats of every description, present a
                    spectacle at once sublime and beautiful, and calculated to charm the mind of the
                    beholder. Of course the trade carried on by means of this river is very great.

                    by the Gut of Canso, which divides Cape Breton from Nova Scotia, by a wider and
                    main channel between Cape North in Cape Breton Isle and Cape Ray in
                    Newfoundland, and by the narrow straits of Belleisle, which separate the coast
                    of Labrador from Newfoundland. The distance from Cape Rosier, Gaspe Bay, to Cape
                    Ray in Newfoundland, is seventy-nine leagues; and from Nova Scotia to Labrador,
                    the distance is one hundred and six leagues. Several islands are situated in the
                    gulf, of which the one most dangerous to navigators is St Paul’s, a small barren
                    isle lying between Newfoundland and Cape Breton. On the south side of the bay is
                    St John’s or Prince Edward’s Island; to the northward are the small Magdalen
                    Islands, eleven in number; north of the Magdalens is Brion’s Island; and beyond
                    this are the Bird Isles or Rocks, the most northerly of which is in lat.
                    47.50.28. north, and long. 61.12.53. west. On this island it is proposed to
                    erect a light-house.</p>
