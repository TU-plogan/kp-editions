                    body is covered with a kind of down. Sir Hans Sloane read a memoir upon this

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Lamb,</hi><hi rend="italic">Charles,</hi> a distinguished
                    essayist and critic, was born in the Temple, London, on the 11th of February
                    1775. He was presented to the school of Christ Hospital in 1782, some
                    recollections of which place he afterwards embodied in one of his most
                    delightful essays. In November 1789, having completed the usual period allotted
                    for education at that seminary, he returned to the home of bis mother, who still
                    resided in the Temple, although his father was now no more. At first he was
                    employed for a short time in the South Sea House with his brother; a graphic and
                    admirable account of which establishment he afterwards gave, in an essay <hi
                    rend="italic">of</hi> the same name. On the 5th'of April 1793, he obtained an
                    appointment in the accountant’s department of the India House, where he remained
                    till 1825, when he was allowed to retire on a handsome pension. The events of
                    his life of a domestic nature are of little moment, and need not detain us in
                    sketching his literary career. His first appearance as an author was in a small
                    volume of poetry, published by his friend Coleridge in 1797, to which he
                    contributed various pieces. A few years afterwards appeared “Old Blind Margaret,
                    and Rosamund Gray,” a tale of great simplicity, sweetness, and pathos. In 1802
                    he published “John Woodvil, a tragedy,” alongst with “Fragments of Burton,” one
                    of his favourite authors. “Mr H ,” a farce, was acted at Drury Lane in 1806,
                    without success. It is, however, probably the best dramatic <hi rend="italic"
                    >jeu d’esprit</hi> in the language; but it wants plot and incident for the
                    stage, and its jokes are too intellectual to be appreciated by a mixed audience.
                    In 1808 appeared his “Specimens of English Dramatic Poets who lived about the
                    time of Shakspeare, with Notes,” chiefly critical. In the year 1811 he
                    contributed to the “Reflector” a series of admirable prose papers, including
                    those on Hogarth’s pictures and the tragedies of Shakspeare. The most celebrated
                    of all Mr Lamb’s works, the “Essays of Elia,” were published in various
                    periodicals between the years 1820 and 1833; and were subsequently collected and
                    given to the public in two octavo volumes. In 1830 appeared his small volume of
                    poems called “Album Verses,” which also contained “The Wife’s Trial,” a dramatic
                    poem, founded on Crabbe’s “Tale of the Confidante.” In conjunction with his
                    sister, he also compiled three very popular books for children, namely, “Mrs
                    Leicester’s School, or the History of several young Ladies, related by
                    themselves;” Tales from Shakspeare and “The Adventures of Ulysses.” He <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193201821" xml:id="kp-eb0713-1821-0032"/> likewise wrote
                    another farce called “The Pawnbroker’s Daughter, or the Reprieved Man,” founded
                    on his amusing paper, “On the Inconveniences of being hanged and to several
                    periodical works he contributed various criticisms on the drama and the fine
                    arts. His volume bearing the title of “The last Essays of Elia” appeared in
                    1833; and its publication he did not long survive, having died on the 27th of
                    December 1834.</p>
                <p>In depth of thought and splendour of genius, Charles Lamb was surpassed by
                    several of his contemporaries; but as an essayist, he is entitled to a place
                    beside Rabelais, Montaigne, Sir Thomas Browne, Steele, and Addison. He unites
                    many of the characteristics of these several writers. He has refined wit,
                    exquisite humour, a genuine and cordial vein of pleasantry, and heart-touching
                    pathos. In the latter quality his Rosamund Gray will stand a comparison with any
                    piece of the kind that ever was written. His fancy as an essayist is
                    distinguished by great delicacy and tenderness; and even his conceits are embued
                    with human feeling and passion. He had an extreme partiality for our earlier
                    prose writers, particularly for Fuller, Sir Thomas Browne, and Burton, as well
                    as for the dramatists of Shakspeare’s time; and the care with which he studied
                    them is apparent in all he ever wrote. It shines out conspicuously in his style,
                    which has an antique air, and is redolent of the peculiarities of the
                    seventeenth century. Its quaintness has subjected the author to the charge of
                    affectation, but there is nothing really affected in his writings. His style is
                    not so much an imitation, as a reflection, of the older writers; for in spirit
                    he made himself their contemporary. A confirmed habit of studying them in
                    preference to modern literature, had made their style natural to him; and long
                    experience had rendered it not only easy and familiar, but habitual. It was not
                    a masquerade dress he wore, but the costume which showed the man to most
                    advantage. With thought and meaning, often profound, though clothed in simple
                    language, every sentence of his essays is pregnant; and in this respect he bears
                    a strong resemblance to the writers alluded to. If he had their manner, he
                    possessed their spirit likewise. To some of his essays and specimens we are
                    considerably indebted for the revival of the dramatic writers of the
                    Shakspearian age; for he preceded Gifford and others in wiping the dust of ages
                    from these admirable writers. In his brief comments on each specimen, he
                    displays exquisite powers of discrimination. His discernment of the true meaning
                    of the writer is almost infallible. He seizes with unerring precision the proper
                    point of view from which the piece ought to be seen; and this led him with equal
                    success to detail the real centre, whether a character or an event, round which
                    the orb of the drama revolved. His penetrating intellect enabled him to throw
                    more and newer light on the true meaning of some of the great masterpieces of
                    the theatre than any other man. The perfect unison of the style of his
                    annotations with the text which they illustrate, also constitutes a great charm,
                    if not a leading merit. As a poet, Mr Lamb is not entitled to a very high place.
                    Like his prose works, his poetical pieces are written in an antique style, so
                    completely identical with that of Beaumont and Fletcher, Johnson, and others of
                    that era, that they might pass current for genuine specimens of these great
                    writers. In private life Mr Lamb was extremely amiable, and his house was a
                    great resort for wits and men of letters; for, in wit and shrewdness of
                    observation, his conversation was considered as equal to his writings.</p>
