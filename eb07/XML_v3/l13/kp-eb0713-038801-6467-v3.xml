                <p><label type="entry">LIVERPOOL</label>.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">This</hi> town, which, after London, is the most
                    considerable place of commerce in the British empire, or perhaps in the world,
                    is situated in the hundred of West Derby, on the eastern bank of the river
                    Mersey, in 53° 22' 30" of north latitude, and 2° 57 ’ of longitude west from
                    Greenwich, at a distance of 30 miles west of Manchester, and 205 miles
                    north-west of London. The town is bounded on the west by the river Mersey, on
                    the east by Low Hill and Everton, on the north by the township of Kirkdale, and
                    on the south by Toxteth Park.</p>
                <p>The limits of the ancient borough were defined by marks called mere-stones,
                    within which its liberties were included. It occupied an area of 2202 acres, of
                    which about 1000 belonged to the Corporation, and the rest to individuals; but
                    under the Parliamentary and Municipal Reform Acts, the limits of the present
                    borough have been greatly extended, and now include a large part of Toxteth
                    Park, Edge Hill, Low Hill, West Derby, Everton, and Kirkdale.</p>
                <p>The name of this place has given rise to much discussion. The most ancient record
                    in which it is mentioned, is the charter of Henry II., where it is called Lyrpul
                    or Litherpul, either of which is inconsistent with the fanciful derivation from
                    the heraldic bird called the liver. It seems to be agreed that the latter part
                    of the name designates a <hi rend="italic">pullum,</hi> or pool of water; and
                    Camden, who gives a Saxon derivation, explains only the termination.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Ubi <hi rend="italic"
                    >Litherpοοle</hi> floret, Saxonice <hi rend="italic">Lyferpok,</hi> vulgo
                    Lirpool, a diffusa paludis in modum aqua, ut opinio est, nominatus. Camden <hi
                    rend="italic">Britan,</hi> p. 614. 1590, 8vo.</p></note> But as the name <hi
                    rend="italic">Lyferpole</hi> does not rest upon any Saxon authority, its
                    correctness may be questioned. To account for the more ancient orthography,
                    however, it has been supposed that the name <hi rend="italic">Litherpool</hi>
                    was formed of the words <hi rend="italic">lithe pol,</hi> signifying gentle
                    lake. In an assessment of Lancashire, made in 1245, when Lancaster was charged
                    thirteen merks, and Preston fifteen, Liverpool paid only eleven. In Leland’s
                    account of his journey, made about the years 1515 and 1516, we find this
                    passage: “Lyrpole, or Lyr-poole, is a pa vid towne, hath but a chapel, Walton a
                    iv miles of, not far from the se is paroche chirch. The king hath a castlet
                    there, and the Erle of Darbe hath a stone house there. Irisch marchants cum much
                    thither as to a good haven. At Lyrpole is smaule custom payid, that cau-sith
                    marchants to resort. Good marchundise at Lyrpole, and much Irisch yarn that
                    Manchester men do by ther.”</p>
                <p>A charter was granted to this town by King John in 1203, and renewed by Henry
                    III. in 1228, by which he constituted Leverpolle a free borough. In 1272 a
                    census was taken of the town, when it was found to consist of 168 houses, and
                    occupied by about 800 inhabitants. Some records of the year 1555 represent it as
                    a poor and obscure place, having only 138 householders and cottagers; but six
                    years afterwards, the number of vessels belonging to the port were twelve, of
                    177 tons, and manned by 175 seamen.</p>
                <p>In 1626 Charles I. granted a new charter, by which a-corporate and politic body
                    was created. At the levy of ship-money, in the early part of that reign, this
                    town was assessed for L.25, whilst Chester was rated at L.26, and Bristol at
                    L.1000, which may be some guide to the relative importance of the several
                    places. During the civil war, in the latter part of this reign, it was the scene
                    of several conflicts between the royalists and the parliamentarians; and, after
                    a siege, when it was taken by the former, it suffered severely by the plague,
                    which carried off 200 of its inhabitants. About this time, the ships in
                    Liverpool and the dependent ports had increased as follows:</p>
                <p>Liverpool . . ships, 24 . . tons, 462 . . men, 76.</p>
                <p>After the restoration, and the internal national peace that followed it,
                    Liverpool seems gradually to have gone on increasing in extent, population, and
                    trade. It appears that, in 1753, there were 3700 houses, and 20,000 inhabitants;
                    and that in 1760, the houses were 4200, and the population 25,000. Dr Enfield,
                    to whom we are indebted for these two comparative statements, does not give any
                    data that can be implicitly confided in, but they have every appearance of
                    approximating to accuracy.</p>
                <p>Till the year 1698, Liverpool was included in Walton parish, but in that year it
                    was separated from it. In 1699 it became an independent parish. The first
                    newspaper was established in the year 1756; and in the year 176θ, the first
                    stage-coach was established between Liverpool and London. In 1770, the public
                    library commenced, and about the same time the Society of Artists of Liverpool
                    was founded.</p>
                <p>The African and West India trade had been rapidly growing during seventy years,
                    and all other branches had also been increasing. In the year 17 54, there
                    were</p>
                <p>83 ships in the African trade.</p>
                <p>124 ... in the West India trade.</p>
                <p>28 ... in the American and foreign trade.</p>
                <p>21 ... in the London cheese trade.</p>
                <p>101 coasters and Irish traders.</p>
                <p>80 sloops and flats on the river.</p>
                <p>At this time a new dock was constructed, and received the name of the Salt-house
                    Dock.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The first dock
                    constructed was the Old Dock, as it is called, which had been formed in
                    1699.</p></note> From that period, the progress of Liverpool has been truly
                    without example in any other British port, or perhaps in any other age or
                    country.</p>
                <p>On the site of St George’s Church, formerly stood the ancient castle of
                    Liverpool. According to Camden, it was built as early as the year 1076. Whatever
                    may have been its origin, it was demolished by order of Parliament in the year
                    1659; but it existed in a dilapidated state from that time till the year 1721,
                    when it was razed to the ground. There was also a building denominated the
                    Tower, which occupied a site of about 3700 square yards, and was situated near
                    the bottom of Water Street. It served for ages as the residence of the Earls of
                    Derby, then as an assembly-room, and afterwards as a prison. It was demolished
                    in 1819, and with it disappeared the last remaining vestige of the ancient days
                    of Liverpool.</p>
                <p>The state to which Liverpool has arrived, and the gradual steps by which it has
                    been accomplished, within the present century, may be most accurately shewn by
                    the returns obtained in the four decennial enumerations of Great Britain, which,
                    by the diligence and acuteness of Mr Rickman, have been collected, arranged, and
                    presented to the two houses of parliament. Every ten years exhibits more fully
                    the state of the country than was to be found in the volumes that preceded
                    it.</p>

                    xml:id="kp-eb0713-6480-0389"/>In the last of these years, the families were
                    38,122, of whom 227 were chiefly employed in agriculture; 18,881 were
                    principally employed in trade, manufactures, or handicraft; and 19,014 were not
                    comprehended in either of the before-mentioned classes.</p>
                <p>The number of males who had attained the age of twenty years was 44,726. Of
                    these, the portion employed in agriculture were, 39 occupiers of land, employing
                    labourers; 165 occupiers of land, not employing labourers; and 132 employed as
                    labourers in agriculture. The remainder are thus classed: 359 making
                    manufacturing machinery; 21,208 employed in retail trade, or in handicraft, as
                    masters or as workmen; 5201 capitalists, bankers, professional and other
                    educated men; 16,095 labourers employed in labour not agricultural; 1214 others
                    not particularly classed, and 313 domestic servants. The number of female
                    servants was 9033.</p>
                <p>Of the whole population, as before stated, of 189,242 individuals, the males were
                    87,919, and the females 101,323. The excess of the latter over the former may be
                    attributed to the number of seafaring people, a part of whom must necessarily be
                    much absent from their residences.</p>
                <p>The rapid increase of the town will be observed from what has been stated; but
                    the most authentic record of this increase is to be found in the bills of
                    mortality, as preserved in the parish registers, and from them the following
                    results are derived :—</p>

                <p>Exclusive of the baptisms, marriages, and burials in the places of public worship
                    in Toxteth Park and Everton, and of the burials at the Necropolis, which, in
                    1834, amounted to 1586.</p>
                <p>It appears by the bills of mortality that the increase of the population, as
                    shewn by deducting the number of burials from the number of baptisms, would have
                    been only 22,108 individuals in the ten years, from the year 1821 to the year
                    1831; whereas the returns shew an increase of 59,441; thus proving that besides
                    the increase from itself, there must have been an immigration of 37,333 persons
                    at Liverpool. The increased salubrity of the town is also observable. The whole
                    of the burials in 1821 were 3267, out of a population of 131,801, or about one
                    in forty; and in 1830 they were 3620, out of a population of 189,242, or one in
                    fifty-two.</p>
                <p>The increase in the population since 1830 has been remarkably steady, although
                    the town has been twice visited by the cholera, and on one of the occasions very
                    severely. The births in 1835 were 8145.</p>
                <p>One of the main causes of the increase and prosperity of Liverpool has been the
                    construction of the docks for the reception of ships. The river Mersey, on the
                    right bank of which the town is built, empties itself through a great estuary
                    filled with banks, and crossed by a bar at its mouth, which is very shallow at
                    low-water; but the tides rise twenty-one feet at neap, and twenty-eight feet at
                    spring tides. The land around is low, and ships in the river are in consequence
                    exposed to gales of wind. The entrance to the river is easy and safe, from some
                    of the prominent objects on the peninsula which separates the Dee from the
                    Mersey; and the nearer approach to the harbour has been facilitated by the
                    construction of light-houses, by the erection of buildings called the
                    Bootie-marks on the shore, by the establishment of floating-lights, and by an
                    appropriate placing of buoys to mark the channel. The Mersey is navigable for
                    vessels of sixty tons thirty-five miles above Liverpool, to the confluence of
                    the Irwell. The river Weaver falls also into the estuary, and is navigable for
                    vessels of sixty tons as far as Northwich, the great depository of rock-salt. It
                    was to remedy the inconveniences felt after entering the harbour, that the docks
                    here described were constructed. Between the town and the river, a tract of low
                    land, nearly three miles in length, extending to low-water mark, was found
                    adapted for the purpose of forming docks. The space thus recovered from the sea
                    by persevering labour has been gradually converted into docks, containing 111
                    acres, and much of it is covered with warehouses and other buildings required by
                    commerce.</p>
                <p>In the notices of the docks, we shall follow their position from south to north
                    rather than the date of their construction. The southernmost of these is the
                    Brunswick Dock. It is the largest of all, being chiefly constructed for the use
                    of vessels employed in the timber trade. The east and west ends are 430 yards
                    long, and the north and south 140 yards. It is connected with another, called
                    the Half-Tide Basin, the dimensions of which are 120 by 108 yards.</p>
                <p>The Queen’s Dock, which is next to the Brunswick, has a communication with it by
                    means of the Half-Tide Dock, of the latter. It was opened in 1796, and is now
                    chiefly frequented by vessels from the Baltic and from Holland. The mean length
                    is about 400 yards, and the mean breadth about 100 yards. The gates are 42 feet
                    wide, and 28 deep. At the south end, and the east and west sides, there are
                    well-constructed sheds, affording shelter from the inclemency of the weather,
                    whilst the cargoes are receiving or discharging. The quay is very extensive, and
                    between it and the river are two graving-docks, 170 yards in length, admirably
                    calculated for the building and repairing of ships.</p>
                <p>The King’s Dock, to the north of the Queen’s and with an opening into it from a
                    basin common to both, was first used in the year 1788. It extends from north to
                    south 270 yards, and from east to west 95 yards. It is surrounded by spacious
                    quays, with sheds for discharging tobacco, which constitutes the cargoes of most
                    of the vessels that repair to it. The entrance, which is on the south side, has
                    strong gates, 28 feet deep, and 42 wide, with a cast-iron bridge turning on a
                    swivel. On the west side of this dock is one of the most capacious storehouses
                    in the world, intended as the warehouse for bonded tobacco. It is a plain brick
                    building, with walls eighteen inches in thickness, extending from north to south
                    575, and from east to west 239 feet; being in extent fifty per cent, more than
                    the internal area of St Paul’s cathedral in London, and containing three acres
                    one rood and twenty perches. In this dock a vessel has been converted into a
                    floating chapel, in which divine service is performed on Sundays. The pier on
                    the west side forms a fine promenade, from which an extensive prospect over the
                    river may be obtained.</p>
                <p>The next dock, so called from the name of the constructor, the late Duke of
                    Bridgewater, is small, but elegantly constructed. It has a range of storehouses
                    upon an arch, under which vessels may enter and have their loading drawn up to
                    the proper warehouses above them. This is private property, now belonging to
                    Lord Francis Egerton, and used for purposes connected with his vast excavations
                    and water communications on the Bridgewater canal.</p>
                <p>Nearest to the Bridgewater, and to the north of it, is the Salthouse Dock, which
                    was opened in 1753. The form of this dock is irregular, being on the east side
                    297 yards, on the south end 80 yards, and on the north end 150 yards; the whole,
                    with the passage, comprehending an area of 23,025 square yards. On the east side
                    is a range of extensive warehouses, under the front of which is a piazza for the
                    accommodation of passengers. The vessels which chiefly occupy this dock are
                    those from the Levant, and the coasters from the neighbouring ports, and many
                    from Ireland.</p>
                <p>The Dry Dock, next to the north, is also of an irregular <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193206493" xml:id="kp-eb0713-6493-0390"/>figure. The west side is 150
                    yards in length, the north end 64 yards, the east side 219 yards, and the south
                    end 108 yards. It has connected with it the graving docks, which are made use of
                    for the purpose of building or repairing ships. The vessels which chiefly repair
                    to this dock are those loaded with foreign corn, or employed in the coasting
                    trade; the former generally load back with different kinds of foreign or
                    colonial articles with which Liverpool is at all times well stored.</p>
                <p>George’s Dock, originally commenced in the year 1767, was repaired and
                    considerably enlarged about ten years ago. It communicates at the south end with
                    the Dry Dock by means of a canal 110 yards long, the gates of which are 25 feet
                    long, 36 deep, and 42 wide. The dock is 246 yards long, and 100 broad,
                    containing an area of 26,068 square yards. On the eastern side is a magnificent
                    pile of warehouses, with an extensive piazza for the accommodation of foot
                    passengers. The quay room around is spacious, and on the western side sheds are
                    constructed to protect the goods, as they are landed, from the inclemencies of
                    the weather. The basin belonging to this dock is at the north end, and its
                    dimensions are, on the south side 163 yards, on the east and west sides 112
                    yards, and on the north side 154 yards. Within it is the Mariner’s Church, in
                    which divine service is weekly performed to the seamen.</p>
                <p>To the south of the pier-head of this dock is a smaller one, the property of the
                    Mersey and Irwell Company, called Manchester Dock, which is appropriated solely
                    for the purpose of receiving the flats belonging to the company, which are
                    loaded or discharged with their articles from the adjacent counties.</p>
                <p>The most beautiful as well as the most stable of all the docks, is that called
                    Prince’s, which was begun in May 1816, and opened on the day of the coronation
                    of King George I V., viz. on the 19th of July 1821. The length of the dock from
                    north to south is 500 yards, and the average breadth from east to west is 110
                    yards, thus containing an area of 54,000 square yards. The total expense, as
                    appears from official vouchers, was L.461,059: 19:4, exclusive of the land,
                    which is valued at L. 100,000. At each end there is a dwelling-house, with
                    appropriate offices, designed for the use of the dock-masters. There are two
                    entrances; one from the George’s Dock basin at the south, the gates of which are
                    45 feet wide, and 34 deep; and another at the north end, whose gates are of the
                    same dimensions. Each of these passages is furnished with a lock, so contrived
                    as to admit vessels either in or out at half-tide. The dock and its quays are
                    inclosed with brick walls, having gates at the north and south ends, and on the
                    east side. Between the western wall and the river is the Marine Parade, which is
                    700 yards long and 11 yards broad, and protected on the side next the water by a
                    stone wall about a yard in height. There are also three flights of steps down to
                    the river, for the convenience of passengers, who may land or embark in any
                    state of the tide. When the tide is in, this forms a most varied and delightful
                    promenade. The basin belonging to the Prince’s Dock is situated at the northern
                    end of it, and is 140 yards long, and about 134 wide at the centre, but differs
                    a few feet at each end.</p>
                <p>The newest, as well as the most northern of the docks, is that named the
                    Clarence, in honour of William IV. It was first opened in September 1830. It
                    consists of a principal dock, 250 yards long, 135 yards broad at the north end,
                    and 111 yards at the south end, with a basin 160 yards by 100, between it and
                    the river, furnished with gates, by means of which vessels may be allowed to
                    pass either inward or outward at half-tide. The stone of which the walls are
                    formed is of the most durable quality, and the masonry surpasses that of most
                    works of the same description. On each side of the passage two beautiful
                    circular offices have been erected, supplied with windows on all sides, through
                    which a complete view may be obtained of every part of the dock and of the
                    quays. A lofty and spacious shed extends the entire length of the eastern side,
                    and the whole of these works is surrounded by a strong and lofty wall.</p>
                <p>Between the Clarence and the basin of the Prince’s Dock, there are constructing
                    three other wet docks, with an extensive graving dock, which is to be furnished
                    with patent slips. One of them, the Waterloo Dock, is open to vessels, and
                    requires only some additions to be made to the pier to complete it; the others
                    are likely to be finished very shortly. They are to be called the Victoria and
                    Trafalgar Docks.</p>
                <p>The whole of these works arc defended against the force of the powerful tides,
                    which twice in twenty-four hours assail them, by a strong sea wall more than two
                    miles and a-half in length.</p>
                <p>To this general description we are enabled to add, from an official paper, the
                    following table, shewing the area of water contained in the stupendous
                    excavations, and the quantity of quay-space which they afford :—</p>

                <p>This forms a total, of dock-room of one hundred and eleven acres, and the
                    quay-space extends to nearly eight miles in length. The whole length of the
                    river wall is about two miles and a half, exclusive of openings.</p>
                <p>Proper precautions are adopted for clearing -these docks from the mud, which
                    every influx of the tide carries into them, and this purpose is effected by the
                    aid of improved machinery, worked by steam. Strict rules are established and
                    enforced as a guard against fire. No ship is allowed to have any gunpowder on
                    board, nor any combustible articles on the deck. No fire is allowed in any ship,
                    nor a candle to be lighted, except in a lantern, and these only to be used in
                    the presence of a custom-house officer. The arrange <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193206506" xml:id="kp-eb0713-6506-0391"/>ments for admitting, or for
                    the exit of vessels, and for their - position when in dock, to forward their
                    loading or discharging, are all well known and simple, and are executed under
                    the authority of a dock-master, who is placed at the head of the officers of
                    each dock, with proper persons under him to open and shut the gates at the
                    proper time, and to execute such other business as may be required for
                    facilitating the business to be transacted.</p>
                <p>These extensive works have been accomplished by means of loans raised by the
                    dock-trustees on bonds, for the payment of the principal and interest of which
                    the rates are appropriated agreeably to an act of Parliament. When these bonds
                    shall be discharged, or when the income is greater than the expenditure, the
                    duties are to be reduced, so as to leave an amount equivalent to the expenses of
                    the establishment, and to the necessary reparations. Such bonds are safe
                    deposits for the savings of the inhabitants, and for the property of widows,
                    orphans, or any trust-money; and thus great numbers in and around Liverpool are
                    interested in the prosperity of these valuable works.</p>
                <p>By means of these establishments, the cost in wear and tear of ships, and the
                    expense of loading and unloading, is less at Liverpool than at most of the other
                    ports of the kingdom. The celerity, also, with which every operation relating to
                    the dispatch of ships is carried on, is greater than elsewhere, and thus an
                    additional saving is effected in the wages and provisions for the masters and
                    crews.</p>
                <p>The warehousing or bonding system has tended very essentially to increase the
                    commerce of Liverpool. The number of warehouses and vaults for bonded goods are
                    very considerable, and there are a number of yards for bonded timber, as well as
                    ample granaries under the King’s Lock for foreign corn. The estimated value of
                    bonded property is one million and a half Sterling.</p>

                    the exports and imports of the various commodities which form the trade of
                    Liverpool. The following table gives the amount of the dock duties received, and

                <p>As the business of the shipowner is not an accurate criterion of the commercial
                    importance of places, neither is the amount of custom duties an actually certain
                    standard. The imports of articles which are brought from one part of the United
                    Kingdom to another, and consequently pay no duty, may cause an enormous trade,
                    and be highly beneficial, but nothing of it would appear in the returns of the
                    amount of duty collected at the custom-house. Although we exhibit the means of
                    making comparative estimates, yet, in the case of Liverpool, the imports from
                    Ireland must not be omitted to be recorded in taking a view of the state of its
                    trade. It appears that their imports of agricultural products alone, consisting
                    of live cattle, corn, flour, malt, bacon, pork, beef, hams, butter, hogs-lard,
                    and eggs, amounted, in 1832, to <hi rend="superscript"> l</hi> L.4,444,500, 6s.;
                    in 1833, to the estimated amount of L.8,179,844, exclusive of linen, feathers,
                    hides, wool, and porter, to at least the value of L.50.000 of the latter
                    article.</p>

                <p>The salaries paid to the officers at the Custom-House for 1835, wera L.46,447:
                    18: 0; and the incidental expenses amounted to L-47,541: 3: 7.</p>
                <p>The vast extent of the commerce of Liverpool, as here in some measure exhibited,
                    has in a great degree been indebted for its progress to the capital, the skill,
                    and the industry of the inhabitants of the counties in its vicinity, as well as
                    to the convenience of its port and its docks. With these counties the facilities
                    of intercourse have been constantly advancing, chiefly by the numerous internal
                    canals which branch out from the river Mersey. One of these, the Leeds and
                    Liverpool, which brings Hull, by the Aire, in communication with the Mersey,
                    forms a way for conveying the woollen and cotton goods made in the West Riding
                    of Yorkshire to the great shipping port for America, where are the greatest
                    number of the consumers of them. In the course of this canal, either by direct
                    or indirect communication, it is brought in contact with the manufacturing towns
                    of Wigan, Chorley, Preston, Bolton, Blackburn, and Rochdale, in Lan cashire, and
                    with Halifax, Huddersfield, Bradford, Leeds, Wakefield, Barnsley, and Sheffield,
                    all towns of great manufacturing activity. By the Duke of Bridgewater’s canal
                    from Runcorn, Liverpool is brought into direct contact with Manchester and
                    Stockport, and with that vast mass of coal on the duke’s estate, which could
                    easily supply the whole fuel for these and the surrounding populous places, but
                    it is surprising how little of that valuable commodity comes down to Liverpool
                    by the canal. By the Grand Trunk Canal, the Mersey is supplied with the rock and
                    refined salt, both articles of very great export, from the towns of Middlewich
                    and North wich, in Cheshire; and the cheese of that county is by the same
                    channel brought to be shipped for London, and other ports of the southern
                    divisions of the kingdom. The same canal passes Staffordshire, from the northern
                    part of which the potteries of Burslem, and the large new built towns in its
                    vicinity, convey thousands of crates of their ware annually, which are
                    dispatched from Liverpool to all parts of the globe; whilst, in its progress to
                    the south, it touches Wolverhampton, the head-quarters of the heavy iron
                    manufactory; and then, by other canals to Birmingham, with its innumerable
                    articles of hardwares of which every country in the world receives a portion.
                    The canal navigation to the south joins the two great rivers, the Severn on the
                    west, and by the Grand Junction with the Thames on the east; and thus a water
                    communication is maintained internally with almost every part of the south of
                    the kingdom.</p>
                <p>The annual revenue of the corporation in 1793 was L.25,000, which, valued as
                    capital, was estimated at L.1,044,766. The debts due by the corporation were
                    also valued and found to amount to L.367,816, 12s., leaving a balance in favour
                    of the corporation of L.676,959, 8s. The revenues have, since that period,
                    materially increased in value. The income is now about L. 150,000 per annum, and
                    the debt is upwards of a million.</p>
                <p>The most abundant source of revenue to the corporation is in the town-dues,—a
                    rate levied generally on all merchandise imported or exported into or out of
                    Liverpool. Freemen are exempted from this tax. The following table shews the
                    amount of the town-dues every tenth year from 1731 to 1831, each year ending
                    12th of October :—</p>

                <p>There are few towns which have their parochial concerns of such magnitude as
                    Liverpool, or have the affairs connected with it better conducted.</p>
                <p>The Workhouse, perhaps the largest in the kingdom, was erected in 1771, but has
                    been much enlarged since that period. The paupers in it are well supplied with
                    the necessaries of life, and the aged amongst them are allowed many additional
                    comforts. All that are not sick are employed in some trade or useful
                    manufacture, such as joiners, blacksmiths, wheel-wrights, shoemakers, tailors,
                    &amp;c., but their labour is not very productive. The boys are instructed in
                    some trade, and the girls above nine years of age are taught to knit, sew or
                    spin, to make straw bonnets, or to weave calicoes or other cloth.</p>
                <p>The local taxes for this and other purposes, assessed and collected in Liverpool,
                    are shewn by the following table, and clearly prove that neither pauperism nor
                    taxation have increased in the same ratio as the population, and, it may be
                    presumed, not in the same ratio as the wealth.</p>

                <p>The valuations of the several premises were, in the years 1820, 1821, and 1822,
                    about equal to the rack rent. From 1823 to 1830 they were about four-fifths of
                    the rack rent, and from 1831 and 1834 they were nearly equal to the full
                    value.</p>
                <p>The proportion of these rates, which are actually collected, has varied in
                    different years between 70 and 74 per cent, of the amount assessed.</p>
                <p>The corporation, which is one of the most ancient and wealthy in the kingdom, has
                    been altogether remodelled bythe Muncipal Reform Bill. Previous to the passing
                    of the act, the Body-Corporate consisted of forty-one persons, chosen by the
                    freemen of the borough. These formed the common-council, and from amongst whom
                    were chosen annually a mayor and two bailiffs: vacancies were filled up by the
                    members of the council, as they occurred. By the Municipal Reform Act, the old
                    corporation was abolished, and the town was divided into sixteen wards,
                    returning forty-eight councillors and sixteen aldermen, who are to be elected on
                    the 9th of November by the resident rate-payers<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193206545" xml:id="kp-eb0713-6545-0394"/>. The councillors remain in
                    office for three years. The mayor is elected from amongst themselves; the whole
                    corporate body being thus sixty-four. They are required to meet quarterly, but
                    they generally meet once a month, and often more frequently. The council is
                    empowered to enact laws for the better regulation of the police of the town, of
                    the port, and of the dock, as well as for watching and lighting of the town, and
                    other public purposes.</p>
                <p>Since the accession of the new council to office, a new and improved system of
                    police has been formed; old laws have been consolidated; and preparations arc
                    now making to extend to the new extended borough, the advantages enjoyed by the
                    inhabitants of the old. There are twenty-nine justices of the peace for the
                    borough of Liverpool.</p>
                <p>At the registration of 1836, the total number of persons qualified to vote for
                    members of parliament was 10,600.</p>
                <p>The districts in immediate communication with Liverpool have within the last
                    thirty years increased from 2,000,000 inhabitants to 3,600,000; and there can be
                    no doubt but that their wealth has been augmented in a still greater ratio. It
                    has, too, been brought into indirect communication with a much larger district,
                    as the advance extends the limits of supply at every step on both sides its
                    course. The increase of the import trade, or of foreign commodities, including
                    colonial, is thus very naturally acounted for.</p>
                <p>The recent introduction of steam navigation has been extended amply to Liverpool,
                    and been found of the greatest benefit. In the supply of the markets with every
                    kind of provisions from the adjoining districts on the shore, but especially
                    from Ireland, the accuracy of their arrival when loaded with perishable
                    products, has had a manifest good effect in reducing their prices. Steam-boats
                    are constantly passing between the Mersey and the ports of Ireland, of the Isle
                    of Man, of Scotland, and of North Wales. They are used at the ferry to the city
                    of Chester, and, in contrary winds, to tow vessels into or out of the river. The
                    celebrated rail -road, with its steam-carriages, between Manchester and
                    Liverpool, has given a wonderful impetus to communication. A particular account
                    of this railroad will be given under the article <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Manchester.</hi></p>
                <p>No place can be better supplied, or at lower rates, with all the necessaries and
                    comforts of life, than Liverpool. Water, one of the first of those necessaries,
                    is furnished by two companies. It is raised by steam-engines to the due height,
                    to convey it to the upper floors of the dwellings. They also supply large
                    reservoirs and many tanks, in different parts, which have always abundance of
                    water ready to extinguish fires.</p>
                <p>It has been observed that the markets are well supplied; to which may be added,
                    that they are well calculated for the display and preservation of the
                    commodities, by the appropriate nature of the buildings. The most extensive
                    market is St John’s, containing an area of 8235 square yards, being 183 in
                    length and 45 in breadth. It is very light and clean, and at night is lighted by
                    gas. The roof is lofty, supported by cast-iron pillars, and against the walls
                    are nearly sixty small shops, eighteen feet long, and twelve feet wide, with a
                    fireplace in each. There are besides upwards of 500 stalls or compartments,
                    allotted for the exhibition of vegetables, eggs, poultry, fish, fruit, and
                    potatoes, and on the basement thirty convenient storehouses. The whole is
                    supplied with pumps of hot and cold water, and every evening the floor is swept
                    and washed, and then shut up under the care of watchmen. The regulations for
                    weighing, or otherwise ascertaining the quantities of the articles sold, are
                    simple and cheap; as are those for the regulation of the porters, who are known
                    by a badge, and carry the purchases from the market to the residence of the
                    buyers. It is perhaps the best and neatest market of any city in Europe. There
                    are others. St James’s market is neat, but has an area of only 3000 yards. At
                    the end of the same street is a commodious fish-market, opened in 1826. A new
                    market, with an elegant front, has been built in a situation convenient for
                    those in the neighbourhood of Scotland Road; and besides these are Islington,
                    Pownal Square, and Cleveland Square Markets; one for hay and cattle in Lime
                    Street, and one for pigs in Great Howard Street. There is a market for live
                    cattle three miles from the town on the London road.</p>
                <p>The streets in the centre of the town are generally narrow, and rather gloomy in
                    their appearance; but many of the recently-built portions are handsomely, and
                    some elegantly arranged, and contain very excellent houses. There are abundance
                    of good hotels and inns. The streets are well paved, and lighted with gas
                    furnished by two companies; and the police, for the preservation of the peace
                    and of cleanliness, is well arranged. The public buildings deserve notice. The
                    first of these, in point of extent, is the Town-Hall, built on the site of a
                    former one which was consumed by fire in 1795. It is of a quadrangular form,
                    with a rustic basement, on which rises a range of columns and pilasters, having
                    rich and finely-finished capitals. Between the pilasters are handsome well
                    proportioned windows, with semicircular heads. On the western and southern sides
                    the spaces between the capitals are ornamented with various designs, executed in
                    bas-relief, emblematic of commerce. The whole is surmounted with a large and
                    stately dome, in strict keeping with the rest of the building, and supporting a
                    massive figure of Britannia in a sitting posture. The principal entrance is
                    through a portico which leads to a splendid staircase, illuminated from above in
                    a manner to produce a highly pleasing effect. It is adorned by a fine white
                    marble statue of the late Mr Canning, by Chantrey. The principal story is laid
                    out in a fine saloon, two drawing-rooms, and a ball-room of great dimensions;
                    and in the former are excellent portraits of his present Majesty William IV.,
                    when Duke of Clarence, by Shee; of George III., by Sir Thomas Lawrence; of
                    George IV., when Prince of Wales, by Hopner; and of the late Duke of York, by
                    Philips. The painting and other ornamental finishing of the apartments, as well
                    as the furniture, are tasteful and appropriate, and executed at an expense
                    becoming the liberality of the second commercial city of the world. The dome has
                    a gallery surrounding it, whence a very fine view may be obtained of the whole
                    of the river and docks, and of the country around.</p>
                <p>This building forms one side of another mass of erections, executed about
                    twenty-five years ago, for the purpose of an Exchange. It is of great extent,
                    being 197 fleet long and 178 broad, thus forming a quadrangle of 3500 square
                    feet, being nearly double the space occupied by the area of? the Royal Exchange
                    in London. It has upon one side a finely-proportioned Doric front, with three
                    rusticated arches, one forming the entrance to a large and splendid vestibule,
                    composed of thirty-two columns, from which spring richly ornamented groined
                    arches. The architectural beauty of this arcade attracts universal admiration.
                    In the eastern wing is the new room 94 feet in length and 51 in width, in which
                    are to be found the papers relating to knowledge in general, of either politics
                    or commerce, that are issued in the several countries of the globe. Over this is
                    another apartment, used by the insurance-brokers and underwriters, where
                    insurances of shipping are effected. The rest of the building is used as
                    offices, and the exterior consists of large and convenient warehouses.</p>
                <p>In the centre of the area a splendid bronze monument to the memory of Lord Nelson
                    was erected in 1813. It stands on a circular marble basement, at the top of
                    which is the principal figure, in an erect attitude, receiving from Victory a
                    fourth naval crown, whilst Death is aiming the fatal blow from under the folds
                    of the enemy’s flag, whilst <pb break="no" facs="nls:193206558"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0713-6558-0395"/>a sailor is seen grasping a battle-axe about to
                    revenge the death of a hero, and Britannia leaning on her spear, with laurels in
                    her hand, seems overwhelmed with a sense of her loss, and apparently regardless
                    of her glory. The pedestal is beautifully adorned with designs in bas-relief,
                    descriptive of some of the admiral’s great naval battles. The whole is a fine
                    piece of workmanship, executed by Westmacott, from a design by Wyat, and the
                    expense, about L. 9000, was collected by public subscription.</p>
                <p>The Sessions-house is a fine building, with a front of i74 feet in length. Its
                    architecture is a specimen of simple elegance, whilst the interior is skilfully
                    contrived to form an excellent court of justice, with easy access, and
                    appropriate places for the magistrates, council, attorneys, witnesses, jurors,
                    and prisoners. It contains also convenient apartments for committees, and a
                    gallery for auditors.</p>
                <p>A new custom-house was begun to be erected in 1828, and is now nearly finished.
                    It is a large and magnificent building of fine freestone, of the Ionic order of
                    architecture. It is composed of three facades rising from a rusticated basement.
                    The porticoon the north front forms the principal entrance, and is 470 feet in
                    length, and the wings from north to south are each 220 feet. When the interior
                    is finished it will be one of the most convenient, as it now is one of the most
                    splendid edifices in the kingdom; and the Excise-office will be removed to and
                    occupy a part of it, which will give great facility to both the revenue
                    departments, as well as to the merchants and masters of the trading vessels.</p>
                <p>The Dock-office, the Public Baths, where cold, tepid, vapour, and sulphur baths
                    are always ready; the Corn-exchange, where sales of grain are made; are all, as
                    buildings and as conveniences, worthy of observation.</p>
                <p>The whole town of Liverpool constitutes but one parish. The mother church,
                    dedicated to St Nicholas, is said to be on a site with a chapel built at the
                    time of the Norman Conquest, but to have been kept by repairs in a state for
                    public worship till 1774, when it was rebuilt. It is chiefly to be noticed on
                    account of an accident which happened to it in 1810. Whilst the bells were
                    calling the congregation to the morning service, the tower fell down upon the
                    body of the church. Few adults were yet seated, but the children of a charity
                    school had entered when the tower fell. Twenty-eight persons were taken out from
                    among the ruins, of whom twenty-three were dead, or expired soon afterwards, and
                    seventeen were of the charity children. A new tower has since been erected, in
                    the ornamental Gothic style, which is a fine object, 180 feet high, and
                    furnished with a peal of twelve bells.</p>
                <p>Besides this there are twenty-seven other churches, and two chapels, in the
                    Docks, for the adherents of the established religion. Many of them are elegant,
                    most of them recently erected, and all commodious and spacious. They are capable
                    of seating from 1200 to 2000 persons each, and in most of them the free sittings
                    bear a very great proportion to the whole of the seats. In one of these, St
                    David’s, the service is performed in the Welsh language.</p>
                <p>If our limits allowed it, many of these would be entitled to elaborate
                    descriptions, but it can or ly here be said that, in combination with their
                    spires, they produce a very striking effect on the appearance of the place,
                    whether looked at in walking the streets, or viewed from the gallery of the
                    Town-Hall, or any similar height. Some other churches are now building or
                    projecting.</p>
                <p>The several classes who differ from the established religion have their
                    respective places of public worship. The Roman Catholics have five chapels, one
                    of them a handsome Gothic edifice in Hawk Street, and another, equally spacious
                    and neat, in Seal Street; the remainder are less striking, and are attended
                    chiefly by the Irish of the lower classes. There are two churches of the Scotch
                    establish-1 ment, and two for seceders from it. The Wesleyan Me- " thodists,
                    including their several sections or subdivisions, have twelve places of worship;
                    one in Pit Street is large and commodious, and furnished with an organ; another
                    in Moss Street is spacious, with rows of seats one above another like a theatre.
                    The others, though of somewhat less dimensions, are neat and clean. The
                    Independents have five chapels, one of which, the largest, in Great George
                    Street, is a very spacious building, capable of seating 2000 persons; and being
                    very commodiously arranged, the galleries contain nearly 1000 children of a
                    Sunday school. One of the other chapels belongs to the Welsh Independents. There
                    arc eight chapels belonging to the different sections of Anabaptists, three to
                    Welsh Calvinists, two to Unitarians, one each to the Quakers, to the
                    Sandemanians, and the Swedenborgeans, and the Jews have also a synagogue. There
                    is also a place of public worship for converted Jews. Several of the places of
                    worship have their separate burying-grounds, and most of them, like all the
                    churches of the established religion, have charity schools, either on Sundays or
                    week days, or both.</p>
                <p>Very few of the churches have burying-grounds attached to them, but an extensive
                    cemetery has been formed, with the chapel of St James’s within it for reading
                    the funeral service. The ground contains 44,000 square yards, and was originally
                    the stone quarry from which much of the materials for the buildings of the town
                    was drawn. It is laid out with taste, and kept in good order, and recently a
                    handsome house has been erected for the officiating minister. There is another
                    cemetery at Low Hill, which is open for the entombment of persons of every
                    religious denomination.</p>
                <p>Besides the institutions for communicating religious instruction, Liverpool is
                    not deficient in others for the promotion of general knowledge, and the
                    diffusion of a taste for the fine arts, and other objects which give grace to
                    human society. One of these is the Liverpool Royal Institution in Colquit
                    Street. It was first opened in 1817, with an appropriate address from that
                    celebrated and estimable native of the town, the late William Roscoe. On the
                    ground-floor there is an elegantly furnished reading-room, ornamented with
                    several ancient paintings, formerly part of Mr Roscoe’s collection, the
                    production of the early masters, shewing the progress of the art to the
                    commencement of the fifteenth century. The apartment is provided with a library,
                    and most of the periodical works. In connexion with it is a lecture-room, 30
                    ſect by 50, with seats for pupils in an ascending order. The upper stories are
                    formed into a museum, containing collections of natural history, casts of the
                    Elgin marbles, and of other Grecian antiquities, and a few specimens of
                    statuary.</p>
                <p>There are other institutions for the diffusion of knowledge, which may be noticed
                    without entering into the minute details of their more peculiar objects. These
                    are the School of Arts for the benefit of the artizans of the town; the
                    Athenaeum, a library of 14,000 volumes, with a newsroom; the Lyceum, with a
                    library of 30,000 volumes, and a spacious and elegant news-room; the Union
                    News-room, with a select library, and an apartment used as a school of arts, in
                    which lectures are delivered; the Apprentices’ Library, and the Law Library,
                    whose names designate the purposes to which they are applied. The Blue-coat
                    Hospital was founded 125 years ago, and then maintained, taught, and clothed 40
                    boys and 10 girls, and the number is now increased to 350 of the two sexes.
                    There are besides upwards of twenty free day-schools, mostly supported by
                    bequests from, or subscriptions by, the members of the Established Church, and
                    the children are instructed in the doctrines and worship adopted by it. One of
                    these is a Welsh school, with 300 boys and 100 girls. The dissenters <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193206571" xml:id="kp-eb0713-6571-0396"/> of every class
                    are not behind their neighbours in providing means of education for the poorer
                    members of their communion. The Wesleyan Methodists have more than 1000 children
                    in the schools connected with their chapels, and the other sectaries display an
                    equal degree of zeal, in proportion to their numbers, in this cause. There are
                    six infant schools established, where those too young to receive much
                    instruction are amused, kept from mischief, and are taught to acquire docility
                    before they become prepared to enter the free schools.</p>
                <p>The Infirmary is a public hospital, open to patients of every age, country,
                    complexion, or creed. It is a fine building, capable of receiving 220 patients,
                    if its funds were more ample than they are at present, of which the expectation
                    is sanguinely indulged. There are two dispensaries, where advice from the ablest
                    medical men can be obtained, and where medicines are supplied gratuitously every
                    day. There are besides, a lunatic asylum, two ophthalmic institutions, an
                    institution for relieving diseases of the ear, a marine humane society, an
                    institution for teaching the deaf and dumb, a female penitentiary, and above
                    all, the Blind Asylum, in which 120 beings are maintained and instructed, and
                    occupied in such employments as are suitable to their melancholy condition.</p>
                <p>Like other large towns, Liverpool has its places of amusement. The Theatre-Royal
                    was built in 1772, and was enlarged in 1803. There is also an amphitheatre for
                    equestrian and pantomimic performances, which open in some months of each year.
                    A little but neat theatre has also been built in Church Street, for exhibiting
                    dramatic pieces.</p>
                <p>The Wellington Rooms, opened in 1816, are adapted for balls and for public
                    dinners, or other social assemblies, having a ball, supper, and card room of
                    elegant appearance, and tastefully furnished.</p>

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Liverpool,</hi><hi rend="italic">Charles Jenkinson, first
                    Earl of,</hi> was the eldest son of Colonel Jenkinson, the representative of a
                    family which had been settled at Walcot, near Charlbury, Oxfordshire, for above
                    a century. Mr Jenkinson received his education at the Charter-house School, and
                    at the University of Oxford. In early life he published verses on the death of
                    Frederick prince of Wales, a dissertation on the establishment of a national and
                    constitutional force in England, independently of a standing army, and a
                    discourse on the conduct of government respecting neutral nations. In 1761,
                    having obtained an introduction to the Earl of Bute, he became one of the under
                    secretaries of state, and in the same year was returned to parliament for
                    Cockermouth. In 1763, he was appointed joint secretary to the treasury, and
                    having shared with Lord Bute the marked favour of his majesty Geor III. he, on
                    that nobleman’s sudden retirement from office, became a conspicuous member of
                    the party then commonly called the King’s Friends. On the accession to power of
                    the Rockingham administration, in 1765, he resigned his public appointments; but
                    about the same period he was nominated auditor of accounts to the
                    Princess-dowager of Wales. In 1766 he was appointed a lord of the admiralty by
                    the Grafton administration; and the following year he became a lord of the
                    treasury. Under Lord North’s government new honours awaited this steady aspirant
                    for promotion. In 1772, he was appointed one of the vice-treasurers of Ireland;
                    and, in 1775, he was allowed to purchase the patent office of clerkship of the
                    pells in that country. He afterwards succeeded Lord Cadogan as master of the
                    mint; and, in 1778, he became secretary at war. In 1783, he became a member of
                    the Board of Trade; and, in 1785, he published his Collection of all the
                    Treaties of Peace, Alliance, and Commerce, between Great Britain and other
                    Powers, from the treatypf Munster in 1648 to the treaties signed at Paris in
                    1783. In 1786, he was made chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster; called up to
                    the House of Lords by the style and title of Baron Hawkesbury of Hawkesbury, in
                    the county of Gloucester; and appointed president of the Board of Trade. The
                    commerce of the country formed a prominent object of attention to Lord
                    Hawkesbury, and though his theoretical views were confined, his practical
                    knowledge was extensive. He is said to have drawn up the commercial treaty with
                    America, and to have facilitated the establishment of the South Sea fishery, to
                    which he had been the first to direct the attention of the government. In 1796,
                    his personal honours were carried <hi rend="italic">au comble</hi> by his
                    advancement to the dignity of Earl of Liverpool. His lordship was twice married,
                    and had two sons and a daughter. After obtaining his earldom, he rarely quitted
                    his retirement; but whenever he spoke in the House of Peers, the extent and
                    accuracy of his information, particularly on commercial subjects, procured him
                    marked attention. In 1805, he addressed a letter to the king on the coins of the
                    realm, containing a concise and distinct statement of most of the facts
                    deserving of notice in the history of British coinage. Lord Liverpool died on
                    the 17th of December 1808. <hi rend="smallcaps">(a.)</hi><hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Liverpool,</hi><hi rend="italic">Robert Banks Jenkinson, second Earl of,</hi>
                    son of the preceding, was born on the 7th of June 1770. At an early age he was
                    placed at an academy at Parson’s Green, near Fulham, where he remained until his
                    thirteenth year; he was then removed to the Charter-house School, where he
                    continued between two and three years; and soon after leaving the Charter-house,
                    he was entered as a student at Christ Church College, Oxford. Mere he became
                    acquainted with Mr Canning, the most distinguished of his contemporaries, and
                    formed for him a friendship which proved of an unusually permanent character,
                    and had more than once an important influence on the fortunes of Mr Canning’s
                    public life. About the period of the breaking out of the French revolution, Mr
                    Jenkinson paid a visit to Paris, and was in that capital when the Bastille was
                    demolished. This sudden ebullition of popular fury against one of the
                    strongholds of tyranny, and some other excesses which he is said to have
                    witnessed in the streets of Paris, appear to have excited in his mind
                    apprehensions which clouded his judgment, and led him to form the most distorted
                    and incorrect notions of the events which the progress of the revolution evolved
                    in France. Soon after his return to England, he was introduced to parliament as
                    one of the representatives of Rye, and took his seat under the avowed patronage
                    of the minister, Mr Pitt. On the 27th of February 1792, he made his first
                    speech, in opposition to certain resolutions proposed by Mr Whitbread, on the
                    subject of the claim urged by the Czarina Catherine to the fortress of Ockzakow
                    and the adjoining territory. His address was praised as manifesting considerable
                    knowledge of the question in dispute, as well as of the affairs and prospects of
                    Europe generally; and as the protege of a powerful minister always finds
                    indulgent critics, it was prognosticated that Mr Jenkinson would rise to be a
                    distinguished parliamentary speaker, and an efficient member of the British
                    cabinet. His next public appearance was one which reflects no honour on his
                    memory. His father had been one of the opponents of the abolition of the
                    slave-trade in the House of Commons; and the son was scarcely warm in his seat
                    in the House of Commons, when he joined the ranks of those who, without
                    venturing to defend the principle, sought to perpetuate the practice of this
                    enormous iniquity. On the 2d of April 1792, Mr Wilberforce moved, in a committee
                    of the whole house, “that the trade <pb break="no" facs="nls:193206584"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0713-6584-0397"/>carried on by British subjects for the purpose of
                    obtaining slaves on the coast of Africa, ought to be abolished.” This was met by
                    an insidious suggestion of Mr Dundas, who proposed to insert the word
                    “gradually,” before the word “abolished ;” but Mr Jenkinson, whose zeal was too
                    hot to be satisfied with mere evasion, moved “that the chairman should leave the
                    chair.” The amendment was, however, rejected by a large majority, and Mr
                    Dundas’s more adroit proposition agreed to. Never, perhaps, was so much splendid
                    oratory displayed in the House of Commons, as in the debate which followed on Mr
                    Wilberforce’s motion.</p>
                <p>Mr Jenkinson’s next appearance was in a more prominent and less questionable
                    position. The king of France had been deposed, and the British ambassador, Lord
                    Gower, recalled. On the 15th of December 1792, Mr Fox moved an address to the
                    king, praying that a minister might be sent to Paris to treat with the
                    provisional government of France, touching such points as might be in discussion
                    between his majesty and his allies, and the French nation. In the temporary
                    absence of Mr Pitt, who had vacated his seat by accepting the wardenship of the
                    Cinque Ports, Mr Jenkinson replied to Mr Fox, in a speech which, though warmly
                    complimented by Burke, is more remarkable for rambling and vehement declamation,
                    than any quality of a higher order. Mr Fox was much more effectually answered by
                    an overwhelming majority. His motion was negatived without a division. In April
                    1793, Mr Jenkinson was appointed one of the commissioners of the India Board;
                    and on the 6th of May he stood forward in opposition to Mr Grey’s memorable
                    motion on the subject of parliamentary reform, defending the state of the
                    representation as it then stood, and maintaining that the House of Commons,
                    constituted as it was, answered all the ends for which it had been designed. On
                    the 6th March 1794, he opposed Mr Grey’s motion for an address to the king,
                    expressive of the concern of the House that his majesty should have formed an
                    alliance with powers whose apparent aim was to regulate the affairs of a country
                    with which they had no right to interfere. On the 10th of April, he undertook a
                    more difficult task, namely, to justify the measures of the ministry, and to
                    palliate the failure of the army commanded by the Duke of York at Dunkirk. Mr
                    Jenkinson was long twitted in parliament and elsewhere, with an observation
                    which fell from him on this occasion. He declared that “the marching to Paris
                    was attainable and practicable; and that he, for one, would recommend such an
                    expedition.” The ridicule which this excited was unbounded; it became a stock
                    topic of derision. “The conquest of France !” says Mr Fox, in his letter to the
                    electors of Westminster. “Oh, calumniated crusaders, how rational and moderate
                    were your objects! Oh, tame and feeble Cervantes, with what a timid pencil and
                    faint colours have you painted the portrait of a disordered imagination !” Yet,
                    such are the accidents of war and fortune, Mr Jenkinson, contrary to all human
                    probability, lived to see his notion realized; and what seemed, in the year
                    1794, like a sick man’s dream, or the vision of a disordered imagination, was
                    effected in 1814, and repeated in little more than a year afterwards. On the
                    30th of May 1794, he made one of his best efforts, in opposition to Mr Fox’s
                    motion for putting an end to the war with France. This was perhaps the most
                    active period of his life.</p>
                <p>In the next session, Mr Jenkinson was absent from his place in parliament, love
                    having superseded politics. On the 25th of March 1795, he married the third
                    daughter of the Earl of Bristol and Bishop of Derry. At the opening of the
                    session of 1796, the address was seconded by Mr Stewart, afterwards Lord
                    Castlereagh, in the first speech delivered by him in the House of Commons. He
                    was answered by Mr Sheridan, who strongly censured ministers, at the same time
                    advising them to declare themselves willing to treat with the French republic.
                    Mr Jenkinson replied to Mr Sheridan, repeating his former arguments in
                    justification of the government measures. Upon commercial subjects Mr Jenkinson
                    entered with confidence, conceiving, perhaps, that he had some claims to
                    “hereditary knowledge.” On Mr Grey’s motion in the House of Commons (10th of
                    March 1796) for an inquiry into the state of the nation, he descanted on the
                    effect of the war upon our commerce, contending that, notwithstanding its
                    pressure, the situation of Great Britain, in a commercial point of view, was
                    more prosperous than at any preceding period. On the 28th of May 1796, Mr
                    Jenkinson participated in the honours of his family, exchanging its surname for
                    his father’s second title of Lord Hawkesbury. When the great measure of the
                    legislative union with Ireland was proposed, it received his entire concurrence.
                    The subject was introduced by a message from the crown, on the 22d of January
                    1799; and, in the discussion which ensued, Lord Hawkesbury warmly supported the
                    views of government respecting it.</p>
                <p>The circumstances which attended the temporary retirement of Mr Pitt from power
                    early in 1801, are too well known to render it necessary to say any thing
                    respecting them. In the new ministry, the formation of which was announced on
                    the 14th of March, with Mr Addington at its head, Lord Hawkesbury was appointed
                    to the office of secretary of state for the foreign department, and took a
                    prominent part in the debates which ensued. The great business of the succeeding
                    summer and autumn consisted in the adjustment of preliminaries of peace with
                    France. Lord Hawkesbury, as foreign secretary, was of course intrusted with the
                    interests of Great Britain in the negotiations which followed the signature of
                    the preliminaries; and, on the 28th of March 1802, a definitive treaty of peace
                    was concluded at Amiens between the French republic, the king of Spain, and the
                    Batavian republic, on the one hand, and the king of Great Britain and Ireland on
                    the other. In the important debate on this peace, which took place on the 13th
                    ofMay 1802, Lord Hawkesbury defended the treaty at great length, in a speech
                    which was considered as the ablest that had been delivered in either house of
                    parliament on the ministerial side. He also distinguished himself by the part he
                    acted in reference to the remonstrances of the First Consul respecting the
                    strictures made on his person and conduct by the newspaper press of Britain;
                    and, in the correspondence which ensued with Μ. Otto, he ably vindicated the
                    public character andliberties of his country. The evil complained of, though
                    certainly calculated to keep alive national animosities, and to provoke a
                    renewal of the war, was not one for which the government could afford any
                    redress. The constitution of this country admits of no previous restraint upon
                    publications of any description. But there exist judicatures, wholly independent
                    of the executive government, capable of taking cognizance of such publications
                    as the law deems to be criminal, not only of libels against the government and
                    magistracy of this kingdom, but also of publications defamatory of those in
                    whose hands the administration of foreign governments is placed To these the
                    French minister was with strict constitutional propriety referred. For, as the
                    government of this country neither enjoys nor requires any other protection than
                    that which is afforded by the laws, it could never be expected to consent to
                    new-model laws, or to change its constitution, in order to gratify the wishes of
                    a foreign power. In October, Lord Hawkesbury, in his turn, remonstrated against
                    the occupation of Switzerland by the French under Ney, in order to enforce the
                    reception of a new constitution for that country, prepared by the First Consul
                    in his own cabinet. This he did in a note addressed to Μ. Otto, in which he
                    expressed the deep regret excited in the breast of his majesty by the
                    proclamation of the First Consul to <pb break="no" facs="nls:193206597"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0713-6597-0398"/>the Helvetic people, and declared that his majesty
                    could view the recent exertions of the Swiss cantons in no other light than as
                    the lawful efforts of a brave and generous people to recover their ancient laws
                    and government, and to procure the re-establishment of a system not only
                    favourable to their domestic happiness, but perfectly consistent with the
                    tranquillity and security of other powers.</p>
                <p>At this period, the management of the House of Commons had, in a great measure,
                    devolved on Lord Hawkesbury, who, of course, spoke on every topic involving the
                    character of the administration, as well as on the political questions which
                    were brought under the consideration of the House of Commons. At the opening of
                    next session, he was called to the House of Lords by writ, as a peer’s eldest
                    son; but the only measure of importance which in that session he brought forward
                    in the new situation in the legislature where he had been placed to defend the
                    measures of ministers, was the volunteer consolidation bill. About the same
                    time, he addressed a circular to the ministers of foreign courts resident in
                    London, disclaiming indignantly the charge that his majesty’s government had
                    been a party to plans of assassination, and describing the recent seizure and
                    execution of the Duke d’Enghien as “a sanguinary deed, perpetrated by the direct
                    order of the First Consul, in violation of the rights of nations, and in
                    contempt of the most simple laws of humanity and honour.” That the British
                    government were innocent of the crime imputed to them, is beyond a doubt. But,
                    on the other hand, it cannot be denied that the life of the First Consul had
                    been openly attempted in the streets of Paris; that Pichegru, Cadondal, and
                    their associates, avowedly meditated assassination; that these conspirators had
                    been landed on the coast of France by an English vessel, commanded by an English
                    captain; that the English press continued to revile in unmeasured terms the head
                    of the French government, if not to insinuate that taking him off would be a
                    meritorious act; and that, consequently, appearances unhappily seemed to give
                    some ground to the charge which the First Consul preferred against the
                    government of the country, in justification of a deed which, however it may be
                    viewed, was, if not the greatest crime, at all events the greatest error, he
                    ever committed.</p>
                <p>On the 12th of May, the administration was dissolved, by the resignation of Mr
                    Addington; Mr Pitt returned to the head of the ministry, and Lord Hawkesbury
                    received the seals of the home department. The renewal of the war being now
                    inevitable, the first effort of the new government was to place the military
                    establishments of the country on a more enlarged and efficient footing; and with
                    this view, Lord Hawkesbury exerted himself in the House of Lords in support of
                    the additional force bill. At a later period of the session, Mr Wilberforce
                    renewed his attempts to put an end to the detestable traffic in human flesh, and
                    a bill for that purpose passed the House of Commons; but, on its transmission to
                    the House of Peers, it was postponed, on the motion of Lord Hawkesbury, for more
                    mature investigation in the ensuing session. The pretext was worthy of the cause
                    in favour of which it was employed. On the 10th of May 1805, Lord Grenville
                    moved the order of the day for taking into consideration the petitions of the
                    Roman Catholics of Ireland. This motion Lord Hawkesbury also opposed. He would
                    neither consent to break the fetters of the enslaved African, nor agree to
                    remove the disabilities which placed millions of our fellow-subjects beyond the
                    pale of the constitution. In the autumn of 1805, Mr Pitt retired to Bath, his
                    health being then in a state of rapid decline. On the 11th of January 1806, he
                    returned with difficulty to his house at Putney, where he died on the 23d, two
                    days after the meeting of parliament. The death of Mr Pitt afforded Lord
                    Hawkesbury an opportunity of placing himself at the head of the cabinet; but
                    being well acquaint-1 ed with the relative position and strength of parties, his
                    ambition yielded to his good sense, and he declined the' flattering offer. His
                    majesty, however, appointed him to the situation of warden of the Cinque Ports,
                    vacant by the death of Mr Pitt. On the return to power of that minister’s
                    friends in 1807, Lord Hawkesbury resumed his station in the cabinet as home
                    secretary, and took a prominent part in defence of all the measures of
                    government, particularly of the questionable expedition to Copenhagen, and the
                    famous orders in council. Towards the close of 1808, Lord Hawkesbury was, by the
                    death of his father, placed at the head of his family, as second Earl of
                    Liverpool.</p>
                <p>Lord Liverpool was the political heir of Mr Pitt, in all except his talents.
                    Reposing a just confidence in the stability of our institutions, which had
                    safely weathered the conflict with democratical principles, he adhered to the
                    system of his early patron and master; and although Mr Pitt had died despairing
                    of his country, Lord Liverpool was one of those who had the temerity or the
                    courage to brave the concentrated power of imperial France, wielded by the most
                    wonderful genius that any age or country has produced. True to the principle of
                    eternal war with France, as long as a man sprung from the Revolution presided
                    over her destinies, though the prospect was still dark, the immediate peril
                    great, and the future shadowed out by portentous omens, he had still faith in
                    the ultimate approach of a day of crowning triumph; and fortune at length smiled
                    upon counsels which the ordinary inspirations of human wisdom had disclaimed.
                    With these feelings, Lord Liverpool warmly advocated the cause of Spain, in the
                    session which commenced on the 19th of January 1809. His doctrine was based upon
                    the principle of tenacity. He contended that, according to all the lights
                    furnished by history, nations, after maintaining such contests for ten or twenty
                    years, have eventually succeeded, in spite of frequent and severe reverses, in
                    securing the object which they struggled to attain. In <hi rend="italic">a
                    few</hi> days (23d January) he had occasion to move the thanks of the House of
                    Peers to Lord Wellington for his conduct in the Peninsula. This motion
                    especially related to the battle of Vimicro.</p>
                <p>When the quarrel and subsequent duel between Lord Castlereagh and Mr Canning
                    induced both to resign, and led the Duke of Portland to withdraw from his
                    situation as nominal head of the administration, Mr Percival united in name, as
                    he had already done in effect, the offices of first lord of the treasury and
                    chancellor of the exchequer; and, in this new arrangement, Lord Liverpool became
                    secretary of state for the war department. The illness of George HL, the
                    introduction of the regency bill, the difficulties which beset the prince regent
                    in his endeavours to form a new administration, and his final determination to
                    abide by Mr Percival, are all too well known to require any detail. In the two
                    succeeding se'ssions the exertions of Lord Liverpool were unremitting, but not
                    marked by any thing of prominent importance. At length, on the 11th of May 1812,
                    Mr Percival fell by the hand of an assassin, leaving the ministry in so
                    disjointed a state, that, after some abortive negotiations with the Marquis
                    Wellesley and Lords Grey and Grenville, Lord Liverpool yielded to the request of
                    the prince regent, that he would place himself at its head. The only additions
                    made to the ministry upon this occasion were Lord Sidmouth, and Mr Vansittart,
                    afterwards Lord Bexley.</p>
                <p>The first important measure of Lord Liverpool’s government was rendered necessary
                    by the disturbances which had taken place in the manufacturing districts, where,
                    owing to various causes, great distress prevailed; and it assumed the form of a
                    bill to prevent the rioters from pos- <pb break="no" facs="nls:193206610"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0713-6610-0399"/>,sessing themselves of arms, to guard against
                    tumultuary meetings, and to give more extensive jurisdiction to the magistrates
                    of the disturbed districts. Towards the close of the session, his lordship
                    signalised himself by the explicit and unqualified opposition which he gave to a
                    resolution proposed in the House of Lords by Marquis Wellesley, that the house
                    would, early in the next session of parliament, take into consideration the
                    state of the laws affecting the Roman Catholics. Upon this occasion the premier
                    came boldly forward as the champion at once of injustice and intolerance. He
                    would not consent that the question should be entertained in any shape, or that
                    even so much as a hearing should be given to those who were suing to be relieved
                    from the galling and ignominious stigma of bondage. He declared it to be a maxim
                    of his political life, that, with respect to a great constitutional question, if
                    a stand were to be made, it should be made <hi rend="italic">in limine</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> and, in such a code of political morality as that which
                    Lord Liverpool had espoused, there can be no doubt whatever that this is a maxim
                    which Macchiavelli would have himself recommended as the only safe rule of
                    conduct. When free scope is once allowed to formal inquiry, perseverance in
                    injustice is no longer possible. On the 20th of September parliament was
                    dissolved.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile the transactions in Spain and the north of Europe were highly
                    favourable to the cause of legitimacy. In the Peninsula, Ciudad Rodrigo and
                    Badajoz had fallen; the victory of Salamanca had been followed by the advance of
                    Lord Wellington on Madrid; the siege of Cadiz had been abandoned, and the whole
                    south of Spain evacuated by the enemy. In the north of Europe events of a still
                    more decisive character had occurred. The burning of Moscow, and the premature
                    setting in of the frost, had sealed the doom of the French grand army; the
                    former event had rendered retreat inevitable, and the latter soon converted that
                    retreat into a scene of the most appalling horrors and disasters. What the fire
                    had begun, the frost consummated; General Morosow did the work which General
                    Kutusow could never have accomplished; and the Scythian wilderness was covered
                    with the wrecks of that mighty host which had swept onwards in the proud
                    confidence of superior power. These disasters became known in England during the
                    bustle of the elections, and contributed to augment the public confidence in the
                    war policy of ministers, which the elements had thus unexpectedly crowned with
                    success.</p>
                <p>The first session of the new parliament opened on the 28th of November 1812, and
                    closed on the 22d of July 1813. The principal subjects brought under the notice
                    of parliament were, the Marquis Wellesley’s charge against the government, of
                    not affording sufficient force to his brother; a proposition for granting relief
                    to the Russians; an explanation of the causes of the rupture with America; the
                    sinking-fund; the renewal of the East India Company’s charter; and the treaty
                    between Great Britain and Sweden; in the discussion of all which Lord Liverpool
                    took part. The military campaign was one of still greater activity. Lord
                    Wellington, after gaining the battle of Vittoria, taking San Sebastian, and
                    blockading Pampluna, entered France, beat the French on their own ground, and
                    fully established himself on the “sacred territory.” In the north of Europe,
                    where nations rather than armies assembled to combat the French, the campaign
                    opened favourably for the allies; and the subsequent loss of the battle of
                    Leipsig threatened the French emperor with utter ruin. The administration was
                    duly sensible of the importance of the crisis. Parliament was assembled,
                    principally to sanction loans of large amount to foreign powers; and before
                    Christmas it was adjourned until the month of March. In the intoxication of
                    victory, it was to the executive rather than to the legislative body; that the
                    eyes of the country were directed. The government had become omnipotent. The
                    great events which followed were the entrance of the allies into Paris, the
                    abdication of Napoleon, and the signature, on the 30th of May 1814, of a
                    definitive treaty of peace between France and the allied powers. On the 24th of
                    December a treaty was concluded at Ghent, which put an end to the unfortunate
                    contest with America; and thus terminated a year as fortunate for Great Britain
                    as any in her annals.</p>
                <p>But the peace was destined to be short-lived. On the 20th of March 1815,
                    Napoleon, having left Elba, landed in France, marched in a sort of triumphal
                    procession to Paris, drove out the Bourbons, and replaced himself upon the
                    throne, without firing a shot or spilling a single drop of blood. No sooner had
                    intelligence of these astounding events been received, than messages were sent
                    to parliament by the prince regent, and corresponding addresses moved by Lord
                    Liverpool, who, in his speeches, dwelt much on the fortunate circumstance that
                    Napoleon had undertaken his dangerous enterprise whilst the confederacy of the
                    allies remained undisturbed, and they were still in a condition to act in
                    concert. The result is universally known. Britain made gigantic efforts, both
                    financial and military, to overthrow the man whom France had again placed at its
                    head; and she was rewarded by the victory of Waterloo, where Napoleon drained
                    the cup of misfortune to the very dregs. This was ere long followed by the
                    treaty of Paris.</p>
                <p>In the session of 1816 the principal subjects to which Lord Liverpool directed
                    his attention were, the defence of the military establishment, explanations of
                    the recent treaty, the transactions between government and the bank of England,
                    and the state of the silver coinage. The meeting of parliament in 1817 was, from
                    various causes, anticipated with much anxiety. The distress which prevailed
                    amongst the manufacturers had produced disturbances in the inland counties, and
                    a riot had occurred in the metropolis itself. The suspension of Habeas Corpus
                    was proposed by the government; and Lord Liverpool had the unenviable task
                    assigned him of defending that measure in the House of Peers. In seasons of
                    distress, suffering naturally renders men credulous, and there are always
                    persons ready to take advantage of this adjunct of misery; but there is too much
                    reason to suspect that, in many instances, the starving people were first misled
                    and afterwards betrayed by the agency of characters of a still more odious
                    description, who were not altogether unknown to the government. The Catholic
                    question having been brought under the consideration of the House of Lords on
                    the 16th of May, by Lord Donoughmore, the premier restated his opinions
                    concerning it, adding that “if the demands of the Catholics were complied with,
                    the parliament would cease to be a protestant parliament.” At a subsequent
                    period of the session, ministers found it convenient to urge the continuance of
                    the Habeas Corpus suspension act, which Lord Liverpool declared that he called
                    upon parliament to vote, because “he considered the measure essential to the
                    preservation of property and morality.”</p>
                <p>The death of George III. and the accession of George IV., who had already
                    exercised the sovereign power for nearly eight years, made no change in the
                    government, the ministers being immediately reinstated in their several offices.
                    It is unnecessary to enter further into details, which more properly belong to
                    the general history of the time. The principal affairs in which Lord Liverpool
                    took a prominent and leading part were, the proceedings against Queen Caroline,
                    particularly the bill of pains and penalties; the bill for the resumption of
                    cash payments; the conduct of France and the allies in regard to constitu <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193206623" xml:id="kp-eb0713-6623-0400"/> tional Spain; the
                    Catholic bill of 1825, with its two auxiliary measures, commonly termed “wings
                    the state of ’the country, especially of the circulation, produced by the
                    unexampled panic in the money market that followed the blind rage for
                    speculation which distinguished the year 1825; the corn laws; and some other
                    measures of less magnitude and importance. The Earl of Liverpool was in his
                    place in the House of Lords on the 15th of February 1827, having brought down a
                    message from the king recommending a provision for the Duke and Duchess of
                    Clarence; and next day he moved an address expressive of the willingness of the
                    house to comply with his majesty’s request. This was the last occasion upon
                    which his lordship appeared at his post. On the 17th he experienced an
                    apoplectic attack, accompanied with paralysis, which at once prostrated both his
                    mind and body; and, after lingering for a considerable time in a hopeless state,
                    he expired in convulsive agony on the 4th of December 1828.</p>
                <p>The public character of Lord Liverpool belongs to the history of that period,
                    crowded with events of tĥe greatest magnitude, during which he was either an
                    influential member of the British government, or placed at its head; and he will
                    be variously judged, according to the preconceived opinions of those who attempt
                    to decide as to the character of that system of policy of which he was so long a
                    prominent exponent. He was not a man of brilliant genius or excursive fancy, but
                    he possessed useful talents, inflexible perseverance, and unimpeachable
                    integrity, and towards the close of his life manifested a disposition to
                    accommodate his policy to the advancing knowledge and opinions of the age.
                    Excepting on a few points, he was perhaps the least bigoted and impracticable of
                    the party which, after the death of Mr Pitt, recognised him as its head. As to
                    his style of speaking, if it had little to recommend it in the form of
                    eloquence, it commonly impressed the hearer with a conviction that the speaker
                    was in earnest. He was vehement rather than energetic, and more noisy than
                    forcible, but never intemperate. He entertained no angry feelings towards his
                    parliamentary opponents; he never refused to others the tribute of applause
                    which he thought they merited; and his gentlemanly deportment, unruffled by the
                    rude collisions of party warfare, frequently disarmed his fiercest adversaries.
                    In private life Lord Liverpool was justly respected for his amiable deportment
                    and irreproachable conduct; sincere in his religious belief, and unobtrusive in
                    the fulfilment of his duties as a member of society. We are far from
                    entertaining any admiration of the principles of the minister, but it is a
                    pleasing task to render homage to the virtues of the man. <hi rend="smallcaps"
