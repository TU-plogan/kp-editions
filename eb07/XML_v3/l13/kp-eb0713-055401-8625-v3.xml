                    significant corrections to the OCR text, predominantly in cases of confusing "c"
                    and "e." Isolates 90 entries that were mistakenly included at the end of prior
                    entries in v1 and v2. Normalizes ordinal numbers. Separates metadata in
                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,
                    the end fragment is now joined to the start fragment, making a machine-readable
                    word.</change>

                    county of Northumberland, 281 miles from London. The population amounted in 1801
                    to 3355, in 1811 to 4358, in 1821 to 5547, and in 1831 to 6613.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Long Island,</hi> an island of America, belonging to the
                    state of New York, about 120 miles in length and from ten to twenty in breadth.
                    It extends along the coast in.the form of a crescent, and is separated from the
                    mainland by a bay which communicates with∙the sea at both ends, called Long
                    Island Sound. The southern and western parts are generally of a light soil,
                    which, when well manured, produces excellent crops of grain, especially Indian
                    corn. Towards the east and north the land becomes hilly, and the soil much
                    stronger, and a large quantity of wood is there raised to supply the city of New
                    York. A considerable portion has been laid out in orchards and nurseries, and,
                    from the general high state of cultivation in this island, it has sometimes been
                    called the garden of the United States. It is divided into three counties,
                    King’s, Queen’s, and Suffolk, and possesses many thriving towns and villages,
                    the principal of which are Brooklyn, Jamaica, Sag Harbour, Flatbush, Flushing,
                    Satauket, and Huntington. Brooklyn, the chief town, is a large and thriving
                    place, situated opposite the city of New York, with which a regular
                    communication is kept up by means of steam. It is a compact and handsome town,
                    having several public buildings, various manufactories, a bank, and an extensive
                    trade. To the north-east is the United States navyyard. The population of the
                    town in 1830 was 15,394, and that of the whole island 69,775.</p>

                    circumference, situated off the coast of Papua, between the ocean and Mysore

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Long,</hi><hi rend="italic">Roger·,</hi> master of Pembroke
                    Hall in Cambridge, Lowndes professor of astronomy in that university, rector of
                    Cherryhinton in Huntingdonshire, and of Bradwell <hi rend="subscript"> t</hi>
                    ∕wxta <hi rend="italic">mare</hi> in Essex, was author of a treatise of
                    astronomy, and the inventor of a curious astronomical machine. The latter is
                    thus described by himself: “I have, in a room lately built in Pembroke Hall,
                    erected a sphere of eighteen feet diameter, wherein above thirty persons may sit
                    conveniently. The entrance into it is over the south pole by six steps; the
                    frame of the sphere consists of a number of iron meridians, not complete
                    semicircles, the northern ends of which are screwed to a large round plate of
                    brass, with a hole in the centre of it. Through this hole, from a beam in the
                    ceiling, comes the north pole, a round iron rod about three inches long, and
                    supports the upper parts of the sphere to its proper elevation for the latitude
                    of Cambridge. The lower part of the sphere, so much of it as is invisible in
                    England, is cut off; and the lower or southern ends of the meridians, or
                    truncated semicircles, terminate on and are screwed down to <hi rend="italic"
                    >a</hi> strong circle of oak, of about thirteen feet diameter, which, when the
                    sphere is put into motion, runs upon large rollers of lignum-vitae, in the
                    manner that the tops of some windmills are made to turn round. Upon the iron
                    meridians is fixed a zodiac of tin painted blue, whereon the ecliptic and
                    heliocentric orbits of the planets are drawn, and the constellations and stars
                    traced. When it is made use of, a planetarium will be placed in the middle
                    thereof. The whole, with the floor, is well supported by a frame of large
                    timber.” Dr Long published a Commencement Sermon in 1728, and an answer to Dr
                    Galley’s pamphlet on Greek Accents; and he died on the 16th of December 1770, at
                    the age of ninety-one.</p>
