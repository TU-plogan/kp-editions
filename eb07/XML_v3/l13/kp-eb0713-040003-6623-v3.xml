                <p><label type="entry">LIVIUS, <hi rend="smallcaps">Titus</hi></label>, the most
                    celebrated of the Roman historians, was descended from an illustrious family
                    which had given several consuls to Rome. Only a few particulars of his life have
                    been transmitted to us. He was born at Patavium, now <hi rend="italic"
                    >Padua,</hi> in the north of Italy, B. c. 59, the year before Cicero was driven
                    into banishment; and died, at the advanced age of ninety-six, <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a. d.</hi> 18, the same year as Ovid. He resided during the
                    greater part of his life at Rome; and, if we may credit a statement of Suetonius
                    <hi rend="italic">(in Claud.</hi> 41), became the instructor of the Emperor
                    Claudius. His history was written partly at Rome and partly at Naples, and it is
                    said that his reputation was so widely diffused, that a native of Gades, now <hi
                    rend="italic">Cadiz,</hi> in Spain, actually visited Rome for no other purpose
                    than to have the pleasure of forming an acquaintance with the historian. (Plin.
                    <hi rend="italic">Ep. fi.</hi> 3.) From some inscriptions found at Padua in
                    1413, it has been asserted that Livy was twice married, had two sons and four
                    daughters; but this must rest merely on conjecture, as there were no doubt many
                    of the same name in Padua. Seneca (Prooem. v. <hi rend="italic">Controu.),</hi>
                    indeed, states that one of his daughters was married to L. Magius the
                    rhetorician.</p>
                <p>Besides his history, we are acquainted with the titles of three other works of
                    which he was the author; but not a fragment of them has been preserved. These
                    were, <hi rend="italic">Epistola</hi><hi rend="italic">ad Eilium scripta,</hi>
                    mentioned by Quintilian (i. 10); <hi rend="italic">Dialogi,</hi> which Seneca
                    <hi rend="italic">(Epist.</hi> c.) hesitates whether he ought to class amongst
                    historical or philosophical works; and <hi rend="italic">Libri</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">ex</hi><hi rend="italic">professo Philosophiam continentes.</hi>
                    The loss, however, of these works, is less a subject of regret than that of the
                    greater part of his <hi rend="italic">Roman History,</hi> or, as he himself
                    modestly entitles it, <hi rend="italic">Annals of the Roman people.</hi> This
                    work extends from the building of the city to the year 744 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >(b. c.</hi> 9), when Drusus was carrying on war in Germany, and in which he
                    died. Livy undertook this work probably at the suggestion of Augustus, when he
                    was already far advanced in years. It consisted of 142 books, of which only
                    thirty-five remain; and some of these (lib. xli. xliii. xliv. xlv.) are in a
                    very imperfect state. The first ten contain the history of Rome from its
                    foundation to the year of the city 460, the others (xxi.-xlv.) from 536 to 586,
                    or from the beginning of the second Punic war to the end of the wars with
                    Perseus and Gentius. Of the remaining books we possess only short epitomes,
                    which have been supposed, though without any sufficient reason, to have been
                    composed by the writer Florus. It would appear that a complete copy of Livy’s
                    History existed at the beginning of the sixteenth century; but all attempts to
                    discover it have hitherto proved unavailing. Some fragments have indeed been
                    found, and published at Rome, by Niebuhr (1820); but they are few and
                    unimportant. There is, indeed, no loss that has befallen us in Roman literature
                    at all to be compared to that which has left this history imperfect.</p>
                <p>Livy follows a chronological arrangement in his history, and, like Dionysius of
                    Halicarnassus, has adopted the Ca-tonian era for his basis. He therefore
                    supposed the city of Rome to have been founded <hi rend="smallcaps">b. c.</hi>
                    751, whereas Varro placed it two years earlier, <hi rend="smallcaps">b. c.</hi>
                    753. The sources from which he derived his information, more particularly for
                    the earlier parts of his history, seem less worthy of belief, though he probably
                    had recourse to the best within his reach. All the more ancient historical
                    records had no doubt disappeared, and he could therefore only be acquainted with
                    their statements through the medium of later annalists. For this early period he
                    had recourse to the <pb break="no" facs="nls:193206636"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0713-6636-0401"/>works of no Greek historian, unless we include
                    amongst them that of L. Cincius Alimentas, who, though a Roman, wrote in the
                    Greek language. This author served in the second Punic war, and he is called by
                    Livy (vii. 3) a most diligent investigator of ancient monuments. In the early
                    part of the war he fell into the hands of Hannibal, and from him he received an
                    account of his passage through Gaul and across the Alps, which he incorporated
                    in his history. To the works of this writer Livy acknowledges himself much
                    indebted. As to the sources from which he drew his materials for the second
                    decade (xi.-xx.), which is lost, all that can be said is only matter of
                    conjecture; but we know that Polybius was the principal writer whom he
                    consulted, and that he followed that writer generally both in the arrangement of
                    his materials and in the development of the story. It is not a sufficient answer
                    to this that Livy seldom alludes to Polybius as his authority, since he does not
                    think it necessary to cite the writer upon whom he depends for his information,
                    unless on occasions where there is a difference of opinion. There is no doubt,
                    that wherever he has adopted the statements of Polybius, we may place perfect
                    confidence in the account; and yet, where they differ, we must not condemn Livy,
                    who evidently consulted Roman authorities of undoubted credibility, and who may,
                    upon due examination, have come to the conclusion that Polybius was mistaken.
                    The difference in the accounts given by the two historians of Hannibal’s passage
                    across the Alps is an example of this, though the balance of probability is
                    greatly in favour of that of Polybius.</p>
                <p>Livy has been accused of a wilful perversion of the truth, of an undue partiality
                    for his own country, and a desire to recommend himself to the favour of the
                    nobility, by flattering their pride by the manner in which he records the deeds
                    of their ancestors. But if he represents the characters of his countrymen in a
                    different light from other writers, might he not suppose himself better able to
                    appreciate their conduct? and if his love of country led him to conceal whatever
                    might be prejudicial to them in the eyes of posterity, it was a fault for which
                    he may be forgiven, though it certainly must be allowed to detract considerably
                    from the value of his work. He has been accused also of superstition, because he
                    has reported faithfully all the prodigies and omens in which those early ages
                    abounded, and which seemed to have formed the principal part of their religion;
                    but he has several times observed, that he narrates those wonderful events
                    because he found them in the ancient annalists whom he consulted, without
                    meaning to vouch for their accuracy. Livy was evidently gifted by nature with a
                    brilliant talent for narration, and for seizing the characteristic features of
                    humanity. He was a poet, though without the power or perhaps the love of
                    versifying. His rhetorical powers, too, were of the highest order; and, in the
                    palmy state of the republic, he would have ranked amongst the first orators of
                    his age. The periods of Livy are full and well rounded, in imitation of the
                    style of Cicero; and indeed the age in which he lived would have tolerated no
                    other mode of writing. It is strange that there should be any difficulty in
                    discovering the political sentiments of the historian; but he felt that he was
                    writing under the eye of a despot, however amiable, and he thought himself
                    obliged to suppress many sentiments to which he would in other circumstances
                    have given utterance. He was fully sensible of the degeneracy of his own days,
                    and was glad to forget it by reviving the recollection of all that was glorious
                    and noble in the past. He might also imagine that he could excite in the breasts
                    of his countrymen a desire to emulate the heroic deeds of their ancestors, and
                    might thus be the means of restoring the constitution of his country to its
                    ancient form and strength. It is said that Augustus accused him of being too
                    favourable to the party of Pompey (Tacit. <hi rend="italic">Ann.</hi> iv. 34);
                    and we may therefore conclude that he was in his heart a partisan of the
                    republic. It has been much disputed what Asinius Pollio <hi rend="italic"
                    >[Quintil.</hi> viii. 1) meant by the accusation he brought against Livy of
                    Patavinity <hi rend="italic">[Patavinitas)</hi>; but it seems the most likely
                    conjecture that it was some provincialism in the language and style, perceptible
                    to the refined ear <hi rend="italic">of</hi> a Roman critic, though we can no
                    longer discern it.</p>
                <p>Livy’s History was first printed at Rome, about the year 1469, by Sweynheym and
                    Pannartz, in folio. Of this rare edition Lord Spencer is in possession of a fine
                    copy; but the most exquisite one is that printed on vellum, which formerly
                    belonged to the Imperial Library at Vienna, but was afterwards acquired by a
                    private collector in England. Amongst the subsequent editions of the history may
                    be mentioned that of Gronovius, “cum notis variorum et suis,” Leyden, 1679, in
                    three vols. 8vo; that of Leclerc, Amsterdam, 1709, in,ten vols. 12mo; that of
                    Crevier, Paris, 17 35, in six vols. 4to; that of Drakenborch, Amsterdam, 1738,
                    in seven vols. 4to, reprinted at Stuttgardt, 1820- 1827, in fifteen vols. 8vo;
                    that of Ruddiman, Edinburgh, 1751, in four vols. 12mo; that of Homer, London,
                    1794, in eight vols. 8vo; that of Oxford, 1800, in six vols. 8vo; and that of
                    Ruperti, Göttingen, 1807, in six vols. 8vo. The edition of the first five books
                    of Livy, by Dr John Hunter of St Andrews, Cupar Fife, 1822, is remarkable for
                    its great accuracy, and is accompanied with English notes, in which are treated
                    some of the most refined principles of philology. (See Lachmann, F. <hi

                    about 240 years before the Christian era. He was the first who turned the
                    personal satires and Fescennine verses, so long the admiration of the Romans,
                    into the form of a proper dialogue and regular play. Though the character of a
                    player, so valued and applauded in Greece, was reckoned vile and despicable
                    amongst the Romans, Andronicus acted a part in his dramatical compositions, and
                    engaged the attention of his audience by repeating what he had worked up after
                    the manner of the Greeks. Andronicus was the freedman of Μ. Livius Salinator,
                    whose children he educated. His poetry had grown obsolete in the age of Cicero,
                    whose nicety and judgment would not even recommend the reading of it.</p>
