                <p><label type="entry">LESLIE, <hi rend="smallcaps">Charles</hi></label>, was the
                    second son of Dr John Leslie, bishop of Clogher, in Ireland, who was descended
                    from an ancient family in the north of Scotland, and, being an admirable
                    scholar, rose to the dignity of bishop of Orkney in his own country, whence he
                    was, in the year 1633, translated to Raphoe, and afterwards, in 1661, to the see
                    of Clogher, in Ireland.</p>
                <p>Our author was born in Ireland, but in what year we have not learned. There is a
                    ludicrous story, indeed, of his having been begotten in prison, and of his
                    father having said that he hoped he would in consequence become the greatest
                    scourge of the covenanters that Great Britain or Ireland had ever seen. This
                    story, with all its circumstances, can scarcely be true; but we think it could
                    not have been fabricated, had not Charles Leslie been born within a year of
                    Cromwell’s conquest of Ireland, when the good bishop, having sustained a siege
                    in his castle of Raphoe, was some time kept in close confinement.</p>
                <p>We are equally ignorant of the school where he was educated as of the year of his
                    birth; but we know that he received his academical education in Trinity College,
                    Dublin, where he took the degree of master of arts. In the year 1671, he lost
                    his father, when he came over to England, and, entering himself in the temple,
                    studied law for some years, but afterwards relinquished it for the study of
                    divinity. In 1680 he was admitted into holy orders, and, in 1687, was made
                    chancellor of Connor.</p>
                <p>About this period he rendered himself particularly obnoxious to the Catholic
                    party in Ireland, by his zealous opposition to them, which was thus called
                    forth. Ro^er Boyle, bishop of Clogher, dying in 1687, Patrick Tyrrel was made
                    Catholic bishop, and had the revenues of the see assigned him by King James. He
                    set up a convent of friars in Monaghan, and, fixing his habitation there, held a
                    public visitation of his clergy with great solemnity; when, some subtile
                    logicians attending him, he challenged the Protestant clergy to a public
                    disputation. Leslie undertook the task, and performed it to the satisfaction of
                    the Protestants; though it happened, as it generally does at such contests, that
                    both sides claimed the victory. He afterwards held another public disputation
                    with two celebrated Catholic divines, in the church of Tynan, in the diocese of
                    Armagh, before a very numerous assembly of persons of both religions; the issue
                    of which was, that Mr John Stewart, a Catholic gentleman, renounced the church
                    of Rome.</p>
                <p>As the Catholics had got possession of an Episcopal see, they engrossed other
                    offices also; and a Catholic high-sheriff was appointed for the county of
                    Monaghan. This proceeding alarmed the gentlemen in that county, who, depending
                    much on Leslie’s knowledge as a justice of peace, repaired to him, then
                    confined, by the gout, to his house. He told them, that it would be as illegal
                    in them to permit the sheriff to act as it would be in him to attempt it. But
                    they insisting that he should appear himself on the bench at the next
                    quarter-sessions, and all promising to stand by him, he was carried thither with
                    much difficulty and in great pain. When the sheriff appeared, and was taking his
                    place, he was asked whether he was legally qualified; to which he answered
                    smartly, “That he was of the king’s own religion, and it was his majesty’s will
                    that he should be sheriff.” Leslie replied, “that they were not inquiring into
                    his majesty’s religion, but whether he (the pretended sheriff) had qualified
                    himself according to law, for acting as a proper officer; that the law was the
                    king’s will, and nothing else to be deemed such; that his subjects had no other
                    way of knowing his will, but as it is revealed to them in his laws; and it must
                    always be thought to continue so, till the contrary is notified to them in the
                    same authentic manner.” Upon this the bench unanimously agreed to commit the
                    pretended sheriff, for his intrusion and arrogant contempt of the court. Leslie
                    also committed some officers of the army which the Lord Tyrconnel raised, for
                    offences.</p>
                <p>By this spirited conduct Leslie acted like a sound divine and an upright
                    magistrate; but though he thought himself authorized to resist the legal
                    mandates of his sovereign, like many other great and good men, he distinguished
                    between active and passive obedience, and felt not himself at liberty to
                    transfer his allegiance from that sovereign to another. Refusing therefore to
                    take the oaths to King William and Queen Mary, he was deprived of all his
                    preferments; and in 1689 he removed with his family to England, where he
                    published the following amongst other works: 1. Answer to Archbishop King’s
                    State of the Protestants in Ireland. 2. Cassandra, concerning the new
                    Associations, <hi rend="italic">&amp;c.</hi> 1703, 4to. 3. Rehearsals; at first

                    seven years. 4. The Wolf stripped of his Shepherd’s Clothing, in Answer to
                    Moderation a Virtue, 1704, 4to. The pamphlet it answers was written by James

                    Conformity, 1705,4to. 9. A Warning for the Church of England, 1706, 4to. Some
                    have doubted whether these two pieces were his. 10. The good old Cause, or Lying

                    Letter to Mr Nelson. Besides these, he published the four following tracts: 25.
                    A Sermon preached at Chester, against Marriages in different Communions, 1702,
                    8vo. This sermon occasioned Mr Dodwell’s Discourse upon the same subject. 26. A
                    Dissertation concerning the Use and Authority of Ecclesiastical History. 27. The
                    Case of the Regal and the Pontificate. 28. A Supplement in Answer to a Book
                    entitled The Regal Supremacy in Ecclesiastical Affairs asserted. These last two
                    pieces were occasioned by the dispute about the right of convocation, between
                    Wake, &amp;c. on one side, and Atterbury and his friends, amongst whom was
                    Leslie, on the other.</p>
                <p>It is said by the authors of the <hi rend="italic">Biographical Dictionary,</hi>
                    that, in consequence of a publication of his, entitled “The Hereditary Right of
                    the Crown of England asserted,” he was under the necessity of leaving the
                    kingdom; and that he repaired to the Pretender at Bar-le-due, where he was
                    allowed to officiate, .in a private chapel, according to the rites of the church
                    of England, and where he endeavoured, though in vain, to convert the Pretender
                    to the Protestant religion.</p>
                <p>That he repaired to Bar-le-due, and endeavoured to convert to the faith of the
                    church of England him whom he considered as the rightful sovereign of England,
                    is indeed true; but there is reason to believe that this was not in consequence
                    of his being obliged to leave the kingdom. In the first place, it is more than
                    probable that “The Hereditary Right of the Crown of England asserted” was not
                    written by Leslie; and there is still in existence undoubted evidence, that, in
                    consequence of his great fame as a polemic, he was sent to Bar-le-due for the
                    express purpose of endeavouring to convert the son of James II., by some
                    gentlemen of fortune in England, who wished to see that prince seated upon the
                    throne of his ancestors. The writer of this article had the honour to be well
                    known to the grand-daughter of one of those gentlemen, a lady of the strictest
                    veracity; and from her he received many anecdotes of Leslie and his associates,
                    which, as he did not then foresee that he should ever have any occasion to use
                    them, he has suffered to slip from his memory. That lady, we have reason to
                    believe, was in possession of many letters by Leslie, written in confidence to
                    her grandfather, both from Bar-le-due and from St Germains; and by the account
                    which she gave of these letters, Leslie appears to have considered his prince as
                    a weak and incorrigible bigot, though, in every thing but religion, an amiable
                    and accomplished man. This may have been his genuine character, for we know very
                    well that it was the character of his father; but it is not of him that we are
                    now writing.</p>
                <p>Mr Leslie having remained abroad from the year 1709 till 1721, returned that year
                    to England, resolving, whatever the consequences might be, to die in his own
                    country. Some of his friends having acquainted Lord Sunderland with his purpose,
                    implored his protection for the good old man, which his lordship readily and
                    generously promised. Mr Leslie had no sooner arrived in London, than a member of
                    the FIouse of Commons officiously waited on Lord Sunderland with the news, but
                    met with such a reception from his lordship as the malice of his errand
                    deserved. Our author then went over to Ireland, where he died, on the 13th of
                    April 1722, at his own house at Glaslough, in the county of Monaghan.</p>
                <p>His character maybe summed up in a few words. Consummate learning, attended by
                    the deepest humility, the strictest piety without the least tincture of
                    moroseness, a conversation in the highest degree lively and spirited, yet to the
                    last degree innocent, made him the delight of mankind; and has left what Dr
                    Flickes says of him unquestionable, that he made more converts to sound faith
                    and a holy life than any other man of his time.</p>
                <p>A charge, however, has been brought against him, which, if well founded, must
                    detract not only from his literary fame, but also from his personal integrity.
                    <hi rend="italic">The Short and Easy Method with the Deists</hi> is
                    unquestionably his most valuable, and apparently his most original work; yet
                    this work has been published in French amongst the works of the Abbé St Real,
                    who died in 1692; and therefore it has been said, that unless it was published
                    in English prior to that period, Charles Leslie must be considered as a
                    shameless plagiary..</p>
                <p>The English work was certainly not published prior to the death of the Abbé St
                    Real, for the first edition bears date the 17th of July 1697; and yet many
                    reasons conspire to convince us that our countryman was no plagiary. There is
                    indeed a striking similarity between the English and the French works; but this
                    is no complete proof that the one was copied from the other. The article <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Philology</hi> in this Encyclopaedia, of which the late Dr Doig
                    of Stirling was the author, was published the very same week in which Dr
                    Vincent’s dissertation on the Greek verb appeared. It was therefore impossible
                    that either of these learned men, who till then were strangers to each other’s
                    names, could have stolen aught from the other; and yet Dr Vincent’s derivation
                    of the Greek verb bears as striking a resemblance to that of Dr Doig as the Abbé
                    St Real’s work does to that of Charles Leslie. In the article <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Miracle,</hi> too, the credibility of the gospel miracles is
                    established by an argument, which the author certainly did not borrow from any
                    one, and which the late Principal Campbell of Aberdeen considered as original;
                    yet within halta year of the publication of that article, the credibility of the
                    gospel miracles was treated in the very same manner by Dr Sayers, though there
                    is in his dissertation complete internal evidence that he had not seen the
                    article in this Encyclopaedia. Further, the author of this sketch reviewed, in
                    one of the Journals, the work of a friend, which was at the same time reviewed
                    in another Journal which he never saw. Yet he was told by a friend, who was
                    conversant in that kind of reading, and knew nothing of his concern with either
                    Journal, that the book in question must, in both, have been reviewed by the same
                    hand, because in both the same character was given of it in almost the very same
                    words.</p>
                <p>After these instances of apparent plagiarism, and which we know to be only
                    apparent, has any man a right to say that Charles Leslie and the Abbé St Real
                    might not have treated their subject in the way that they have done, without
                    either borrowing from the other? The coincidence of arrangement and reasoning in
                    two different works is indeed very surprising; but it is by no means so
                    surprising <pb break="no" facs="nls:193204569" xml:id="kp-eb0713-4569-0242"/>as
                    the coincidence of etymological deductions which appear in the writings of Drs
                    Doig and Vincent. The divines reason from the acknowledged laws of human
                    thought; the reasonings of the grammarians, with all deference to their superior
                    learning, we cannot help considering as sometimes a little fanciful.</p>
                <p>But this is not all that we have to urge on the subject. If there be plagiarism
                    in the case, and the identity of titles looks very like it, it is infinitely
                    more probable that the editor of St Real’s works stole from Leslie, than that
                    Leslie stole from St Real; unless it can be proved that the works of the abbĕ,
                    and this work in particular,’were published before the year 1697. At that period
                    the English language was very little read or understood upon the Continent,
                    whilst in Britain the French language was, by scholars, as generally understood
                    as at present. Hence it is, that so many Frenchmen, and indeed foreigners of
                    different nations, thought themselves safe in pilfering from the British
                    philosophers; whilst there is not, in as far as we know, one well authenticated
                    instance of a British philosopher appropriating to himself the discoveries of a
                    foreigner. Is it then very improbable that the editor of the works of St Real
                    would claim to his friend a celebrated tract, of which he knew the real author
                    to be obnoxious to the government of his own country, and therefore not likely
                    to have powerful friends to maintain his right?</p>
                <p>But further, Dr Burnet, bishop of Sarum, was an excellent scholar, and well read,
                    as every one knows, in the works of foreign divines. Is it conceivable, that
                    this prelate, when smarting under the scourge of Leslie, would have let slip so
                    favourable an opportunity of covering with disgrace his most formidable
                    antagonist, had he known that antagonist to be guilty of plagiarism from the
                    writings of the Abbé St Real? Let it be granted, however, that Burnet was a
                    stranger to these writings and to this plagiarism; it can hardly be supposed
                    that Le Clerc was likewise ignorant of them. Yet this author—when, for reasons
                    best known to himself, he chose, in the year 1706, to depreciate the argument of
                    Leslie’s <hi rend="italic">Short and Easy Method,</hi> and to traduce its author
                    as ignorant of ancient history, and as having brought forward his four marks for
                    no other purpose than to put the deceitful traditions of popery upon the same
                    footing with the most authentic doctrines of the gospel—does not so much as
                    insinuate that he had borrowed these marks from a popish abbé, though such a
                    charge, could he have established it, would have served his purpose more than
                    all his rude railings and invective. But there was no room for such a charge. In
                    the second volume of the works of St Real, published in 1757, there is indeed a
                    tract entitled <hi rend="italic">Methode</hi><hi rend="italic">Courte et Aisée
                    pour combattre les Déistes;</hi> and there can be little doubt but that the
                    publisher wished it to be considered as the work of his countryman.
                    Unfortunately, however, for his design, a catalogue of the abbé’s works is given
                    in the first volume; and in that catalogue the <hi rend="italic">Methode</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Courte et Aisée</hi> is not mentioned.</p>
                <p>We have dwelt thus long on <hi rend="italic">The Short and Easy Method with the
                    Deists,</hi> because it is one of the ablest works that ever was written in
                    proof of the divine origin of the Jewish and Christian Scriptures; a work of
                    which the high merit was acknowledged even by Lord Bolingbroke, and which, as is
                    well known to theological scholars, Dr Conyers Middleton confessed to be
                    unanswerable. If by men of science we should be thought to have spent our time
                    well in vindicating the rights of some of our illustrious philosophers, to
                    discoveries which have been unjustly claimed for the philosophers of Germany and
                    France, we will not surely, by the friends of Christianity, be thought to have
                    employed our time ill in vindicating Leslie’s claim to this decisive argument in
                    support of our holy religion.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Leslie,</hi><hi rend="italic">Sir John,</hi> Professor of
                    Natural Philosophy in the University of Edinburgh, and author of several
                    scientific works, inventions, and discoveries, of great celebrity, was born at
                    the village of Largo, in the county of Fife on the 16th of April 1766. If, in
                    sketching the Life of this eminent person, we should happen to exceed the usual
                    limits of our biographical notices, we can at least plead in excuse that we have
                    done so in the case of one of the greatest benefactors of this Encyclopaedia—one
                    whose counsels led to not a few of the improvements which distinguish the later
                    years of its history, and to whom it is indebted for many contributions, marked
                    with the stamp of his vigorous and original powers. It is painful to us to
                    recollect the number of similar claims to our attention. Too many illustrious
                    contemporary benefactors have, like him, left us the mournful duty of preserving
                    some memorials of their personal history, in the work which received from their
                    co-operation its highest honours and proudest recommendations.</p>
                <p>He was the son of humble, but, in their line of life, highly respectable parents,
                    who lived to enjoy the celebrity of their son, and for whom he ever cherished
                    that affection which formed a marked feature of his character, in regard to all
                    the members of his family. His father, originally from the neighbourhood of St
                    Andrews, lived for some time at Anstruther, but ultimately settled at Largo, as
                    a joiner and cabinet-maker. His wife, Anne Carstairs, was a native of that
                    place; and the subject of this article was the youngest child of their marriage.
                    Though he attained in manhood a robust frame, he was, in early youth, of a very
                    feeble constitution; so much so, that when sent, at four years of age, to a sort
                    of school, kept by an old woman, who plied her wheel whilst teaching the
                    alphabet, he was indulged with a separate stool, near the fire-place, which the
                    dame set apart for the feeblest of her juvenile pupils. As long as he was
                    permitted to monopolize this seat of honour, he seems to have been tolerably
                    pleased with his situation; but being at length superseded by a younger, or more
                    favoured pupil, he eloped from the school, hid himself for a day in some obscure
                    corner, and, when obliged to come forth, obstinately refused to return to the
                    tutelage of the ancient spinster. He was in consequence placed in another
                    school, where he remained six months, and was taught writing and arithmetic; bis
                    father and his eldest brother, who appear to have possessed some knowledge of
                    the elementary parts of mathematics, giving him, at the same time, his first
                    lessons in that science. He was afterwards entered at a school in the
                    neighbouring town of Leven, where Latin was taught; but his intense dislike, at
                    this time, to that language, and his inability to walk and return daily a
                    distance of three miles, induced his parents to discontinue his attendance,
                    after a short trial of six weeks. Such was the brief and meagre <hi
                    rend="italic">curriculum</hi> which formed the whole training of the future
                    mathematician and philosopher, previous to his being entered a student at the
                    University of St Andrews! But we must not too hastily despatch this early period
                    of his life, when his genius, working with its own inward resources, already
                    began to attract observation.</p>
                <p>The first person of any sort of distinction who noticed his precocious
                    attainments, was Mr Oliphant, who became Minister of Largo about the time when
                    the boy had reached his eleventh or twelfth year. Struck with the knowledge in
                    mathematical and physical science which he displayed, the reverend gentleman
                    kindly lent him some scientific books, with which he was but poorly provided;
                    and he also strongly urged him to study Latin,—telling him, by way of showing
                    the necessity of an immediate commencement, that it had cost himself seven years
                    to acquire that language. This was the worst argument that <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193204582" xml:id="kp-eb0713-4582-0243"/>could be urged to the young
                    philosopher, who unhesitatingly declared that he never would bestow half that
                    time upon any language, and that he particularly disliked Latin. In this state
                    of his knowledge and taste, he was, in his thirteenth year, sent to the
                    University of St Andrews to study mathematics under Professor Vilant. On
                    examination by the Professor, he was found already qualified for the second or
                    senior class; and, at the close of the session, he obtained a prize. It is
                    remembered, as a characteristic particular, that having previously discovered,
                    in some of those antiquarian researches to which also he was early addicted,
                    that it was not indispensable for students of the first year to wear a gown, he
                    steadily refused, during this year, to exhibit himself in the accustomed
                    academical habiliment.</p>
                <p>This session proved a decisive one as to the course of his future studies. The
                    Earl of Kinnoull, then Chancellor of the University, having been informed of his
                    remarkable abilities, sent for his father, and proposed to him to defray the
                    expense of his son’s education, provided the father would agree to maintain him
                    at college, with the view of qualifying him for the Church. The proposal was
                    readily embraced; and the repugnance of the youth to apply himself to Latin was
                    at length overcome, by making the permission to attend the Natural Philosophy
                    class of next session,—the great object of his desire,—conditional on his
                    agreeing to qualify himself, during the vacation, for attending also the Latin
                    class. With this lure before him, he applied assiduously to his lessons, under
                    the direction of a private teacher, and succeeded in fitting himself for
                    admission into that class. No one could discover, in his after life, any traces
                    of this early and vehement dislike to Latin; for though he ever held that the
                    learned languages were suffered to engross too much attention in our system of
                    education, and was by no means sparing of reprehension upon this subject,<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>“The great error,” says he,
                    “in modern education consists in the undue attention paid to the dead languages,
                    which consumes the precious time that should be devoted, during the freshness of
                    youth, to the higher intellectual pursuits.” (See Preface to his Äu- <hi
                    rend="italic">diments of Geometry,</hi> published in 1828.)</p></note> his own
                    scholarship had become considerable; and indeed his writings manifest a more
                    than ordinary degree of fondness for embellishing the conclusions of science
                    with illustrations from the Greek and Latin Classics. He continued to the last
                    to read them occasionally, particularly Lucretius, whose bold and imaginative
                    philosophy, and splendid descriptions, were peculiarly adapted to his taste. He
                    came also to be well versed in the theory of grammar; and his observations upon
                    languages often evinced learning, as well as ingenuity.</p>
                <p>His health, at the period above alluded to, was still so delicate that it became
                    necessary to moderate and regulate his studious habits; but he succeeded, during
                    his second session, in acquiring additional honours, and in attracting in a more
                    marked degree the flattering attentions of the Chancellor, who kindly invited
                    him to Dupplin Castle, where, notwithstanding the bashfulness of his manner, he
                    contrived to impress the other visitors with a high opinion of his powers. About
                    the same time, he became known to Mr Playfair, on occasion of a visit which the
                    latter, alongst with the Reverend Dr Small, made to St Andrews. Dr Small’s son
                    was a fellow-student and companion of young Leslie, and hence his introduction
                    to both these mathematicians. Mr Playfair was at this time parish - minister of
                    Liff, in Forfarshire. Here he was afterwards visited by his young acquaintance,
                    neither of them then dreaming of that lot which was to place them, in
                    succession, in two conspicuous Chairs of the University of Edinburgh, destined
                    to derive from both additional lustre and recommendations. His visits to Mr
                    Playfair were continued after the latter, in 1782, resigned his clerical charge,
                    in order to superintend the education of the present Robert Ferguson, Esq. of
                    Raith, and his brother Sir Ronald. It was in this way, we believe, that he first
                    became known to these excellent and distinguished men, then youths of his own
                    age; and the acquaintance, in after years, ripened into a warm and lasting
                    friendship, alike honourable to both parties, and which formed one of the chief
                    and most valued solaces of his life.</p>
                <p>In 1783 or 1784, he quitted St Andrews, and proceeded to Edinburgh, with the
                    intention of entering himself a studentof Divinity in the metropolitan
                    university. He was accompanied by a fellow-student, destined, like himself, to
                    obtain a distinguished niche in the Temple of Science, James Ivory; and they
                    lived together for some time. He never had any liking for the Church as a
                    profession; and though he was formally entered at the Divinity Hall, he
                    contrived to devote his first session to the sciences, particularly to
                    Chemistry. In fact, he seems early to have relinquished all thoughts of the
                    Church ;—a resolution perhaps hastened by the death of his patron the Earl of
                    Kinnoull, which took place soon after his removal to Edinburgh. He continued to
                    study here till the close of the session of 1787; and, as is customary with
                    students of greater ability and industry than means, devoted part of his time to
                    private tuition. One of the young men whose studies he assisted was nearly
                    related to, and became the heir of, Dr Adam Smith; a circumstance which he was
                    accustomed to recollect with pleasure, as having made him known to that
                    illustrious philosopher, who treated him kindly, and occasionally favoured him
                    with directions as to his own pursuits. His first essay as an author must have
                    been composed about the time of his leaving this university. It was a Paper <hi
                    rend="italic">On the Exsolution of indeterminate Problems,</hi> which was read
                    to the Royal Society of Edinburgh by Mr Playfair, in 1788, and published in
                    their <hi rend="italic">Transactions.</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>See vol. ii. p. 193.</p></note></p>
                <p>In this year, he was prevailed upon by two young students of the name of
                    Randolph, and of the distinguished American family of that name, to accompany
                    them, in capacity of tutor, to Virginia; and he accordingly left Scotland
                    alongst with them. They arrived at the place of their destination in the
                    beginning of November; and his time afterwards seems to have passed both
                    agreeably and usefully. He was all his life fond of visiting other countries,
                    and perhaps a little disposed to underrate his own. Thus he was wont to say,
                    that the thunder-storms of Virginia took away all feelings of awe at those of
                    Scotland, just as the Alps of Switzerland left him nothing to admire in the
                    Scottish mountains. His stay in the new world did not much exceed a year, owing
                    to the breaking up of the family establishment by the death of the father of his
                    young friends. After visiting New York and Philadelphia, he returned to his
                    native place towards the close of the year 1789.</p>
                <p>From some letters to his family, written about the time of his leaving America,
                    his thoughts seem to have been anxiously directed to his future means of
                    employment and support; and one of his schemes appears to have been to try his
                    fortune in India, probably as a civil engineer. This notion recurred afterwards,
                    but without leading to any results. His next field of adventure was London,
                    whither he proceeded in January 1790, carrying with him various letters of
                    recommendation; one of which was written by Dr <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193204595" xml:id="kp-eb0713-4595-0244"/>Aaam Smith, then drawing near
                    the close of his career. It was on this occasion, if our recollection does not
                    mislead us, that Dr Smith exhorted his young friend never to approach any author
                    whose favour he might wish to win, without first reading his book, lest the
                    conversation should happen to turn that way. One of Mr Leslie’s objects in
                    visiting the capital, was to ascertain what success he might expect from a
                    course of Lectures on Natural Philosophy; and the information he received soon
                    satisfied him, as he says in a letter to one of his brothers, that “rational
                    lectures would not succeed.” He therefore employed himself for some time in
                    writing for the <hi rend="italic">Monthly Review,</hi> and in executing literary
                    jobs delegated to him by his countryman Dr William Thomson, author of the
                    continuation of Watson’s <hi rend="italic">History of Philip the Third,</hi> and
                    of many other works now forgotten, and who was much in the habit of lending his
                    versatile pen, as well as his name, to those who required the assistance or
                    recommendation of either. But a more eligible and suitable connection was ere
                    long opened to him, by the invitation of the younger Wedgewoods, who had been
                    his fellow-students at Edinburgh, to reside with them, and superintend their
                    studies. He readily acceded to their proposals; and proceeded, in April 1790, to
                    their residence at Etruria, in Staffordshire, where he remained till the close
                    of 1792, in the enjoyment of a liberal salary, and of society at once agreeable
                    and intelligent. This was, in every sense, a happy and profitable period of his
                    life. The time not devoted to tuition was assiduously employed in experimental
                    investigations, and in completing a translation of Bufibn’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Natural History of Hirds,</hi> which he had previously undertaken for a London
                    bookseller. It was published in 1793, after he left Etruria, in nine volumes
                    octavo. Though executed with fidelity and vigour, it was valued by himself, at
                    least after he became otherwise eminent, only as having, by the sum which it
                    procured him, laid the foundation of that pecuniary competency which he early
                    foresaw to be necessary to the independent prosecution of his favourite studies;
                    and which his industrious and prudent habits enabled him in no long time, in a
                    moderate degree, to attain. The preface, however, speaks of this <hi
                    rend="superscript"> iι</hi> first attempt” with some anxiety; and endeavours to
                    bespeak favour for it as executed “at an early period of life, and in the
                    retirement of the country.” This preface is written in that nervous, but
                    strained and ornate style, which characterises his after writings. His first
                    contribution to Natural Philosophy, entitled <hi rend="italic">Observations on
                    Electrical Theories,</hi> was also written at Etruria; and was, in 1791,
                    transmitted to the Royal Society of Edinburgh, for insertion in their <hi
                    rend="italic">Transactions.</hi> This was promised; but performance having, as
                    he thought, been long and unhandsomely deferred, he indignantly recalled his
                    Paper, and laid it aside for many years. It did not, indeed, see the light till
                    1824, when he was induced to publish it in the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh
                    Philosophical Journal,</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>See vol. xi. p. 1.</p></note> conducted by his distinguished friend
                    Professor Jameson.</p>
                <p>About the period of the close of his agreeable engagement at Etruria, which was
                    occasioned, we believe, by the ill health of Mr Thomas Wedgewood, and the
                    marriage of his younger brother, a Cornish gentleman with whom he had become
                    acquainted at that place proposed to engage him as a companion in an extensive
                    tour through Greece, Egypt, and the Holy Land. Ever fond, as he was, of visiting
                    foreign countries, particularly those hallowed by memorable events or classical
                    associations, the proposal could not but prove agreeable to him, and it was
                    accordingly embraced with alacrity. The tour was to commence early in 1793; but
                    a change of plan having been decided upon without his concurrence, and by which
                    he found that his observations were to be transferred to another, he indignantly
                    relinquished the engagement. His intention to visit these interesting countries,
                    when a fit opportunity should occur, remained with him through life; and, at a
                    period nearly forty years subsequent to this,—in his last years, indeed,—he
                    actually made some preparations for a year’s sojourn in Egypt and Palestine,
                    from which he was diverted only by engagements and avocations of which he found
                    it difficult to disencumber himself.</p>
                <p>After leaving Etruria, he passed some months in Holland; a country which, like
                    Descartes, he seems to have thought peculiarly suited to secluded study, and
                    where he at this time acquired the German language. Thereafter, he returned to
                    Largo, where he remained for about two years, devoted to experimental
                    researches, in the course of which he invented and perfected his Differential
                    Thermometer; the parent, if we may so speak, of that beautiful family of
                    philosophical Instruments,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>These Instruments, viz. the Differential Thermometer, Hygrometer,
                    Hygroscope, Photometer, Pyroscope, Aethrioscope, and Atmometer, are all
                    described, and their principles explained, by himself, in the articles <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Climate</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Meteorology.</hi> The
                    latter, like the former, will, at the proper place, be transferred, to this
                    work, from the <hi rend="italic">Supplement</hi> to the preceding editions.
                    Properly speaking, the Hygrometer was the parent instrument; the Differential
                    Thermometer having been invented in the course of his endeavours to improve it;
                    but as the Hygrometer, in its latest form, is only a modification of the other,
                    it may be represented as derived from it. See the article <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Cold.</hi></p></note> with which he enriched the Treasury of Science, and
                    amplified and variegated the means of physical inquiry. His ingenuity had been
                    early exercised in some attempts to construct an accurate Hygrometer, and these
                    ultimately suggested to him the well-known contrivance above named ;—a
                    contrivance happily adapted to the measurement of the smallest variations of
                    temperature, and which richly rewarded his inventive powers by its ministry to
                    the achievement of his subsequent discoveries. It has generally, indeed, been
                    allowed to be one of the most useful as well as elegant inventions that
                    inductive genius ever applied to the investigation of chemical changes. At a
                    later period, when his name had attained a high degree of celebrity, he, like
                    most of the other sons of genius, was made to feel that fame brings with it
                    pains as well as pleasures; for it was now discovered that the Differential
                    Thermometer, instead of being an invention of his own, perfected, as he has
                    himself recorded, in the course of a series of experiments on the evaporation of
                    ice, which the severe winter of 1794-5 afforded him an opportunity of
                    performing,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See the
                    article <hi rend="smallcaps">Meteorology.</hi></p></note> was in reality a
                    plagiarism, if not from Van Helmont, who died in 1644, at any rate, from John
                    Christopher Sturmius, who died some sixty years later. Such was one attempt to
                    impeach the originality of this eminently inventive experimentalist. An
                    Instrument of which all the world remained ignorant, till he, by means of it,
                    told the world the better part of all it yet knovys concerning the phenomena of
                    radiated heat, was discovered to have been furtively purloined from one or other
                    of these worthies! Neither the authors nor the abettors of this allegation
                    pretended that either Van Helmont or Sturmius ever dreamt of such applications,
                    or derived such results from their supposed invention, as were reserved, by some
                    caprice of chance, no doubt! for its luckier plagiarist; and it is now, we
                    believe, allowed, that this is just one of those cases of curious but partial
                    anticipation so frequently to be met with in the history of science, and where
                    the ultimate discoverer shows, by his skilful and fruitful employment of the
                    disputed invention, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193204608"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0713-4608-0245"/>how much he surpassed, and how little he needed
                    the help of, those whom he is ungenerously supposed to have robbed of their
                    legitimate honours.</p>
                <p>In the spring of 1796, Mr Leslie received an invitation from his friend Mr Thomas
                    Wedgewood, to accompany him in a tour through the north of Germany and
                    Switzerland. To this proposal, which was every way agreeable, he immediately
                    acceded. They arrived at Hamburg about the first of May, and employed that and
                    thenext four months in their tour, part of which was performed on foot. He
                    alludes to their observations in the course of their journeyings amongst the
                    mountains of Switzerland, in one of the notes to his work on Heat; but of this,
                    as of all his subsequent tours on the Continent, he kept regular Journals, which
                    are still preserved, and which show that he was no less observant of the social,
                    moral, and economical condition of the countries he visited, than of their
                    geological, meteorological, and physical aspects.</p>
                <p>For some years after the period just mentioned, he seems to have employed himself
                    in his experimental pursuits, and to have divided his time, chiefly, between
                    London and Largo; to which place, and to the society of his family, be ever was
                    fondly attached. His earnings by literary labour, and his allowances, had raised
                    his humble fortune to what a philosopher might view as an independence; and he
                    accordingly employed or amused himself as his own inclinations dictated. Early
                    in the summer of 1799 he set out with an old college acquaintance on a tour to
                    the northern kingdoms of Europe; in the capitals of which, the latter, who had
                    for some time been settled in Spain as a merchant, had business to transact.
                    After traversing Denmark, part of Norway, and Sweden, they proceeded through
                    Brandenburg to Berlin; and from thence returned to England about the end of
                    November. From his Journal of this tour, which is more detailed than any of
                    those he subsequently kept, the Swedish mines appear to have formed particular
                    objects of his attention. One of his entries records his having, before quitting
                    Hamburg, written an account of his Hygrometer, for insertion in Voght’s <hi
                    rend="italic">'Magazine,</hi> and in the <hi rend="italic">Annales de
                    Chimie.</hi></p>
                <p>In the following year, he published the Paper just mentioned, but with some
                    alterations, in Nicholson’s <hi rend="italic">Philosophical Journal.</hi> It is
                    entitled a <hi rend="italic">Description of an Hygrometer and Photometer</hi><hi

                    Remarks</hi> on these Instruments. In the same year, he also published, in that
                    Journal, a Paper <hi rend="italic">On the Absorbent Powers of the Different
                    Earths</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and other two, containing <hi rend="italic"

                    pieces are very valuable, as showing the progress of his researches and
                    discoveries in that field of inquiry which their titles indicate.</p>
                <p>The results of his more extended investigations were ere long to appear before
                    the world in a different shape. Having“collected at Largo all the necessary
                    apparatus, he prosecuted with ardour a series of experiments, which enabled him,
                    in the years 1801 and 1802, to compose the bulk of bis celebrated work on Heat.
                    In the latter year, “the gleam of peace,” as he tells us in his usual ornate
                    style, “tempted him to indulge in a temporary suspension; and to repair to the
                    famed capital where the treasures of art and science are so profusely displayed.
                    In that vortex of pleasure and centre of information, I spent,” he adds,
                    “several months very agreeably; but the work I had undertaken recalled my
                    thoughts, and I hastened again to my retreat.”<note anchored="true"

                    the Nature and Properties of</hi><hi rend="italic">Heat</hi> was here at length
                    completed. It was published at London in the spring of 1804, with a dedication,
                    couched in terms of strong and affectionate friendship, to Mr Thomas Wedgewood,
                    the companion of his studies at Etruria, and of his first continental tour. The
                    early death of that ingenious and excellent person, whose delicate health is
                    here feelingly alluded to, was always mentioned by him as a public as well as
                    private misfortune. The originality and boldness of the peculiar doctrines of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Inquiry,</hi> and the number of new and important facts
                    disclosed by its ingenious experimental combinations, conspired to render it an
                    object of extraordinary interest in the scientific world; and, indeed, it must
                    ever be viewed as constituting an era in the history of that branch of physical
                    science which forms its subject. The Royal Society of London unanimously
                    adjudged to its author the Rumford Medals appropriated as the reward of
                    discoveries in that recondite province. As a philosophical disquisition, it is
                    far, however, from being perfect. Its hypotheses are not warranted by the sober
                    maxims of inductive logie; and its method and style are alike liable to serious
                    criticism. But it would be difficult to name any work in the whole range of
                    physical science more strongly indicative of a vigorous and inventive genius;
                    and it must be allowed by all, that its beautifully devised experiments, and its
                    large stock of new observations, far more than atone for its questionable
                    theories, and for that desultory arrangement, and those ambitious modes of
                    expression, which so often mar its reasonings and obscure its sense. More than
                    ten years before the appearance of this work, Mr Leslie wrote an essay on <hi
                    rend="italic">Heat and Climate,</hi> which contains some of the theoretical
                    opinions advanced in the former, as well as the germs of some of its
                    discoveries. It was read at two successive meetings of the Royal Society of
                    London in the spring of 1793; but it was not admitted into the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Transactions</hi> of that body. Its aspiring author was not of a disposition to
                    be cheeked in the career of inquiry by this repulse; and he did not shrink from
                    bringing his Paper forth, in 1819, from its long oblivion of twenty-six years;
                    he having then published it, for the first time, in Dr Thomson’s <hi

                <p>Twice before that period of his life at which we are now arrived, Mr Leslie had
                    appeared as a candidate for an Academical Chair; first in the University of St
                    Andrews, afterwards in that of Glasgow, and on both occasions without success.
                    He was again to try his fortune in the same line in the Metropolitan University.
                    Early in the year 1805, a vacancy occurred in its Mathematical Chair, owing to
                    the removal ofProfessor Playfair, on the death ofDr John Robison, to that of
                    Natural Philosophy. This afforded a new opening to his academical ambition; and
                    he was particularly desirous to occupy a Chair upon which the names of the
                    Gregories, of Maclaurin, of Matthew Stewart, and of Playfair, had shed so much
                    lustre. He accordingly presented himself as a candidate; and, with his now high
                    reputation as a discoverer and original thinker, and his known eminence in
                    mathematical science, it was not to be expected that he could have any
                    formidable competition to surmount. Nor did there occur any, in as far as fame
                    or talents were concerned. His principal competitor, though a man of amiable
                    character, and respectable attainments, was wholly unknown in the scientific
                    world, and as inferior to him in abilities as in renown. But he was one of the
                    Ministers of the City, and supported with all the influence of that body; then
                    pretty generally suspected of a wish to secure a monopoly of the <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193204621" xml:id="kp-eb0713-4621-0246"/>Philosophical Chairs of the
                    University. It soon, however, became known that the Patrons were determined to
                    decide upon a comparison of claims, and that Mr Leslie must triumph. In this
                    state of things, and in an evil hour for themselves, the City Clergy were
                    induced to raise an objection to his eligibility, on the serious ground of his
                    having, in one of the notes appended to his work on Heat, approved of a doctrine
                    directly leading to atheism. We are sorry to be obliged to notice this
                    discreditable proceeding; but it forms too memorable an occurrence in Mr
                    Leslie’s life to allow us to pass it without some animadversion. In the note
                    alluded to, the author, though no metaphysician, and in general rather a
                    contemner of metaphysical science, was, naturally enough, led to illustrate what
                    he had said in the text with reference to the unphilosophical opinion that

                    deductions of logic, and imply nothing more at bottom, in the relation of cause

                    liberal minds, was, in March 1805, elected to the Mathematical Chair. The

                    now exhausted its resources, and that its hopes must, however sorrowfully, be
                    relinquished. Dismissing any supposition of interested designs, and even
                    allowing that Mr Leslie’s expressed opinion as to <hi rend="italic"
                    >Causation,</hi> if taken apart from the subject-matter of his book, or left
                    unexplained, was calculated to occasion some alarm in the minds of the pious,
                    still, impartial history ever must brand the proceedings of his opponents as
                    alike uncharitable, unfair, and arrogant; and as deeply injurious to the
                    character of that Church with whose name and authority they clothed themselves.
                    It was on all hands admitted, that if Mr Leslie had, by a single word, limited
                    his observations to <hi rend="italic">Physical</hi> causes, they would have been
                    wholly free from objection; and, surely, it required a most perverse and
                    intolerant construction to extend to any but such causes, the observations of an
                    illustrative note to a work purely physical, and undeniably levelled at those
                    theories which resort to certain invisible <hi rend="italic">intermedia,</hi> in
                    order to account for the connection of physical sequences. But this was not all.
                    Mr Leslie, on being informed of the charge, immediately declared, in a very
                    pointed Letter laid before the junto, that his observations “<hi rend="italic"
                    >referred entirely</hi> to the relation between cause and effect, considered as

                <p>Mr Leslie commenced and prosecuted his official duties with great ardour. He
                    entertained lofty ideas of the dignity and utility of the professorial
                    character, and was thus disposed to make all the exertions necessary to success.
                    Though the bent of his genius lay more to Physics than to Pure Mathematics, he
                    had cultivated the study of Geometry with kindred relish; and with an
                    admiration, in particular, of the analytical investigations of the ancient
                    geometers, which led to his happiest essay in that science. As a teacher, he not
                    only laboured to promote the study, but to procure for it a larger share of
                    attention than our academical system usually assigns to it. His instructions
                    were better suited, perhaps, to youths of superior ability than to ordinary
                    students; but reputation and intellectual power produced their usual results,
                    and secured for him an attendance as numerous as could be expected by any
                    teacher, during the whole of the fifteen years that he occupied the Mathematical
                    Chair. Soon after his election, he resolved to compose and to publish, at
                    successive intervals, a complete “Course of Mathematics,” digested and arranged
                    according to his own ideas of what was wanted towards promoting a purer taste in
                    the cultivation of the science. Of this Course, the first volume, comprising <hi
                    rend="italic">Elements of Geometry, Geometrical Analysis, and Plane.
                    Trigonometry,</hi> was published in 1809; and it has gone through several very
                    extensive editions. The first part of it has been viewed as the least perfect
                    and useful; but his own favourite portion, on <hi rend="italic">Geometrical
                    Analysis,</hi> has been extolled by the most unsparing critics of the former, as
                    “a great acquisition to Elementary Geometry; and as calculated to keep alive the
                    knowledge of a most beautiful and interesting branch of the mathematics, which
                    has been too much overlooked during the improvement of the more general and
                    powerful methods of algebraic investigation.”<note anchored="true"

                    favourable; as it was speedily translated into the French and German languages.
                    He re-produced it, with considerable emendations, in the second volume of his
                    “Mathematical Course,” which, besides, contains the <hi rend="italic">Geometry
                    of Curve Lines.</hi> This volume was not published till 1821—an interval of
                    twelve years having thus elapsed from the appearance of the first. A third
                    volume, on <hi rend="italic">Descriptive Geometry, and the Theory of
                    Solids,</hi> was still wanting to complete his original design; but his removal
                    to another Chair,and other circumstances, called his attention to different
                    objects, and his “Mathematical Course” was thus left unfinished.</p>

                <p>He was induced, at a late period of his life, to recast the first volume in a
                    greatly abridged form. His object in doing so was to accommodate it to the use
                    of those who, in riper years, become desirous to supply the defects of early
                    education, and to qualify themselves for obtaining some knowledge of Natural
                    Philosophy. This abridgment appeared in 1828, under the title of <hi
                    rend="italic">Rudiments of Plane Geometry, including Geometrical Analysis, and
                    Plane Trigonometry-</hi> In connection with his mathematical works, though
                    forming no part of his “Course,” we may here mention the profound and learned
                    treatise on the <hi rend="italic">Philosophy of Arithmetic,</hi> which he
                    published in 1817. It was a republication, with considerable alterations and
                    additions, of one of the numerous articles contributed by him to the <hi
                    rend="italic">Supplement</hi> to the former editions of this Encyclopaedia.</p>
                <p>It was not to be expected that the labours of the Mathematical Chair would wean
                    Professor Leslie from his experimental inquiries. His fine Instruments were
                    always at hand, and always in use, in connection with some ingenious conception
                    or other. Early in the summer of 1810, he determined to proceed with some
                    experiments previously suggested in the course of his researches with his
                    Hygrometer, but which had for some time been suspended; and they now conducted
                    him to the discovery of that beautiful process of Artificial Congelation, by
                    which he was enabled to produce ice, and even to freeze mercury, at pleasure.
                    The discovery was achieved by means of a happily-conceived combination of the
                    powers of rarefaction and absorption, effected by placing a very strong
                    absorbent under the receiver of an air-pump. It was in the month of J one of
                    that season that the discovery was consummated.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See the article <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Cold.</hi> The successive steps of the discovery are here recorded by himself,
                    in those <hi rend="italic">verba</hi><hi rend="italic">ardentia</hi> which the
                    bent of his genius so strongly prompted him to employ.</p></note> We happened to
                    witness this consummation,—at least the performance of the first successful
                    repetition of his process,— and we never shall forget the joy and elation which
                    beamed on the face of the discoverer, as, with his characteristic good nature,
                    he patiently explained its principles, and the steps by which he had been led to
                    it. We could not but feel, on looking at, and listening to him, how noble and
                    elevating must be the satisfaction derived from thus acquiring a mastery over
                    the powers of Nature, and enabling man, weak and finite as he is, to reproduce
                    her wondrous works! Proportioned to the admiration which such achievements are
                    calculated to excite, ought to be the disapprobation of any unfair endeavours to
                    lower or depreciate them. We have already alluded to an attempt to divest this
                    illustrious experimentalist of the honours connected with his Differential
                    Thermometer; and we have now to add, that several years after the discovery of
                    his process of Artificial</p>
                <p>Congelation, there were some similar endeavours to transfer the merit of it to a
                    gentleman of the name of Nairne. The claim for him was founded on a Paper
                    published in 1777. in the <hi rend="italic">Transactions</hi> of the Royal
                    Society of London; from which it appeared that he was acquainted with the facts,
                    that evaporation produces cold, and that sulphuric acid, the absorbent employed
                    by Mr Leslie, imbibes moisture. But in order to decorate Mr Nairne with the
                    laurels of the latter, his depredators ought to have been able to show, that the
                    former had combined the properties alluded to, in a manageable process for the
                    production of ice <hi rend="italic">ad libitum.</hi> In such an attempt they
                    must have failed ignominiously; and, perhaps, there is not in the whole history
                    of science any more triumphant reply to a charge of plagiarism, than is
                    furnished by the admitted facts, that with Mr Nairne’s Paper before them for a
                    long course of years, the scientific world remained utterly ignorant of the
                    existence of any such process till the date of Mr Leslie’s discovery; nay, that
                    with his description of that process in their hands, the most distinguished
                    experimentalists of the capital failed in their trials of it, till it was
                    performed there by himself, in the ensuing summer!<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Some very complete and curious legal evidence
                    of these facts was adduced by Professor Leslie, in 1822, in a prosecution which
                    he was advised to institute against the publisher of a well-known <hi
                    rend="italic">Magazine,</hi> for a series of libels inserted in that work, and
                    in one of which he was accused of having stolen the discovery alluded to, from
                    Mr Nairne. Amongst other witnesses, two very distinguished Chemists were
                    examined on that occasion—the late Dr Marcet, and Dr Thomson, Professor of
                    Chemistry in the University of Glasgow. We shall extract a small portion of that
                    of Dr Marcet, to whom Mr Leslie Was, personally, but little known—“Q. Is it your

                    perfectly original. Q. Is the discovery of Mr Leslie analogous to other
                    discoveries in the science of chemistry ?— <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There is
                    hardly any discovery of the least value that has been made in that science but
                    from the known properties of bodies. It is by combining those properties, so as
                    to 'produce certain effects, that a discovery is made.—Q. Then, you mean to say
                    that Mr Leslie has done what none before him ever accomplished ?— <hi

                    atmosphere.”</p>
                <p>In the autumn of 1814, Professor Leslie indulged himself with a tour of six weeks
                    in France and the Netherlands. He never was satisfied if he allowed a vacation
                    to pass without seeing or revisiting some foreign scenes. One or two extracts
                    from Letters written by him on the present occasion, may be here introduced, as
                    either curious in themselves, or characteristic of the writer. Writing from
                    Paris, on the 1 st of August, he says, “you know that it was not my intention at
                    present to mix much with the <hi rend="italic">Sçavans.</hi> But I have been so
                    well received, and even feasted by them, that I may perhaps depart a little from
                    my original design. Humboldt has been very kind and attentive to me, and
                    introduces me wherever I want. They are much better acquainted with what we are
                    doing than I should have imagined. My book on Heat is better known than in
                    England. I was even reminded of some passages in it which in England were
                    considered as fanciful, but which the recent discoveries on the Polarity of
                    Light have confirmed. Even Laplace has, in consequence of some observations of
                    mine, silently omitted a passage in the last edition of his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Système</hi><hi rend="italic">du Monde.</hi> I paid a visit the other day at
                    Arcueil. Berthollet has a fine chateau seated on a bank amidst gardens,
                    vineyards, &amp;c.; and Laplace has another, little inferior, and adjoining to
                    the grounds. I dine with Laplace next Sunday. Some person had informed him that
                    I was the author of a critique in the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Review</hi> on
                    a paper of his, and he had sent an answer to me, which, however, I never
                    received.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>This must

                    first contributions to that Journal.</p></note> The following extract from
                    another letter, written at Bordeaux, in the beginning of September, gives a
                    rapid and lively sketch of his journey to that place :— “My tour has furnished
                    what I wanted—a number of images of the milder and hotter regions of the
                    Continent. From Paris I proceeded to Macon, over a rich and well-cultivated
                    country, covered with wheat and vineyards, the crop for the most part already
                    gathered in. Thence I descended the Somme, a fine, clear river, to Lyons; the
                    banks covered with luxuriant vineyards stretching to a range of hills, and the
                    waved surface sprinkled with trees, intermixed with frequent villages, and
                    lively villas, all of white limestone. At Lyons I met with the celebrated Baron
                    Zach, and was conducted by him in his carriage to the fountain of Vaucluse,
                    Avignon, and thence to Marseilles. His society was particularly entertaining and
                    instructive. We now passed through the country of the mulberry, the fig, and the
                    olive; but I confess that Provence did not come up to my expectation. I have
                    seen, w hat I had longed to see, the awful fountain of Vancluse, and the blue
                    expanse of the Mediterranean; but the shores at Marseilles are terminated by
                    gray, naked rocks, shooting fantastically to great heights. I staid some days at
                    Marseilles, and spent most of my time at a country house occupied by the old
                    Duchess of Saxe-Gotha, with whom Baron Zach lives in quality of Chamberlain. I
                    found her very kind and affable, and extremely glad to hear any news of the
                    Royal Family of England. From Marseilles I returned to Avignon, and then
                    crossing the Rhine, proceeded to Nismes, over a country extremely fertile and
                    interesting. This is almost a Roman town. There is a temple to Augustus,
                    beautifully Corinthian, a fine temple of Diana, and an amphitheatre almost
                    entire, capable of holding twenty thousand spectators. I now proceeded to
                    Montpellier, and saw the majestic range of the Pyrenees stretching on our left,
                    and covered with eternal snow. Montpellier is an interesting place,—its Botanic
                    Garden rich, and its promenades superb. I then proceeded to Toulouse. In leaving
                    it, the carriage plunged into a hollow across the road; it was eleven at night,
                    but the moon shone full, and lighted up a fine rich plain. I shuddered when told
                    that we had just crossed five hundred dead bodies, which had been thrust into a
                    cut or trench of the road, after the late battle. The road to Bordeaux runs near
                    the course of the Garonne, through one of the finest and richest countries I
                    have ever seen.” From this place he returned to Paris, and, after a short stay,
                    proceeded through the Netherlands to Rotterdam, where he took shipping for
                    Scotland.</p>
                <p>The publication of the <hi rend="italic">Supplement</hi> to the three editions of
                    this Encyclopaedia immediately preceding the present one, commenced towards the
                    dose of 1815, and was continued progressively till its completion early in 1824.
                    To that work, which was undertaken upon an unusually extensive plan, and which
                    aimed at procuring the highest attainable assistance, Mr Leslie was throughout a
                    Contributor. His contributions, surprisingly numerous when his other avocations
                    are considered, display all the powers and attainments for which he was
                    remarkable. Nor was it by his writings alone that he aided this publication. His
                    advice, his invaluable information,—amazing alike for its minuteness and
                    extent,—and his influence, were always at the service of its Editor, whose
                    acknowledgment of these various obligations has long been before the
                    public.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See Preface to
                    Supplement, p. 13.</p></note> But it is due to Mr Leslie’s memory to specify in
                    this sketch of his life what the work owes to his genius and knowledge. Ranged
                    in alphabetical order, his writings in it occur under the following heads:
                    Achromatic Glasses; Acoustics; Aeronautics; Andes; Angle; Angle, trisection of;
                    Arithmetic, palpable and figurate; Atmometer; Barometer; Barometrical
                    Measurements; Climate; Cold and Congelation; Dew; Interpolation;
                    Meteorology.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The present
                    edition is enriched with the whole of these articles. That part of the article
                    <hi rend="italic">Arithmetic,</hi> which relates to palpable notation, has been
                    omitted, with the exception of the curious disquisition on the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Abacus,</hi> which is printed separately in this edition. The article <hi
                    rend="italic">Interpolation</hi> is, in it, annexed to that on
                    Logarithms.</p></note></p>
                <p>Another work which at intervals enjoyed the benefit of his co-operation, was the
                    <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Review.</hi> But his contributions, though
                    commencing in the year 1809, were not numerous. They helped, however, and that
                    in an eminent degree, to strengthen and diversify the scientific department of
                    that Journal; whilst those regarding Voyages and Travels combine scientific
                    observation with powers of writing of no ordinary description. Among his
                    principal articles may be mentioned those on the Physical and Chemical Memoirs
                    of the Society of Arcueil; on the history of the Barometer; on Delambre’s work
                    on the Arithmetic of the Greeks; on Von Buch’s Travels; on Humboldt’s Physical
                    View of the Equatorial Regions, and on his Travels; and on the attempts to
                    discover a North-West Passage to Asia. The picture in the last, of the

                    year, as observed within the arctic circle, is executed with a force of
                    conception, as well as of colouring, that have not often been surpassed.</p>
                <p>In the year 1819, a new field of professorial labour was opened to Mr Leslie, by
                    the vacancy in the Chair of Natural Philosophy, occasioned by the death of one
                    of the greatest ornaments of the University, Mr Playfair. Mr Leslie was on his
                    return from one of his summer trips to the Continent when this lamented
                    occurrence took place. The news met him on being put ashore at Largo, and is
                    thus mentioned in a letter from that place, written on the first of August; in
                    which he also describes an accident that had nearly, as he says, deprived the
                    University of another Professor: “After having been detained for about a week in
                    Holland, and after a tedious but agreeable passage of near ten days, I was at
                    last put ashore here, from a sloop bound from Rotterdam to Grangemouth. Every
                    thing looked joyous; but I had soon the tidings of poor Playfair’s death, which
                    was most unexpected and distressing. The loss to the university is severe I
                    suspect that you were nearly deprived of two professors at once; for on Tuesday
                    the 13th ultimo, I met with an alarming accident in Holland. I had passed the
                    evening at a clergyman’s with an intelligent merchant, late Provost of Aberdeen.
                    On coming out of the house, at the end of the Boomtiges Street, or the street
                    with rows of trees, the Maas running close, I stepped hastily forward to show
                    him the Comet, and the quay being quite dark, I fell eight feet, and then
                    plunged four feet in the water. This was the affair of an instant, and I felt
                    that I was drowning; but I quickly recovered myself, and was helped out, with no
                    damage but that of a bruise sustained in the fall.” The eyes of the Patrons, and
                    others interested in the University, were now turned to Mr Leslie, as the person
                    best qualified to fill the vacant Chair. Two years before, when Mr Playfair was
                    abroad, and an arrangement failed for carrying on the Class, Mr Leslie, at the
                    very commencement of the session, unhesitatingly undertook the task for his
                    absent colleague ∙,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Mr
                    Playfair expressed his gratitude, in very warm terms, for the promptness with
                    which Mr Leslie, on this occasion, relieved him rom what would have otherwise
                    proved an unpleasant predicament; and it is but justice to the latter to mention
                    the act, as showing <hi rend="superscript"> t</hi> h <hi rend="superscript">
                    at</hi> the placability of his nature, aided perhaps by the consciousness of
                    intellectual power, had entirely obliterated those feelings wlnch the somewhat
                    severe critique of his <hi rend="italic">Geometry</hi> in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Edinburgh Review,</hi> known to have been written by Mr Plavfair, would ιave
                    left to rankle, and produce the ordinary results, in a mind more irritable or
                    less magnanimous.</p></note> but, independently of this circumstance, his
                    eminence in mathematical and physical science was such, that no one else could
                    reasonably be thought of; and he accordingly was, without difficulty, appointed
                    to the Chair; being thus a second time, but in more melancholy circumstances
                    than on the former occasion, nominated a successor to his early friend.</p>
                <p>The Chair to which he was thus unexpectedly called was unquestionably that for
                    which he was best suited; and had he happened to be placed in it at the
                    commencement of his professorial career, science in all probability would have
                    derived greater benefits than she actually reaped from his powers. The time
                    spent in his mathematical compositions would have been more profitably employed
                    in that wider and richer province which he was so peculiarly qualified to
                    cultivate. One of the first cares of his new situation was the extension of the
                    Apparatus required for that greatly enlarged series of experiments which he
                    thought necessary for the illustration of the Course. This, indeed, was an
                    object of which, from the first to the last year of his incumbency, he never
                    lost sight; and it is due to him to state, that it was through his exertions
                    that the means of experimental illustration, in the Natural Philosophy Class,
                    were for the first time made worthy of the place. Viewing him merely as a
                    teacher, it must be admitted that he was not eminent. He was apt to forget, or
                    rather did not perceive, that the connecting links between premises and
                    conclusion, though familiar to the teacher, may, to the learner, be all unknown;
                    that views quickly reached by the acquired perceptions of the one, must be
                    opened up, step by step, to the yet imperfect vision of the other; and that it
                    is the imperative duty of a public instructor to bring down knowledge from its
                    highest spheres, and place it on a level adapted to the powers of unpractised
                    understandings. His views of the nature of science were grand and animating; and
                    his strictures on the great discoveries which constitute the epochs of its
                    history, sometimes swelled into lofty strains of admiration; but, generally, in
                    lecturing, as in writing, he wanted that consecution of thought, and that
                    perspicuity of exposition, without which reasoning cannot be made intelligible,
                    nor its conclusions satisfactory. Still, the attraction of his numerous
                    experiments, the celebrity of his name, and the opinion entertained of his
                    extraordinary powers, joined with great simplicity and affability of manner,
                    concurred to secure him the respectful homage of his students, and to sustain
                    the glory of the University. In 1823, he published, chiefly for the use of his
                    class, a volume entitled <hi rend="italic">Elements of Natural
                    Philosophy</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> being the first of a Course intended to
                    extend to three, and to exhibit a comprehensive view of the principles of that
                    congeries of sciences which we are accustomed to class under the above term.
                    Here, as was the case with his Mathematical Course, his plan was not completed;
                    for he published no part of it but the volume mentioned, which includes only
                    Mechanics and Hydrostatics. A second edition of this volume, corrected, and
                    augmented with Notes, was published in 1829, three years before his death.</p>
                <p>Mr Leslie had early determined to visit Italy at a fit opportunity; and he at
                    last, in the summer of 1823, carried his design into execution. He set out with
                    a mind still glowing with youthful enthusiasm, at the prospect of beholding the
                    “eternal city but, whether from his entertaining too lofty conceptions, or from
                    his view being too hurried and superficial, the tour, in as far at least as
                    respected that crowning object of it, ended in disappointment. The following
                    letter, written at Innsbruch on the 11th of August, contains a brief outline of
                    his journey. “I have thus reached the frontiers of Germany on my return from
                    Italy. I have fortunately achieved the principal objects of my tour; and though
                    I have travelled slowly, I have seen a great deal in a short time. From Geneva I
                    proceeded by Lausanne up the Valois to Brieg—thence crossed the Simplon, and
                    descended through the plains of Lombardy to Milan. From this place I advanced by
                    Parma and Modena to Bologna—next crossed the Appenines to Florence—again crossed
                    another part of that broad chain to Rome. For various reasons, I made the
                    ‘eternal city’ the limit of my journey. I therefore traversed the Appenines
                    again to Ancona—skirted a considerable portion of the Adriatic—returned to
                    Bologna, and thence proceeded to Mantua. I spent two days, about twenty miles
                    from that place, at an old chateau, the residence of Acerbi, wflio accompanied
                    me to Verona. Thence I went to Trent, and journeying through the Tyrol, have
                    reached this spacious, interesting city. Italy has rather fallen below my
                    expectations, whilst Switzerland has surpassed my early impressions. The passage
                    of the Simplon alone is worth the journey; but the route through the Tyrol,
                    though not so sublime, is highly picturesque. Italy has every thing on a grand
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:193204673" xml:id="kp-eb0713-4673-0250"/>scale. The
                    plains, mountains, rivers, works of art, are all majestic and noble. But there
                    is no comfort. Rome itself stands in the midst of a desert. Its grandeur has
                    always been artificial—the result of force or fraud. I have seen whatever is
                    most interesting; and I am inclined to differ very widely from our ordinary
                    travellers. I heard much of the <hi rend="italic">malaria,</hi> but I escaped
                    untouched. I suffered little from the heat, and bore it better than the natives.
                    Conformably to the custom, however, I was a sort of prisoner during a great part
                    of the day—the windows shut to exclude every ray of light; and I was only called
                    at times to look out, by the babbling chant of the Monks, with their torches and
                    crosses, carrying the dead to their graves, and followed by the Charitable
                    Brethren, like ghosts, apparelled in white sheets, with only holes for their
                    eyes. They seemed better fitted to terrify the living than to comfort the
                    dying.” Two years after this, he made another tour on the Continent, in which he
                    seems only to have gone over ground in France, the Netherlands, and Holland,
                    which for the most part he had traversed before. This, we believe, was the last
                    of his journeys abroad.</p>
                <p>The only important production of Mr Leslie’s latter years was that which formed
                    his crowning benefaction to this work—his Discourse on the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Progress of Mathematical and Physical Science during the eighteenth
                    century</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> which, with others of a similar
                    description, constitute its first volume. The opening tribute to Mr Playfair, of
                    whose history of the earlier progress of these sciences, this Discourse is a
                    continuation, does honour alike to the writer’s candour and taste. “The progress
                    of mathematical and physical science during the brilliant period which closed
                    with Newton and Leibnitz, has,” he says, “been traced with fidelity and
                    sustained interest by the hand of a master, whose calm judgment weighed
                    impartially the different claims of discovery, whose powers of illustration
                    could expand the fine results, and whose luminous eloquence was commensurate
                    with the dignity of the subject.” Nor is his observation on his own task less
                    just; namely, that the more crowded field of discovery which it presents
                    rendered it one of increased difficulty ;—“its multifarious materials often
                    lying scattered among the countless volumes of the Transactions of learned
                    Societies.” His arrangement of these materials, and his view of the whole
                    subject, is comprehensive, vigorous, and spirited; and the greater ease and
                    perspicuity of its style make this the most agreeable of all his writings.</p>
                <p>The volumes of the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Philosophical Journal,</hi>
                    published between 1824 and 1829, contain some small contributions, which may be
                    here mentioned as also belonging to his latter years. The first consists of <hi
                    rend="italic">Remarhs on the Light of the Moon and of the Planets</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> the second, of an <hi rend="italic">Enumeration of the
                    Instruments requisite for Meteorological observations</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi> the third, of a <hi rend="italic">Letter on the Goniometer</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> and the last, of <hi rend="italic">Observations on the
                    Theory of Compression, applied to discover the internal constitution of our
                    Earth.</hi> The characteristic boldness and poetical dress of his speculations
                    are abundantly displayed even in these small productions. In the first of them,
                    he endeavours to show that the moon is <hi rend="italic">aphosphorescent</hi>
                    substance, like the Bolognian stone; and he anticipates a period when “she will
                    no longer cheer our nights by her soft and silvery beams; when she will become
                    dim and wane, and seem almost blotted from the blue vault of heaven. To our most
                    distant posterity,” he adds, “this prospectis indeed gloomy; but other changes
                    will arise to renovate and embellish the spectacle of the universe.” In the
                    last, he carries his reasonings to the startling conclusion, that the crust of
                    the planet on which we tread includes “an immense concavity, not dark and
                    dreary, as poets have fabled, but containing <hi rend="italic">light</hi> in its
                    most concentrated state, shining with intense refulgence and overpowering
                    splendour !”</p>
                <p>Early in the year 1832, which unhappily proved to be that of his death, he was,
                    on the recommendation, we believe, of Lord Brougham, then Lord High Chancellor,
                    created a Knight of the Guelphic Order. This honour was also conferred on
                    several other distinguished men of science, at the same time. In a letter
                    mentioning this occurrence, he says, “my holiday title is now of course Sir
                    John; but I shall always retain an affection for my old distinction of <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Professor.”</hi> He had but few other titular distinctions of
                    any sort; for he was far from setting any value on those arising from fellowship
                    with Scientific Bodies. He was a member of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, but
                    not of that of London. The only distinction of this kind that he in the least
                    degree prized was his being elected a Corresponding Member of the Royal
                    Institute of France. This took place, with honour, in 1820; the choice, if we
                    recollect rightly, having fallen upon him, in preference to others then
                    proposed, by a majority of thirty-three out of thirty-seven votes.</p>
                <p>For a few years before the fatal one above mentioned, his occupations had been
                    agreeably diversified, by his attention to the improvement of a small estate,
                    called Coates, situate near his native place, of which he made a purchase. Here,
                    the house and garden being every way commodious and suitable, and surrounded
                    with scenes endeared by his earliest recollections, he loved to reside; and even
                    those of his friends who most regretted that, his precious time should be wasted
                    on rural occupations, could not but sympathise with his feelings, and rejoice
                    that the honourable labours of the Philosopher had enabled him to secure such a
                    retreat. No one could enjoy more vigorous or constant health; and though of a
                    corpulent habit of body, he was exceedingly active, and fond of exercise. His
                    strength, and the longevity of his family—a circumstance on which he himself
                    founded flattering hopes—alike gave promise of longer life; and it is melancholy
                    to think that its close was but too probably hastened by one of his foibles—a
                    contempt for medicine, and an unwillingness to think that he could be seriously
                    ill. In the last days of October, whilst engaged in superintending some
                    improvements on his grounds, he exposed himself to wet, and caught a severe
                    cold. This was fol- <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> lowed by erysipelas in one of
                    his legs, which he neglected, and again imprudently exposed himself in the
                    fields. He soon afterwards became dangerously ill, and expired at Coates, on the
                    evening of Saturday the third of November 1832, in the sixty-seventh year of his
                    age.</p>
                <p>It has been well observed by Dr Johnson, that “of every great and eminent
                    character, part breaks forth into public view, and part lies hid in domestic
                    privacy. Those qualities which have been exerted in any known and lasting
                    performances, may, at any distance of time, be traced and estimated; but those
                    peculiarities which discriminate every man from all others, if they are not
                    recorded by those whom personal knowledge enabled to observe them, are
                    irrecoverably lost.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    prevent “this mutilation of character,” as the same writer calls it, we shall
                    close our narrative with a few details more particularly illustrative of the
                    mind, opinions, and dispositions of this remarkable person. His discoveries, and
                    the facts and controversies connected with them, may be discussed by many; and

                    enjoyed all the advantages for observation which long and intimate “personal
                    knowledge” alone can supply, we think it right to endeavour, though briefly, to
                    prevent some characteristic features from being “irrecoverably lost.” The
                    portrait may be imperfect; we cannot, indeed, complete it to our own
                    satisfaction on our narrow canvass; but, in as far as the sketch extends, we can
                    honestly say that it is faithfully copied from nature.<note anchored="true"

                    originally proceeded.</p></note></p>
                <p>It would be impossible, we think, for any intelligent and well-constituted mind,
                    thoroughly acquainted with the powers and attainments of Sir John Leslie, to
                    view them without a strong feeling of admiration for his vigorous and inventive
                    genius, and of respect for that extensive and varied knowledge, which his active
                    curiosity, his excursive reading, and his happy memory, had enabled him to amass
                    and digest. Some few of his contemporaries in the same walks of science may have
                    excelled him in profundity of understanding, in philosophical caution, and in
                    logical accuracy; but we doubt if any surpassed him, whilst he must be allowed
                    to have surpassed most, in that creative faculty one of the highest and rarest
                    of nature’s gifts—which leads to and is necessary for discovery, though not
                    all-sufficient of itself for the formation of safe conclusions; or in that
                    subtilty and reach of discernment which seizes the finest and least obvious
                    qualities and relations of things— which elicits the hidden secrets of nature,
                    and ministers to new and unexpected combinations of her powers. “Discoveries in
                    science,” says he, in one of his works, “are sometimes invidiously referred to
                    mere fortuitous incidents. But the mixture of chance in this pursuit should not
                    detract from the real merit of the invention. Such occurrences would pass
                    unheeded by the bulk of men; and it is the eye of genius alone that can seize
                    every casual glimpse, and discern the chain of consequences.” With genius of
                    this sort he was richly gifted. Results overlooked by others were by him
                    perceived with a quickness approaching to intuition. To use a poetical
                    expression of his own, they seemed “to blaze on his fancy.” He possessed the
                    inventive in a far higher degree of perfection than the judging and reasoning
                    powers; and it thus sometimes happened, that his views and opinions were not
                    only at variance with those of the majority of the learned, but inconsistent
                    with one another. Notwithstanding the contrary testimony, explicitly recorded,
                    of the founders of the English Experimental School, he denied all merit and
                    influence to the labours of the immortal delineator of the Inductive Logic. He
                    freely derided the supposed utility of Metaphysical Science, without perceiving
                    that his own observations on <hi rend="italic">Causation</hi> virtually
                    contained the important admission, that physical is indebted to mental
                    philosophy for the correct indication of its legitimate ends and boundaries. His
                    writings are replete with bold and imaginative suppositions; yet he laments the
                    “ascendancy which the passion for hypotheses has obtained in the world.”<note

                    in matters of ordinary life was, to say the least of it, as conspicuous as his
                    tendency to scepticism in science. It has been profoundly remarked by Mr Bugaid
                    Stewart, that “though the mathematician may be prevented, in his own pursuits,
                    from going far astray,* by the absurdities to which his errors lead him, he is
                    seldom apt to be revolted by absurd conclusions in other matters.” “Thus, even
                    in physics,” he adds, “mathematicians have been led to acquiesce in conclusions
                    which appear ludicrous to men of different habits.” Something of this sort was
                    observable in the mind of this distinguished mathematician. He was apt, too, to
                    indulge in unwarrantable applications of mathematical reasoning io subjects
                    altogether foreign to the science; as when he finds an analogy between
                    circulating decimals and the lengthened cycles of the seasons! But when the
                    worst has been said, it must be allowed that genius has struck its captivating
                    impress over all his works. Whether his bold speculations lead him to figure the
                    earth as enclosing a stupendous concavity filled with light of overpowering
                    splendour; or to predict the moon’s arrival at an age when her “silvery beams”
                    will become extinct; or to ascribe the phenomena of radiated heat to aerial
                    pulsations; we at least perceive the workings of a decidedly original mind.
                    This, however, is not all. His theoretical notions may be thrown aside or
                    condemned; but his exquisite instruments, and his experimental combinations,
                    will ever attest the utility no less than the originality of his labours, and
                    continue to act as helps to farther discovery. We have already alluded to the
                    extent and excursiveness of his reading. It is rare, indeed, to find a man of so
                    much invention, and who himself valued the inventive above all the other powers,
                    possessing so vast a store of information. Nor. was it in the field of science
                    alone that its amplitude was conspicuous. It was so in regard to every subject
                    that books have touched upon. In Scottish history, in particular, his knowledge
                    was alike extensive and accurate; and he had, in acquiring it, gone deep into
                    sources of information—such as parish records, family papers, and criminal
                    trials—which ordinary scholars never think of exploring. The ingenious
                    mathematician, the original thinker, the rich depositary of every known fact in
                    the progress of science, would have appeared to any one ignorant of his name and
                    character, and who happened to hear him talk on this subject, as a plodding
                    antiquary; or, at best, as a curious and indefatigable reader of history, whom
                    nature had blessed with at least one strong faculty, that of memory. His
                    conversation showed none of that straining after “thoughts that breathe, and
                    words that burn,” so conspicuous in his writings. In point of expression, it was
                    simple, unaffected, and correct. Though he did not shine in mixed society, and
                    was latterly unfitted, by a considerable degree of deafness, for enjoying it,
                    his conversation, when seated with one or two, was highly entertaining. It had
                    no wit, little repartee, and no fine turns of any kind; but it had a strongly
                    original and racy cast, and was replete with striking remarks and curious
                    information.</p>
                <p>Viewing the whole of his character, moral and intellectual, it must be confessed
                    that it presented some blemishes and defects. He had prejudices, of which it
                    would have been better to be rid; he was not over charitable in his views of
                    human virtue; he was not so ready, on all occasions, to do justice to kindred
                    merit as was to be expected in so ardent a worshipper of genius; and his care of
                    his fortune went much beyond what is seemly in a philosopher. But his faults
                    were far more than compensated by his many good qualities ;—by his constant
                    equanimity, his cheerfulness, his simplicity of character almost infantile, his
                    straightforwardness, his perfect freedom from affectation, and, above all, his
                    unconquerable good nature. He was, indeed, one of the most placable of human
                    beings; and, notwithstanding ,his general attention to his own interest, it is
                    yet undeniable, that he was a warm and good friend, and a relation on whose
                    affectionate assistance a firm reliance ever could be placed. He was fond of
                    society, and greatly preferred and prized that of the intelligent and refined;
                    but no man ever was more easily pleased; no fastidiousness ever interfered with
                    his enjoyment of the passing hour; he could be happy, and never failed to

                    pass an afternoon with mere boys, discoursing to them pleasantly upon all topics
                    that presented themselves, just as if they had been his equals in age and
                    attainments. He was thus greatly liked by many who knew nothing of his learning
                    or science, except that he was famous for both.</p>
                <p>He was never married. As to his person,—he was somewhat under the middle size,
                    and corpulent, but strong and well limbed; and though his face was large and
                    florid, there was that about his eyes and forehead which seemed to show that he
                    was no ordinary man. There is a Bust of him by Joseph; a Portrait of the
                    ordinary size, taken a few years before his death, by Wilkie; and a Head, drawn
                    at an earlier period, by Henning, which presents a striking likeness.</p>
