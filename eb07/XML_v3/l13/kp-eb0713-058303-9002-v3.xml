                    natural philosopher of great merit and celebrity, born at Geneva on the 8th of
                    February 1727, was the son of James Francis de Luc, descended From a family
                    which had emigrated from Lucca and settled it Geneva in the fifteenth
                    century.</p>
                <p>His father was the author of some very respectable pub-ications in refutation of
                    Mandeville and other sceptical writers; and he had the means of giving his son
                    an excellent education, although he found it convenient to establish him in a
                    commercial engagement, which principally occupied the first forty-six years of
                    his life, without any other interruption than that which was occasioned by some
                    journeys of business into the neighbouring countries, and a few scientific
                    excursions among the Alps. During these, however, he collected by degrees, in
                    conjunction with his brother William Antony, a splendid museum of mineralogy,
                    and of natural history in general, which is still preserved at Geneva by the
                    younger Deluc, his nephew. He at the same time took his share of the public
                    business of the state, as one of the council of Two Hundred; and he is still
                    remembered with respect by his fellow citizens, though he revisited them but
                    once, and hat for a few days only after his emigration, which was the
                    consequence of some unexpected misfortunes in commerce. He bore them with
                    fortitude, and he rather rejoiced than lamented at the change of his pursuits,
                    when ιe removed to England in 1773. He was made a fellow of the Royal Society in
                    the same year, and was appointed leader to the queen; a situation which he
                    continued to told for forty-four years, and which afforded him both leisure and
                    a competent income. In the latter part of his life he obtained leave to perform
                    several tours in Swit-erland, France, Holland, and Germany. In this last country
                    he passed six years, from 1798 to 1804; and after his return he undertook a
                    geological tour through England. When he was at Göttingen, in the beginning of
                    his Ger man tour, he received the compliment of being appointed honorary
                    professor of geology in that university; but he never entered upon the active
                    duties of a professorship. He was also a correspondent of the Academy of
                    Sciences at Paris, and a member of several other scientific associations.</p>
                <p>His favourite studies were geology and meteorology. The situation of his native
                    country had naturally led him to contemplate the peculiarities of the earth’s
                    structure, and the properties of the atmosphere, as particularly displayed in
                    mountainous countries, and as subservient to the measurement of heights. He
                    inherited from his father a sincere veneration for the doctrines of
                    Christianity, and a disposition to defend the Mosaic account of the creation,
                    against the prevailing incredulity of the age. His royal patroness was most
                    anxious to encourage and promote his labours in this field; and he is
                    universally allowed to have had great success in removing the specious
                    objections which had been advanced by his antagonists, against the comparatively
                    recent formation of the present continents. The testimony of Cuvier is
                    sufficient to establish his character in this capacity, and to place him, at the
                    same time, in the first rank of modern geologists. His original experiments
                    relating to meteorology are, however, not less valuable to the natural
                    philosopher; and he discovered many facts of considerable importance relating to
                    heat and moisture. He noticed the disappearance of heat in the thawing of ice,
                    about the same time that Black founded on it his ingenious hypothesis of latent
                    heat. He ascertained that water was more dense about forty degrees of Fahrenheit
                    than at the temperature of freezing, expanding equally on each side of the
                    maximum; and he was the original author of the opinion since re-advanced by Mr
                    Dalton, that the quantity of aqueous vapour contained in any space is
                    independent of the presence or density of the air, or of any other elastic
                    fluid; though it appears difficult to reconcile this opinion with some of the
                    experiments of our author’s great rival, Saussure, a philosopher who, as he very
                    candidly allows, made, in many respects, more rapid progress in hygrometry than
                    himself. Deluc’s comparative experiments on his own hygrometer, and on
                    Saussure’s, show only that both are imperfect; but it may be inferred from them,
                    that a mean between both would in general approach much nearer to the natural
                    scale than either taken separately. It appears also probable that Saussure’s is
                    rather less injured by time than Deluc’s, which has been found to indicate a
                    greater degree of mean moisture every year than the last.</p>
                <p>Deluc was a man of warm feelings, and of gentle and obliging manners, fulfilling
                    on all occasions the various duties of a husband, a father, a master, and a
                    friend; at the same time that his literary and scientific merits, and his
                    unremitting attention to the service of the queen, insured her respect and her
                    kindness. He saw her daily for many years, and in his last illness, which was
                    long and painful, she showed him repeated marks of benevolent regard. He died at
                    Windsor on the 7th of November 1817, leaving a variety of works, which will long
                    be remembered in the scientific world.</p>

                    moisture, evaporation, and the indications of hygrometers and thermometers,

                    than the <hi rend="italic">Lettres sur</hi><hi rend="italic">lα Terre.</hi> It
                    is principally intended as a refutation of the Vulcanian system of Hutton and
                    Playfair, who deduced the changes of the earth’s structure from the operation of
                    fire, and attributed a higher antiquity to the present state of the continents
                    than is required in the Neptunian system adopted by Deluc after Dolomieu.</p>
                <p>26. He sent to the Royal Society, in 1809, a long paper on separating the
                    chemical from the electrical effects of the pile, with a description of the
                    electric column and aërial electroscope, in which he advanced opinions so little
                    in unison with the latest discoveries of the day, especially with those of the
                    president of the society, that the council probably thought it would be either
                    encouraging error or leading to controversy to admit them into the <hi
                    rend="italic">Transactions.</hi> He had, indeed, on other occasions shown
                    somewhat too much scepticism in the rejection of new facts; and he had never
                    been convinced even of Mr Cavendish’s all-important discovery of the composition
                    of water. The paper was afterwards published in Nicholson’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Journal</hi> (xxvi.), and the dry column described in it was constructed by
                    various experimental philosophers. It exhibited a continual vibrating motion,
                    which was made more sensible by the sound of a little bell, struck by the
                    pendulum at each alternation; and the vibration was more or less rapid,
                    according to the state of the atmospherical electricity, and according to other
                    circumstances affecting the column; but the motion ceased at last, after a
                    continuance of several months, or perhaps years. There are also papers in
                    volumes xxi. xxii. xxvii. xxviii. xxxii. xxxiii. and xxxv. mostly on electricity
                    and galvanism, together with one on hygrology, a letter to Bode on comets, and a
                    fanciful theory of the origin of the heat derived from compression. Some of them
                    are dated from Ashfield, near Honiton, in Devonshire.</p>
                <p>27. In the <hi rend="italic">Philosophical Magazine,</hi> volumes xxxv xlii.
                    xliii. and xlv. there are also some papers, on electricity and geology,
                    especially on that of St Michael’s Mount, of Vesuvius, and of Northumberland;
                    and a note on the sympathetic vibrations of the pendulums of two clocks placed
                    near each other.</p>
