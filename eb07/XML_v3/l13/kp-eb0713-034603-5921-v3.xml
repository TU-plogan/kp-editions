                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">LIMA</label>, a department of the republic of Peru, in South
                    America, bounded on the north by Truxillo, on the east by Junin and Ayacucho, on
                    the south by Arequipa, and on the west by the Pacific Ocean. The Cordillera of
                    the Andes ranges along its eastern side. The climate is considered as fine; and
                    although the atmosphere is cloudy and humid, it seldom rains throughout the
                    whole year. The heat is excessive along the coast; but as the country becomes
                    more elevated towards the interior, the air becomes purer and more temperate.
                    Earthquakes are frequent, from six to twelve occurring annually; and these
                    convulsions of nature on a large scale seem to observe a periodical return at
                    intervals of fifty years. It is watered by several streams, but none of any
                    considerable size, the largest being the river Rimae, which, during the summer
                    months, is much swollen by torrents from the Andes. The soil is good, and
                    agricultural pursuits are followed to a considerable extent. The chief wealth of
                    the country <hi rend="superscript"> 7</hi>, however, consists in the produce of
                    the mines, which are worked by proprietors in Lima. Next to Lima in importance
                    is the sea-port of Callao, situated in the bay of that name, and containing a
                    population of about 8000. The port is defended by three castles, which are
                    surrounded with thick walls, a moat, and batteries of great strength. It is
                    connected with the city of Lima by a straight road, about six indes in length.
                    It was entirely destroyed by an earthquake in 1746, when upwards of 3000 of the
                    inhabitants are said to have perished, and nineteen ships sunk in the harbour.
                    Trade has lately much increased, and the town has greatly improved. Its
                    appearance, however, is mean and unfavourable.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Lima,</hi> a city in the department of that name, and
                    capital of the republic of Peru, is situated in a spacious plain, on the
                    southern bank of the river Rimae, about ten miles from the sea. Long. 76. 56.
                    45. W . Lat. 12. 3. S. The population, according to the latest accounts, is
                    40,000 inhabitants. It was founded in 1553 by Pizarro, who called it La Ciudad
                    de les Reyes, or City of Kings; but the name has been since changed to Lima, a
                    corruption of Rimae. The city is built in an amphitheatre formed by sierras of
                    the great chain of the Andes, which shelter it from the northerly <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193205934" xml:id="kp-eb0713-5934-0347"/>and easterly winds. The
                    figure of the city is nearly semicircular, the river being the diameter, and is
                    two miles long from east to west, and one and a quarter in breadth. It consists
                    of 157 squares, and 355 streets, built at right angles, and about twenty-five
                    feet wide. The streets are well paved, and furnished with streams of water,
                    which are arched over, and rendered subservient to cleanliness and other
                    conveniences. It stands nearly 700 feet above the level of the sea, and, when
                    seen from Callao roads, presents a beautiful appearance, owing to its numerous
                    domes and spires rising from so elevated a situation. The entrance is by a fine
                    avenue Or public walk called the Almeda, <hi rend="subscript"> i</hi> at the
                    termination of which are the ruins of a handsome gate. It is surrounded by a
                    brick wall, flanked with thirty-four bastions, but without embrasures. At the
                    south-eastern extremity of the city is a small citadel, called Santa Catalina;
                    and on the right side of the river, connected with the city by a bridge, is the
                    suburb of San Lazarro, which is inhabited by the lower classes. The city having
                    suffered much from earthquakes, the houses are generally built of one story, the
                    walls being composed of mud and cut straw, formed into bricks by the heat of the
                    sun, and strengthened by pieces of timber. The houses of the wealthy
                    inhabitants, built in a Moorish style, generally consist of a square pile, two
                    stories in height, enclosing a quadrangular court, which is surrounded with
                    piazzas, and sometimes contains a second, or even third inner court. The Plaza,
                    or great square, in the centre of the city, is surrounded partly with shops and
                    private houses, and partly with public buildings. On the eastern side is the
                    cathedral, to the north of which is the principal parish church, adorned with a
                    beautiful façade, and adjoining it is the archiepiscopal palace, part of which
                    is now occupied by the Peruvian synod. On the north side are the viceroy’s
                    palace and the city hall, under which is the city jail. In the centre of the
                    square is a fine brass fountain, erected in 1653, the water of which being the
                    best in Lima, is conveyed to all parts of the city. In this square the principal
                    market is held. The cathedral is a noble edifice, and at each corner is a tower,
                    nearly 200 feet in height. The interior is very rich, and the high altar has a
                    magnificent appearance. The roofs of the houses, and domes and spires of the
                    churches, are built of wood, covered with stucco-work, variously ornamented,
                    which presents a splendid appearance when viewed from a distance; but the
                    traveller is apt to feel disappointed upon a nearer inspection. Formerly the
                    number of monks was reckoned at 1200, but they have now decreased nearly one
                    fifth in amount. There are fourteen convents for females, and a number of
                    religious houses, into which ladies retire for a short period. Some of the
                    conventual churches are remarkably beautiful; that of St Domingo having a tower
                    about 180 feet high, which is the loftiest in the city. There are several
                    hospitals of a charitable and benevolent description. The university, founded in
                    1549, and possessing peculiar privileges, is a handsome building, with several
                    good halls, and an extensive library.</p>
                <p>The higher classes of the inhabitants are generally well educated, though in a
                    limited sense; and the females are equally celebrated for their vivacity and
                    beauty. They are said, however, to be somewhat licentious in their manners; and
                    their walking-dress, consisting of a petticot fitted close to the body, and a
                    hood thrown over the head, seems peculiarly favourable to intrigue. Both sexes
                    are addicted to smoking; but the females do not practise it openly. All classes
                    of the inhabitants are extravaganten their dress, the richest stuffs of Europe
                    being used even on ordinary occasions. Music, cards, and dancing, are the
                    principal sources of amusement; bull-fights having been abolished. Gambling
                    formerly prevailed in the higher circles; but this vice has of late sensibly
                    diminished. The</p>
                <p>Spaniards of Lima are at present almost all creoles; the European Spaniards
                    having quitted the country at the period of the revolution. There were formerly
                    15,000 slaves; but slavery was abolished in 1828 by the new constitution. Lima
                    has been repeatedly laid in ruins by earthquakes, the most destructive of which
                    were those of 1678 and 1746, when, out of 3000 houses, not more than twenty were
                    left standing. In 1822 and 1828 also very destructive earthquakes occurred. The
                    political events which have occurred in Lima will be fully detailed under the
                    article <hi rend="smallcaps">Peru.</hi></p>
