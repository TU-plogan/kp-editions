                    distinguished constitutional lawyer and historian, was born on the 13th of
                    January 1763, at Strynzia, his paternal estate, situated on the mainland of
                    Orkney. He received the rudiments of his education at the grammar-school of
                    Kirkwall; and, when he had attained the proper age, he was sent to the
                    University of Edinburgh, where he completed his elementary studies. Here he not
                    only made the acquaintance, but gained the friendship, of many young men of
                    great promise, who afterwards rose to eminence in different walks of life. He
                    was admitted a member of the Speculative Society, which had for its object
                    general literature and science. It had been founded about twenty years before,
                    and, during that period, numbered amongst its members all the distinguished
                    youth of Scotland, as well as many foreigners of distinction. “Laing,” says Sir
                    James Mackintosh,“was most acute and ingenious, but his meaning was obscured by
                    the brevity which he too much pursued in his writings, and by an inconceivable
                    rapidity of utterance.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                <p>Mr Laing passed as advocate in the year 1784. Whether he had any predilection for
                    the profession of the law, or made choice of it merely for the respectability it
                    confers, and the opportunity it sometimes affords of attracting notice as a
                    politician, we have had no means of ascertaining. It seems certain, however,
                    that notwithstanding his general talents, and his great powers as a close and
                    vigorous reasoner, he <pb break="no" facs="nls:193201678"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0713-1678-0021"/>was never much employed professionally, nor known
                    as a successful practising barrister. It will not altogether account for this
                    failure to attract business, that the manner in which he delivered his arguments
                    was neither dignified nor pleasing; that, in fact, his speeches were uttered
                    with an almost preternatural rapidity, in harsh and disagreeable tones. Such
                    reasoning as he was accustomed to employ scarcely required the extraneous
                    assistance of manner to recommend it, even to a jury; whilst, at the period in
                    question, nearly all the pleading in Scotland was addressed solely to the
                    judges, whose well-disciplined intellects might have been supposed more likely
                    to acknowledge the force of reason and of argument, even when divested of all
                    extrinsic attractions, than to be moved by rhetorical elegance or by holiday
                    declamation. Laing has evinced, in his writings, an intimate acquaintance with
                    almost all the departments of Scotch law; in treating historical subjects, he
                    skilfully availed himself of this knowledge, as well as of the experience which
                    he had acquired in his profession; and hence, taking all the circumstances into
                    view, it may safely be concluded that the limited extent of his practice is to
                    be attributed rather to his own choice than to any deficiency of talent or want
                    of aptitude for conducting forensic business. Nor will this conclusion be
                    weakened by the perusal of the admirable address which he delivered in defence
                    of Gerrald, one of the foredoomed victims of the persecution that then raged
                    against the advocates of a reform in the representation of the people; an
                    address so clear and cogent in its reasoning, so irresistible in its deductions,
                    that it must have carried conviction to all minds except those of a time-serving
                    jury and of political judges.</p>
                <p>In 1790 or 1791, Mr Laing, and his friend Mr Adam Gillies, now Lord Gillies, took
                    a house, which they furnished, and in which they continued to live together
                    until the year 1801, when Mr Gillies married. During the whole of this period,
                    Mr Laing was much engaged in researches relative to the history of Scotland; and
                    in the course of it also, he formed an acquaintance and commenced a
                    correspondence with Mr Fox, which appears to have continued with but little
                    interruption until the death of that illustrious statesman.</p>
                <p>The first fruits of his laborious investigations were employed in preparing for
                    the press the last volume of Henry’s History of Great Britain, which the author,
                    at the time of his death, had left incomplete. The matter collected by Henry did
                    not extend to a period at which the work could with propriety be terminated; and
                    Mr Laing was requested by the author’s executors to write two additional
                    chapters, to which, when completed, he annexed a dissertation on the crimes
                    attributed to Richard III. The labours of two such authors, so very different in
                    their views, character, and style, could not be very aptly united in the same
                    volume, much less amalgamate or coalesce into a whole; besides, many persons
                    considered Mr Laing as an uncompromising liberal, whose historical deductions
                    seemed harsh and prejudiced, when compared with the calm and subdued narrative
                    of Henry. But, however dissimilar these writers may have been in their style and
                    manner, as well as in their respective modes of treating historical subjects,
                    there are few persons, at least in the present day, who will be disposed to give
                    the preference to the latter. Henry was a man of good sense and considerable
                    industry, but, of all our historians, perhaps he is the least philosophical; and
                    if he appears calm and moderate, he does so because he is an entire stranger to
                    strong opinions and strong sympathies. Laing, on the other hand, was a man of
                    vigorous judgment and profound speculation; he had no taste whatever for the
                    romance of history; and if he argued keenly in support of the opinions which he
                    had adopted, he did so, not like a man who is determined to maintain a point
                    merely because he had asserted it,.and felt personally interested in showing it
                    to be true, but as one who, having considered the matter maturely, had submitted
                    it to the arbitration of bis own judgment, and was resolved to annihilate all
                    those prejudices which prevented others from seeing it in the same light in
                    which it appeared to himself. It is absurd to blame an historian for his
                    opinions, because that is equivalent to censuring him for his honesty; it is
                    only when, as has sometimes happened, he distorts facts in order to support
                    preconceived opinions, instead of regulating his opinions according to the
                    ascertained facts, and taking care that the one shall be a legitimate deduction
                    from the other, that he merits reproach and condemnation. The sole object of Mr
                    Laing was to discover truth; and there can be no doubt whatever that he sought
                    the truth in the love of it. It is not impossible that his prepossession in
                    favour of the class of principles which he had adopted may, in some instances,
                    have led him to deduce hasty or improper conclusions from the facts he had
                    ascertained; but although the stern severity of his character was calculated to
                    provoke opposition, and even to envenom criticism, no political adversary has
                    ever accused him of perverting facts. His historical probity, indeed, has been
                    tacitly recognised even by those who were most bitterly opposed to the opinions
                    and doctrines which he laboured so strenuously to inculcate. To Mr Laing has
                    sometimes been ascribed the Memoir of Henry, which accompanied the last volume
                    of his History; but, if we arc not greatly misinformed, it was drawn up by Sir
                    Henry Moncrieff, the leading executor, by whom Mr Laing had been induced to
                    write the continuation.</p>
                <p>The publication of this work was partly the occasion of procuring Mr Laing the
                    notice and acquaintance of Dr Parr. In an original letter, dated Hatton, near
                    Warwick, 22d of March 1794∣, and addressed to Malcolm Laing, Esq. the latter
                    says: “Often have I told our illustrious friend, Mr (afterwards Sir James)
                    Mackintosh, of the pleasure and the instruction which I have received from your
                    continuation of Dr Henry’s History. I saw with delight the comprehensive and
                    elevated views which your mind takes of general politics. I thought your
                    statement of the controversy about Warbeck so correct, your proofs so apposite,
                    and your reasoning upon them so acute and impartial, that not one lurking weed
                    of a doubt will ever shoot up again in my own mind.” And, in another part of the
                    same letter, the writer adds, “The energy of your style, the extent of your
                    inquiries, and the solidity of your observations, have increased the interest
                    which I ĥad long ago taken in the reputation of this history; and I am speaking
                    from motives, selfish if you please, but such as no man of letters would deign
                    to dissemble, when I express my earnest wishes that your professional
                    engagements would permit you to finish a performance, in which you have already
                    engaged so far as to impress every intelligent reader with the most favourable
                    opinions of your taste, judgment, and comprehensive researches.”</p>
                <p>But the more immediate occasion of this letter was one which does infinite credit
                    to the heart and the feelings of the distinguished writer, whilst it forms a
                    sort of epoch in the career of Mr Laing. On the 3d of March 1794&lt;, Joseph
                    Gerrald had, after a mock trial, been convicted of a crime which had no
                    existence before, on a law created for the occasion, by a verdict pronounced
                    without legal evidence. Mr Laing had been counsel for Gerrald, in behalf of whom
                    he delivered one of the most able and convincing addresses that ever proceeded
                    from the bar; and Gerrald, again, had been a favourite pupil of Parr, who,
                    notwithstanding all his errors and follies, still retained for him the affection
                    of a parent. “Gerrald,” says he, in the letter already quoted, “Gerrald, whom
                    you have protected as a client, I taught as a boy. Dissipated as he has been by
                    the pleasures, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193201691" xml:id="kp-eb0713-1691-0022"
                    />and worn out by the cares, of a most unhappy life, he presents, and can only
                    present, to your view the broken and deformed ruins of a mind originally great.
                    But my recollection is often carried back to his better days; to the powers of
                    his genius, when they were unfolding themselves in a genial and fruitful spring;
                    to the beneficial and rapid effects of the culture I bestowed on them during
                    their evolution; and to the rich harvest of knowledge which I once had in
                    prospect for him, when time should have matured those talents which nature had
                    conferred, and education cherished. In this season of sorrow, or, I should
                    rather say, this crisis of danger, his follies and irregularities make me cling,
                    with more eager efforts of remembrance, to the contemplation of endowments so
                    blasted, and of virtues doomed so soon to decay. But forgive me, if, by
                    associations so natural to a lettered mind, I find relief in turning aside from
                    the horrors of his situation, to express my gratitude for the benevolence, and
                    my veneration for the abilities, of that man, who has endeavoured to shield him
                    from the merciless arm of oppression. You, sir, sympathise, as I do, with his
                    sufferings. You are struck, like myself, with admiration, even at the diminished
                    glories of his genius. You have defended him as I could not do, in the course of
                    his trial. You visit him, as I wish to do, and you console him, amidst the gloom
                    of his confinement. For all these masterly exertions, and all these humane
                    offices, in favour of poor Joseph, I entreat you to accept the tribute of my
                    praise and my thanks.” This truly eloquent letter concludes with a most
                    affecting prayer, that “when he (Gerrald) is removed to that dreary shore, from
                    which he never will return, his spirit may not be broken down by the severities
                    of banishment; that his misfortunes may lead him into a train of wise and
                    virtuous reflection; that his old age may be calm; and that his death may be an
                    hour of serenity and resignation.” Mr Laing, in replying to this “inestimable
                    letter,” which has hitherto remained unpublished, observes, in reference to his
                    ill-fated client :— “In the cause of liberty others may have experienced a
                    punishment, severer if possible, not more iniquitous. Voluntarily to await a
                    sentence which he foresaw was inevitable, and knew to be illegal, exalts him to
                    the rank of the most illustrious martyrs of freedom, and will render his trial
                    memorable, whether the constitution which he sought to regenerate shall perish
                    or survive. In a remote exile, inaccessible unless to the prayers of his
                    friends, he will enjoy the dignified consolation of having discharged his duty
                    to society, and the conscious possession of a mind superior to vicissitudes, not
                    to be broken by misfortune or woe.”</p>
                <p>But, to return from this digression, whatever defects some may have discerned in
                    the continuation of Henry’s History, the public generally appreciated the merit
                    of the work, and honoured the author with its approbation. Thus encouraged, Mr
                    Laing continued his historical labours, and, having directed his attention to
                    his native country, published, in the year 1800, his History of Scotland, from
                    the union of the crowns, on the accession of James VI. to the throne of England,
                    to the union of the kingdoms, in the reign of Queen Anne: And this was
                    accompanied with two dissertations, historical and critical; one on the Gowry
                    conspiracy, and the other on the supposed authenticity of Ossian’s Poems. As in
                    the previous case of Dr Henry’s History, this work proved very dissimilar in its
                    character to that of which it was in fact intended as a continuation; we mean,
                    the History of Dr Robertson. Of the elaborate elegance, the studied rhythm, the
                    balanced cadences, and the academical polish, which distinguish the style of the
                    latter, it is almost entirely destitute. It cannot be pronounced either harsh or
                    inelegant, but it is certainly complicated; and, from the constant effort made
                    to compress a great deal of meaning into few words, it becomes occasionally
                    obscure. It is terse and vigorous, but hard and abrupt; without volume, fluency,
                    or elasticity. The continuity is in the thoughts rather than in the expressions;
                    the sequence of the ideas is complete, but their full development is often left
                    to be supplied by the mind of the reader. In the art of narration, he is as much
                    inferior to Robertson, as he surpasses him in all the higher attributes of a
                    philosophical historian; in tracing events and actions to their true causes and
                    motives, disentangling intricate and perplexed questions, sifting evidence, and
                    steadily exploring his way through the mazes of contradictory testimony. In his
                    remarks and reflections, he also displays a depth and originality of thought
                    which Robertson could never have reached, as well as an adventurous boldness of
                    speculation from which the latter would have shrunk with dismay. But his chief
                    merits consist in the great critical power he displays in discussing complicated
                    questions of evidence; in seizing and steadily keeping in view the strong points
                    of each case, as it comes before him; in the mastery which he exercises over all
                    the resources of analysis; in the inflexible perseverance with which he pursues
                    his investigations; and in combining the acuteness of the practised lawyer with
                    the discrimination of the close observer of human nature. Hence, the separate
                    dissertations, though to some they may appear to contain nothing but special
                    pleadings, are perhaps the most instructive as well as admirable portions of the
                    work. Upon all subjects, indeed, the ruling spirit of the author prompted him to
                    search for debated questions, few of which he has left without some sort of
                    settlement of the point in dispute. In this manner he has treated many points in
                    English history, and amongst these the celebrated question as to the authorship
                    of <hi rend="italic">Eikon Basiliké</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> a subject
                    afterwards treated with consummate ability by his illustrious friend and
                    countryman Sir James Mackintosh, and concerning which he proved that, whatever
                    share Charles may have had in the original suggestion or even partial
                    composition of the work, Gauden was the person who had prepared it for the
                    press, and whose claims on this account were afterwards fully and liberally
                    acknowledged.</p>
                <p>Mr Laing appears also to have taken a peculiar pleasure in setting at nought
                    local and national prejudices. Exulting in the free exercise of his strong
                    reasoning powers, he scrupled not to attack prevailing opinions, however deeply
                    rooted in the minds and affections of his countrymen, when he conceived that
                    they were founded in error. This characteristic peculiarity is strikingly
                    exemplified in his Dissertation on the authenticity of the Poems ascribed to
                    Ossian. These productions required no depth of argument, no minute investigation
                    of facts, to support their credit amongst an enthusiastic people, much more
                    accessible to the impulses of feeling than the deductions of reason; whilst, on
                    the other hand, those who questioned their genuineness shrunk from directly
                    encountering what they naturally considered as unconquerable prejudices. But Mr
                    Laing was not a man who would either acquiesce in a received opinion as such, or
                    hesitate for an instant to bring it before the tribunal of reason; and,
                    accordingly, he proceeded, without scruple or remorse, to examine the
                    pretensions of Macpherson, on the broad and intelligible principle of an
                    investigation into the facts upon which they were professedly grounded.</p>
                <p>The arguments in this Dissertation may be resolved into three great classes or
                    divisions. The first class consists of a logical examination of the arguments
                    and proofs produced, or supposed to have been produced, in favour of the
                    authenticity of the poems ascribed to Ossian, with a vigorous exposition of
                    their errors and fallacies; but, as the author is necessarily obliged to confine
                    himself to mere sceptical arguments, this is perhaps the least interesting and
                    satisfactory part of the investigation. The second class of arguments, embracing
                    those derived from contemporary documents and chronological facts, not only
                    forms <pb break="no" facs="nls:193201704" xml:id="kp-eb0713-1704-0023"/>that
                    portion of the subject in the treatment’ of which the extensive reading and
                    discriminating sagacity of the author were most conspicuously displayed, but
                    constitutes a body of evidence which finally demolished every pretence for
                    considering the poems of Ossian as authentic translations of the productions of
                    a Highland bard of the fourth century. The third division of the subject,
                    containing an examination of the internal evidence furnished by the poems
                    themselves, if not the most conclusive part of the inquiry, is certainly that
                    which gives us the highest conception of the author’s critical ingenuity,
                    indefatigable industry, and searching spirit of investigation. He produces terms
                    expressive of ideas which could scarcely be supposed or even imagined to have
                    entered into the minds of the early and rude population of the Highlands; he
                    points out similes, and trains of thought, derived or plagiarised from the
                    writings of other authors, particularly from Virgil, Milton, Thomson, and the
                    Book of Psalms; and, finally, he institutes a curious comparison between the
                    method of arranging terms and expressing ideas in the poems of Ossian, and that
                    which is exhibited in a forgotten poem, called <hi rend="italic">The
                    Highlander,</hi> published in early life by Macpherson,—pointing out many
                    striking coincidences, and clearly establishing, to a certain extent, a complete
                    identity of authorship. In short, the Dissertation, taken as a whole, though
                    strained in some points, and overlaboured in others, presents a body of evidence
                    and argument, which has completely satisfied all impartial persons as to the
                    spuriousness of the pretended translations of Macpherson, and almost reduced the
                    defenders of their authenticity to despair. The onset made by Johnson had proved
                    entirely abortive, because it was a mere sudden ebullition, the offspring of
                    passion and prejudice, rather than of inquiry or examination; but the attack of
                    Laing was of a very different character; and being conducted in a scientific
                    manner, by regular approaches from various points, it ultimately succeeded in
                    demolishing every defence, and in forcing the defenders of Ossian to capitulate
                    at discretion. “I was delighted and instructed by your History,” says Dr Parr,
                    in an original letter now before us, “and I sincerely think your remarks on
                    Ossian one of the most able and satisfactory pieces of criticism I ever read; it
                    amounts to demonstration, and does the highest credit to your sagacity and your
                    knowledge.”</p>
                <p>But the author of this fierce attack upon one of the strongholds of Scottish
                    national pride did not achieve his victory without suitable reprobation. The
                    Highlanders were loud in their wailings, and the public prints teemed with
                    ebullitions of their wrath. All their national feelings were excited into
                    furious activity against the man who had dared to dispute the authenticity of
                    Macpherson’s pretended translations, which every Highlander was prepared to
                    receive, with undoubting faith, as the genuine inspirations of Ossian. Mr Laing
                    was regarded as a sort of monster, who, having no bowels of compassion, had set
                    all feelings of patriotism at defiance. To many it seemed an anomaly in human
                    nature, that a Scotchman should thus voluntarily undermine a fabric of national
                    glory; and, unable otherwise to account for such sacrilege, they sought to
                    discover in the author motives of petty rancour, local prejudice, and
                    inconceivable animosity. Mr Laing’s Dissertation, however, had the merit of
                    eliciting a report by a committee of the Highland Society of Scotland,
                    “appointed to inquire into the nature and authenticity of the poems of Ossian
                    but although the inquiry was conducted under the superintendence of Mr Henry
                    Mackenzie, and brought to light some curious facts previously unknown, it left
                    the question as to the authenticity of Macpherson’s pretended translations very
                    much in the same situation in which it originally stood. Meanwhile, Mr Laing
                    brought the controversy to a final issue by publishing a work, entitled the
                    Poems of Ossian, containing the Poetical Works of James Macpherson, in prose and
                    rhyme, with Notes and Illustrations, the nature of which may easily be
                    conceived. This work is in fact a great literary curiosity. Like a victim decked
                    out for immolation, it is conspicuously introduced to the world only to render
                    its destruction the more signal and notorious. About the same time, an attempt
                    was made to answer Mr Laing’s argument, by a gentleman of the name of Macdonald;
                    and, two years afterwards, an elaborate work, complacently termed a Confutation,
                    was published by Dr Graham of Aberfoyle, who, however, gave a somewhat unlucky
                    specimen of his qualifications for the task, by quoting, as authority concerning
                    the Celts, the treatise of Tacitus <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Moribus Germanorum,</hi> which refers entirely to the nations of Teutonic
                    origin. Mr Laing did not feel himself called upon to answer an argument based
                    upon such infelicitous and inapplicable authority.</p>
                <p>His next work was one which, if possible, occasioned a still greater outpouring
                    of wrath than his Dissertation on the Poems of Ossian. In 1804 he published a
                    new edition of his History, to which he prefixed, in two volumes, a Preliminary
                    Dissertation on the participation of Mary Queen of Scots in the Murder of
                    Darnley. The object of this disquisition is declared in the title; and,
                    throughout the whole detail, the author never for an instant deviates from the
                    conclusion of guilt, which it is the professed purpose of his elaborate
                    induction to establish. This, in fact, is the peculiar manner in which he has
                    almost invariably treated controverted questions. Having first formed his own
                    opinion from analytical investigation, he proceeds at once to establish it by
                    synthetical probation; he arranges his documents and produces his arguments with
                    the precision and conciseness of a practised logician; and, in the treatise in
                    question, he no more hints at the possibility of the queen’s innocence, than the
                    crown-lawyer at that of the prisoner against whom he seeks for a verdict of
                    guilty. He goes directly forward to his object, accumulating proofs or
                    presumptions of criminality as he advances, till at length he carries our reason
                    as it were by storm, and compels us, whether we will· or not, to acquiesce in
                    the judgment which from the first we had been prepared to hear pronounced. Few
                    who have read this extraordinary production can ever forget the startling
                    exactness with which the arguments are suited to the facts, or the strict
                    accordance of the reasoning with all the details of the murder as given in the
                    narrative of that event submitted to the reader. The reciprocal adaptation is in
                    every respect complete; and hence the whole fabric must be overthrown together,
                    or the joint force and full result of all must be unconditionally admitted.
                    There is no other alternative, no intermediate term; Mr Laing grapples with his
                    subject in such a manner as to render it impossible to withstand the force of
                    his attack except by utterly destroying the assailant.</p>
                <p>Hence it has been generally acknowledged that the effect of his reasoning is
                    irresistible. “His inquiry into the controverted question of Mary’s
                    participation in the death of Darnley,” says Dr Parr, “is minute without
                    tediousness, and acute without sophistry. Whether I consider,” adds he, “his
                    sagacity in explaining causes, his clearness in relating facts, his vigour in
                    pourtraying characters, or his ingenuity in unfolding and enforcing principles,
                    I shall ever find reason to lament that the continuation of Hume’s History was
                    not undertaken by a writer <hi rend="italic">βο</hi> eminently qualified as Mr
                    Laing for a work so arduous and important.” In referring to the production in
                    question, as one peculiarly characteristic of his genius, a very able writer in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Review</hi> employs still stronger language. “Mr
                    Laing’s merit as a critical inquirer into history, an enlightened collector of
                    materials, and a sagacious judge of evidence,” says he, “has never been
                    surpassed. If any man,” adds he, “believes the inr∙</p>

                <p>nocence of Queen Mary, after an impartial and dispassionate perusal of Mr Laing’s
                    examination of her case, the state of such a man’s mind would be a subject
                    worthy of much consideration by a philosophical observer of human nature.” Sir
                    James Mackintosh expresses an opinion equally decided, but much more specific
                    and detailed, “I have just finished a careful perusal of your Dissertation on
                    Mary,” says he, in a letter to Mr Laing, dated Bombay, 28th of July 1807; “and I
                    think myself bound to profess my shame for having ever doubted the atrocious
                    guilt of that princess. Hume and Robertson are undoubtedly too mild. The
                    original documents themselves cannot be read without conviction. Whoever doubts
                    the genuineness of the long letter from Glasgow, or of Haubert’s confession,
                    must either be incorrigibly prejudiced, or altogether unaccustomed to the
                    examination of evidence. If she were tried before me, I should certainly direct
                    a jury to find her guilty. Her adversaries (with the exception of Murray) seem a
                    detestable gang. Only think of the conferences at York and Westminster, in which
                    there were at least two accusers, Lethington and Morton, who were more or less
                    concerned in the murder; for, after all Morton’s dying piety, by his own
                    account, while his hands were reeking with Rizzio’s blood, he haggles for a
                    written warrant from Mary; he suffers at least the murderous plot to proceed for
                    months, undisturbed by him, to its completion, and he at last acts a principal
                    part in the collusive acquittal of the man whom he knew to be the murderer.
                    Indeed the Scottish court and nation were then little less barbarous, bloody,
                    and perfidious, than Abyssinia in the time of Bruce, though the literature of
                    Buchanan, and the beauty of the unfortunate Mary, throw a little fallacious
                    brilliancy around them.” <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi></p>
                <p>Besides the works already enumerated, Mr Laing edited <hi rend="italic"
                    >The</hi><hi rend="italic">Historie</hi><hi rend="italic">and Life of King James
                    the Sext,</hi> which was published at Edinburgh in the year 1804, from a copy of
                    the original manuscript which David Crawfurd of Drum-soy, historiographer to
                    Queen Anne, had employed in comoiling his Memoirs of the Affairs of Scotland.
                    The occasion of this publication arose out of the exposure made by Mr Laing, in
                    his Historical Dissertation on the Murder of Darnley, of the real character of
                    Crawfurd’s work, and his “complete detection of the first of those literary
                    forgeries for which the Scots are still so peculiarly distinguished.” This he
                    had announced without reserve in the Dissertation. “It is necessary to observe,”
                    says he, “that Crawfurd’s Memoirs are a downright forgery, which has ntroduced
                    much error into the present controversy. Hav-ng found a manuscript history of
                    the times, he expunged every passage unfavourable to Mary, inserted every fact
                    or assertion which he found in Camden, Spottiswood, or Melvil, whom he quotes on
                    the margin as collateral authorities; and, after compiling Memoirs of his own,
                    protests, that without wresting the words, he has adhered to the sense and
                    meaning of the original. From Goodall’s advertisement to the second edition, it
                    appears that the manuscript was transferred to Mr Hamilton of Wishaw. On making
                    proper inquiry, ĭ had the good fortune to find it among the papers of his
                    descendant, the present Lord Belhaven. From the same advertisement it appears,
                    that Goodall collated Crawfurd’s Memoirs, not only with Keith’s copy, but with
                    another of the same manuscript in the Advocates’ Library;—nor had Goodall the
                    honesty to explain the forgery which he must have perceived, or to state, in a
                    single instance, the discrepancy between the manuscript and the printed
                    Memoirs.” <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> These severe strictures naturally
                    provoked criticism, and Mr Laing was soon afterwards induced to publish <hi
                    rend="italic">The Historic of the Life of King James the Sext,</hi> as contained
                    in the Belhaven manuscript, the avowed prototype of Crawfurd’s Memoirs; a
                    publication which he justly regarded not merely as a vindication of himself, but
                    also as an instructive exposure of one of the grossest literary forgeries that
                    have ever been employed to pervert the genuine history of Scotland. <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 3</hi></p>
                <p>In the year 1805 Mr Laing married Miss Margaret Carnegie, daughter of Mr Thomas
                    Carnegie of Craigo, a most respectable gentleman in Forfarshire, and
                    sister-in-law to his friend Lord Gillies. He continued to reside chiefly in
                    Edinburgh, until 1807, in which year he was chosen member of parliament for
                    Orkney. He was then in a very indifferent state of health; but, during that one
                    session, he occasionally attended his duty in parliament, where, notwithstanding
                    the disadvantages of his manner, he was listened to with much attention and
                    respect. These brief and irregular appearances may be said to comprise his whole
                    career as a legislator; for, although he still continued a member, a serious
                    illness, with which he was now seized, prevented his further attendance in
                    parliament, and thus deprived the country of the services of one who thoroughly
                    understood, and was eminently qualified to advance, its true interests. Whether
                    from excessive study and exertion, or from original debility of constitution, he
                    suffered severely from a nervous disorder, which committed frightful inroads on
                    his already enfeebled frame, and ultimately reduced him to such a state of
                    weakness, that he required to be supported by artificial means to prevent him
                    from fainting. In 1810, his illness still continuing, he went to reside in
                    Orkney, hoping no doubt to derive benefit from breathing his native air. Nor
                    were these hopes altogether disappointed. By the cessation of laborious and
                    exhausting intellectual exertion, and still more perhaps by the absence of
                    excitement, his health was to a certain extent re-established; and as his ever
                    active mind required, as a condition of health, employment of some description,
                    he sought and found it in attention to the primitive occupation of mankind. From
                    this period he devoted himself entirely to agricultural pursuits, in which he
                    displayed his usual zeal, and in which, also, his labours were crowned with
                    success. He farmed with advantage to himself, but <hi rend="italic superscript">

                    reflection struck me,” adds Sir James, in continuation. “In so small a town as
                    Edinburgh then was, and at so little a court as that of Mary, I think it
                    impossible that all the circumstances of a murder so long conspired,
                    communicated to so many noblemen, and executed by so many of Bothwell’s
                    dependents, should not have very soon transpired, and been really known in the
                    whole society, before any formal evidence of them was in existence. The
                    contrivance of a false tale, the forgery of the letters, &amp;c. were, in such
                    circumstances, impossible. Haubert, the queen’s valet, was a person of some
                    consequence. The gentlemen who were Bothwell’s retainers were still more so.
                    Their confession, if forged, would have been contradicted by witnesses enough. I
                    speak now with some little experience in such matters. I have been three years a
                    criminal judge, and I know what becomes of <hi rend="italic">secrets</hi> in
                    small societies.”</p>

                    “One of the immediate results of this publication (by Mr Laing),” says the
                    learned and ingenious editor, “was the discovery of the Newbattle manuscript, by
                    the late noble Marquess of Lothian, who, with that liberality of spirit which in
                    him was native and indelible, did not lose a moment in communicating his
                    discovery to Mr Laing; and, in 1806, Mr Laing, with his characteristic
                    promptitude and zeal, had made prepa-rations foi printing the continuation of
                    the work which this manuscript put into his possession, together with the
                    corrections on his previous publication which it had enabled him to make. From
                    this object, however, he was afterwards diverted by other more important
                    pursuits; and it is now (1825) only, for the first time, that the entire History
                    and Life of King James the Sixth has been given to the public.” (Preface, <hi

                    break="no" facs="nls:193201730" xml:id="kp-eb0713-1730-0025"/> certainly with
                    far greater advantage to Orkney, into which he introduced many beneficial
                    improvements, the general adoption of which is chiefly ascribable to his
                    example. But his health, which had so long been infirm, continued to decline
                    till November 1818, when he expired suddenly, without any suspicion having been
                    entertained of the immediate approach of death.</p>
                <p>Mr Laing was personally much esteemed, and, as an historian, greatly admired by
                    Mr Fox, whose acquaintance he appears to have made some time in the year 1804·.
                    In a note prefixed to an interleaved copy of the first edition of the History of
                    Scotland, containing Dr Parr’s corrections, and dated on Good Friday 1803, the
                    doctor says, “Mr Fox is a great admirer of your work, and he is also <hi
                    rend="italic">puri sermonis amator.</hi> 1 wish you were acquainted. As a
                    critic, he is quite as captious and fastidious in protecting English idiom from
                    Scottish invasion as I am.” It would appear that not long afterwards the wish
                    here expressed was realized. Mr Fox not only admired Mr Laing’s work, but
                    emphatically pronounced it a “treasure ;” opening, as he said, new sources of
                    interesting information; presenting new views of important transactions; and
                    constituting a valuable acquisition to all who desire to obtain a true knowledge
                    of the history of the nation of which it treats. The correspondence which passed
                    between these distinguished individuals still remains unpublished, though it
                    would no doubt form a very interesting addition to our stock of epistolary
                    information respecting the history of the period to which it relates. During the
                    time that Mr Laing represented his native county in parliament, and was
                    permitted by the state of his health to attend to his parliamentary duties, he
                    gave an active and zealous support to the short administration of his
                    illustrious friend, of whose character and principles he was an ardent and
                    devoted admirer.</p>
                <p>The severity of Mr Laing’s manner, the uncompromising nature of his opinions, the
                    inflexible sternness of his principles, and the keen controversial character of
                    his writings, all united to raise up against him a numerous host of adversaries,
                    who but too often endeavoured to conceal their deficiency in knowledge and in
                    argument by the bitterness of their scurrility, or the virulence of their abuse;
                    but, in his private capacity, he appears to have had no enemies. On the
                    contrary, he was much esteemed and beloved by his personal friends, all of whom
                    that still survive agree in describing him as a single-hearted, upright, and
                    truly honest man, who, to the courage necessary for asserting any truth however
                    dangerous, or combating any prejudice however inveterate, added a higher and
                    rarer endowment, namely, the magnanimity of acknowledging and correcting an
                    error when it was distinctly shown to be such. He loved truth for its own sake;
                    and though he delighted to discuss controverted questions both in history and in
                    letters, he never contended for victory like a vulgar disputant, but only
                    sought, by the honest means of research and reasoning, to disencumber such
                    questions of the errors and fallacies with which he conceived them to have been
                    overgrown, and to set before the world the uncorrupted truth in its native
                    simplicity and purity. That his judgments were sometimes harsh, and his censure
                    often unsparing, when the occasion seemed scarcely to require any great display
                    of severity, is what his admirers have never denied nor attempted to conceal;
                    but, on the other hand, it is proper to keep in view, that strong convictions
                    naturally give birth to strong expressions, and that a mind at once actuated by
                    the love of truth, rectitude, and liberty, and by an innate abhorrence of
                    falsehood, iniquity, and oppression, could scarcely be expected, in surveying
                    some of the darkest and blackest portions of our annals, to refrain from giving
                    utterance to that moral indignation which every lover of freedom and of virtue
                    must feel in contemplating the abuse of law, justice, religion, humanity, and
                    government, for the purpose of enslaving and oppressing a whole people. Finally,
                    to Mr Laing, more perhaps than to any other historian or critic of his country,
                    belongs the undoubted merit of having cleared away much rubbish, removed much
                    prejudice, refuted numerous and grave errors, detected not a few impostures,
                    and, generally, placed both the characters and events of that portion of our
                    national history of which he treats, in a clearer and more satisfactory light
                    than he found them.</p>
