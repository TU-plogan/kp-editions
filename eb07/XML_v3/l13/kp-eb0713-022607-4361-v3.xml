                    Charles</hi></label>, a diligent and accurate astronomer, born at Paris, on the
                    23d of November 1715, was the son of Peter Lemonnier, of St Sever, in
                    Normandy.</p>
                <p>His father was a professor of philosophy in the College d’Harcourt, and member of
                    the Academy of Sciences. He distinguished himself, as a teacher, by his activity
                    in promoting the introduction of mathematical reasoning into the Cartesian
                    philosophy. Under such auspices, the son might have enjoyed facilities for the
                    cultivation of any of the sciences; but he soon showed a decided preference for
                    astronomy, and began to be a practical observer before he was sixteen. In the
                    month of November 1732, Mr Fouchy procured him the use of a mural quadrant of
                    three feet radius, and he soon applied himself with diligence to the
                    determination of the sun’s greatest equation, an investigation which he
                    continued for many years; and in 1741, he found the equation to amount to 1° 55'
                    3ľ'; a quantity differing only by 7" from Delambre’s latest determination.</p>
                <p>He presented to the Academy of Sciences, in 1735, an elaborate map of the moon,
                    accompanied by some remarks; and in the month of April of the following year,
                    before he was twenty-one years old, he was made a member of the Academy, in the
                    character of Adjunct Geometrician. He continued to be a constant contributor to
                    its Memoirs for more than fifty years. The winter of 1736 and 1737 he passed at
                    Torneo, with Clairaut and Maupertuis, as a member of a committee appointed by
                    the Academy for measuring a degree in Lapland; and he was not less zealous than
                    any of his colleagues in the execution of that arduous undertaking.</p>
                <p>He is considered as having effected, in conjunction with Lacaille, a complete
                    reformation in the practical astronomy of France. He entered very early into
                    correspondence with the English astronomers of the day; they had carried their
                    instruments and modes of observation to a higher degree of perfection than their
                    neighbours; and Lemonnier was of great use to the science, in making known to
                    his countrymen the practical methods of Flamsteed, and in introducing the
                    instruments of Graham and Bird.' In April 1739, he was made a foreign member of
                    the Royal Society of London, and for the last twelve or fourteen years of his
                    life he is said to have been the senior member of the society. He was the first
                    that introduced the effects of nutation, then lately discovered by Bradley, into
                    the solar tables; and he complained bitterly of Lacaille’s injustice, in not
                    giving him due credit for the improvement.</p>
                <p>The Due de Noailles made him known to the king of France, who was fond of his
                    company, and showed him many kindnesses. In 1742, he gave him apartments at the
                    Capucins in the Rue St Honoré, where he continued to live till the Revolution.
                    On another occasion, when he had taken great pains to fix an accurate meridian
                    at St Sulpice, the king made him a present of 15,000 livres, which he expended
                    in the purchase of instruments, as the greatest luxury that be was capable of
                    enjoying.</p>
                <p>The places of the stars, which he determined in 1740, served Lalande for the
                    purpose of computing their proper motions, though they differed a little from
                    the results of Bradley’s observations. About 1746, he was much engaged in
                    examining the inequalities of Saturn, produced by the attraction of Jupiter; and
                    Euler employed his computations in the theory which obtained a prize in 1748;
                    each confirming the accuracy of the other. He continued to observe the moon,
                    without intermission, for fifty years, though a small part only of his
                    observations was published.</p>
                <p>In the year 1748 he went to England, partly for the purpose of obtaining further
                    information from a personal acquaintance with the astronomers and opticians
                    resident in London, and partly in order to observe the solar eclipse <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193204374" xml:id="kp-eb0713-4374-0227"/> of that year, in
                    a situation where it would be very nearly annular. He proceeded accordingly to
                    Scotland with the Earl of Morton, accompanied by Short the optician, and they
                    observed the eclipse together at Aberdour, an ancient residence of Lord
                    Morton’s, in Fifeshire. They obtained their time from the College at Edinburgh,
                    where there was a transit instrument, by means of the flash of a cannon fired
                    from the castle at twelve, and another five minutes after. “The eclipse was so
                    nearly annular, that, at the nearest approach, the cusps seemed to want about
                    one-seventh of the moon’s circumference to be joined; yet a brown light was
                    plainly observed, both by Lord Morton and myself,” says Mr Short, “to proceed or
                    stretch along the circumference of the moon, from each of the cusps, about one
                    third of the whole distance of the cusps from each cusp; and there remained
                    about one third of the whole distance of the cusps not enlightened by this brown
                    light, so that we were for some time in suspense whether or not we were to have
                    the eclipse annular with us. During the greatest darkness, the planet Venus was
                    seen at Edinburgh, and other places, by a great number of people, but I did not
                    hear of any other stars being seen. The darkness was not great, but th© sky
                    appeared of a faint languid colour.” In fact, our mornings and evenings are
                    always illuminated by a light, which has acquired more or less of a red tinge in
                    its oblique passage through the atmosphere; and when we have a similar light
                    without the redness, the contrast between the sensation and the memory makes it
                    appear “faint,” that is, greenish or grey, instead of white. Mr Lemonnier was
                    particularly anxious to measure the moon’s diameter, which “he found 29'47∣", ’
                    ' agreeing precisely with the computed diameter, and not requiring any
                    correction for the supposed effects of irradiation. A similar remark was made by
                    a very accurate practical astronomer in the eclipse of 1820.</p>
                <p>In order to verify the position of his mural quadrant, which was of eight feet
                    radius, and made by Bird, Lemonnier felt the advantage of having a moveable one
                    to compare with it, and he procured a block of marble eight feet by six, and
                    fifteen inches thick, turning on an axis, to which he fixed his smaller
                    instrument, of five feet radius, in order to be able to reverse its position. He
                    devoted a considerable portion of his time to the investigation of the laws of
                    magnetism, and especially to the variation of the compass; and he endeavoured to
                    ascertain the effect of the moon’s influence on the winds, and on the atmosphere
                    in general.</p>
                <p>Lemonnier had long disputed the accuracy of the Parisian base, measured by
                    Cassini and Maraldi, but he was at last convinced that his objections were
                    groundless. He was originally a most zealous friend and patron of Lalande; but
                    afterwards, having taken offence at some slight cause, he refused to see him for
                    many years. In fact, he appears to have been somewhat obstinate and irritable;
                    but he is said to have had genius, zeal, activity, and intelligence, as well as
                    credit in the world, and reputation among men of science. He was a voluminous
                    writer; he had much learning and sagacity, but he often wanted precision in his
                    language and his reasoning. In November 1(91, he had a paralytic attack, which
                    terminated his scientific career, though he survived it till the 2d of April
                    1799, when a second stroke carried him off, at Héril, near Baieux. He was made,
                    in the mean time, one of the 14+ original members of the National Institute, as
                    a testimony to the merit of his past labours.</p>
                <p>He had married, in 1763, Mlle, de Cussy, a lady of very respectable family in
                    Normandy. He had three daughters; the first married Mr de Parfouru, who was an
                    early victim of the Revolution; the second the celebrated Lagrange; and the
                    third her uncle, Lemonnier the physician, who was also a man of considerable
                    science, and a member of the Royal Society of London.</p>
                <p>From 1735 to 1790, there are very few volumes of the Memoirs of the Academy
                    without one or more of Lemonnier’s papers; but though not unimportant in the
                    aggregate, they are somewhat uninteresting in the detail. They relate almost
                    exclusively to astronomical observations; eclipses, occultations, appulses,
                    oppositions, and conjunctions; solstices, longitudes and latitudes; with some
                    accounts of astronomical instruments and apparatus. There are also some memoirs
                    relating to the sun’s equation and diameter, and on his place, as compared with
                    Arcturus; on the motion of Saturn, and on his fifth satellite; on the expansion
                    of wooden measures; on the transit of Venus, and on the diameter and the tables
                    of that planet; on Euler’s formula for parallax; on the variation of the needle;
                    on lunar altitudes; on the tides; on horizontal refraction; on Saturn’s ring;
                    and on some currents of wind. He also published separately some extensive works,
                    which acquired considerable celebrity.</p>

                    Memoirs of the Academy. The eclipse, which was observed as annular in China,
                    should have been total, according to the computed distance of the luminaries
                    concerned.</p>
