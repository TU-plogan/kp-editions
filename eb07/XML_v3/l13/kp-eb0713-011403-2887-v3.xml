                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">LARES</label>, amongst the ancients, derived by Apuleius from
                    <hi rend="italic">lar familiaris,</hi> a kind of domestic genii or divinities,
                    worshipped in houses, esteemed the guardians and protectors of families, and
                    supposed to reside more immediately in the chimney corner. The Lares were
                    distinguished from the Penates, as the former were supposed to preside over
                    housekeeping, the servants in families, and domestic affairs; whilst the latter
                    were the protectors of the masters of families, their wives, and children.
                    Accordingly the Lares were dressed in short, succinct habits, to show their
                    readiness to serve; and they held a sort of cornucopia in their hands, as a
                    signal of hospitality and good housekeeping. According to Ovid, there were
                    generally two of them, who were sometimes represented with a dog at their feet.
                    Plutarch distinguishes good and evil Lares, as he had before done good and evil
                    genii. There are also some public, others private Lares. Apuleius tells us the
                    domestic Lares were no more than the souls of departed persons, who had lived
                    well, and had discharged the duties of their station; <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193202900" xml:id="kp-eb0713-2900-0115"/>whereas those who had done
                    otherwise were vagabonds, wandering about and frightening people, called <hi
                    rend="italic">Larvae</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Lemures.</hi> The Lares were
                    also called <hi rend="italic">Penates,</hi> and were worshipped under the
                    figures of little marmosets, or images of wax, silver, or earthen ware. The
                    public Lares were also called <hi rend="italic">Compitales,</hi> from <hi
                    rend="italic">compitum,</hi> a cross-way; and <hi rend="italic">Viales,</hi>
                    from <hi rend="italic">via,</hi> a way or public road; as being placed at the
                    meetings of roads and in the highways, and esteemed the patrons and protectors
                    of travellers. The private Lares took care of particular houses and families,
                    and were also called <hi rend="italic">Proestites,</hi> from <hi rend="italic"
                    >proesto.</hi> The Lares were likewise genial gods, and were supposed to take
                    care of children from their birth. It is for this reason that, when Macrobius
                    tells us the Egyptians had four gods who presided over the births of children,
                    viz. Genius, Fortune, Love, and Necessity, called <hi rend="italic"
                    >Proestites,</hi> some interpret him as if he had said the Egyptians had Lares,
                    and they have mentioned that there was a great difference between the Lares of
                    the Romans and the Proestites of the Egyptians. However, the learned Mr Bryant
                    affirms that they were the same. The ancients differ extremely about the origin
                    of the Lares. Varro and Macrobius say that they were the children of Mania; Ovid
                    makes them the issue of Mercury, and the Naiad Lara or Larunda; Apuleius assures
                    us that they were the posterity of the Lemures; Nigridius, according to
                    Arnobius, makes them sometimes the guardians and protectors of houses, and
                    sometimes the same with the Curetes of Samothracia, which the Greeks call <hi
                    rend="italic">Idoei Dactyli.</hi> Nor was Varro more consistent in his opinion
                    of these gods; sometimes making them the manes of heroes, and sometimes gods of
                    the air. Titus Tatius, king of the Sabines, was the first who built a temple to
                    the Lares. The chimney and fire-place in the house were particularly consecrated
                    to them. Tertullian is of opinion that the custom of worshipping the Lares arose
                    from this, that they anciently interred their dead in their houses; and hence
                    the credulous people took occasion to imagine that their souls continued there
                    also, and thus proceeded to pay them divine honours. To this it may be added,
                    that the custom being afterwards introduced of burying in the highways, they
                    might hence take occasion to regard them as gods of the highways. The victim
                    offered to the Lares in the public sacrifices was a hog; but in private they
                    were offered wine, incense, a crown of wool, and a little of what was left at
                    the table. They also crowned them with flowers, particularly the violet, myrtle,
                    and rosemary. Their symbol was a dog, which was usually represented by their
                    side, on account of its fidelity and the service it does to a man in watching
                    his house. They were sometimes also represented as clothed in a dog’s skin. The
                    term <hi rend="italic">Lares,</hi> according to Mr Bryant, was formed from <hi
                    rend="italic">laren,</hi> an ancient word by which the ark was represented. He
                    supposes that the Lares and Manes were the same domestic deities under different
                    names; and that by these terms the Etruscans and Latins denoted the <hi
                    rend="italic">dii arkitae,</hi> who were no other than their arkite ancestors,
                    or the persons preserved in the laren or ark, the genius of which was Isis, the
                    reputed parent of the world, He observes further, that they are described as
                    demons and genii, who once lived upon earth, and were gifted with immortality.
                    Arnobius styles them <hi rend="italic">Lares</hi><hi rend="italic">quosdam
                    genios et functorum</hi><hi rend="italic">animas</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi>
                    and he says that, according to Varro, they were the children of Mania. Huetius
                    <hi rend="italic">(Demonst. Prop.</hi> iv. p. 139) adds, that Mania had also the
                    name of Larunda; and that she is styled the mother <hi rend="italic">of</hi> the
                    demons. By some she is called Lara, and was supposed to preside over families;
                    and children were offered at her altar in order to procure her favour. Instead
                    of these, they offered in after times the heads of poppies and pods of
                    garlic.</p>
