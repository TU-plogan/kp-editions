                <p><label type="entry">LAMBERT, <hi rend="smallcaps">John</hi></label>, was born on
                    the 7th September 1619, in the parish of Kirkby-Malhamdale, in the west riding
                    of Yorkshire, at Calton Hall, the seat of a family of which he was the
                    representative, and which traced its descent from a daughter of the Conqueror.
                    That his father died when he was thirteen years of age, that he married, when in
                    his twenty-first year, a daughter of Sir William Lister, his neighbour, and that
                    he studied the law in an inn of court, but never pursued it as a profession, is
                    all that we find recorded of his early years. He first participated in political
                    measures, as one of those who signed the address to the king, of the 13 th of
                    May 1642, in answer to his demand of a guard of horse from the county of York.
                    He also signed a declaration and protest against raising troops and money, in
                    preparation for the ominous struggle which was then commencing. He also attended
                    the great meeting on Heworth Moor, on the 3d of June, when a petition was
                    presented by Sir Thomas Fairfax, which Charles refused to accept. In August the
                    royal standard was raised, and the civil war was begun; and, in September,
                    Lambert commenced his military career as captain in the parliamentary forces,
                    under Lord Fairfax, who commanded them in the north. In the following year we
                    find him bearing the rank of colonel: and the earliest exploits in which he is
                    know:n to have distinguished himself, were a sally from Hull on the 11th of
                    October 1642, by which he obliged Lord Newcastle to raise the siege; an
                    engagement at Bradford on the 5th of March 1644, wherein he defeated Colonel
                    Bellasis; and the pursuit of this officer and his troops to Selby, which, being
                    joined by Lord Fairfax, he stormed and took on the 11th of April. The siege of
                    York by the combined forces of Lords Fairfax, Manchester, and Leven ensued; and,
                    on the 2d of July, the eventful fight of Marston Moor. Here Lambert and Sir
                    Thomas Fairfax were the two officers by whom the right wing of the parliamentary
                    forces, consisting of cavalry, was commanded. Opposed to it was the cavalry
                    commanded by Prince Rupert, which Lambert and Fairfax charged and broke; but
                    were carried too far by the ardour of pursuit. Lambert appears to have shown
                    much bravery in this action, but others were more instrumental in its important
                    issue. The siege of York was recommenced by the victorious army, and Lambert was
                    sent in to a parley with the governor, which ended in the surrender of that
                    city. Upon the resignation of Lord Essex in January 1645, and the appointment of
                    Fairfax to succeed him as commander-in-chief of the parliamentary forces,
                    Lambert was appointed commissarygeneral of the northern army, and ordered to
                    take charge of the forces in Yorkshire in the absence of Fairfax. Under
                    Lambert’s command, during 1645, the royalists were beaten in two skirmishes, at
                    Keighley and Ferrybridge; and the garrisons of Scarborough, Pomfret, Sandall,
                    Sherborne, Bolton, and Skipton, surrendered to the parliament. In the
                    commencement of 1646 we find Lambert engaged under Fairfax in the west, in
                    subduing the last remnants of the royalist forces in that quarter: we find him
                    at the sieges of Dartmouth, of Truro, and of Excter, which surrendered, the
                    first on the 20th of January, the second on the 14th of March, and the last on
                    the 9th of April; after which he marched with the army to the siege of Oxford,
                    and was one of the commissioners who conducted the negotiation which ended in
                    the surrender of that important city, of which, by the parliament, he was
                    appointed governor. He was afterwards made one of a select council of five (his
                    colleagues being Cromwell, Ireton, Fleetwood, and Whitelocke), to consult on the
                    disposal of the parliamentary forces for the reduction of the few garrisons
                    which still maintained the authority of the king. These were the principal
                    military services which Lambert is recorded to have rendered to his party during
                    the first civil war. In the struggles for ascendancy between the parliament and
                    the army in 1647, Lambert took a prominent part, and was an able advocate of the
                    cause of the latter. In the declarations published on the part of the army,
                    “Colonel Ireton,” says Whitelocke, “was chiefly employed, or took upon him the
                    business of the pen; and having been bred in the Middle Temple, and learned some
                    grounds of the law of England, and being of a working and laborious brain and
                    fancy, he set himself much upon these businesses, and was therein encouraged and
                    assisted by Lieutenant-General Cromwell, his father-in-law, and by Colonel
                    Lambert, who had likewise studied in the Inns of Court, and was of a subtle and
                    working brain.” He was one of the commissioners who, on the 2d of July, attended
                    at High Wycombe, to treat with commissioners from the parliament, and prepared
                    the proposals for the settlement of the kingdom, which they submitted to the
                    parliamentary commissioners at Colnbrooke, on the 3d of August; proposals which
                    insisted neither on the abolition of episcopacy nor the punishment of the
                    royalists, and which contained terms more favourable to regal power than those
                    to which Charles afterwards acceded in the Isle of Wight.</p>
                <p>After delivery of these proposals, Lambert wa⅛ sent into Yorkshire as
                    major-general of the four northern counties. In 1648 the civil war again broke
                    out, and his military talents were again exerted. He defeated Langdale and
                    Musgrave near Carlisle, whilst awaiting a junction with the Scotch army under
                    the Duke of Hamilton, which was about to invade England. The junction, however,
                    could not be prevented; and Lambert, much inferior in strength to the combined
                    armies, was obliged to await the arrival of Cromwell before he hazarded an
                    action. When reinforced by Cromwell in August, the parliamentary forces were
                    scarcely more than 8000 men, whilst those of Hamilton and Langdale were 20,000.
                    But availing themselves of the detached position of the allied forces, the
                    parliamentary generals attacked them successively, and put each army utterly to
                    rout; and Hamilton, who with the remnant of his forces fled towards the south,
                    was pursued by Lambert and his cavalry to Uttoxeter in Staffordshire, where,
                    having in his progress dispersed and beaten the scattered portion of the Scotch
                    army, Lambert forced its commander to surrender. He then followed Cromwell into
                    Scotland, where they were received cordially by Argyll’s party; and Lambert,
                    after remaining awhile at Edinburgh at Argyll’s request when Cromwell had
                    returned, and having received thanks for his good services from the committee of
                    estates, marched back into England to reduce Pomfret, a strong fortress which
                    the royalists had seized anew. Before this place he arrived in December 1648,
                    and here he remained till after the trial and execution of Charles; events in
                    which he bore no part, and of which we have no evidence of his having approved.
                    Pomfret surrendered soon afterwards; and the parliament, on receiving this
                    intelligence in March 1649, voted thanks to him, and a grant of lands out of the
                    demesnes of Pomfret, of the value of L.300 a year, “in <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193201847" xml:id="kp-eb0713-1847-0034"/>respect of his many great and
                    eminent services, performed with much care, courage, and fidelity, as well
                    against the Scots army as against the forces of Sir Marmaduke Langdale, and in
                    reducing the castle of Pomfret, being the last garrison in England held out
                    against the parliament, and in respect of his extraordinary charges therein, he
                    having not been allowed any pay as a major-general.” When the parliament found
                    it expedient to appoint some person to command in Ireland, Sir William Waller
                    was supported by the Presbyterian party, and Lambert, whom Clarendon calls “the
                    second man in the army” (Cromwell being the first) was preferred by the
                    Independents. Both, however, waived their pretensions in favour of Cromwell, who
                    was consequently appointed to the government of Ireland, and soon afterwards,
                    upon the resignation of Fairfax, to the post of commander-in-chief of all the
                    parliamentary forces. Lambert was at the same time made second in command; and
                    the two generals, in June 1650, marched towards Scotland, where Charles II., who
                    had been acknowledged in that portion of his dominions, was at the head of a
                    numerous force, hoping by its aid to subdue the remainder. Lambert, in a gallant
                    but indecisive action near Musselburgh, was wounded, his horse killed, and
                    himself for a while in the hands of the enemy, but was rescued by his troops.
                    Nothing decisive occurred till the memorable battle of Dunbar, in which Lambert
                    led the van, and eminently contributed to the successful issue of that important
                    action; which was followed by the occupation of Edinburgh and Leith, and the
                    surrender of the castle of Edinburgh in the course of the winter. No further
                    advantage was obtained till the summer of 1651, when, in the month of July,
                    Lambert defeated above 4000 of the king’s troops at North Ferry, and obtained
                    minor successes in thecourscof the same month at Inchgarvey and Burntisland. The
                    parliamentary generals had not been careful to keep between the king and the
                    English frontier; and, profiting by their oversight, Charles, immediately after
                    these actions, embraced the bold resoltition of marching into England, and
                    passed through Carlisle on the 5th of August, at the head of 16,000 men. Leaving
                    Monk before Stirling with 7000 men to reduce that fortress, Cromwell and Lambert
                    hastened in pursuit of Charles; and it was the duty peculiarly assigned to
                    Lambert to hover with his cavalry round the royalist army, and harass and divert
                    its progress, whilst Cromwell pursued a more direct route southward, in order to
                    interpose between the king’s army and the capital. Lambert, though with a far
                    inferior force, engaged the royal army at Warrington; but the country, being
                    much enclosed, was unfavourable for his cavalry, and he retired to Knutsford
                    Heath, where he could act with more effect. The king, however, rightly judging
                    that it was Lambert’s policy to disturb the march of the royalist forces, was
                    unwilling to attack him, and passed on towards Worcester. Lambert, instead of
                    pursuing him further, attended Cromwell’s summons for a general rendezvous of
                    the parliamentary forces at Warwick. From thence the combined forces, amounting
                    to about 30,000 men, marched to Worcester, where, on the 3d of September, the
                    anniversary of the battle of Dunbar, occurred that important conflict which
                    reduced Charles from the leader of a mighty host to the condition of a
                    proscribed, disguised, and solitary fugitive. Lambert behaved with skill and
                    gallantry in this battle, in which he was much exposed, and had his horse shot
                    under him. He bore as large a share of the honours of success as could fairly be
                    ascribed to a second in command, where Cromwell was the chief; and the gratitude
                    of the parliament was promptly shown, on the sixth day after the battle, by a
                    resolution “that lands of inheritance in Scotland, to the yearly value of L.1000
                    sterling, be settled upon Major-general Lambert and his heirs, for his great and
                    eminent services for this commonwealth ;” and it was ordered that both of his
                    regiments should continue on the English establishment. In the winter of this
                    year, Lambert was made a commissioner, together with Monk, Vane, St John, and
                    four others, for the settlement of affairs in Scotland, where he remained a very
                    short time, being, on the death of Ireton, appointed by the parliament, in
                    January 1652, to succeed him as lord-deputy of Ireland. But the term of this
                    office was limited to six months, and Lambert, filled with displeasure against
                    the parliament (a displeasure which Cromwell artfully fomented), resigned the
                    proffered post; upon which Fleetwood, who had married Ireton’s widow, the
                    daughter of Cromwell, was appointed in his stead. Lambert appears to have been
                    amongst those who were most favourable to the assumption of supreme power by
                    Cromwell, and whose influence chiefly contributed to elevate him to the
                    situation of protector. He was the leading person in a general council of
                    officers convened to deliberate on the settlement of the kingdom; he was one of
                    a select committee deputed by that council to prepare the ground and conditions
                    of a plan; he participated in framing the <hi rend="italic">instrument of
                    government,</hi> presented it to the council, and urged its acceptance; and he
                    bore a prominent part in the installation of Cromwell as lord-protector. As
                    president of the council, he came forward to declare the dissolution of the
                    parliament (called Barebone's), and the adoption of the plan of government
                    prepared by the council; and invited Cromwell to undertake the office of chief
                    magistrate under this constitution; upon which Cromwell, “having heard the
                    instrument of government read, and taken the oath as directed in the close of
                    the said instrument, Major-general Lambert, kneeling, presented him with a sword
                    in the scabbard, representing the civil sword, which Cromwell accepting, put off
                    his own, intimating thereby that he would no longer rule by the military
                    sword.”</p>
                <p>Lambert sat as member for the west-riding of Yorkshire in the new parliament,
                    which met on the 3d of September 1654. He appears to have been an active member
                    of the legislature, being named on almost all committees, and frequently a
                    teller in divisions; but his share in debate is not recorded, except on one
                    important occasion, where he acted in a manner which appears unquestionably
                    disinterested. It was debated in a committee of the whole house, on the act of
                    settlement, whether the office of protector should be <hi rend="italic"
                    >hereditary</hi> or <hi rend="italic">elective</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and
                    Lambert, on whom, after Cromwell’s death, the office would be most likely to
                    fall, spoke strongly in favour of its being made hereditary.</p>
                <p>In the parliament which was convened in 1656, Lambert was again member for the
                    west-riding of Yorkshire, and exerted himself to maintain that form of
                    government, in the constitution of which he had been principally concerned. He
                    vehemently opposed the proposal of investing Cromwell with the title of king;
                    and though the offer of that title was carried in the obsequious parliament, the
                    opposition of Lambert, and the murmurs of the army, with which he had much
                    influence, made Cromwell feel that it was prudent to decline it. He had at one
                    time resolved to accept the title; upon learning which, Lambert, Fleetwood, and
                    Des-borougĥ, declared to him, in their own names and those of others, that in
                    that event they must resign their commissions, and sever themselves from his
                    councils and service for ever. Cromwell consequently refused the title, but
                    accepted all those other attributes of royalty with which he was invested, on
                    his second inauguration, of the 12th of May 1657. Lambert, disgusted with these
                    inordinate assumptions of power, refused to take the oath of fidelity to the
                    protector; gave up his commissions, which brought him an income of six thousand
                    pounds per annum; and retired on a pension of L.2000. Lambert took no prominent
                    part in political events until after the death of Cromwell, the succession of
                    Richard, and the meeting of a new parliament in January 1659, in which Lambert
                    was elected for Aidborough and Pomfret, and took his seat for the latter.</p>

                <p>He was one of an opposition characterized as “republicans,” amongst whom Were
                    Vane, Hazlerig, Ludlow, and Fairfax; a body small in number, but formidable from
                    their ability, activity, and union. The first important measure debated was the
                    bill of recognition for establishing Richard in his office, in which, though the
                    protectorists succeeded, Lambert’s party obtained a resolution, that, previous
                    to its commitment, “the house should declare such additional clauses to be part
                    of it, as should bind the power of the chief magistrate, and fully secure the
                    rights and privileges of parliament, and the liberties and rights of the
                    people.” The acknowledgment of the House of Lords as constituted by Oliver was
                    next debated, and warmly opposed by Lambert and his party, who, though unable to
                    succeed, in consequence of the union in this instance of the protector’s friends
                    with the concealed royalists, rendered the recognition much less full than had
                    been contended for by the court party. Meanwhile, Lambert, with Fleetwood and
                    other leaders of the army, had begun to meet at Fleetwood’s residence,
                    Wallingford House, where they held council how to subvert Richard, and to uphold
                    what they called “the good old cause.” A struggle ensued between the array and
                    the parliament now become Richard’s sole support. The Commons, on the 18th of
                    April, carried a resolution that there shall be no council of officers during
                    the sitting of parliament, without permission of the protector and of the
                    houses; and, on the 21st of that month, the command of the army was vested in
                    the three estates, to be exercised by the protector. This brought the struggle
                    to a crisis. Richard was peremptorily told by Desborough that the parliament
                    must be dissolved; and he accordingly dissolved it on the following day. From
                    this time Richard’s power had departed, and the country for a while was without
                    a government. The army was the predominant power, and Lambert was its real
                    leader; for Fleetwood, the nominal commander-in-chief, was too vacillating for
                    such emergencies. But the army leaders felt that it was dangerous to attempt to
                    govern without some semblance of civil administration; so the members of the
                    long parliament, excluded by Cromwell in 1653, were invited to assemble; and
                    this remnant, ridiculed under the name of “the Rump,” met as a parliament on the
                    7th of May. Order was for a while restored; but the royalists were encouraged,
                    by the state of the country, to make a bold effort for the restoration of
                    Charles; and Lambert’s military prowess was again required in August for the
                    suppression of a rising in Cheshire under the command of Sir George Booth.
                    Lambert obtained a complete and easy victory at Nantwich, in reward for which
                    service the parliament voted him L.1000. But the parliament feared Lambert’s
                    power and probable ambition, bis influence in the army, and the control of his
                    more powerful mind over the wavering Fleetwood; and, on a petition having been
                    presented from the army in his favour, the effect of which would have been to
                    give to Fleetwood the nominal command, and to Lambert the real power (as was
                    formerly the case under Fairfax and CromwelD, Hazlerig, suspecting Lambert to be
                    the instigator, rashly moved that he should be sent to the Tower. This motion,
                    and the votes hostile to the power of the army, produced a breach, which
                    Hazlcrig rashly made irreparable, by attempting to deprive Fleetwood, Lambert,
                    and other leaders of the army, of their commissions. Upon this, Lambert, with
                    Cromwell’s example before his eyes, dissolved the parliament by military force;
                    and the supreme authority again devolved on the military council at Wallingford
                    House. The people murmured at their sway; and Monk commenced his celebrated
                    march from Scotland, with the professed intention of restoring the power of the
                    parliament. Lambert, with a view to subdue or win this formidable opponent,
                    proceeded northward, at the head of 7000 men, having previously exacted a
                    promise from Fleetwood that he would not, without his concurrence, make any
                    terms with Charles II. or with Hazlerig. But when arrived at Newcastle, Lambert
                    allowed himself to be overreached by the subtlety of Monk, who amused him with
                    negotiations, of which the real object was delay, whilst Monk was strengthening
                    his force by recruiting in the north, and events were favouring his views in the
                    south. There the power of the military council was crumbling away in the absence
                    of Lambert, and under the feeble administration of Fleetwood, who resigned his
                    commission on the 26th of December. The ejected members resumed their authority;
                    and one of their first acts was to disband Lambert’s forces, and order him to
                    return to his own house. Desertion had thinned his ranks; to resist was useless;
                    he obeyed, and being thought too dangerous and powerful to remain at liberty,
                    was soon afterwards committed to the Tower. In April, when Monk had almost
                    withdrawn the mask, and appeared the restorer rather of monarchy than of that
                    “good old cause,” as it was termed, to which many had believed him friendly, the
                    republicans again turned their eyes towards Lambert. Apprized of their wishes,
                    he escaped from the Tower, and after lying hid a short time in the city, he
                    hastened into Warwickshire, where, on the 13th of April, he placed himself at
                    the head of six troops of horse and several companies of foot. He was opposed
                    near Daventry, on the 21st, by an equal force, under the command of Ingoldsby.
                    His soldiers refused to fight; and, without a blow being struck, Lambert, the
                    idol of the army, was compelled to surrender, and was again committed to
                    prison.</p>
                <p>After the restoration of Charles II. Lambert, though not a regicide, was excepted
                    out of the bill of indemnity. But the Lords and Commons of the convention
                    parliament concurred in a petition, that if he shall be attainted, execution as
                    to his life might be remitted; to which petition the king assented. The
                    succeeding parliament, less mercifully disposed, pressed urgently that he and
                    Vane should be brought to trial, which was accordingly done on the 4th of June
                    1662, when Lambert was arraigned in the Court of King’s Bench, for levying war
                    against the king. His demeanour was meek, and is represented by some as having
                    been deficient in manliness. But an absence of useless bravado is surely an
                    insufficient ground for attributing cowardice to one whose whole previous career
                    had incontestably proved his courage. Lambert was found guilty, and received
                    judgment of death; but his punishment was commuted to imprisonment for life in
                    the island of Guernsey. There he seems to have been mildly treated. It appears,
                    from the warrant-book in the State-paper office,· that in November 1662 a
                    warrant was issued to the governor of Guernsey for permitting Lambert to have
                    the liberty of the whole island. That this was afterwards withdrawn (though at
                    what time and for what reason is not known), may be inferred from another
                    warrant of March 12, 1664, directing that Lambert should have his <hi
                    rend="italic">former</hi> liberty. A letter, hitherto unpublished, is extant in
                    the Bodleian Library; it is from Lambert to the Chancellor Clarendon, dated 27th
                    April, and probably in the year 1664, from which it appears that he owed this
                    favourable treatment to the good offices of that minister. The following
                    extracts, whilst they declare this fact, also display the grateful and contented
                    spirit of the writer “Here, my Lorde, give me leave (seeing I believe it cannot
                    be unwelcome to you to know the happie effects of what yo <hi rend="superscript"

                    finde what is fit to aske then to obtaine.” Lambert remained in Guernsey till
                    his death, which occurred about thirty years afterwards. The favourite pursuits
                    of this tranquil remainder of his active life were botany and painting. It does
                    not appear that he devoted any part of it to literature, or left any record of
                    the great events in which he had been engaged.</p>
                <p>Lambert’s abilities as a military man were great. In this capacity he was second
                    only to Cromwell, and was, next to him, the idol of the army. As a politician he
                    was less eminent; and though greatly superior to the vacillating Fleetwood, he
                    wanted that union of caution and boldness which enabled Cromwell to surmount all
                    difficulties. That he failed to stem the tide of returning attachment to
                    monarchy is not imputable as a proof of deficiency in political skill, since it
                    may be questioned whether even Cromwell, had he lived, would have been able
                    ultimately to counteract it. A want of caution was the fault which made him at
                    length a victim to the subtlety of Monk. He appears to have been of a mild and
                    amiable disposition, and to have exhibited more of refinement and a courteous
                    bearing than was common amongst his associates. His ambition appears to have
                    been not of an inordinate and reckless kind, but mingled with traits of
                    generosity and disinterestedness. His career was unsullied with crimes against
                    humanity. In troubled times he long held the second place of power, and for a
                    short period the supreme authority, without being chargeable with any act which
                    reflects discredit on his moral character. Though the last and most formidable
                    opponent of the restoration, he seems to have been regarded by the royalists
                    with a degree of good will which was not extended to his inferior associates. He
                    was not one of those master-minds which seem to direct the course of events. He
                    belongs to that secondary class, who display ability in execution rather than in
                    direction. Amongst such, Lambert is entitled to a high place; and he may ever be
                    considered as a very able, and in some respects an estimable man.</p>

                    of great talent and originality, born on the 29th of August 1728, at Mülhausen,
                    in Upper Alsace, was the son of a French refugee in a very humble station, and
                    one of a numerous family.</p>
                <p>His early studies were only assisted by the instruction he obtained at a small
                    free school in his native town. His father, who was a tailor, could scarcely
                    even afford him leisure from mechanical labour. He was obliged to read and write
                    in the night; and, in order to procure candles, he made little drawings for
                    sale, while he was watching the cradle of his infant sisters. Having learned to
                    write a good hand, he obtained some employment as a copying clerk in the
                    chancery of the town, which he gave up when he was only fifteen, upon being
                    appointed book-keeper at some iron-works in the neighbourhood. At seventeen he
                    became secretary to a Doctor Iselin, who was the editor of a newspaper at Bale,
                    and who became his firm friend through life. He had now time to render himself
                    familiar with the works of Wolf, Locke, and Malcbranche, to which he was in a
                    great measure indebted for the correct logical method that he ever afterwards
                    followed in his researches; having, however, confirmed and improved it by the
                    study of the mathematics, to which he devoted himself with great zeal, and
                    which, after all, constitutes the best practical school of genuine logic.</p>
                <p>In 1748, he removed to Coire, having been recommended by Iselin, as private tutor
                    to the family of the president, Count Peter de Salis, whom he undertook to
                    instruct in history and religion, as well as in languages and science. The
                    library of his patron was extensive; he profited by it in all its departments;
                    and his residence at the house of an accomplished statesman, frequented as it
                    was by the best-informed persons of different countries, and with different
                    pursuits, could not but greatly contribute to the extension of his knowledge,
                    and the improvement of his taste. He even amused himself with some poetical
                    exercises in various languages, which must, at least, have been of advantage to
                    his style in prose. He felt the importance of his literary and scientific
                    pursuits to himself and to the world; and in 1752 he determined to keep a
                    journal of all his studies, which he continued throughout his life. He began to
                    publish a variety of fugitive pieces, on different subjects, in the newspapers
                    and in other periodical works of the day, some of which attracted the notice of
                    his learned countrymen; and, in 1754, he was made a member of the Physicomedical
                    Society, then lately established at Bale, to the Transactions of which he
                    contributed many interesting papers. In 1756 he went to Göttingen with two of
                    his pupils, and in 1757 to Utrecht. The next year the party returned to Coire,
                    by way of Paris, Marseilles, and Turin. At Paris he paid a visit to D’Alembert,
                    who does not appear at that time to have appreciated his merit very highly,
                    though he afterwards rendered him some services with the king of Prussia; but he
                    became more intimately acquainted with Messier the astronomer.</p>
                <p>In 1759 he quitted the family of the Count de Salis, and went to settle at
                    Augsburg, having a small salary as a member of the Electoral Academy of Bavaria.
                    From 1761 to 1763 he was again at Coire and in its neighbourhood, being employed
                    in fixing the boundaries between the country of the Grisons and the Milanese
                    territory. Towards the end of 1763, having had some disputes with the Bavarian
                    academicians, he went to Leipzig, and the next year to Berlin, where he was made
                    a member of the Royal Academy of Sciences, and where he continued to reside
                    during the remainder of his life, receiving many marks of favour from the
                    discriminating liberality of Frederic: thus, in the year 1770, he was made
                    superior counsellor of the board of works, with an additional salary. He
                    contributed a number <hi rend="italic">of</hi> valuable memoirs to the
                    collection of the academy; and in 1774 he undertook the direction of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Astronomical Almanac,</hi> for which he was admirably qualified.
                    He was also a constant writer in the journal published by Nicoai, under the
                    title of the <hi rend="italic">Universal German Library</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi> and he kept up a very extensive correspondence on various subjects of
                    literature and science.</p>
                <p>He was regularly in the habit of writing or reading from five in the morning till
                    twelve, and again from two till midnight; a degree of application unquestionably
                    far beyond that which would have been best calculated for producing the maximum
                    of valuable effect. Perhaps, if he was paid for writing by the ream, he may have
                    earned as much from the booksellers as he would have done by a more judicious
                    economy of his powers; but a nervous system, attenuated by the daily study of
                    seventeen hours, could never have been capable of being employed in any very
                    elevated flights of genius, or in the invention of any sublime or exquisite
                    novelties either in science or in literature; and it is only wonderful that he
                    did any thing so well, as almost to form an exception to this general remark. He
                    was indeed supposed to have injured his health by continued application, and he
                    died consumptive, on the 25th September 1777, at the age of forty-nine. He had
                    never been married. His person was of the middle size, with an interesting and
                    expressive countenance; he was <pb break="no" facs="nls:193201886"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0713-1886-0037"/>animated and lively in conversation, and liked
                    discussion, •but not disputation. He had no literary quarrels; and his
                    criticisms were not offensive, even when they ceased to be flattering. His
                    morals were strictly correct, but his manners were not altogether in unison with
                    those of the society to which his talents had elevated him. He is said to have
                    been timid, awkward, slovenly, and fond of low company; but upright, patient,
                    unostentatious, and compassionate; essentially modest, but as ready to assert
                    his . own merits as to admit his defects. He had a happy facility in managing
                    the instruments of computation, especially in the arrangement of converging
                    series; and he had a peculiar talent for expressing the results of observation
                    by an analytical formula, having first thrown them into the form of a
                    geometrical diagram to assist his invention; a process which he employed with
                    regard to the probabilities of life in London, and to the inequalities of
                    Jupiter and Saturn. In short, after Euler, Lagrange, D’Alembert, and Daniel
                    Bernoulli, there are few mathematicians and natural philosophers of any age who
                    can be put in competition with him, and still fewer who benefited the public by
                    so many diversified labours.</p>
                <p>It would be hopeless to attempt to pursue his indefatigable pen through all its
                    wanderings; and a complete catalogue of his works would be as useless as it is
                    unattainable. A man who wrote so incessantly must have written many things which
                    were destined to oblivion from their first production. It will be sufficient to
                    mention the most remarkable of his works, without any very strict regard to the
                    priority of their publication.</p>
                <p>1. In the <hi rend="italic">Acta Helvetica of the Society of Bale,</hi> ii. 1752,
                    we find an Essay on the Force and Measurement of Heat, a subject which the
                    author resumed in the latter part of his life. 2. A General Series, somewhat

                    Templehof, Berk 1773. This work does credit to the ingenuity and mathematical
                    abilities of the author, though its results may be obtained in a simpler manner
                    by some methods more recently invented.</p>
                <p>6. La Perspective Libre, Zurich, 1759, 8vo; another edition in German. The second
                    German edition, 2 vols. 8vo, Zurich, 1773, contains some additional matter,
                    especially a system of geometry, depending, as it is said, upon the ruler alone,
                    without any other instrument. Such a system must, however, have been extremely
                    limited in its application, much more so than Mascheroni’s <hi rend="italic"

                <p>7. Photometria, sive de Mensura et Gradibus Luminis Colorum et Umbrae, Augsb.
                    1760, 8vo. This original and interesting volume includes and supersedes the
                    greater part of Bouguer’s experimental determinations. It contains the important
                    discovery, that a luminous surface emits its light with equal intensity in all
                    directions; together with some improvements in the theory of twilight, and an
                    investigation of the comparative light of the sun and moon, and stars and
                    planets.</p>
                <p>8. Insigniores Orbitae Cometarum Proprietates, Augsb. 1761,8vo. We here find the
                    elegant theorem for expressing the relation of the area of a sector to the sides
                    of the triangle inscribed in it. This theorem had been demonstrated with respect
                    to the parabola by Euler in 1740; but Lambert first extended it to the other
                    conic sections, and he certainly re-invented the whole, without being aware of
                    what Euler had done. It may be found, together with a concise demonstration, and
                    a further account of this work, in the translation of Olber’s <hi rend="italic"

                    whole work is written in a popular style, and adapted to the taste of general
                    readers. The author’s favourite idea was to make the sun a sort of planet,
                    revolving round some other great body; and he supports the opinion by an
                    argument derived from the supposed insufficiency of the laws of gravity, as
                    relating to the solar system, for explaining some of the inequalities of the
                    motions of Jupiter and Saturn, which have, however, since been reduced to the
                    general analogy by Lagrange and Laplace.</p>

                    published an explanation of this scale, entitled Logarithmische Rechenstabe,

                    1761. A demonstration of the incommensurability of the circumference of a circle
                    to its diameter, which has been adopted by Legendre in his Geometry. It depends
                    on the method of reducing a fraction to its lowest terms, as laid down by
                    Euclid, and on the properties of continual fractions; an expression is obtained
                    for a tangent in terms of the arc from the quotient of the series for the sine
                    and cosine, and the continual fraction thus obtained is proved to be infinite.
                    It is also shown that the ratio of the arc to its tangent can never be expressed
                    by any finite quadratic surds. 13. On the Specific Gravity of Salt, and of its

                    and improve the Aristotelian method of syllogism, in which the author is allowed
                    to have displayed much ingenuity, though its success was greatly limited, on the
                    one hand, by the sober good sense of the empirical reasoners of the school of
                    Bacon and Locke, and, on the other, by the wild enthusiasm of the German
                    innovators, who were beginning to be intoxicated with the high-sounding phrases
                    and exaggerated pretensions of the disciples of Kant. A manuscript Latin
                    translation of the work, by Pfleiderer, was once in the possession of the late
                    Lord Stanhope.</p>

                    1763. The last part, which relates to magnitude, is the most approved; but the
                    whole work was never much read, being partly superseded by the more ostentatious
                    novelties of the day.</p>

                    even at that time general, was somewhat too hastily rejected by the author; but
                    his computations may still be of use in some cases. 55. On the Fluidity of Sand;
