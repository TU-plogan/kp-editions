                <p><label type="entry">LAW, <hi rend="smallcaps">John</hi></label>, commonly known
                    by the name of the Projector, was the eldest son of William Law, and was born at
                    Edinburgh in the month of April 1671. His father followed the profession of
                    goldsmith or banker, with so much success, that he was enabled to purchase the
                    lands of Lauriston and Randleston, which afterwards descended to his son. The
                    latter was educated at Edinburgh, where he is said to have made some progress in
                    literature; but the bent of his genius having led him to study arithmetic and
                    geometry, he attained such proficiency in these branches, as to be able to solve
                    with facility the most intricate problems; and he likewise made himself master
                    of algebra. The principles of public and private credit, the state of trade and
                    of manufactures, the theory and practice of taxation, and other matters
                    connected with political economy, also engaged his attention; and the accession
                    of knowledge resulting from these inquiries laid the foundation of his future
                    eminence. But he soon became noted as a man of pleasure as well as of study.
                    Having lost his father before he had completed his fourteenth year, he was thus
                    left at an early age without paternal control; and as the graces of a naturally
                    handsome person were improved by the acquisition of external accomplishments,
                    Jessamy John, or Beau Law, as he was indifferently called by his companions,
                    addicted himself to the practice of all games of chance, skill, and dexterity,
                    and appears to have engaged in other pursuits of a still more questionable
                    character. In 1694, he visited London, where his wit and accomplishments
                    procured him admission into the first circles, whilst his extravagance speedily
                    involved him in difficulties. At this time he was noted for his propensity to
                    deep play, and for his gallantries amongst women. By the former, he injured his
                    fortune; in consequence of the latter, he narrowly escaped an ignominious end.
                    An intrigue which he had with a Mrs Lawrence proved the occasion of a quarrel
                    between him and one Mr Edward Wilson; a hostile meeting ensued, and Mr Law
                    killed his antagonist on the spot. He was immediately apprehended, and brought
                    to trial at the Old Bailey, on a charge of murder; and being found guilty,
                    received sentence of death. Upon a representation of the case to the crown,
                    however, Law obtained a pardon; but an appeal being lodged by a brother of the
                    deceased, he was detained in the King’s Bench prison. This appeal was brought
                    before the court of King’s Bench in Trinity-term 1694; and as the exceptions
                    taken on the part of Law were overruled by the court, the latter, judging it
                    prudent not to await the result, found means to escape from prison,<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>In the London Gazette of
                    Monday, 7th January 1G95, a reward o'f fifty pounds was offered for the
                    apprehension of “<hi rend="italic">Captain</hi> John Law, a Scotchman, lately a
                    prisoner in the King’s Bench for murther,” who is described as “a very tall,
                    black, lean man, well shaped, above six foot high, large pock-holes in his face,
                    big high nosed, speaks broad and loud.” This description, which conveys no very
                    favourable idea of Law’s personal appearance, and differs from his real
                    portrait, is supposed by Mr Wood to have been drawn up with a view to facilitate
                    his escape. The prefix of “Captain,” which is otherwise a good travelling title,
                    may also, perhaps, be explained on the same hypothesis.</p></note> and retired
                    to the Continent.</p>
                <p>During his stay abroad, he acted for some time as secretary to the British
                    resident in Holland, and occupied himself in improving his knowledge of
                    financial operations, and particularly in making himself acquainted with the
                    constitution and practical operation of the bank of Amsterdam. He returned to
                    his native country in 1700, and in that year appears to have written his <hi
                    rend="italic">Proposals and Reasons for Establishing α Council of Trade,</hi>
                    which was published at Edinburgh early in 1701. His project met with no
                    encouragement; but the publication had the effect of making him known to some of
                    the principal personages of the country, including the Duke of Argyll, his sons
                    the Marquis of Lorn and Lord Archibald Campbell, the Marquis of Tweeddale, and
                    other persons of distinction. Relying upon the support of these noblemen, he
                    offered to the Scottish parliament, in 1705, a plan for removing the
                    difficulties under which the kingdom then laboured from the scarcity of specie,
                    and the stoppage of payments by the bank; and, with a view to further his
                    object, he published another work, entitled <hi rend="italic">Money and Trade
                    considered, with a Proposal for Supplying the Nation with Money,</hi> which
                    appeared at Edinburgh the same year. His “proposal” was, that commissioners, to
                    be appointed by an act, under the control of parliament, should be empowered to
                    issue notes, either in the way of loan, at ordinary interest, upon landed
                    security, the debt, however, not to exceed half, or at the most two thirds, of
                    the value of the land; or upon landpledges, redeemable within a certain period,
                    to the full <pb break="no" facs="nls:193203329" xml:id="kp-eb0713-3329-0148"
                    />value of the land; or, lastly, upon sale irredeemably to the amount of the
                    price agreed upon. Paper-money, thus issued and secured, would, he conceived, be
                    equal in value to gold and silver money of the same denomination, and might even
                    be preferred to these metals, as not being, like them, liable to fall in value.
                    But this scheme, though supported by the united weight of the court party, and
                    of that called the <hi rend="italic">squadrone,</hi> headed by the Duke of
                    Argyll and the Marquis of Tweeddale, was rejected by the parliament, which
                    resolved, “that to establish any kind of paper credit, so as to oblige it to
                    pass, was an improper expedient for the nation.” The rejection of the plan was
                    occasioned by an apprehension, that if it were adopted, all the estates of the
                    kingdom would thereby be brought to a complete dependence upon the
                    government.</p>
                <p>Mr Law now resolved to abandon his native country, and to try his fortune abroad.
                    He resided some time at Brussels, where he became noted for extraordinary
                    success at play; and in two excursions which he made to Paris, his good fortune
                    at the gaming-table became still more conspicuous. Having visited the principal
                    cities of Italy, he continued the same career, playing at all sorts of games,
                    and betting and speculating in the public funds and banks, with uninterrupted
                    success; insomuch that, in theyear 1714, he was worth upwards of L.l 10,000
                    sterling. During these rambles, Law, having the advantage of a graceful figure
                    and an insinuating address, was everywhere well received by persons of the
                    highest quality. At Florence he became acquainted with the Duke de Vendôme, whom
                    he had the honour to oblige with the loan of a considerable sum of money. At
                    Neufchâtel he obtained access to the Prince of Conti, to whom he imparted some
                    of his financial projects. During a short residence at Turin, he communicated to
                    Victor Amadeus, king of Sardinia, a scheme for aggrandising his territories, of
                    the same nature as that which he afterwards proposed to the Duke of Orleans; but
                    the prudent monarch declined embarking in so perilous an adventure, observing to
                    the projector, that his dominions were too small for the execution of so great a
                    design, and that France was the proper theatre for such speculations. “If I know
                    the disposition of the people of that country,” added Victor Amadeus, “I am sure
                    they will relish your schemes; and therefore I would advise you to go thither
                    without delay.”</p>
                <p>Law took the advice which was thus given him, and re-, turned to Paris, where he
                    arrived in 1714, not long before the death of Louis XIV. He was more favourably
                    received than on the occasions of his former visits, when he appears to have
                    been regarded as a mere adventurer; and soon gained the confidence of the Duke
                    of Orleans to such a degree, that he was not only admitted to the convivial
                    parties of the regent, but even nominated one of his counsellors of state. At
                    this time the French finances were in the greatest disorder, indeed in a
                    situation accounted desperate; the nation was burthened with an immense load of
                    debt, contracted during the expensive wars of Louis XIV.; and the people groaned
                    under the intolerable pressure of the taxes which had been imposed for payment
                    of the interest. All industry was thus checked, and trade in a manner
                    annihilated; manufactures, commerce, and navigation, had almost ceased; the
                    merchant and the trader were reduced to beggary, and the artificer was
                    compelled, for want of employment, to leave the kingdom. In a word, the state of
                    affairs was such, that it had been debated in council, and actually proposed to
                    apply a spunge to the debt, and to seek relief by means of a national
                    bankruptcy. The proposal, however, was rejected by the regent, and a commission
                    appointed to inquire into the claims of the state creditors, and endeavour to
                    introduce some degree of order into the public finances. At this calamitous
                    crisis, when the surplus of the public revenue, after payment of the interest of
                    the debt, was found insufficient to defray the necessary expenses of the civil
                    government, Law came forward with his favourite nostrum or panacea, and proposed
                    to liquidate the debt, by establishing a bank for issuing notes secured upon
                    landed property, and on the unalienable impledgement of all the royal revenues.
                    The project seems to have been approved of, but as the conjuncture was thought
                    unfavourable for risking so bold an experiment, his application proved
                    ineffectual. Nothing discouraged, Law requested and obtained permission to
                    establish a private bank, to consist entirely of funds advanced by himself, and
                    others who chose to embark in the undertaking. The letters-patent, which are
                    dated the 2d and 20th of May 1716, specify the principles upon which the bank
                    had been established, as well as the regulations according to which it was to be
                    conducted. The scheme promised success, and, in fact, the General Bank of Law
                    and Company had acquired great credit, when, in December 1718, it was dissolved
                    by an arrêt of the regent, who, observing the advantages resulting from the
                    establishment, resolved to take it into the hands of government; a resolution
                    which could not be very agreeable to the founder and his associates in the
                    enterprise. Law, however, was named director-general of the Royal Bank, in which
                    his own had merged; and branches were established at Lyons, Rochelle, Tours,
                    Orleans, and Amiens.</p>
                <p>Law now began to develope the stupendous project he had long meditated, and which
                    afterwards became so well known to all Europe, under the name of the Mississippi
                    System. This scheme was nothing less than the vesting of the whole privileges,
                    effects, and possessions of all the foreign trading companies, the great farms,
                    the mint, the general receipt of the king’s revenues, and the management and
                    property of the bank, in one great company, who, having thus in their hands all
                    the trade, taxes, and royal revenues, might be enabled to multiply the notes of
                    the bank to any extent they pleased, doubling or even tripling at will the
                    circulating medium of the kingdom, and, by the immensity of their funds,
                    possessed of a power to carry the foreign trade and the improvement of the
                    colonies to a height altogether unattainable by other means. This monstrous and
                    impracticable monopoly was approved of by the regent, and by letters-patent a
                    commercial company was established, under the name of the Company of the West;
                    to which was at the same time granted the whole province of Louisiana, a country
                    watered throughout its whole extent by the Mississippi, from which the project
                    accordingly took its name. The scheme was well calculated to entrap the unwary
                    and to seduce the speculative. Of this company 200,000 actions or shares were
                    issued, at 500 livres each, and the subscriptions were made payable in a
                    depreciated paper-currency, called <hi rend="italic">billets d’etat,</hi> which,
                    however, in the subscriptions, was taken at its full value. This could not fail
                    to operate as a tempting bait to the holders of these billets or notes to lay
                    them out in the purchase of shares, especially since the depreciation amounted
                    to between sixty and seventy per cent. The company thus became creditors of the
                    king to the extent of a hundred millions of livres, the interest of which sum
                    was fixed at the rate of four per cent.</p>
                <p>Law, who had now advanced high in the regent’s favour, was of course named
                    director-general of the Company of the West, and thus intrusted with the
                    development of his own stupendous project. Louisiana having been represented as
                    a region abounding in gold and silver, and possessing a fertile soil capable of
                    the highest cultivation, the actions or shares were bought up with the greatest
                    avidity; and such was the rage for speculation, that the unimproved parts of the
                    colony were actually sold for 30,000 livres the square league. In pursuance of
                    the scheme, the farm of tobacco was made over to the company at an advance of
                    rent exceeding two millions of livres. Soon afterwards <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193203342" xml:id="kp-eb0713-3342-0149"/>they acquired the charter and
                    effects of the Senegal Company; and this was succeeded by a still more important
                    acquisition, namely, the exclusive privilege of trading to the East Indies,
                    China, and the South Seas, together with all the possessions and effects of the
                    China and India companies, now dissolved, upon the condition of liquidating all
                    just claims against them. Upon this occasion, the Company of the West assumed
                    the title of Company of the Indies; and 50,000 new shares were ordered to be
                    constituted, at 550 livres each, payable in coin. The price of actions quickly
                    rose to 1000 livres each. On the 25th of July 1719, the mint was made over to
                    this company for a consideration of fifty millions of livres, to be paid to the
                    king within fifteen months; on the 27th of August following, the regent took out
                    of the hands of the farmers-gen er al, and made over to them, the great farms,
                    for which they agreed to pay an advance of rent of three millions and a half of
                    livres; and, on the 31st of the same month, they also obtained the general
                    receipt or collection of the other branches of the king’s revenue. Having
                    acquired all these grants, and thus concentrated in themselves not only the
                    whole foreign trade and possessions of France, but also the collection and
                    management of the royal revenues, they promised an annual dividend of 200 livres
                    on every share; the price of actions instantly rose in the market to 5000
                    livres; and the public ran with such eagerness upon the last creation of stock,
                    that nearly double the requisite sum was subscribed, whilst the greatest
                    interest was exerted, and every stratagem put in practice, to secure places in
                    that subscription. The frenzy now became general. A rage for the acquisition of
                    shares in the India Company seized and infatuated all ranks in the kingdom.
                    Clergy and laity, peers and plebeians, princes and peasants, statesmen and
                    magistrates, nay, even ladies, all, in short, who either had or could procure
                    money for the purpose, turned stockjobbers, outbidding each other with such
                    avidity, that in November 1719, the price of shares rose to above 10,000 livres,
                    or (when the depreciation of the <hi rend="italic">billets cľ</hi><hi

                    they originally sold for. Nothing was talked of but actions; every place eehoed
                    with Mississippi and Quinquempoix.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    Mechanics laid aside their work, tradesmen forsook their shops, and persons of
                    all grades neglected their professions or employments, to embark in this new
                    occupation; whilst even the few who observed some degree of moderation, showed
                    by their conduct how little concern they took in affairs foreign to the
                    Mississippi scheme.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The
                    unexampled rise in the price of actions enabled obscure and humble individuals
                    to acquire at once princely fortunes; and many amusing anecdotes are told of
                    persons thus suddenly raised to affluence. A footman having realised a large
                    sum, provided himself with a carriage; but the first day it drew up at his door,
                    obeying the instinctive habit of his calling, he, instead of stepping into the
                    vehicle, mounted up to his old station behind it. Another of the same
                    fraternity, who had obeyed the like familiar impulse, endeavoured adroitly to
                    cover his mistake by pretending that he got up merely to see if there was room
                    at the back for two or three more lacqueys, whom be was resolved to hire
                    instantly. Law’s coachman had made so great a fortune that he asked a dismission
                    from the service of his master, which was granted, on condition of his procuring
                    another as good as himself. Cook-maids and waiting-women appeared at the opera
                    bedizzened with jewels and finery; many who had not a dozen livres in the world
                    suddenly “tumbled from a garret into a carriage and the son of a baker at
                    Toulouse, being desirous of having a superb service of plate, purchased the
                    contents of a goldsmith’s shop for 40&lt;),000 livres, and sent them home to his
                    wife, with orders to set them out properly for supper. In a word, property
                    underwent a new and most grotesque distribution.</p></note> The delirium had
                    reached its culminating point.</p>
                <p>Mr Law now blazed a meteor of unequalled splendour. He possessed the ear of the
                    Duke of Orleans; he was almost adored by the people, ever ready to worship at
                    the shrine of the idol of the hour; and he was surrounded by princes, dukes,
                    peers, marshals, and prelates, who all courted his friendship, and even seemed
                    ambitious of bis patronage. Nobles were content to wait in his antechambers,
                    like the meanest subjects; and ladies of the highest quality employed every
                    artifice, sometimes at the risk of their necks, to attract his passing
                    notice.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The regent’s
                    mother asserts, in one of her letters, that “si Laws le vouloit, les femmes

                    which shows that all ideas of delicacy, or even decency, were absorbed by the
                    cupidity and avarice which had taken possession of the public mind.</p></note>
                    The property which he acquired was immense. He purchased no less than fourteen
                    estates with titles annexed to them, and amongst these the marquisate of Rosny,
                    which had belonged to the illustrious Sully, the friend and minister of Henry
                    IV. About this period, too, a free pardon for the murder of Mr Wilson was
                    conveyed to him from England; and Edinburgh, proud of having produced so great a
                    personage, transmitted to him the freedom of the city in a gold box. By his
                    abjuration of the Protestant religion, the only obstacle which stood in the way
                    of bis advancement to the highest offices in the state was soon afterwards
                    removed; and, on the oth of January 1720, he was appointed comptroller-general
                    of the finances. A few days previous to this, the Aeademy of Sciences had
                    elected him one of its honorary members; and the flattering incense of poetry
                    was offered up at the same shrine with the homage of an infatuated people. Thus
                    the astonished world beheld an obscure foreigner, of doubtful reputation and
                    questionable character, rise in a few months from a private condition to the
                    high station of prime minister of France, and govern for a time, with almost
                    absolute power, one of the greatest and most enlightened nations of Europe. It
                    might well be said of him, <hi rend="italic">Tollitur</hi><hi rend="italic"

                <p>But after having raised himself to such an unexampled eminence, Law at length
                    fell a sacrifiée to the intrigues of the other ministers, who, partly from envy,
                    and partly from apprehension, combined with ignorance, undermined the insecure
                    fabric he had reared, and thus precipitated its fall. The credit of the bank and
                    of the India Company had attained its height in November 1719, when shares of
                    the latter sold for more than 10,000 livres each, and money was so abundant in
                    the former that the directors agreed to lend any sum upon proper security at two
                    per cent. But amidst the general delirium, there were symptoms which evidently
                    betokened an approaching revulsion. The most alarming of these was a constant
                    drain of specie from the bank, either for the purpose of being hoarded or sent
                    abroad. Astonished at their exorbitant gains, the original proprietors of the
                    company thought only of converting their shares into gold, and realizing the
                    fortunes which they had so suddenly acquired; and it was computed that not less
                    than 500 millions of livres, the property of persons of this description, had
                    been sent out of France. To avert the danger which thus threatened the system,
                    several edicts were issued early in 1720, by which payments in specie were
                    restricted to small sums, and the standard of the coin was kept in continual
                    fluctuation, whilst bank-notes were declared to remain invariable, and rents,
                    taxes, and customs, were made payable in notes. But what crowned all, was the
                    edict of the 27th February 1720, prohibiting individuals, as well as secular or
                    religious communities, from having in their possession more than 500 livres in
                    specie, under the penalty of a <pb break="no" facs="nls:193203355"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0713-3355-0150"/>fine, and confiscation of all sums found exceeding
                    that amount; a measure which could scarcely fail to sow distrust in the bosom of
                    families, and to excite alarm in the public mind. Still the delusion prevailed.
                    On the 23d of February, a few days before the publication of this edict, the
                    Royal Bank had been incorporated with the company, and the king not only
                    remained guarantee of the banknotes, but gave up to the company all the profits
                    made by the bank since December 1718, when the government had taken it into its
                    own hands. Meanwhile, the manufacture of notes proceeded with so much activity,
                    that, by the 1st of May 1720, paper-money had been fabricated to the amount of
                    more than 2600 millions of livres, or nearly L.l 10,000,000 sterling; whilst the
                    specie in the kingdom was estimated at only 1300 millions of livres, or about
                    L.52,000,000 sterling. In this state of matters, Cardinal Dubois and M.
                    d’Argenson represented to the regent that it had become necessary to equalize
                    the proportion between the notes and the coin, either by reducing the value of
                    the one to the extent of a half, or by doubling that of the other.</p>
                <p>This extraordinary point was debated in council, where it was opposed by some of
                    the members, amongst whom was the comptroller-general, who strenuously contended
                    for letting matters remain as they were; but the majority being in favour of the
                    proposition for lowering the value of the paper, it was decided accordingly;
                    and, on the 21st of May 1720, an edict was issued, which, contrary to all sound
                    policy, and even to the most solemn stipulations, reduced the value of the
                    company’s bank-notes one half, and fixed their actions or shares at 5000 livres.
                    By this unjustifiable and fatal step, the whole paper fabric was destroyed in an
                    instant, the notes lost all credit, and next day a man might have starved with
                    100 millions of paper money in his pocket. The consternation with which all
                    ranks were seized was soon converted into rage, and it became necessary to
                    station troops in different parts of the capital, to prevent the consequences to
                    be apprehended from the fury and despair of the populace. Disorder and confusion
                    reigned everywhere; seditious and inflammatory libels were posted up and
                    distributed; and the life of the regent himself was threatened.<note

                    Some conception may be formed of the distress of the people, when it is
                    considered that at the time when the bank thus stopped payment, and the value of
                    paper money instantly sunk to zero, not less than 2,235,085,590 livres, or
                    upwards of L.90,000,000 sterling in notes, were in circulation. Law was of
                    course peculiarly obnoxious to popular odium, which he endeavoured in vain to
                    allay by resigning into the hands of the regent his office of
                    comptroller-general, on the 29th of May; but, though several times exposed to
                    imminent danger, from the vengeance both of the parliament and the people, he
                    remained in France until towards the close of the year 1720, when he withdrew to
                    Brussels; and soon afterwards his whole property was confiscated, and his
                    brother William sent to the Bastile.</p>
                <p>Law arrived at Brussels on the 22d of December 1720, and, after waiting there for
                    some time, in the vain expectation of being recalled to France, set out for
                    Venice, which he reached early in January 1721; he then visited other places on
                    the Continent, and, in October, arrived in England, for the ostensible purpose
                    of pleading the king’s pardon. He was at first well received, and visited by
                    persons of distinction; but when it was discovered that the fallen financier was
                    in a state almost bordering upon destitution, his friends began to fall off,
                    and, of those who had known or perhaps courted him in his day of power, he could
                    find none good-natured enough to lend him a thousand pounds. In a letter
                    addressed to Mrs Howard, afterwards Countess of Suffolk, he calls that lady his
                    “only friend an avowal which affords a striking instance of the instability of
                    fortune, power, and friendship. After residing some years in England, this
                    extraordinary man returned once more to the Continent, and closed his chequered
                    career at Venice, where, on the 21st of March 1729, he died in a state but
                    little removed from indigence, in the fifty-eighth year of his age. Soon after
                    his death appeared the following epitaph, the point of which reminds us of the
                    bitter jests which appeared upon the occasion of his fall</p>

                <p>We do not think that any great difference of opinion can now be entertained
                    respecting the real character of Law’s project; and indeed it seems to be
                    generally agreed that, even if it had not been violently interrupted by the
                    edict of the regent, it was too insecure in its principles to have proved
                    permanent. The favourite maxim inculcated by Law, and upon which his whole
                    fabric of the Mississippi system was reared; namely, that the power and
                    prosperity of a nation increase in proportion to the quantity of money
                    circulating therein, and that, as the richest nations have not specie sufficient
                    to afford full employment to their inhabitants, this defect may be supplied by
                    paper credit; involves a dangerous fallacy, even in the most restricted view
                    that can be taken of its application, inasmuch as it implies that paper money
                    may be issued with advantage to an almost unlimited extent, upon general
                    security; and that its credit, or, in other words, its value, may thus be
                    maintained without its being rendered convertible at pleasure into cash. But all
                    experience has proved that this is absolutely impossible. When paper is in
                    excess, in comparison with the total amount of gold and silver currency, it
                    necessarily becomes depreciated; the prices of commodities experience a
                    corresponding rise; the nominal value of the precious metals is increased in
                    proportion to the amount of the depreciation, of which this increase is the only
                    measure, and they disappear from circulation. All existing contracts and
                    obligations are disturbed; debtors benefited at the expense of creditors; a
                    spirit of reckless speculation and adventure is thus engendered; and, after a
                    time, the crisis of revulsion and ruin arrives. Whenever the quantity of money
                    in circulation is too great in propor-tlon<pb break="no" facs="nls:193203368"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0713-3368-0151"/> to the total amount of commodities to be
                    circulated by it, depreciation is the necessary consequence, or, in other words,
                    a proportional rise in the price of commodities. Money has no creative power, as
                    Law seems all along to have imagined, and can never be in excess without
                    endangering “the power and prosperity” of the nation where this is the case. His
                    whole system, therefore, was built upon a sandy foundation, and, even if it had
                    received no rude or sudden shock, would have fallen to pieces from its own
                    insecurity and instability. At the same time, there is much truth in an
                    observation of Mr Burke, in his <hi rend="italic">Reflections on the French
                    Revolution,</hi> “It is not true,” says he, “that Law built solely on a
                    speculation concerning the Mississippi; he added the East India trade, he added
                    the African trade, he added the farms of all the farmed revenue of France; all
                    these unquestionably could not support the structure which the public
                    enthusiasm, not he, chose to build on these bases.” He laid the best foundation
                    that he could, perhaps the best which, in the circumstances, it was possible to
                    lay; but the nation went suddenly mad, an event which he could scarcely have
                    foreseen; the company was hurried onwards by the general frenzy; and when the
                    delirium had reached its height, the regent was advised to issue the fatal
                    edict, which levelled the whole fabric with the dust.</p>

                    >Law,</hi><hi rend="italic">Edmund,</hi> bishop of Carlisle, was born in the
                    parish of Cartmel, in Lancashire, in the year 1703. His father, who was a
                    clergyman, held a small chapel in that neighbourhood; but the family had been
                    situated at Askham, in the county of Westmoreland. He was educated for some time
                    at Cartmel school, and afterwards at the free grammar-school of Kendal, from
                    which he went, well instructed in the learning of grammar-schools, to St John’s
                    College in Cambridge.</p>
                <p>Soon after taking his first degree, he was elected fellow of Christ College in
                    that university. During his residence in this college, he became known to the
                    public by a translation of Archbishop King’s <hi rend="italic">Essay on the
                    Origin of Evil,</hi> with copious notes; in which many metaphysical subjects,
                    curious and interesting in their Own nature, are treated of with ingenuity,
                    learning, and novelty. To this work was prefixed, under the name of a
                    preliminary dissertation, a very valuable piece, written by the Reverend Mr Gay
                    of Sidney College. He also, whilst at Christ College, undertook and went through
                    a laborious task, in preparing for the press an edition of Stephens’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Thesaurus.</hi> His acquaintance, during this his first residence
                    in the university, was principally with Dr Waterland, the learned master of
                    Magdalen College; Dr Jortin, a name known to every scholar; and Dr Taylor, the
                    editor of the <hi rend="italic">Demosthenes.</hi></p>
                <p>In the year 1737 he was presented by the university to the living of Graystock in
                    the county of Cumberland, a rectory of about L.300 a year. The advowson of this
                    benefice belonged to the family of the Howards of Graystock, but devolved to the
                    university, for this turn, by virtue of an act of parliament, which transferred
                    to these two bodies the nomination to such benefices as appertained, at the time
                    of the vacancy, to the patronage of a Roman Catholic. The right, however, of the
                    university was contested; and it was not until after a law-suit of two years’
                    continuance that Mr Law was settled in his living. Soon after this, he married a
                    daughter of Mr John Christian of Unerigg, in the county of Cumberland.</p>
                <p>In 1743, he was promoted by Sir George Fleming, bishop of Carlisle, to the
                    archdeaconry of that diocese; and in 1746 he went from Graystock to reside at
                    Salkeld, a pleasant village upon the banks of the river Eden, the rectory of
                    which is annexed to the archdeaconry. Mr Law was not one of those who lose and
                    forget themselves in the country. During his residence at Salkeld, he published
                    Considerations on the Theory of Religion; to which were subjoined, Reflections
                    on the Life and Character of Christ, and an appendix concerning the use of the
                    words Soul and Spirit in Holy Scripture, and the state of the Dead there
                    described.</p>
                <p>At this time Dr Keene held, with the bishopric of Chester, the mastership of
                    Peterhouse in Cambridge. Desiring to leave the university, he caused Dr Law to
                    be elected to succeed him in that station. This took place in the year 1756, in
                    which Dr Law resigned his archdeaconry in favour of Mr Eyre, a brother-in-law of
                    Dr Keene. Two years before this, he had taken his degree of doctor of divinity,
                    in his public exercise for which, he defended the doctrine of what is usually
                    called the “sleep of the soul.”</p>
                <p>About the year 1760, he was appointed principal librarian of the university; a
                    situation which, as it procured him an easy access to books, was peculiarly
                    agreeable to his taste and habits. Some time after this, he was also appointed
                    casuistical professor. In the year 1762, he suffered an irreparable loss by the
                    death of his lady. Some years afterwards, he received several preferments, which
                    were rather honourable expressions of regard from his friends, than of much
                    advantage to his fortune.</p>
                <p>Dr Cornwallis, then bishop of Litchfield, afterwards archbishop of Canterbury,
                    who had been his pupil at Christ College, appointed him to the archdeaconry of
                    Staffordshire, and to a prebend in the church of Litchfield. Dr Green, bishop of
                    Lincoln, his old acquaintance, made him a prebendary of that church. In the year
                    1767, he obtained a stall in the cathedral church of Durham, by the intervention
                    of the Duke of Newcastle, to whose interest, in the memorable contest for the
                    high stewardship of the university, he had adhered, in opposition to some strong
                    temptations. The year after this, the Duke of Grafton, who had a short time
                    before been elected chancellor of the university, recommended the master of
                    Peterhouse to his majesty for the bishopric of Carlisle. This recommendation was
                    made not only without solicitation on his part or on that of his friends, but
                    without his knowledge, until the duke’s intention in his favour was signified to
                    him by the archbishop.</p>
                <p>About the year 1777, Bishop Law gave to the public a handsome edition, in three
                    volumes quarto, of the works of Mr Locke, with a Life of the Author, and a
                    Preface. Mr Locke’s writings and character he held in the highest esteem, and
                    seems to have drawn from them many of his own principles. He was a disciple of
                    that school. About the same time he published a tract, which attracted some
                    attention, on the controversy concerning subscription; and he published new
                    editions of his two principal works, with considerable additions, and some
                    alterations.</p>
                <p>Dr Law held the sec of Carlisle for nearly nineteen years, during which time he
                    twice only omitted spending the summer months in his diocese at the bishop’s
                    residence at Rose Castle; a situation with which he was much pleased, not only
                    on account of the natural beauty of the place, but because it restored him to
                    the country in which he had spent the best part of his life. In the year 1787,
                    he paid this visit in a state of great weakness and exhaustion, and died at Rose
                    Castle about a month after his arrival there, on the 14th of August, being then
                    in the eighty-fourth year of his age.</p>
                <p>The life of the Bishop of Carlisle was a life of incessant reading and thought,
                    almost entirely directed to metaphysical and religious inquiries. Besides the
                    works already mentioned, he published, in 1734 or 1735, a very ingenious Inquiry
                    into the Ideas of Space and Time, in which he <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193203381" xml:id="kp-eb0713-3381-0152"/>combats the opinions of Dr
                    Clarke and his adherents on these subjects; but the tenet by which his name and
                    writings are principally distinguished is, “that Jesus Christ, at his second
                    coming, will, by an act of his power, restore to life and consciousness the dead
                    of the human species, who, by their own nature, and without this interposition,
                    would remain in the state of insensibility to which the death brought upon
                    mankind by the sin of Adam had reduced them.” He interpreted literally that
                    saying of St Paul ( 1 Cor. XV. 21), “As by man came death, by man came also the
                    resurrection of the dead.” This opinion had no other effect upon his own mind
                    than to increase his reverence for Christianity, and for its divine founder. He
                    retained it, as he did his other speculative opinions, without laying, as many
                    are wont to do, an extravagant stress upon their importance, and without
                    pretending to more certainty than the subject admitted of. No man formed his own
                    conclusions with more freedom, or treated those of others with greater candour
                    and equity. He never quarrelled with any person for differing from him, or
                    considered that difference as a sufficient reason for questioning any man’s
                    sincerity, or judging meanly of his understanding. He was zealously attached to
                    religious liberty, because he thought that it leads to truth; yet from his heart
                    he loved peace. There was nothing in his elevation to his bishopric which he
                    spoke of with more pleasure, than its being a proof that decent freedom of
                    inquiry was not discouraged.</p>
                <p>He was a man of great softness of manners, and of the mildest and most tranquil
                    disposition. His voice was never raised above its ordinary pitch. His
                    countenance seemed never to have been ruffled; it preserved the same kind and
                    composed aspect, truly indicating the calmness and benignity of his temper. He
                    had an utter dislike of large and promiscuous companies. Next to his books, his
                    chief satisfaction was in the serious conversation of a literary companion, or
                    in the company of a few friends. In this sort of society he opened his mind
                    without reserve, and with a peculiar turn and sprightliness of expression. His
                    person was low, but well formed ,∙ and his complexion fair and delicate. Except
                    occasional interruptions by the gout, he had for the greater part of his life
                    enjoyed good health; and, when not confined by that distemper, he was full of
                    motion and activity. About nine years before his death, he was greatly enfeebled
                    by a severe attack of the gout in his stomach, and, a short time afterwards,
                    lost the use of one of his legs. Notwithstanding his fondness of exercise, he
                    resigned himself to this change, not only without complaint, but without any
                    sensible diminution of his cheerfulness and good humour. His fault was the
                    general fault of retired and studious characters, too great a degree of inaction
                    and facility in his public station. The modesty, or rather bashfulness, of his
                    nature, together with an extreme unwillingness to give pain, rendered him
                    sometimes less firm and efficient in the administration of authority than was
                    requisite. But this is the condition of human frailty. There is an opposition
                    between some virtues which seldom permits them to subsist together in
                    perfection.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Law,</hi><hi rend="italic">William,</hi> the author of many
                    pious works, some of which obtained great popularity, was born at King’s·;
                    cliffe, Northamptonshire, in the year 1686. Having completed his school
                    education, he entered Emmanuel College, Cambridge, in 1705; commenced bachelor
                    in 1708; was elected a fellow of his college in 1711; and took his degree of
                    master of arts in 1712. Soon after the accession of George I. being called upon
                    to take the oaths, and sign the declaration prescribed by act of parliament, he
                    refused, and in consequence vacated his fellowship in 1716, after which he was
                    considered as a nonjuror. It appears that he had for some time officiated as a
                    curate in London, but had obtained no ecclesiastical preferment. Soon after his
                    resignation of his fellowship, he went to reside at Putney, as tutor to Edward
                    Gibbon, father of the historian of the same name; but how long he remained in
                    this situation has not been ascertained. In 1727, he founded at Cliffe an
                    alms-house for the reception of two old helpless women, and a school for the
                    instruction and clothing of fourteen girls. The money which he thus applied was,
                    it seems, the gift of an unknown benefactor. Whilst standing at the door of a
                    shop in London, he was accosted by a person he had never seen before, who,
                    having inquired his name, as well as whether he was of King’s-cliffe, and
                    received a satisfactory answer on both points, put into his hands a sealed
                    paper, containing a bank note for a thousand pounds. There is no evidence that
                    this money was given him in trust for purposes of charity, and he is therefore
                    fully entitled to the merit of having appropriated it for the benefit of the
                    poor. It appears that, some time before 1740, he was instrumental in bringing
                    about an intimacy between Mrs Hester Gibbon, the sister of his pupil, and Mrs
                    Elizabeth Hutcheson, the widow of a gentleman of the Middle Temple. This
                    circumstance, trifling as it may seem, decided the direction and character of
                    his future life. These ladies, being of congenial sentiments, formed a plan of
                    living together in the country, secluded from the world, and of’ assuming Mr Law
                    as their chaplain, instructor, and almoner. With this view, they ultimately
                    settled at King’s-cliffe, in a house prepared for their reception by Mr Law, and
                    which formed the only property that had been devised to him by his father. Here
                    their whole income, after deducting necessary expenses, was employed in acts of
                    beneficence to the needy and the afflicted, or in donations of larger amount to
                    persons of a somewhat higher grade who had known better days, but whom
                    misfortune had reduced to poverty. In this situation Law remained twenty years,
                    and died on the 9th of April 1761, in the seventy-fifth year of his age.</p>
                <p>Gibbon, in his <hi rend="italic">Miscellaneous Works,</hi> has drawn the
                    character of Law in the happiest manner, and for once commended a man of piety,
                    not only without irony, but even with a feeling approaching to affection. “In
                    our family,” says the historian, “he left the reputation of a worthy and pious
                    man, who believed all that he professed, and practised all that he enjoined. The
                    character of a nonjuror, which he maintained to the last, is a sufficient
                    evidence of his principles in church and state; and the sacrifice of interest to
                    conscience will always be respectable. His theological writings, which our
                    domestic connexion has tempted me to peruse, preserve an imperfect sort of life,
                    and I can pronounce with more confidence and knowledge on the merits of the
                    author. His last compositions are darkly tinctured by the incomprehensible
                    visions of Jacob Behmen; and his discourse on the absolute unlawfulness of
                    stage-entertainments is sometimes quoted for a ridiculous intemperance of
                    sentiment and language. But these sallies of religious phrensy must not
                    extinguish the praise which is due to Mr William Law as a wit and a scholar. His
                    argument on topics of less absurdity is specious and acute, his manner is
                    lively, his style forcible and clear; and, had not his vigorous mind been
                    clouded by enthusiasm, he might be ranked with the most agreeable and ingenious
                    writers of the times. While the Bangorian controversy was a fashionable theme,
                    he entered the lists on the subject of Christ’s kingdom, and the authority of
                    the priesthood; against the <hi rend="italic">Plain Account of the Sacrament of
                    the Lord’s Supper,</hi> he resumed the combat with Bishop Hoadly, the object of
                    Whig idolatry and/ſory abhorrence; and at every weapon of attack and defence,
                    the nonjuror, on the ground which is common to both, approves himself at least
                    equal to the prelate. On the appearance of the <hi rend="italic">Pable of the
                    Bees,</hi> he drew his pen against the licentious doctrine that private vices
                    are public benefits, and morality as well as religion must join in his
                    applause<pb break="no" facs="nls:193203394" xml:id="kp-eb0713-3394-0153"/>. Mr
                    Law’s master-work, the <hi rend="italic">Serious Call,</hi> is still read as a
                    popular and powerful book of devotion. His precepts are rigid, but they are
                    founded on the gospel; his satire is sharp, but it is drawn from the knowledge
                    of human life; and many of his portraits are not unworthy of the pen of La
                    Bruyère. If he finds a spark of piety in the reader’s mind, he will soon kindle
                    it to a flame; and a philosopher must allow that he exposes, with equal severity
                    and truth, the strange contradiction between the faith and practice of the
                    Christian world.”</p>
                <p>Mr Law’s works amount to nine volumes octavo, comprising, besides a collection of
                    letters, sixteen distinct treatises, which, however, it is unnecessary to
                    enumerate, seeing they are all printed together. Although Law is best known as a
                    devotional writer, and there can be no doubt that his <hi rend="italic">Serious
                    CaU,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Christian Perfection,</hi> have proved eminently
                    useful in leading many to think in earnest of religion, yet his merits as a
                    controversial writer are of a very high order, and, in respect of style, wit,
                    and argument, his letters to Bishop Hoadly are amongst the finest specimens of
                    polemical composition to be found in our language. . <hi rend="smallcaps"
