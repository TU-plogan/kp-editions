                <p><label type="entry">LEO X</label>. <hi rend="smallcaps">Pope,</hi> second son of
                    Lorenzo de’ Medicis, was born at Florence in December 1475, and received the
                    baptismal name of Giovanni, or John. He received the tonsure at seven years of
                    age, his father having destined him for the church. Being even at that early
                    period declared capable of clerical preferment, he obtained two rich abbeys,
                    through the interest of his father with Louis XI. of France, and Sixtus IV. At a
                    very early period he held no fewer than twenty-nine church preferments, a strong
                    proof of the most scandalous corruption, as well as of the interest which his
                    family enjoyed. In the time of Innocent VIII. he was promoted to the rank of
                    cardinal, when no more than thirteen years of age, which took place in the year
                    1488 ’. If the great influence of his father was unquestionably censurable in
                    promoting the rapid and illegal advancement of his son, it is but justice to
                    admit, that he employed all his efforts to qualify him for such premature
                    dignity. Angelo Poliziano had the care of his early education, which was greatly
                    accelerated by the uncommon gravity and solidity of his disposition. He was
                    invested with the purple in 1492, and went afterwards to reside at Rome as one
                    of the sacred college. Having opposed the election of Alexander VI. to the
                    pontificate, he found it prudent to withdraw to Florence, in which place he
                    acquired much personal esteem; but on the invasion of Italy by Charles VIII. of
                    France, he was involved in the expulsion of his brother Pietro, and took refuge
                    at Bologna. In 1499 he made a tour through the states of Venice, Germany, and
                    France, and afterwards went to Rome, where, in consequence of his prudent
                    behaviour, he lived safe and respected during the pontificate of Alexander.</p>
                <p>ln 1505, when thirty years of age, he began to take an active part in public
                    affairs, and Julius II. appointed him governor of Perugia. As he adhered with
                    unshaken resolution to the interest of the pope, he acquired the confidence of
                    his holiness in so eminent a degree, that he was intrusted with the direction of
                    the papal army against France; and, if he was not competent to conduct the
                    military operations, he was of singular service in maintaining good order in the
                    camp. He was taken prisoner at the bloody battle of Ravenna in 1512, and
                    conveyed to Milan, where the dignity of his sacred office procured him respect.
                    From this place he found means to escape, returned to Bologna, and assumed the
                    government of the district in the capacity of the pope’s legate.</p>
                <p>At the election of a new pope in the room of Julius II. he was chosen to the
                    pontificate, being then only thirt yeight years of age. Whatever might be the
                    leading motives of the conclave for electing so young a pope, it is agreed on
                    all hands that it was not effected by those corrupt practices too common on such
                    occasions; and he ascended the throne under the name of Leo X. with stronger
                    proofs of affection on the part of both Italians and foreigners than the greater
                    part of his predecessors. He displayed his love of literature by the nomination
                    of Bembo and Sadoleti as papal secretaries.</p>
                <p>One of his first attempts was to free Italy from the dominion of foreign powers;
                    and having taken into pay a large body of Swiss, he gained a victory over the
                    French in the reign of Louis XII. at the bloody battle of Novara, by which means
                    they were driven from Italy; whilst the king of France having incurred
                    ecclesiastical censure, submitted in form, and received absolution. Having thus
                    secured internal tranquillity, he turned his attention to the encouragement of
                    literature and men of genius. He effected the restoration of the Roman
                    university to its former splendour by means of new grants and privileges, and by
                    filling the professorships with distinguished characters from every quarter. A
                    Greek press was established in the city, and all Europe was informed that
                    persons bringing ancient manuscripts to the pope would be liberally rewarded,
                    besides having them printed at the expense of the holy see. He also promoted the
                    study of oriental literature, and he had the honour of founding the first
                    professorship of the Syriac and Chaldaic languages at Bologna.</p>
                <p>On the death of Louis XII. of France, and the accession of Francis I. to the
                    throne, it soon became apparent that a new war was inevitable in the north of
                    Italy. Leo endeavoured to remain neutral, but without success; in consequence of
                    which he joined in a league with the emperor, the king of Aragon, the states of
                    Milan and Flo rence, and the Swiss cantons, against the French king and the
                    state of Venice. But he soon found it expedient to desert his allies, and form a
                    union with Francis, which took place in 1515, at an interview between the two
                    sovereigns.</p>
                <p>In 1517, the Duke of Urbino, whom he had expelled in order to make way for his
                    nephew Lorenzo, collected an army, and by rapid movements regained his capital
                    and dominions, which chagrined Leo to such a degree that he endeavoured to
                    excite all the Christian princes against him. He raised an army under the
                    command of his nephew, and the duke was finally compelled to relinquish his
                    dominions upon honourable terms. In this year the life of Leo was in danger, and
                    all his moments were embittered by a conspiracy against him in his own court.
                    Petrucci, the ringleader, had formed a plan of destroying the pope by poison;
                    but having failed in this attempt, he withdrew from Rome, still, however,
                    carrying on a correspondence with his secretary. Some of his letters being
                    intercepted, he was arrested on his way to Rome, committed to prison, and
                    strangled, whilst his accomplices were put to death with the most severe
                    tortures. To shelter himself from danger, whether real or imaginary, Leo created
                    thirty-one new cardinals in one day, chiefly from amongst his own relations,
                    though some of them were deserving of the dignity by their virtues and
                    talents.</p>
                <p>In the reign of this pontiff began the reformation of religion under the
                    celebrated Martin Luther, who inflict- <pb break="no" facs="nls:193204426"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0713-4426-0231"/><hi rend="subscript"> e</hi> d a wound on the
                    Catholic church which will never probably be healed. Leo’s taste for
                    magnificence and expense having exhausted his coffers, he took from the church
                    the profits arising from the sale of indulgences, for his own private emolument.
                    These wares were extolled in language which shocked the pious and thinking part
                    of mankind, and facilitated the progress of the reformation in the hands of such
                    a man as Luther. The latter, du-rino his opposition to the extravagance of Leo
                    in the sale of indulgences, was still willing to be reconciled to the church;
                    but as he insisted on making an unqualified appeal to the language of Scripture,
                    and Leo would admit of nothing but an unqualified appeal to the decrees of the
                    church,'a reconciliation was found impossible. The works of Luther were burned
                    in different places by Leo’s command, and Luther in his turn made a solemn and
                    public conflagration of the papal decrees and constitutions, and even of the
                    bull itself. It was this pontiff who conferred on Henry VIII. of England the
                    title of defender of the faith.</p>
                <p>The private hours of Leo, it is said, were devoted to indolence, or to
                    amusements, some of which were unworthy of his clerical dignity. He never lost
                    sight of his favourite idea of expelling the French from Italy. The Swiss in the
                    service of France having been induced to desert, the allies crossed the Adda,
                    and occupied Milan without opposition. They next entered the territories of the
                    Duke of Ferrara, who had espoused the cause of France. Many of his strong
                    ^places were taken, and siege was about to be laid to his capital, when it was
                    prevented by the indisposition of the pope, which in the space of eight days
                    terminated in his death, on the 1st of December 1521, in the forty-sixth year of
                    his age and the ninth of his pontificate.</p>
