                    of those illustrious Greeks who, having been expelled from their native country
                    in the fifteenth century, contributed greatly to the revival of letters in
                    Europe. He was descended of the imperial family of the same name, and born at
                    Constantinople, though in what year has not been ascertained. In 1454, he left
                    the imperial city, destined soon afterwards to become the prey of the Turkish
                    invaders, and went to seek an asylum in Italy, where he was favourably received
                    by Francisco Sforza, who intrusted him with the education of his daughter
                    Hippolyta, afterwards married to Alfonzo king of Naples. From Milan he proceeded
                    to Rome, where he lived some time in habits of intimacy with Cardinal Bessarion,
                    and then set out for Naples, whither he had been invited by King Ferdinand, in
                    order to profess Greek and rhetoric in that city. Having spent some years in
                    this occupation, he formed the resolution of going to end his days in one of the
                    isles of Greece; but the vessel in which he had embarked having touched at
                    Messina, the principal inhabitants made to him such urgent applications, that he
                    consented to give lessons in their city. The reputation of this great master of
                    learning soon attracted thither numerous pupils, amongst whom the celebrated
                    Bembo is said to have been one; and he received the honour of citizenship, which
                    he merited equally by his virtues and his erudition. He lived to an advanced
                    age, and died towards the end of the year 1493. In gratitude for the proofs of
                    regard which he had received from the senate, he bequeathed to it, by his will,
                    his library, consisting of valuable manuscripts, which were afterwards
                    transported to Spain, where they may still be seen in the Royal Library of the
                    Escurial. His published works are, 1. Grammatica Graeca, sive Compendium octo
                    Orationis partium, Milan, 1476, in 4to, being the first book printed in Greek;
                    2. Two <hi rend="italic">Opuscula</hi><hi rend="italic">cm</hi> the Sicilians
                    and Calabrese who had written in Greek, published, for the first time, by
                    Maurolico in 1562; 3. A Dissertation on Orpheus, printed in the first volume of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Marmora Taurinensia,</hi> from a manuscript in the library
                    of the king of Sardinia. <hi rend="smallcaps">(a.)</hi><hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Lascaris,</hi><hi rend="italic">Andrew John,</hi> a learned Greek, of the same
                    family with the preceding, and surnamed <hi rend="italic">Phyndacenus,</hi>
                    probably because he was originally from Rhyndacus, a small town between the
                    Hellespont and Phrygia. He abandoned his native country after the overthrow of
                    the lower empire, and took refuge at the court of Lorenzo de’ Medicis. This
                    great protector of letters sent him back to the East to collect such manuscripts
                    as had escaped the fury of the Turks; and having obtained permission to examine
                    the libraries, he derived from them a great number of valuable works. Some years
                    afterwards, he made a second voyage to Greece; but before his return Lorenzo
                    died, and the’ troubles which broke out in Florence determined Lascaris to
                    accept the offers made to him <hi rend="subscript"> tι</hi> by Charles VIII. in
                    order to draw him to France. He was at Paris in the year 1495; and it was he who
                    taught the principles of the Greek language to Budé and to Danes. In 1503, Louis
                    XII. appointed him to the embassy of Venice; a mission in which he must have
                    acquitted himself in a satisfactory manner, since he was sent thither a second
                    time in 1505. Nevertheless, Wicquefort pretends that Lascaris was but ill
                    qualified for an employment which required a knowledge of the interests of
                    princes, and great experience of the world; and he even asserts that the
                    Venetians complained that France had sent them a pedant instead of an
                    ambassador. His functions ceased in consequence of the rupture which took place
                    between the republic and France; and Lascaris resumed the teaching of the Greek
                    language. Leo X. having conceived the design of extending the knowledge of this
                    language, called him to Rome, to put him at the head of the college of young
                    Greeks which he had just founded; and at the same time confided to him the
                    direction of a printing establishment destined to multiply impressions of Greek
                    books. In 1515, the pope intrusted him with a mission to Francis I.; and this
                    prince, sensible of his merits, endeavoured to retain him in France. Lascaris,
                    however, returned to Rome the same year; but he revisited Paris in 1518, and,
                    along with Budé, was employed to form the royal library of Fontainebleau.
                    Francis I. then appointed Lascaris his ambassador to Venice, as his predecessor
                    had. done; and he remained in that city until Pope Paul III. testified a desire
                    to have him at Rome. He yielded to the solicitations of the pontiff, though
                    suffering from the gout, and immediately set out for the capital of the
                    Christian world; but the fatigue of the journey augmented his sufferings, and he
                    died, in 1535, a few months after his arrival, at the advanced age of nearly
                    ninety. Lascaris did not deem it unworthy of him to act as corrector of the
                    press, first in the office of F. Alopa at Florence, and next in the
                    printing-house established by Pope Leo X. in Monte-Cavallo; and we are indebted
                    to him for excellent editions of the following works, viz. I. Anthologia
                    Epigrammatum Graecorum, libri vii. Graece, Florence, 1494, in 4to; 2. Callimachi
                    Hymni Gr. cum scholiis Graecis, ibid, in 4to, the <hi rend="italic">editio
                    princeps,</hi> executed with the same characters as the preceding work; 3.
                    Scholia Graeca in Iliadem, in integrum restituta, Rome, 1517, in folio, a very
                    rare edition; 4. Homericarum Quaestionum, liber, et de Nympharum antro in
                    Odyssea opusculum, ibid. 1518, in small 4to, the <hi rend="italic">editio
                    princeps</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> 5. Commentarii [GraeciJ in septem
                    Tragoedias Sophoclis, ibid. 1518, in small 4to. Lascaris wrote in Latin with
                    equal facility and elegance; and he was entreated to undertake the translation
                    of several Greek authors, but he has only rendered some treatises of Polybius on
                    the military art. Several smaller works are also ascribed to him, viz. 1.
                    Epigrammata Graeca et Latina, Paris, 1527, in 8vo, and 1544, i <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi> n 4to; 2. De veris Graecarum Litterarum formis ac
                    causis apud Antiquos, Paris, 1536, in 8vo; 3. Orationes, Francfort, 1575. The
