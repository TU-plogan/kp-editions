                    surrounded by land, and having no direct nor immediate communication with the
                    ocean or with any seas, or having so only by means of rivers. Lakes are of
                    various kinds, and have been divided into two classes, according to their
                    situation and causes of production. Those which are formed in deep hollows
                    between the ridges or at the bases of mountains, and which are supplied with
                    water by springs or torrents, are classed together; and those which are formed
                    in low and level countries by the surplus water of rivers, or from a want of
                    sufficient declivity in the ground to allow the waters to continue their course,
                    constitute a second class. But there are several other characteristics belonging
                    to lakes, which justify a more minute division; and four distinct kinds have
                    been recognised. The first class comprehends those which have no issue, and into
                    which no running water flows. These, being generally diminutive in size, do not
                    merit much attention. Some of them, as the Arendt, in Vieille Marche, are formed
                    by the sinking down of the circumjacent lands; others, like the Lake Albano,
                    near Rome, appear to be old volcanic craters filled with water. The second class
                    consists of those lakes which discharge, but receive no running water. These are
                    formed by springs, which, rising in a hollow place or reservoir, fill it before
                    they find an outlet for their own waters. These lakes, however, are fed by
                    small, almost invisible, streams, which descend from contiguous heights, or from
                    subterraneous canals. Lakes of this description are often the source of large
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:193201743" xml:id="kp-eb0713-1743-0026"/>rivers, and they are naturally situated on great elevations. There is one of
                    this kind on Mount Rotando, in Corsica, which is 9294&lt; feet above the level
                    of the sea. The third class, consisting of lakes which receive and discharge
                    streams of water, is very numerous. Each of these lakes may be considered as a
                    large basin or reservoir for receiving the accumulated waters of the
                    neighbouring countries. They have in general only one opening, which almost
                    always takes its name from the principal river which flows into it. These rivers
                    are sometimes said to traverse the lakes; but this is scarcely correct, as their
                    waters mingle with those of the basin over which they are diffused. These lakes
                    have often sources of their own, either near the borders, or in their bottom.
                    There are four or five lakes of this class in North America, which in magnitude
                    resemble seas, but which preserve their clearness and sweetness notwithstanding,
                    by the flow of a continual stream of fresh water. Sometimes a chain of lakes are
                    connected with one another and with the ocean, by a series of rivers. This is
                    the case with the great lakes on the northern frontier of North America,. where
                    basin succeeds basin on a lower level, like so many locks of a canal. A fourth
                    class of lakes are those which receive streams of water, and often great rivers,
                    without having apparently any outlet. These lakes are in general confined to
                    warm climates; but the Caspian Sea, the largest of all lakes, belongs to this
                    class. (See the article on the <hi rend="smallcaps">Caspian Sea.)</hi> There arc
                    a great many others besides in Asia; and South America contains the Lake
                    Titicaca, which has no efflux, although it receives very considerable rivers
                    into it. Such lakes appear to belong to the interior of great continents; they
                    are placed on elevated plains, which have no sensible declivity towards the sea,
                    and which do not allow of the water opening for itself a passage through which
                    to flow out. It was long conjectured, that, by some subterraneous channel, lakes
                    of this description communicated with the sea; but the fact that the surfaces of
                    some of the most remarkable of them, such as the Caspian and the Dead Sea, are
                    depressed below the level of the ocean, is quite sufficient to explode this
                    hypothesis. For were there any communication, however small, the ocean would
                    flow into the lake till it brought it to a level with itself. The true
                    explanation seems to be, that a quantity of water equal to that which runs in is
                    carried off by evaporation. The absorption of liquid by the contiguous land may
                    also materially assist in carrying off the surplus fluid. There is another class
                    of lakes, which differ materially from any of the preceding, namely, those which
                    are contamed in cavities quite covered over by earthy strata. These are probably
                    very numerous, for it frequently happens, that after any violent convulsion of
                    the globe, such as an earthquake, they become exposed to view; and, by the
                    operations of mining, digging of wells, and the like, they have often been met
                    with. Some of them appear to be the source of rivers, whilst others are known to
                    receive very considerable streams, which lose themselves in the interior. Such
                    are the numerous cavities of the Julian Alps. Certain lakes situated above
                    ground periodically disappear; and their waters, it is most probable, flow into
                    similar reservoirs. That very extensive subterranean cavities exist, is
                    sufficiently attested by numerous phenomena. The disappearance of rivers, the
                    waters thrown up by volcanoes, the sudden and terrible inundation of mines, the
                    mountains which are suddenly engulphed in the bosom of lakes, and the springs of
                    fresh water which spout up in the midst of the ocean, are all so many evidences
                    of the fact. There is a district in the interior of Algiers, where the
                    inhabitants, after digging to a depth of about two hundred fathoms, invariably
                    come to water, which flows up in such abundance that they çall it the
                    subterranean sea.</p><p>The physical phenomena which certain lakes present are very remarkable, and were
                    calculated to excite astonishment in an age when the operation of natural causes
                    was not sufficiently attended to. Periodical lakes are the most common. Those
                    which are formed by excessive rains, and which are evaporated by solar
                    influence, are sometimes of great magnitude, as in tropical climates, where they
                    cover spaces of several hundred leagues in length and breadth. Towards the poles
                    they shrink into mere pools, scarcely worthy of notice. But there are lakes
                    entirely independent of the rainy season, which appear and disappear at certain
                    intervals, although these changes do not seem to take place at regular
                    intervals. With regard to such sheets of water, Malte-Brun observes: “If there
                    exist now in the numerous cavities of the earth subterraneous lakes of this
                    kind, and if these communicate with other lakes which are visible, it is easy to
                    imagine that the waters of these last may sometimes entirely disappear, by
                    sinking down into the basin of the subterraneous lakes in proportion as they dry
                    up. This lower basin again filling itself anew, the waters issue from it to fill
                    the superior basin. If, in a supposable series of subterraneous cavities, the
                    last link of the chain happen to be a mass of subterraneous water, situated at
                    an elevated level in the bosom of a mountain, the periodical return of the
                    waters in the visible basin may be accompanied by a motion similar to that of
                    the spouting fountains. It is by means of such hydraulic machinery that nature
                    keeps up the wonders of the lake of Cirknitz in Illyria, and in many others of
                    the same description.”</p><p>There are some lakes which present very remarkable phenomena, such as rising and
                    falling like a tide, and boiling, and becoming agitated even during serene
                    weather. Some of the Scottish lakes, and the Welter in Sweden, often experience
                    violent commotion when the atmosphere is perfectly still. It seems highly
                    probable that these agitations are connected with earthquakes in distant
                    countries; and a coincidence in dates on certain occasions has given countenance
                    to this belief. In Portugal there is a small lake or pool near Beja in Alemtejo,
                    which emits a loud noise on the approach of a storm. Other lakes appear agitated
                    by the disengagement of subterranean gases, or by winds which blow in some
                    cavern with which the lake communicates. Near Boleslaw, in Bohemia, there is a
                    lake of unfathomable depth, which sometimes in winter emits blasts of wind so
                    strong as to elevate to some height ponderous pieces of ice. In the Marche of
                    Brandeburg, the pool of Krestin often commences in fine weather to boil up in
                    whirlpools, so as to engulph small fishing boats.</p><p>With regard to depth, lakes vary infinitely. In those situated in mountainous
                    districts, it is remarkably great; that of Lochness, in Scotland, is one hundred
                    and thirty fathoms in some parts. The general depth of the Caspian Sea is from
                    sixty to seventy fathoms. but this increases towards the southern end to such a
                    degree that no bottom can be found with a line of three hundred and eighty
                    fathoms. The lake of Geneva attains the great depth of one hundred and sixty-one
                    fathoms, and there are many others known to be exceedingly deep, without the
                    amount being exactly ascertained. Several have passed for ages amongst the
                    vulgar as bottomless; but this opinion, it is scarcely necessary to say, is
                    unworthy of credit. Yet we are not to reckon as fabulous the accounts of lakes
                    with double bottoms, which are said to be found in Sweden and elsewhere. This
                    phenomenon is supposed to arise from interwoven roots becoming incrusted, and,
                    being suspended near the bottom of a lake, rise and fall according to
                    circumstances, thus causing the depth to vary in appearance In regard to the
                    temperature of lakes, see the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Climate.</hi></p><pb break="no" facs="nls:193201756" xml:id="kp-eb0713-1756-0027"/><p>Distinct from any of the characteristics of lakes yet alluded to, is the chemical
                    nature of their waters. Lakes, in respect to the quality of the waters, arc
                    distinguished into fresh, saline, and alkaline. Those which receive and
                    discharge considerable quantities of fresh water are almost always kept
                    themselves in a state of perfect freshness; but those which have no outlet are
                    invariably saline. Thus the Dead Sea, whose waters have no efflux, and into
                    which the river Jordan continually flows, contains about eight times as much
                    salt as common sea-water. The waters of the Jordan are brackish, and the
                    neighbouring soil is much impregnated with salt, so that the accumulation of
                    such a quantity of saline matter in the lake, during a series of ages, is by no
                    means surprising, for none of it ever passes off by evaporation. Salt must
                    likewise be accumulating in beds at its bottom; for as soon as water is
                    perfectly saturated, and can hold no more salt in solution, the latter must fall
                    to the bottom. Some of the large Asiatic lakes are dried up during summer, and
                    their beds appear lined with an incrustation of salt. All the great American
                    lakes consist of fresh water; those of Europe are either fresh or slightly
                    saline; but the Caspian Sea, and various others which are situated in plains
                    full of salt, or in tracts of country where salt springs abound, are almost
                    invariably impregnated with that substance. Some lakes are both saline and
                    alkaline, as is the case with the Natron Lakes in Lower Egypt. They derive their
                    appellation from their abounding in soda, which is there called <hi rend="italic">trona</hi> and <hi rend="italic">natron,</hi> the nitre of the
                    Scriptures. Some lakes produce a pitchy substance. In the island of Trinidad
                    there is one, on the surface of which an enormous quantity of bitumen, fit for
                    naval purposes, is collected. Deposits of various kinds, besides those
                    enumerated, seem to owe their origin to lakes. Bog iron-ore, or hydro-phosphate
                    of iron, is often found in such situations as to show that it has been deposited
                    from the waters of lakes; and in some countries it is collected from the sides
                    and bottoms of lakes once in a certain number of years. Calcareous springs are
                    numerous, and when the waters of these collect in a hollow place, so as to form
                    a lake, quantities of calcareous sinters and tuffas are deposited, so that the
                    lakes when emptied present extensive deposits of that mineral. The travertine
                    employed at Rome for building is a lake or spring calcareous deposit of sinter
                    and tuffa.</p><p>From the great changes which have been taking place for a series of ages, the
                    number, the extent, and the situation of lakes must have from time to time been
                    materially altered. That they occupied a greater extent of the earth’s surface
                    formerly than they do now, is quite consistent with geological phenomena. But
                    the investigation of the subject belongs more properly to Geology, which see
