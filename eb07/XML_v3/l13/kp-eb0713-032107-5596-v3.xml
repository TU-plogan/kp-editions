                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Although</hi> it too frequently happens, that an accident,
                    which materially endangers the life of an individual, deprives him, in the mean
                    time, of that presence of mind which alone would enable him to take proper
                    measures for his safety; yet to have meditated, in an interval of leisure, upon
                    the best method of proceeding in case of emergency, must tend greatly to
                    diminish the embarrassment and confusion that commonly accompany the accident,
                    even if it should not be thought necessary to provide any particular apparatus
                    for the purpose of escaping the danger. There are also many ways in which those
                    who are not immediately involved in the disaster may contribute to the
                    preservation of life, whether actuated by interest, or by humanity only; and the

                <p>Whenever a family establishes itself in a residence not detached from others, it
                    becomes of importance to ascertain what facilities the house affords for
                    ascending to the roof, and for passing to those of the neighbouring houses. It
                    is scarcely possible that a conflagration should extend at once to the
                    contiguous houses on each side, before the inhabitants of the house in question
                    have had time to escape. But in a detached house, if there are not two or more
                    staircases remote from each other, and even in a house contiguous to others,
                    when there is no facility of communicating by the roof, it becomes highly
                    expedient to provide some <hi rend="italic">internal means</hi> of escaping
                    through the windows in case of fire, and to have <hi rend="italic">on every
                    floor</hi> a good strong rope, with a hook or a loop at the end, by which it may
                    be fastened<pb break="no" facs="nls:193205609" xml:id="kp-eb0713-5609-0322"/> to
                    a bed-post, so as to enable an active person to descend by its help out of the
                    window, finding from time to time a partial footing in the inequalities of the
                    wall. This process will be greatly facilitated by having the rope knotted at
                    intervals of about a foot throughout its length; the knots being nearly as
                    convenient as the blocks or clips that are sometimes made for the purpose of
                    retarding the descent, by holding them, and regulating the friction by the
                    pressure of the hand<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    strong cross bar, on which a person may sit, while he regulates the position of
                    the clip by its handles, and allows himself to descend with more or less
                    velocity at pleasure. The arrangement for this purpose may be made by a roller,
                    or pipe, sliding on the rope, and pushed down so as to open the handles of the
                    clip and tighten its teeth, when the person holds by the roller and draws it
                    down (Plate CCCXXIII. fig. 12); and, on the contrary, the clip may be opened by
                    pressing on the handles with the other hand, or with the thighs; or any other
                    simple mode of regulating the clip may be adopted, provided that it be not
                    liable to be misunderstood, or misapplied, in a moment of confusion. After all,
                    a rope-ladder would perhaps be preferable, as not being liable to be deranged;
                    it is often kept ready made in the shops; and, in the absence of any other rope,
                    a common bed-cord will generally be found strong enough to support the weight
                    even of <hi rend="italic">Å</hi> stout man; for a quarter-inch rope may be
                    safely trusted with two hundredweight, and ought indeed to support three tirhes
                    as much if new and good.</p>

                    from Eire.</hi></p>
                <p>The external means to be employed in cases of conflagration must be provided by
                    the managers of fire-offices, or by other public officers; and every ingenious
                    workman, whom they may employ, will be able, at his leisure, to devise such
                    apparatus as he can the most conveniently execute, and to give it a full trial
                    in the absence of all danger; it will, therefore, only be advisable that he
                    should compare for himself the particular inventions which have been suggested
                    for this purpose, and that he should choose from among them such as he thinks
                    most likely to do him credit; and he may, indeed, very possibly find means of
                    improving on any of them.</p>
                <p>1, In Leopold’s <hi rend="italic">Theatrum Machinarium</hi> (plate liv. lv.) we
                    find the representation of a chair calculated to be draw n up or down by means
                    of pulleys. 2. Mr Varcuurt obtained, in 1761, the approbation of the Parisian
                    Academy of Sciences for his invention of a hollow mast, fixed in a waggon, and
                    supporting a stage, with the means of ascending and descending. <hi
                    rend="italic">(Hist.</hi> p. 158.) 3. In the beginning of the present century, a
                    fire-escape of Mr Audibert was approved by the Parisian Institute. <hi
                    rend="italic">(Mérn. Inst.</hi> iv.) 4. A committee was also appointed for
                    examining several similar inventions at the Lyceum of Arts, and a medal was
                    awarded by it to Mr Daujon, for his apparatus, which consists of a platform
                    carried on wheels, supported by three frames, with brass wires, on which boxes
                    are made to slide up and down for the conveyance of persons or of furniture. <hi
                    rend="italic">(Annales</hi><hi rend="italic">des Arts, Repertory</hi> ii. vol.
                    i. p. 439.) 5. Mr Collins’s invention of pipes raised by ropes, and affording a
                    centre to a long lever, is described in the fourth volume of the <hi
                    rend="italic">American</hi><hi rend="italic">Transactions,</hi> and in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Repertory</hi> (vol. XV. p. 35). 6. In the thirty-first volume of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Transactions of the Society of Arts</hi> (for 1813, p.
                    244), w e have an account of a fire-escape invented by Mr Adam-Young, for which
                    he received a medal from the society.</p>
                <p>It appears to constitute by far the most portable of ladders, consisting of cross
                    bars or rounds, connected by ropes, and having their ends fitted together, so as
                    to form a pole, which is readily elevated to the window; and the rounds being
                    separated, and the hooks at the end properly fixed to the window-frame, the
                    whole forms itself into a very convenient ladder of a mixed structure. 7. The
                    thirty-fourth volume, for 1816 (p. 227), contains a description of Mr Braby’s
                    fire-escape, consisting of a car made to slide on a strip of plank fixed to a
                    pole, and governed by a rope, which is cased with iron, to protect it, in case
                    of necessity, from the effect of the fire.</p>
                <p>The modes of extinguishing fires are not precisely the objects of the present
                    inquiry; but it deserves to be remarked, that the only rational principle on
                    which the methods proposed have been founded, is that of cutting off the supply
                    of air, either by a coat of water or steam, or by means of some chemical
                    substance, capable of forming an impenetrable varnish, or glazing, on the
                    surface of the combustible materials. A mixture of clay, with sulphate of iron
                    and alum, has been proposed for this purpose; but its utility must obviously be
                    extremely limited, and it must require to be applied with great address, so as
                    to be brought into fusion exactly at the place where it is capable of protecting
                    the substances not yet consumed.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> III.— <hi rend="italic">Internal Means of Escape
                    from Shipwreck.</hi></p>
                <p>The means of escaping from shipwreck may be similarly divided into internal and
                    external, or into the precautions to be taken by the ship’s company, and the
                    measures to be adopted by persons on shore. The internal means depend either on
                    enabling the individuals to swim or float, or establishing a connection with the
                    shore by ropes; and of the former, we may first consider those which require no
                    particular preparation before the occurrence of the accident that calls them
                    into action, and which are therefore the most universally applicable.</p>
                <p>Of such expedients, the most effectual appear to be those which depend on the
                    employment of empty watercasks for assisting the ship’s company to drift on
                    shore. 1. A paper on the arrangement of water-casks, to serve as floats in case
                    of shipwreck, appears in the publications of the Society for the Improvement of
                    Naval Architecture, dated in 1796 (vol. ii. 1, p. 51). 2. In 18t8, Mr Grant of
                    Bideford obtained a gold medal from the Society of Arts, for the invention of a
                    life-preserver, consisting of a thirty-six gallon cask, with some iron ballast
                    fixed on a wooden bed, and lashed to the cask, and with ropes round it for the
                    men to hold; and it was found that ten men were supported by it with convenience
                    in tolerably smooth water, the bung of the cask being well secured by cork (vol.
                    xxxvi. p. 63.) The ballast could be of very little use, and a cask simply tied
                    round with a rope, like a common parcel, would probably answer the purpose
                    equally well. It would, indeed, be prudent for every ship in a storm on a lee
                    shore, to have a few of her casks well emptied and stopped, and tied in this
                    manner, before the actual occurrence of imminent danger. 3. In the
                    thirty-seventh volume of the <hi rend="italic">Transactions of the Society</hi>
                    (p. 110j, there is an account of Mr Cook’s life-raft, consisting of a square
                    frame with canvass nailed across it, supported by a cask at each corner, for
                    which the gold medal was voted to him. 4. It is followed by a description of
                    Lieutenant Rodger’s liferaft (p. 112), which obtained a similar compliment. This
                    raft has the advantage of requiring only such materials as are usually found on
                    board of every ship; capstan bars, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193205622"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0713-5622-0323"/>boat-masts, yards, or any other spars of moderate
                    dimensions, which are tied together so as to make a sort of waggon frame, with a
                    large cask fixed on each side; it appears to afford a very convenient support to
                    the men, but it can scarcely possess any great strength for resisting the force
                    of the breakers.</p>
                <p>Mr J. Bremner, a clergyman in the Orkneys, had received a medal from the Society
                    in 1810, for his method of converting any ship’s boat into a life-boat, by
                    putting into it three or four casks attached to the keel, which is to have a
                    ring-bolt fixed in it for receiving the ropes by which the casks are fastened;
                    he gives particular directions for making all the necessary arrangements, in the
                    twenty-eighth volume of the <hi rend="italic">Transactions</hi> (p. 134); he
                    particularly advises that no use should be made of the natural buoyancy of the
                    cavity of the boat, but that the bottom should be perforated without hesitation,
                    wherever the hole would afford any additional facility for fixing a rope.
                    Captain Manby’s jolly-boat, fitted as a life-boat, “at the expense of three
                    pounds,” seems to be comprehended among those preparations which are to be made
                    previously to the voyage.</p>
                <p>The buckling a soldier’s canteen on his breast, as an assistance to enable him to
                    float, belongs to those temporary expedients which may occasionally be employed
                    with advantage. Tying a hat in a pocket-handkerchief, and holding it as a float,
                    has been recommended by Mr Lawson in the <hi rend="italic">Philosophical
                    Magazine</hi> (vol. xx. p. 362); he advises that the crown of the hat should be
                    held downwards, and observes that a stick may be employed, to enable us to use
                    two or four hats at once; but this method can only be adopted when the accident
                    occurs in very still water.</p>
                <p>The first and most obvious <hi rend="italic">preparation</hi> for enabling a
                    person to float, is the learning to swim. It is weH known that swimming is
                    scarcely ever sufficient to enable a seaman to reach the land from a ship that
                    has been wrecked, without some assistance; and many have certainly been drowned
                    from depending too much on their own strength; but for a momentary support, and
                    to afford courage and presence of mind to seek for other aid, there is no
                    question but that the faculty of swimming possesses an inestimable advantage. A
                    boy generally learns to swim by the help of his schoolfellows, better than by
                    any general rules, and more agreeably than in a school of natation; but it may
                    be of some use to observe, that the act of diving to the bottom and
                    re-ascending, in tolerably shallow water, is much more easily performed by a
                    beginner than that of simply supporting himself on the surface; and when he has
                    thus acquired the feeling of the immediate effect of his arms in propelling and
                    sustaining him, he soon finds out the means of employing his feet in their
                    assistance. The art of swimming has, however, been systematically treated by
                    Bachstrom, <hi rend="italic">Kunst zu Schwimmen,</hi> 8vo, Berlin, 1742; by
                    Thévenot, <hi rend="italic">Art</hi><hi rend="italic">de</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Nager,</hi> Paris, 1711; and by Bernardi, <hi rend="italic">Arte Ragionata del
                    Nuotο,</hi> 2 vols. 4to, Naples, 1794.</p>
                <p>It is easy to convince ourselves, by trials in a warm bath, without reference to
                    Robertson’s experiments <hi rend="italic">{Phil. Trans.</hi> 1757), that a
                    substance possessing a very small degree of buoyancy is sufficient to enable the
                    human body to float without effort. In fact, when the chest is fully expanded,
                    the thinnest and most bony person will commonly float in sea-water; but the
                    effort of keeping the chest expanded is as fatiguing as any other muscular
                    exertion; and when the chest collapses, the fattest people may be in danger of
                    sinking, unless they have learned to swim. Sir William Hamilton, indeed, tells
                    us that, in 1783, “a woman of Scilla, four months gone with child, was swept
                    into the sea by the wave” accompanying the earthquake, “and was taken up alive,
                    floating on* her back at some distance, nine hours after; she had been used to
                    swim; her anxiety and suffering, however, had arrived at so great a pitch, that
                    just at the time that the boat which took her up appeared, she was trying to
                    force her head under water, to put a period to her miserable existence.”</p>
                <p>In China, a frame of bamboo surrounding the person is used for a float, and the
                    lightness and strength of this substance must make it extremely proper for the
                    purpose; sometimes also a gourd is tied to a child, to secure its floating in
                    case of accident. The inflated goat-skins used from time immemorial by the
                    Arabs, or the seal-skins employed by the Chilians, have the disadvantage of
                    being easily punctured by a rock or a spar; an objection which is also more or
                    less applicable to all substances containing air; for example, to the air
                    jackets described in Leupold’s <hi rend="italic">Theatrum Pontificium,</hi>
                    published about 1724. A float of a semicircular form was recommended by Ozanam,
                    the author of the <hi rend="italic">Recreations</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and
                    Bachstrom, in his <hi rend="italic">Art of Swimming,</hi> proposed to float a
                    troop of cavalry, by fixing cork to the saddles. The cork jacket of Gelacy is
                    described in the <hi rend="italic">History of the Parisian Academy of
                    Sciences</hi> for 1757, and Lachapelle’s <hi rend="italic">Scaphander,</hi>
                    which is considered an improvement on it, in the volume for 1765. In the year
                    1764, the attention of the British public was particularly called to the
                    floating powers of cork, by some experiments which were made with cork jackets
                    on the Thames, together with some comparative experiments on air jackets; and Dr
                    Wilkinson, in the <hi rend="italic">Philosophical Transactions</hi> for 1765,
                    describes some experiments by which he ascertained that about a pound of cork
                    was amply sufficient to enable a man of ordinary size and make to float without
                    effort. It is almost superfluous to enumerate the multitude <hi rend="italic"
                    >of</hi> trifling variations that have been made in the arrangements of cork
                    jackets and air jackets, apparently for the purpose of exciting a momentary
                    interest, though possibly from the best motives. Mr Bosquet advised a bag of
                    cork shavings to be kept in readiness by each person; the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Seaman’s Friend</hi> was composed of two pieces of cork, united by straps; the
                    <hi rend="italic">Collinetta</hi> was a hollow vessel of copper, divided into
                    cells; a “marine spencer” has been described by Mr Spencer, in the sixteenth
                    volume of the <hi rend="italic">Philosophical Magazine,</hi> consisting only of
                    a number of old corks, arranged so as to form a girdle; and in 1806, Mr T. C.
                    Daniel obtained a gold medal from the Society of Arts, for the invention of an
                    apparatus of waterproof leather, surrounding the body, which, according to the
                    testimonials he produced, had saved the lives of some persons who had been
                    sailing in a pleasure-boat on a river. In smooth water, it has been suggested
                    that throwing a foot-ball, with a small weight tied to it, to the person
                    immersed, would often afford sufficient assistance; and, with respect to
                    floating, there is no doubt that any of the assistances which have been proposed
                    would be sufficient if they were at hand; but there is another object, to which
                    it is necessary to attend, in cold, and even in temperate climates, that of
                    supporting a temperature compatible with life and health, if the immersion is
                    likely to be of long duration; and an additional provision of worsted stockings,
                    jackets, and trowsers, will be almost as essential, in such cases, as the means
                    of obtaining buoyancy.</p>
                <p>For the second object which is desirable to a ship in distress, that of obtaining
                    a safe communication with the shore, it has been usual of late years to rely
                    principally on the humane exertions of persons who may be on the coast, and who
                    may have made preparations for this purpose; and with this view, some
                    instructions for properly co-operating in the measures to be adopted with
                    Captain Manby’s apparatus, have been liberally distributed to all ships when
                    they received their papers from some of the <pb break="no" facs="nls:193205635"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0713-5635-0324"/>British custom-houses. There are, however, some
                    simple expedients which may be adopted for this purpose by persons on board of
                    the ship; for example, the making a kite with a pocket-handkerchief stretched
                    over a hoop, and causing it to carry a cord to the lee shore, by means of which
                    a stronger line, and at last a hawser, may be drawn by persons standing on the
                    beach. A line may also sometimes be carried on shore by a cask, allowed to drift
                    before the wind; and a bag has been recommended to be attached to such a cask,
                    or to a buoy, in order to act as a sail, and to insure its crossing the surf. Mr
                    Cleghorn was also rewarded, in 1814, by the Society of Arts, for the invention
                    of a buoyant line, having a heart of cork, to obviate the inconvenience which
                    would arise from its sinking and being dragged on the stones under the breakers;
                    but he observes, that in heavy storms there is generally a current along shore,
                    which renders the method almost impracticable. <hi rend="italic"
                    >[Transactions,</hi> xxxii. p. 181.) A Mr Wheatley assures us, in Captain
                    Manby’s <hi rend="italic">Essay,</hi> that his own life, and that of eight other
                    persons, were saved, in 1791, by a lead line, which was carried on shore by a
                    Newfoundland dog that he happened to have on board, when two good swimmers had
                    been drowned in the attempt to swim on shore. It had occurred to Lieutenant
                    Bell, in 1791, that a rope might be thrown from a ship which had struck, by
                    means of a mortar carrying a heavy shot, and upon the principle of the gun
                    harpoon; and he showed the practicability of the suggestion by an actual
                    experiment, in which a deep-sea line was carried to a distance of about 400
                    yards. <hi rend="italic">[Trans. Soc. Arts,</hi> xxv. p. 136.) He recommended
                    that every ship should be provided with a mortar capable of carrying such a
                    shot, and observed that it might be placed on a coil of rope to be fired,
                    instead of a carriage. The line was to be coiled on handspikes, which were to be
                    drawn out before the mortar was fired. In 1792 he received a premium of fifty
                    guineas from the Society of Arts (<hi rend="italic">Transactions,</hi> x. p.
                    204); and he obtained his promotion in the Ordnance as an acknowledgment of his
                    merits. The shot was to weigh about sixty pounds or more, and the mortar five or
                    six hundredweight. The experiments of the French artillery at Lafere were
                    subsequent to those of Air Bell, though they have sometimes been quoted as the
                    first of the kind.</p>
                <p>It has, however, generally been thought impracticable to manage a mortar with
                    effect under the circumstances of actual shipwreck; and Mr Trengrouse has
                    preferred a rocket, as more easily fired, and as having a smaller initial
                    velocity than a shot, so that the rope would be less in danger of being broken
                    by the impulse. He found that a rocket of eight ounces carried a mackerel line
                    180 yards, and a pound rocket 212; and in some experiments made under the
                    inspection of the Society of Arts, a rocket an inch and a quarter in diameter
                    carried a cord across the Serpentine River in Hyde Park. The musket is provided
                    with a valve, to prevent the escape of the materials of the rocket, and it is to
                    be fired with a little powder, without wadding. The whole apparatus is packed in
                    a chest, containing from eight to twelve rockets, the musket, a lifespencer, a
                    chair to traverse on a rope, a canvass bag, and a ball of wood to throw to a
                    person swimming. Mr Trengrouse was complimented with a medal from the Society of
                    Arts in 1820. (Vol. xxxviii. p. 161.)</p>

                    from Shipwreck.</hi></p>
                <p>The means to be employed by persons on shore, in cases of shipwreck, depend
                    either on projecting a line over the ship, or on the use of a life-boat. Mr Bell
                    had cursorily observed, that a line might be carried over a ship from the shore
                    by means of his mortar; but for the actual execution of this proposal, in a
                    variety of cases, we are indebted to the meritorious exertions of Captain G. W.
                    Manby, whose apparatus, according to the report of a committee of the House of
                    Commons, dated in March 1810, appears “to be admirably adapted to its purpose,
                    and to have been attended with the fullest success in almost every instance.” In
                    consequence of this report, Captain Manby was thought worthy of a parliamentary
                    reward; and he afterwards published a description of his inventions, under the
                    title of <hi rend="italic">An Essay on the Preservation of Shipwrecked
                    Persons,</hi> 8vo, London, 1812. He had previously received a gold medal from
                    the Society of Arts in 1808. (<hi rend="italic">Transactions,</hi> xxvi. p.
                    209.) His success makes it expedient to extract from his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Essay</hi> a detailed description of the apparatus, and it will be easy to make
                    it somewhat more intelligible by a slight alteration of the order of
                    arrangement.</p>
                <p>P. 21. “The method of affixing a rope to a shot, for the purpose of effecting
                    communication, when projected from a piece of ordnance over a stranded vessel,
                    was at length succeeded in, by introducing a jagged piece of iron, with an eye
                    at the top, into a shell, and securing it by filling the hollow sphere with
                    boiling lead; and in another way, by drilling a hole through a solid ball, and
                    passing a piece of iron, with an eye to it, as before described, to the bottom,
                    where it should be well secured by riveting.” (Plate CCCXXIII. fig. 22.)</p>
                <p>“To produce the means of connecting a rope to a shot, and prevent its being
                    burnt, and rendering it ‘ <hi rend="italic">irresistible</hi> to the powerful
                    inflammation of gunpowder, was the labour of infinite time, and the number of
                    experiments to accomplish it is beyond all possible conception. Chains in every
                    variety of form and great strength breaking, proved that it required not only an
                    elastic, but a closer connected body. At length, some stout platted hide, woven
                    extremely close to the eye of the shot, about two feet in length beyond the
                    muzzle of the piece, and with a loop at the end to receive the rope, happily
                    effected it.” (Plate CCCXXIII. fig. 14.)</p>
                <p>“This method is certainly desirable, as the rope may, immediately [as] it is
                    required, be affixed to the loop, and applied in service. The form of the
                    platted hide may likewise be woven by twisting it in the manner that the lashes
                    of whips or ropes are spun; there is another method, by passing the rope through
                    a case of leather, taking the greatest care that it is so well secured at the
                    eye of the shot, as to leave no room for the <hi rend="smallcaps">slightest
                    play,</hi> as is represented by the following <hi rend="smallcaps">barbed
                    shot.”</hi> (Plate CCCXXHL fig. 21.)</p>
                <p>“When the crews of the distressed vessel are incapable of availing themselves of
                    the benefits arising from communication, tíiey having previously lashed
                    themselves in the rigging to prevent being swept away by the sea, which is
                    repeatedly breaking over them, and when, from long fatigue and the severity of
                    the storm (on which occasions it too frequently occurs), they totally lose the
                    use of their limbs, and are rendered incapable of assisting themselves in the
                    slightest degree—the advantages of this shot are, that, on its being projected
                    over the vessel, and the people of the shore hauling it in, it firmly secures
                    itself on some part of the wreck or rigging, by which a boat can be hauled to
                    the relief of the distressed objects; and by the counterbarbs it is rendered
                    impossible [that it should] give up its hold, or slip, while that part of the
                    wreck remains to which it has secured itself.</p>
                <p>“Among the many that have been saved by this shot, the following are testimonials
                    of a few of the cases: We, the crew of the brig Nancy of Sunderland, do hereby
                    certify, that we were on board the said vessel when she was stranded on the
                    beach of Yarmouth, on Friday morning, -the lôtfi of December 1809, and compelled
                    to secure our <pb break="no" facs="nls:193205648" xml:id="kp-eb0713-5648-0325"
                    />selves in the rigging to prevent being swept away, the sea running so high
                    over the vessel. And we do farther declare and certify, that Captain Manby,
                    firing a rope with a hooked shot, securely holding on the wreck, enabled a boat
                    to be hauled from the shore over the surf to our relief, otherwise we must
                    inevitably have perished.” This certificate is attested by six signatures.</p>
                <p>P. 27.—“Facilitating communication is at all times of importance; but when the
                    stranded vessel is in momentary danger of going to pieces, this point becomes a
                    consideration of extreme urgency. I feel a persuasion that this particular
                    service can only be carried into effect by a small and light piece of ordnance,
                    the range of which is consequently very inconsiderable, when compared with that
                    of a large and heavier piece, as it is weight alone that conveys the rope. In
                    order, therefore, to increase the powers of a shot projected from a small
                    mortar, its natural form must be varied, so as to give it additional ‘
                    preponderance.’ The following shape, in the form of a pear, has been used with
                    the greatest success; for, by the increased weight, the shot’s momentum and
                    power over the line is in consequence considerably augmented in its range; and
                    when made to fit the piece as close as possible, a great increase of velocity is
                    likewise produced from that decrease of windage.” (Plate CCCXXIII. figll∙)</p>
                <p>“Portability in the construction of a piece of ordnance (as just described) is
                    the very essence of this service; and communication with the stranded vessel or
                    wreck may be effected with a cord, by which cord a rope can be conveyed, and by
                    that rope a hawser or cable sent to the distressed vessel; for this purpose the
                    following was constructed.” (Plate CCCXXI1I. fig. 18.)</p>
                <p>P. 31.—“A person completely equipped with every necessary apparatus to effect
                    communication with a vessel driven on a lee-shore the horseman, fully equipped,
                    travelled a mile and a half, the howitzer was dismounted, and the line projected
                    153 yards, in six minutes.</p>
                <p>“The application of a small piece of ordnance (Plate CCCXX1II. fig. 17) likewise
                    offers particular advantages, capable of being employed from a boat to go to the
                    assistance of a vessel grounded on a bar when running for a harbour, the
                    necessity of which repeatedly occurs, and was twice witnessed at Blakeney on the
                    10th of November 1810, when boats endeavoured to go to their relief, and were
                    enabled to get out of the harbour on the ebb tide, within twenty yards of the
                    vessel; but it was found impossible to approach them nearer. Had such boats been
                    provided with a piece of this description, and the same firmly secured on a
                    stout piece of plank, by the holes left at each corner of the iron bed, they
                    might have projected a small rope, coiled in a crate or basket made to the form
                    of the bow of the boat, and the persons in the boat, so provided, would not have
                    remained the distressed spectators of the untimely end of their
                    fellow-creatures, without being able to afford them the smallest relief,
                    although so little was then wanted for that desirable purpose.”</p>
                <p>- “Although advantages have been pointed out in the use of these small mortars,
                    it is necessary to be kept in remembrance, that they are produced for particular
                    services, as the nature of the coast, and circumstances attending the distressed
                    vessel, will direct what piece is best adapted to the undertaking. To enable the
                    mind to form a judgment what can be effected by other pieces, the following are
                    the minutes of experiments made with a five and half inch brass mortar, stating
                    the quantity of powder used, and distance the ropes were projected against a
                    strong wind, at the angle of seventeen degrees (elevation): weight of the mortar
                    and bed about three hundred.</p>

                <p>P. 15.—“<hi rend="italic">Directions for using the Apparatus.</hi> When the rope
                    (which should be pliant and well stretched) is brought on the beach or cliff
                    opposite to the stranded vessel, the most even spot, and free from projecting
                    stones, should be selected to lay it on, and great care be taken that no two
                    parts of it whatever overlay or even touch each other, nor must it be laid in
                    longer lengths than of two yards. But to project a small line or cord, it will
                    be necessary, if it is required, to contract the faker to half a yard at most,
                    to avoid the jerk received at the end of each right line. The best method, with
                    such a description of cord, is to lay it on the ground in the most short and
                    irregular windings, to relieve it from this powerful impulse. To prove the
                    effect of the impulse on a rope, if it is faked ir, lengths of ten or fifteen
                    -yards, it will break each time, as it then becomes a most powerful pendulum.
                    These precautions are absolutely necessary to the success of the service.</p>
                <p>“The following has, after various trials, been found a certain method of laying
                    the rope, and placing it into compartments.” <hi rend="italic">(^French
                    Faking,</hi> Plate CCCXXIII. fig. 1.)</p>
                <p>“A particular attention to this mode will never fail with a good rope, when the
                    impediments are removed that might otherwise obstruct its rapid flight Its
                    advantages are, that it will allow the eye rapidly (yet correctly, <hi
                    rend="italic">just before firing,</hi> which is absolutely necessary) to pass
                    over the different compartments, and at once discover if any fake has been
                    displaced by the storm, or by any other casualty or accident come in contact
                    with another part, which would destroy its application by the rope breaking.</p>

                <p>“It is, however, necessary to add, that great attention is required in laying it
                    agreeably to the two latter methods, arising not only from the arm being liable
                    to get under certain parts of the rope, and thereby displace it, but from the
                    great anxiety of mind natural on these occasions, where the lives of
                    fellow-creatures are literally dependent on the correctness with which the rope
                    is laid; it is therefore extremely difficult, in a moment of agitation, to
                    determine whether any overlay has taken place, an error that would infallibly
                    destroy every endeavour, and occasion even the fate of those whose lives we
                    might be exerting ourselves to preserve. Could persons in the <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193205661" xml:id="kp-eb0713-5661-0326"/>performance of this service
                    be always collected, the two latter methods would have a decided advantage over
                    the first mode of faking, they being laid in a much less space of time.</p>
                <p>“As all these methods of laying the rope occupy time to place it with the care
                    necessary; and as it has repeatedly happened that vessels, very soon after
                    grounding, have gone to pieces, and all hands perished; it was necessary to
                    produce a method of arranging the rope, so that it could be immediately
                    projected as soon as it arrived at the spot; and none proved so effectual as
                    when brought ready laid in a basket.” (Plate CCCXXII1. fig. 20.)</p>
                <p>“In this case, the rope should be most carefully laid in alternate tiers or
                    fakes, no part of it overlaying, and it should be well secured down, that in
                    travelling it be not displaced. But, above all things, no mistake must happen in
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">placing the basket</hi> PROPERLY. For example, that the end
                    of the basket, from which the shot hangs in the above plate, should be
                    previously marked, as it is here represented, and must be placed towards the sea
                    or wreck, that the rope be delivered freely, and without any chance of
                    entanglement. It will be scarcely necessary to add, there will be several tiers
                    of the rope when laid. The utmost care and attention are required in laying the
                    rope in tiers with strict regularity, to prevent entanglement.”</p>
                <p>P. 36.—“The next is the application of the mortar. If the wind is sideways to the
                    shore, it must be pointed sufficiently to windward to allow for the slack of the
                    rope lighting on the object, as the rope will, of course, be considerably borne
                    to leeward by the effect <hi rend="italic">of</hi> a strong wind, and by its
                    being laid at a low elevation insures the rope falling against the weathermost
                    part of the rigging. While this service is performing, great care should be
                    taken to keep the mortar dry; nor should it be loaded until every thing is
                    ready; when that is done, it should be primed; but as it would be impossible to
                    do it with loose powder in a storm, a tube is constructed in the simplest
                    manner, of common writing paper (the outer edge being cemented with a little
                    gum) in this form (Plate CCCXXIII. fig. 2.) It is filled with meal gunpowder,
                    made into paste with spirit of wine; when in a state of drying, run a needle
                    through the centre, and take care the w hole is left open, for, on the tube
                    being inflamed, a stream of fire darts through the aperture with such force as
                    to perforate the cartridge. The mortar should then instantly be fired; and in
                    order to lessen a difficulty that has often occurred in performing this service,
                    a pistol may be used, having a tin box over the lock, to exclude the effect of
                    wind or rain on the priming; and the muzzle being cut [obliquely], dilates the
                    inflammation, so as to require but little exactness in the direction of the
                    aim.</p>
                <p>“We will suppose the communication to be secured, although it is scarcely
                    necessary to offer any other assistance than that of a rope, as the inventive
                    genius of a sailor will supply every thing else; yet I could expect the people
                    on shore to get a boat ready for meeting the vessel when driven on a beach: it
                    is the promptest and most certain method of relief, as well as the most easy to
                    be accomplished; for by hauling her off with the rope projected, the boat’s head
                    is kept to the waves, and not only insures safety by rising to the surge, but
                    prevents her upsetting.”</p>
                <p>Again, p. 59.— “When the rope attached to the shot (not having barbs to it) is
                    fired over the vessel and lodges, let it be secured by those on board, and made
                    fast to some firm part of the rigging or wreck, that they may haul off a boat by
                    it; but should there not be any boat, then haul on board by the projected rope a
                    larger one, and a tailed block, through which a smaller rope is rove. Let the
                    large rope be made fast at the mast-head, between the cap and the top of one of
                    the lower masts, and theĵailed block a little distance below it; but, if the
                    masts should have been cut or carried away, then it must be made fast to the
                    loftiest remaining part of the wreck. When this is done, there will be supplied
                    from the shore a eot, hammock, netting, basket, hoop, or any of the numerous
                    resources of seamen, which will run on the larger rope, and be worked by the
                    people on shore. If a cot be used, the men may be so securely fastened to it as
                    to prcelude all possibility of falling out, and then be brought from the wreck,
                    one by one, in perfect safety.”</p>
                <p>P. 47.—“While communication is gaining, three stakes should be driven into the
                    ground in a triangular position, so as to meet close at the heads to support
                    each other. As soon as communication has been effected by thecrew of the vessel,
                    and they have secured the line attached to the shot, made fast to these stakes,
                    and the crew will haul on board by it a large rope and a tailed block, through
                    which a smaller rope is to be rove, both ends of which (the smaller rope) are to
                    be kept on shore. When they have secured these on board, and the larger rope is
                    rove through the rollers, let a gun-tackle purchase be lashed to it, then lash
                    the purchase to the stakes. By the means of the purchase, the larger rope may be
                    kept at a fit degree of tension; for, if care be taken to slacken the purchase
                    as the ship rolls out to sea, the danger of the rope being broken will be
                    guarded against; and, on the other hand, if the purchase be gathered in as the
                    ship rolls toward the shore, the slackness of the rope, which would prevent the
                    cot traversing as it ought to do, and plunge it in the water more than it
                    otherwise would, will be avoided.” (Plate CCCXXIII. fig. 9.)</p>
                <p>P. 59.—“Supposing neither boat nor cot apparatus at hand, first cast off the shot
                    from the projected rope, and with a close hitch, thus (Plate CCCXXIiI. fig. 16),
                    let it be put over the head and shoulders of the person to be saved, bringing it
                    close under cach arm, drawing it tight, <hi rend="smallcaps">observing
                    particularly the knot is on the breastbone</hi>; for, by having the knot in that
                    position, on the people of the shore hauling the person from the wreck, he will
                    naturally be on his back, consequently, the face will be uppermost to seize
                    every moment for respiration, after each surf has passed over the body. If
                    circumstances compel recourse to this method, care must be taken to free the
                    rope from any part of the wreck, and to jump clear away; but should there be
                    more than one on board, each man should make himself fast in the same way, about
                    four feet from the other, and join hands, all attending to the same
                    directions.”</p>
                <p>P. 61. —“<hi rend="italic">Eor giving Relief to Vessels Stranded on a Lee Shore

                    secondly, to produce a method of laying the mortar for the object, with as much
                    accuracy as in the light; thirdly, to render the flight of the rope perfeetly

                    sufficient quantity of gunpowder to burst the ball and inflame the stars. The
                    fuze fixed in the ball was graduated, to set fire to the bursting powder at the
                    height of 300 yards. Through the head of the fuze were drilled holes, at equal
                    [distances], to passthrough them strands of quick match, to prevent the

                    importance of going to the relief of ships in distress at a distance from the
                    land, or for taking off pilots, was viewed as of the highest consequence by the
                    Elder Brethren of the Trinity House, and offered to my particular attention by
                    several distinguished characters. After numerous experiments to accomplish it in
                    various ways, the mode following was most approved. About forty fathoms of two
                    and a half inch rope, made fast to two moving anchors, was laid out parallel
                    with the shore, at a distance beyond the sweep of the surf; to the centre of
                    this rope was made fast a buoy, of sufficient power to suspend the great rope,
                    and prevent it from chaffing on the sand, rock, or stones, as well as embedding,
                    a circumstance that has rendered it impossible, on a sandy or shingly coast, to
                    heave out an anchor with a rope to it from the shore. As this service should be
                    performed in fair weather (to be prepared for the storm), it may be regulated
                    with the greatest exactness, and should take place at the top of high-water,
                    that the upper part of the buoy may be at the full stretch of its power, and
                    only seen at that time. (Plate CCCXXIII. fig. 8.)</p>
                <p>“Should the shore be extremely flat, it will be desirable to place another set at
                    a sufficient distance beyond the first, to insure the operation of this method
                    in any state of the tide.”</p>
                <p>P. 71.—·“The royal mortar being brought to the spot, is to be pointed in the
                    direction for the buoy, and should be laid at a very low elevation, but such as
                    to insure the range; for the more it is depressed, the less slack of rope there
                    will be from the parabola formed in the shot’s flight; the basket with the rope
                    ready laid (having a barbed shot to it) is to be placed in the front of the
                    mortar; on its being fired, instantly haul the slack of the rope in, to prevent
                    the effect produced on it by a strong tide. Which being done, let the remainder
                    be gently hauled in, to insure the shot’s grappling with the great rope; when
                    that is caught and hooked, a power will be acquired fully adequate to the
                    service. (Plate CCCXXI1I. fig. 1.5.)</p>
                <p>“As a cast-iron anchor appears particularly adapted to this method, and would be
                    much cheaper than hammered, the following is a plan of one which the Honourable
                    the Navy Board approved, and allowed me to cast at their expense, for the
                    purpose of making the experiment.” (Plate CCCXXIII. fig. 19.)</p>
                <p>P. 43.—“When a vessel is in that extreme and perilous situation, driven under a
                    rugged and inaccessible cliff, and in danger of going soon to pieces, the most
                    prompt method I should suggest is, by lowering to the crew a rope with stiff
                    loops spliced into it, at the distance of a foot and a half from each loop, of
                    sufficient size to contain the foot, by which they can ascend as a ladder.
                    (Plate CCCXXIII. fig. 7.)</p>
                <p>“This rope ladder is capable of being projected; and one of an inch and half rope
                    was thrown from a mortar 194 yards. It might also, from the simplicity of its
                    structure, be extremely useful in escaping from a house on fire. By making one
                    end fast to the leg of a bed or a table, the person would come down from the
                    window in safety, and with much less difficulty, and quicker, than with the
                    common rope ladder, which is heavier and more unwieldy. It has great advantages
                    when employed in saving shipwrecked men in situations just described, when, from
                    extreme cold, and almost benumbed limbs, it would be impossible for them to
                    climb up a rock, or ascend it even by the aid of a common rope. The holds, thus
                    spliced in, will support both hands and feet.”</p>
                <p>The Report of the Committee of the House of Commons contains also a paper of
                    instructions for the managers of Captain Manby’s apparatus on shore, which are
                    somewhat more minute than the directions published in his Essay. For example (p.
                    13)—</p>
                <p>, “If the wind be sideways to the shore, the mortar must be pointed sufficiently
                    to windwards to allow for the slack of the rope lighting on the object, as the
                    rope will, of course, be borne considerably to leeward by the effect of a strong
                    wind.”</p>
                <p>“The distance your judgment decides the vessel to be from the shore, should
                    regulate the charge of powder as stated in the scale,—taking just a sufficient
                    quantity to clear the object: an attention to this will be more certain of your
                    effecting communication, and guarding against the danger of the rope breaking,
                    or any other circumstance that might prevent the successful performance of the
                    service. The elevation of fifteen degrees is to be preferred, particularly if
                    the wind is sideways, pointing the mortar sufficiently to windward, as the rope
                    would then fall against the weathermost part of the rigging of the stranded
                    vessel.”</p>
                <p>“When a vessel is driven on shore in the night, you will flash gunpowder as often
                    as convenient on youι≈ way; this will animate the crew, and denote to them you
                    are coming to their assistance. On getting to the spot where you have reason to
                    suspect the vessel lies, as you are not able to discover her from the extreme
                    darkness, and if the people on board cannot [make known] their situation by
                    luminous signals or noises (which they will be directed to make if possible),
                    you will lay the mortar at a very high elevation, and fire a light ball.”</p>
                <p>“Just before you fire (the rope) it would be advisable to let off a blue light to
                    put the crew on their guard, to look out, and be ready to secure the rope. The
                    service can be performed with a carronade.”</p>
                <p>In p. 15, chap. iv. we have a copy of directions to persons on board vessels
                    stranded on a lce shore, proposed to be delivered to the masters at the
                    custom-house. It is observed, that even snapping a pistol, when the powder is
                    wet, may sometimes afford a signal visible on shore, from the sparks of the
                    steel alone. The other parts of the directions will be easily supplied by those
                    who understand the principles of the proposed mode of relief.</p>
                <p>The last description of the inventions to be considered with regard to the
                    preservation of lives, in cases of shipwreck, is that of life-boats which are of
                    such a construction as to be incapable of sinking even when filled with water.
                    The occasional adaptation of the common boats of the ship to such purposes, by
                    means of empty casks, has been already considered. But the boats now in question
                    are supposed to be kept on shore at proper stations, and manned by active
                    persons, who are in the habit of exerting themselves for the relief of seamen in
                    distress.</p>
                <p>Mr Henry Greathead, of South Shields, received a gold medal and fifty guineas
                    from the Society of Arts in 1802, and a parliamentary reward of L.1200, besides
                    further remunerations<pb break="no" facs="nls:193205687"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0713-5687-0328"/> from the Trinity House, and from Lloyd’s
                    Coffee-House, for his invention of a life-boat, which is described in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Transactions of the Society,</hi> vol. xx. p. 283. The length of
                    this boat is thirty feet, its breadth ten, and its greatest depth about three,
                    besides a general curvature which nearly doubles the depth, as reckoned from the
                    ends; the convexity below being intended to give it a greater facility of
                    turning, and a greater power of mounting on the waves without submersion of the
                    bow, which would increase the resistance, though it would not sink the boat; the
                    breadth is also continued further than usual fore and aft, in order to
                    contribute to the same property. The gunwale projects some inches, and the sides
                    below it are cased with pieces of cork, amounting in the whole to seven
                    hundredweight, which are secured by plates of copper. There are ten short oars
                    of fir, fixed on pins to the gunwales, and a longer oar for steering at each
                    end, both ends of the boat being alike. It is painted white, in order to be more
                    conspicuous; and a carriage is provided, for conveying it over land when
                    required. The description is accompanied by documents of the preservation of two
                    or three hundred men by the boats of South Shields and North Shields, which were
                    built in 1789 and 1798 respectively.</p>
                <p>Mr Christopher Wilson received a gold medal in 1807, for a life-boat with air
                    gunwales, which was tried at Newhaven, and was said to be lighter and more
                    manageable than Mr Greathead’s. <hi rend="italic">( Transactions,</hi> xxv.
                    55.)</p>
                <p>“Little is required,” says Captain Manby, p. 73, “to establish the importance and
                    advantages that will result from giving every boat the properties of a
                    life-boat, particularly when taken into consideration that it can be produced at
                    a very trifling expense.”</p>
                <p>To illustrate the method of giving the properties of preservation to any boat, I
                    have selected the representation of a man of war’s jolly boat, fitted up to make
                    experiments thereon, by permission of the Honourable Commissioners of the Navy
                    Board. (Plate CCCXXIII. fig. 23.)</p>
                <p>“To give it buoyancy, empty casks were well lashed and secured in it. For the
                    advantage of keeping it in an upright position, launching from a flat shore,
                    beaching, and to resist upsetting, it had billage boards of equal depth with the
                    keel, and when a good sized piece of iron or lead was let into or made fast to
                    the keel, if any accident did upset the boat, it immediately regained its
                    original posture. A stout projecting rope, with swellings upon it to increase
                    its elasticity, surrounded the gunwale, served as a fender, and prevented it
                    being stoved in lowering down, or when driven in contact with the vessel it
                    might be going to relieve.</p>
                <p>“The boat thus described had the plug out, and was filled with water until it ran
                    over the gunwale, when a crew of four, with myself, tried it in every way, and
                    found, from the buoyant property of the casks, it kept the boat so much above
                    the water’s edge, that it was rowed with the greatest ease, and was capable of
                    performing any service required.”</p>
                <p>Mr J. Boyce, in 1814, obtained a medal for his lifeboat and safety buoy,
                    consisting of hollow cylinders made of canvass painted and varnished, and
                    connected with each other. It was tried on a river, and carried a man with
                    safety (vol. xxxii. p. 177); but surely it could not be trusted among breakers
                    on a lee shore. In 1818, Mr Gabriel Bray obtained a silver medal for his
                    invention of a boat filled with air boxes under the seats and along the sides.
                    (Vol. XXXV. p. 172.)</p>
                <p>Captain Manby’s proposal for throwing ropes from ship to ship in cases of
                    accidents, may easily be understood from the methods which he employs for saving
                    lives in shipwrecks. Mr Thomas Cook’s life-buoy is related to the same class of
                    inventions; its object is to preserve the life of a person falling overboard in
                    the night, by means of a floating light; and it obtained him a gold medal from
                    the Society of Arts in 1818. <hi rend="italic">( Transactions,</hi> xxxvi. p.
                    121.) He observes that a ship may often have to run half a mile before she can
                    get about and lower a boat, so that it becomes highly desirable to afford a
                    temporary support to the sufferer. The machine consists of two casks, with a
                    pillar between them, carrying a composition of potfire, to be lighted by a lock
                    when the accident happens, and to serve as a rendezvous to the man and the boat.
                    He found that it might be lighted and let down into the water in the short time
                    of five seconds, being always kept suspended in a proper manner between the
                    cabin windows at the stern of the ship. Mr Miller’s safety poles for skaiters,
                    and Mr Prior’s mode of preventing accidents in descending mines, are mentioned
                    in the <hi rend="italic">Transactions of the Society of Arts</hi> (vols. xxxii.
                    and xxxvi.); but they do not require more particular notice on the present
                    occasion.</p>
                <p>A sketch of the expedients which have been recommended for the preservation of
                    mariners, published in a work entitled <hi rend="italic">Shipwrecks and
                    Disasters at Sea</hi> (vol. iii. p. 459, Edinb. 1822, 8vo), contains a few
                    further historical details relating to some of the inventions which have been
                    described. <hi rend="smallcaps">(l. l.)</hi></p>
