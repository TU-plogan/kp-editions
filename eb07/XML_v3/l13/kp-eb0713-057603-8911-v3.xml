                <p><label type="entry">LOVE</label>, in the enlarged sense of the word, denotes all
                    those affections of the pleasing kind which objects and incidents excite in our
                    minds. Thus we are said to <hi rend="italic">love</hi> not only intelligent
                    agents of morally good dispositions, but also sensual pleasures, riches, and
                    honours.</p>
                <p>But <hi rend="italic">love,</hi> in its usual and more appropriate signification,
                    may be defined, “that affection which, being compounded of animal desire,
                    esteem, and benevolence, becomes the bond of attachment and union between
                    individuals of the different sexes, and makes them enjoy in the society of each
                    other a species of happiness which they experience nowhere else.” We call it an
                    <hi rend="italic">affection</hi> rather than a <hi rend="italic">passion,</hi>
                    because it involves a desire of the happiness of its object; and that its
                    constituent parts are such as have just been enumerated we shall first endeavour
                    to prove, and then proceed to trace its rise and progress from a selfish
                    appetite to a generous sentiment.</p>
                <p>Mere animal desire has nothing in view but the species and the sex of its object;
                    and before it makes a selection, it must be combined with sentiments very
                    different from itself. The first sentiment with which it is combined, and by
                    which a man is induced to prefer one woman to another, seems to be that by which
                    we are delighted with gracefulness of person, regularity of features, and beauty
                    of complexion. It is not indeed to be denied that there is something
                    irresistible in female beauty. The most severe will not pretend that they do not
                    feel an immediate prepossession in favour of a handsome woman; but this
                    prepossession, even when combined with animal desire, does not constitute the
                    whole of that affection which is called <hi rend="italic">love.</hi> Savages
                    feel the influence of the sensual appetite, and it is extremely probable that
                    they have some ideas of beauty; but amongst savages the affection of love is
                    seldom known. Even amongst the lower orders of society it seems to be a very
                    gross passion, and to have in it more of the selfishness of appetite than of the
                    generosity of esteem. To these observations many exceptions will no doubt be
                    found;<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Such as that of
                    the negroes whose story is so pathetically told by Addison <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Spectator,</hi> No. 215); the two lovers who were killed by lightning at
                    Staunton-Harcourt (Pope’s <hi rend="italic">Letters)</hi>; and many others which
                    will readily occur to every reader.</p></note> but we speak of savages in
                    general, and of the great body of the labouring poor, who, in the choice of
                    their mates, do not study, and indeed are incapable of studying, that rectitude
                    of mind, and those delicacies of sentiment, without which neither man nor woman
                    can deserve to be esteemed.</p>
                <p>In the savage state, and even in the first stages of refinement, the bond of
                    union between the sexes seems to consist of nothing more than mere animal desire
                    and instinctive tenderness for their infant progeny. The former impels them to
                    unite for the propagation of the species, and the latter preserves the union
                    until the children who are the fruit of it be able to provide for their own
                    subsistence. That in such unions, whether casual or permanent, there is little
                    mutual esteem and benevolence, is apparent from the state of subjection in which
                    women are held in rude and uncultivated nations, as well as from the manner in
                    which marriages are contracted.</p>
                <p>Sweetness of temper, a capital article with us in the female character, displays
                    itself externally in mild looks and gentle manners, and is the first and perhaps
                    the most powerful inducement to love in a cultivated mind. “But such graces,”
                    says Lord Kames, “are scarce discernible in a female savage, and even in the
                    most polished woman would not be perceived by a male savage. Among savages,
                    strength and boldness are the only valuable qualities. In these, females are
                    miserably deficient; for which reason they are contemned by the males, as beings
                    of an inferior order. The North American tribes glory in idleness; the drudgery
                    of labour degrades a man in their opinion, and is proper for women only. To join
                    young persons in marriage is accordingly the business of the parents; and it
                    would be unpardonable meanness in the bridegroom to show any fondness for the
                    bride. In Guiana a woman never eats with her husband, but after every meal
                    attends him with water for washing; and in the Caribbee islands she is not even
                    permitted to eat in the presence of her husband. Dampier observes in general,
                    that among all the wild nations with which he was acquainted, the women carry
                    the burdens, while the men walk before and carry nothing but their arms; and
                    that women even of the highest rank are not better treated. In Siberia, and even
                    in Russia, the capital excepted, men, till very lately, treated their wives <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193208924" xml:id="kp-eb0713-8924-0577"/> in every respect
                    like slaves. It might indeed be thought that animal desire, were there nothing
                    else, should have 'raised women to some degree of estimation among men; but male
                    savages, utter strangers to decency and refinement, gratify animal desire with
                    as little ceremony as they do hunger or thirst. Hence it was that in the early
                    ages of society a man purchased a woman to be his wife, as one purchases an ox
                    or a sheep to be food; and valued her only as she contributed to his sensual
                    gratification.”</p>
                <p>But if amongst savages and the vulgar, love be unknown, it cannot possibly be an
                    instinctive affection; and therefore it may be asked how it gets possession of
                    the human heart, and by what means we can judge whether in any particular
                    instance it be real or imaginary. These questions are of importance, and deserve
                    to be fully answered, though many circumstances conspire to render it no easy
                    task to give to them such answers as may be perfectly satisfactory. Love can
                    subsist only between individuals of the different sexes. A man can hardly love
                    two women at the same time; and we believe that a woman is still ess capable of
                    loving at once more than one man. Love, therefore, has a natural tendency to
                    make men and women pair, or, in other words, it is the source of marriage; jut
                    in polished society, where alone this affection has any )lace, so many things
                    besides mutual attachment are ne- &gt;essary to make the married life
                    comfortable, that we rare-y see young persons uniting from the impulse of love,
                    and ιave therefore but few opportunities of tracing the rise, )rogress, and
                    consequences of the affection. We shall, ιowever, throw together such
                    reflections as have occurred ,o us on the subject, not without indulging a hope
                    that hey may be useful to the younger part of our readers vhen forming the most
                    important connexion in life.</p>
                <p>We have said that the perception of beauty, combined vith animal desire, is the
                    first inducement which a man :an have to prefer one woman to another. It may be
                    ιdded, that elegance of figure, a placid masculine counte-ιance, with a person
                    which indicates strength and agility, .re the qualities which first tend to
                    attach any woman to I particular man. Beauty has been defined by Buffier, í that
                    particular form which is the most common of all articular forms to be met with
                    in the same species of seings.” Let us apply this definition to our own species,
                    <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> nd try, by means of it, to ascertain what
                    constitutes the ⅛cauty of the human face. It is evident, that of countenances we
                    find a number almost infinite of different forms; ∣f which, however, one only
                    constitutes beauty, whilst the est, however numerous, constitute what is not
                    beauty, ut deformity or ugliness. To an attentive observer, .owever, it is
                    evident, that of the numerous particular jrms of ugliness, there is not one
                    which includes so many ices as are formed after that particular cast which
                    con-titutes beauty. Every particular species of the animal s well as the
                    vegetable creation may be said to have a xed or determinate form, to which, as
                    to a centre, nature ∣L continually inclining. Or it may be compared to pen-
                    .ulums vibrating in different directions over one central oint; and as they all
                    cross the centre, though only one l asses through any other point, so it will be
                    found i hat perfect beauty is oftener produced by nature than eformity; we do
                    not mean than deformity in general, ut than any one kind and degree of
                    deformity. To ini tance in a particular part of a human feature; the line ∕hich
                    forms the ridge of the nose is deemed beautiful I /hen it is straight; but this
                    is likewise the central form, I zhich is oftener found than any one particular
                    degree of i oncave, convex, or any other irregular form that may be I imposed.
                    As we are then more accustomed to beauty han deformity, we may conclude that
                    that is the reason zhy we approve and admire it, just as we approve and admire
                    fashions or dress for no other reason than that we are used to them. The same
                    thing may be said of colour as of form. It is custom alone which determines our
                    preference of the colour of the Europeans to that of the Ethiopians, and which
                    makes them prefer their own colour to ours; so that though habit and custom
                    cannot be the cause of beauty, they are certainly the cause of our liking
                    it.</p>
                <p>That we do like it cannot be denied. Every one is conscious of a pleasing emotion
                    when contemplating beauty either in man or woman; and when that pleasure is
                    combined with the gratification of the sensual appetite, it is obvious that the
                    sum of enjoyment must be greatly increased. The perception of beauty, therefore,
                    necessarily directs the energy of the sensual appetite to a particular object;
                    but still this combination is a mere selfish feeling, which regards its object
                    only as the best of many similar instruments of pleasure. Before it can deserve
                    the name of love, it must be combined with esteem, which is never bestowed but
                    upon moral character and internal worth; for let a woman be ever so beautiful,
                    and of course ever so desirable as an instrument of sensual gratification, if
                    she be not possessed of the virtues and dispositions which are peculiar to her
                    sex, she will inspire no man with a generous affection. With regard to the
                    outlines, indeed, whether of internal disposition or of external form, men and
                    women are the same; but nature, intending them for mates, has given them
                    dispositions which, though concordant, are however different, so as to produce
                    together delicious harmony. « The man, more robust, is fitted for severe labour,
                    and for field exercise; the woman, more delicate, is fitted for sedentary
                    occupations, and particularly for nursing children. The man, bold and vigorous,
                    is qualified for being a protector; the woman, delicate and timid, requires
                    protection. Hence it is that a man never admires a woman for possessing bodily
                    strength or personal courage; and women always despise men who are totally
                    destitute of these qualities. The man, as a protector, is directed by nature to
                    govern; the woman, conscious of inferiority, is disposed to obey. Their
                    intellectual powers correspond to the destination of nature. Men have
                    penetration and solid judgment to fit them for governing, women have sufficient
                    understanding to make a decent figure under a good government; a greater portion
                    would excite dangerous rivalship between the sexes, which nature has avoided by
                    giving them different talents. Women have more imagination and sensibility than
                    men, which make all their enjoyments more exquisite; at the same time that they
                    are better qualified to communicate enjoyment. Add another capital difference of
                    disposition: The gentle and insinuating manners of the female sex tend to soften
                    the roughness of the other sex; and wherever women are indulged with any
                    freedom, they polish sooner than men.</p>
                <p>“These are not the only particulars that distinguish the sexes. With respect to
                    the ultimate end of love, it is the privilege of the male, as superior and
                    protector, to make a choice; the female preferred has no privilege but barely to
                    consent or to refuse. Whether this distinction be the immediate result of the
                    originally different dispositions of the sexes, or only the effect of
                    associations inevitably formed, may be questioned; but among all nations it is
                    the practice for men to court, and for women to be courted; and were the most
                    beautiful woman on earth to invert this practice, she would forfeit the esteem,
                    however by her external grace she might excite the desire, of the man whom she
                    addressed. The great moral virtues which may be comprehended under the general
                    term integrity, are all absolutely necessary to make either men or women
                    estimable; but to procure esteem to the female character, the modesty peculiar
                    to their sex is a <pb break="no" facs="nls:193208937"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0713-8937-0578"/>very essential circumstance. Nature hath provided
                    them with it as a defence against the artful solicitations of the other sex
                    before marriage, and’also as a support of conju-</p>
                <p>A woman, therefore, whose dispositions are gentle, delicate, and rather timid
                    than bold, who is possessed of a large share of sensibility and modesty, and
                    whose manners are soft and insinuating, must, upon moral principles, command the
                    esteem and benevolence of every individual of the other sex who is possessed of
                    sound understanding; but if her person be deformed, or not such as to excite
                    some degree of animal desire, she will attract no man’s love. In like manner, a
                    man whose moral character is good, whose understanding is acute, and whose
                    conversation is instructive, must command the esteem of every sensible and
                    virtuous woman; but if his figure be disagreeable, his manner unpolished, his
                    habits slovenly, and, above all, if he be deficient in personal courage, he will
                    hardly excite desire in the female breast. It is only when the qualities which
                    command esteem are, in the same person, united with those which excite desire,
                    that the individual so accomplished can be an object of love to one of the other
                    sex; but when these qualities are thus united, each of them increases the other
                    in the imagination of the lover. The beauty of his mistress gives her, in his
                    apprehension, a greater share of gentleness, modesty, and every thing which
                    adorns the female character, than perhaps she really possesses; whilst his
                    persuasion of her internal worth makes him, on the other hand, apprehend her
                    beauty to be absolutely unrivalled.</p>
                <p>To this theory an objection readily offers itself, which it is incumbent upon us
                    to obviate. Men and women sometimes fall in love at first sight, and very often
                    before they have opportunities of forming a just estimate of each other’s moral
                    character. How is this circumstance to be reconciled with the progressive
                    generation of love? We answer, by an association of ideas, which is formed upon
                    principles of physiognomy. Every passion and habitual disposition of mind gives
                    a particular cast to the countenance, and is apt to discover itself in some
                    feature of the face. This we learn by experience; and in time, without any
                    effort of our own, the idea of each particular cast of countenance comes to be
                    so closely associated in our minds with the internal disposition which it
                    indicates, that the one can never afterwards be presented to our view without
                    instantly suggesting the other to the imagination. Hence it is that every man,
                    who has been accustomed to make observations, naturally forms to himself, from
                    the features and lineaments of a stranger’s face, some opinion of his character
                    and fortune. We are no sooner presented to a person for the first time, than we
                    are immediately impressed with the idea of a proud, a reserved, an affable, or a
                    good-natured man; and upon our going into a company of absolute strangers, our
                    benevolence or aversion, our awe or contempt, rises instantly towards particular
                    persons, before we have heard them speak a word, or know so much as their names
                    or designations. The same thing happens when we are presented to the fair sex.
                    If a woman, seen for the first time, have that particular cast of countenance,
                    and that expression of features, with which we have associated notions of
                    gentleness, modesty, and other female virtues, she instantly commands our
                    esteem; and if she have likewise so much beauty as to make her an object of
                    particular desire, esteem and desire become suddenly combined, and that
                    combination constitutes the affection of love. Such, too, is the nature of all
                    mental associations, that each part of which they are composed adds strength and
                    vividness to the other parts; so that, in the present instance, desire makes us
                    imagine virtues in the woman which her countenance perhaps does not indicate,
                    and the virtues which are there actually visible make us apprehend her beauty as
                    more perfect than it is.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Love,</hi> in <hi rend="italic">Medicine.</hi> The symptoms
                    produced by this passion as a disease, according to medical writers, are
                    various. The eyelids often twinkle; the eyes are hollow, and yet appear as if
                    full with pleasure; the pulse is not peculiar to the passion, but the same with
                    that which attends solicitude and care. When the object of this affection is
                    thought of, particularly if the id¾a be sudden, the spirits are confused, the
                    pulse changes, and its force and time are very variable. In some instances, the
                    person is sad and watchful; in others, the person, not being conscious of his
                    state, pines away, is slothful, and regardless of food; though the wiser, when
                    they find themselves in love, seek pleasant company and active entertainments.
                    As the force of love prevails, sighs grow deeper; a tremor affects the heart and
                    pulse; the countenance is alternately pale and red; the voice is suppressed in
                    the fauces; the eyes grow dim; cold sweats break out; sleep absents itself, at
                    least until the morning; the secretions become disturbed; and a loss of
                    appetite, a hectic fever, melancholy, or perhaps madness, if not death,
                    constitutes the catastrophe. (On this subject the curious may consult Aegineta,
                    lib. iii. 17; Oribat. <hi rend="italic">Synon.</hi> lib. viii. cap. 9; ora
                    treatise on Love as a distemper, by John Ferrard, Oxford, 1640.)</p>
                <p>The manners of the Greeks and Romans were similar to each other in the affairs of
                    love. They generally made a discovery of their passion by writing upon trees,
                    walls, doors, and other places, the name of their beloved. They usually decked
                    the door of their dulcinea with flowers and garlands, and made libations of wine
                    before their houses, sprinkling the posts with the same liquor, as if the object
                    of their affection was a real goddess. For a man’s garland to be untied, and for
                    a woman to compose a garland, were held to be indubitable indications of
                    love.</p>
                <p>When their love was without success, they used several arts to excite affection
                    in the object of their desire. They had recourse to enchantresses, of whom the
                    Thessalian were in the highest estimation. The means made use of were most
                    commonly philtres or love potions, the operation of which was violent and
                    dangerous, and frequently deprived such as drank them of their reason. Some of
                    the most remarkable ingredients of which they were composed were the hippomanes,
                    the jynx, insects bred from putrefaction, the fish remora, the lizard, the
                    brains of a calf, the hairs on the tip of a wolf’s tail, his secret parts, the
                    bones of the left side of a toad eaten with ants, the blood of doves, the bones
                    of snakes, feathers of screech-owls, twisted cords of wool in which a person had
                    hanged himself, rags, torches, reliques, a nest of swallows buried and famished
                    in the earth, bones snatched from hungry bitches, the marrow of a boy famished
                    in the midst of plenty, dried human liver; to which may be added several herbs
                    growing out of putrid substances. Such were the ingredients that entered into
                    the composition of that infernal draught called a love potion.</p>
                <p>But, besides the philtres, various other arts were used to excite love; in which
                    the application of certain substances was to have a magical influence on the
                    person against whom they levelled their skill. A hyena’s udder worn under the
                    left arm, they fancied would draw the affections of whatever woman they fixed
                    their eyes upon. That species of olives called <hi rend="italic">μιτυξα,</hi>
                    and barley-bran made into a paste, and thrown into the fire, they thought would
                    excite the passion of love. Flour was used with the same intention; and burning
                    laurel, and melted wax, were supposed to have a similar effect. When one heart
                    was to be hardened and another mollified, clay and wax were exposed to the fire
                    together. Images of wax were frequently used, representing the persons on whom
                    they wished to <pb break="no" facs="nls:193208950" xml:id="kp-eb0713-8950-0579"
                    />make an impression; and whatever was done to the substitute of wax, they
                    imagined was felt by the person represented. Enchanted medicaments were often
                    sprinkled upon some part of the house where the person resided. Love-pledges
                    were supposed to be of singular use and efficacy; these they placed under the
                    threshold, to preserve the affections of the owner from wandering. Love-knots
                    were also of singular power, and the number three was particularly observed in
                    all they did. But no good effect was expected if the use of these things had not
                    been attended with charms or magical verses and forms of words.</p>
                <p>Having mentioned their arts of exciting love, it may not be amiss to take notice
                    that the ancients imagined that love excited by magic might be allayed by more
                    powerful spells and medicaments, or by application to demons more powerful than
                    those who had been concerned in raising that passion. But love inspired without
                    magic had no sure; Apollo himself could find no remedy, but exclaimed, “Hei mihi
                    quod nullis amor est medicabilis herbis.” The antidotes against love were
                    generally, <hi rend="italic">agnus castus,</hi> which ιas the power of weakening
                    the generative faculty; sprinkling the dust in which a mule had rolled herself;
                    tying toads in the hide of a beast newly slain; applying amulets of minerals or
                    herbs, which were supposed of great efficacy in other cases; and invoking the
                    assistance of the nferior deities. Another cure for love was bathing in the
                    waters of the river Selemnus; to which we may add, the lover’s leap, or jumping
                    down from the Leucadian promontory.</p>
