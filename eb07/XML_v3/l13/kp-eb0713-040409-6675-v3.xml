                    description; but an explanation of the principles on which its security depends
                    will probably be new and interesting.</p>

                <p>The most essential portion of a lock is a bolt which can be thrown out or
                    withdrawn only by its proper key; and the best lock is that which most perfectly
                    prevents any other instrument from effecting this purpose.</p>
                <p>There arc two distinct modes by which this excellence has been sought; and a
                    clear understanding of their principles and differences will greatly promote a
                    due appreciation of the many ingenious contrivances to which the pursuit of this
                    object has given rise.</p>
                <p>The first mode consists in the insertion of fixed obstacles, called <hi
                    rend="italic">ιoards,</hi> to the entrance of other instruments than the proper
                    key. They are placed between the keyhole and the bolt; and in good locks they
                    are made numerous and intricate, for the double purpose of preventing access to
                    the bolt, and of varying the patterns of the <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> &lt;
                    <hi rend="superscript"> e</hi> ys∙</p>
                <p>The second mode consists in the insertion of obstacles to the motion of the bolt;
                    not fixed, therefore, like the <hi rend="italic">wards,</hi> but moveable, by
                    means of the proper key <hi rend="superscript"> 7</hi>, into positions which
                    give freedom to the bolt. They are frequently called <hi rend="italic"
                    >tumblers</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and we shall here apply that very
                    expressive term to all moveable impediments to the retraction of the bolt,
                    retaining the equally appropriate designation of <hi rend="italic">wards</hi> to
                    describe the fixed impediments to the introduction of surreptitious
                    instruments.</p>
                <p>These two means of protection, namely, wards and tumblers, may be applied
                    separately or combined.</p>
                <p>Till the middle of the last century, the locks used in Europe depended
                    principally on the number and intricacy of their wards. But very little skill
                    was exhibited even in this respect, though a great deal of misplaced labour and
                    ingenuity was sometimes expended in fanciful decorations.</p>
                <p>One very serious objection to the use of wards alone is, that they do not require
                    to have exact counterparts in the key. It is true that the proper key is usually
                    cut in perfect correspondence with the wards in the lock, but such accuracy is
                    not indispensable, as the diagram figures 1 and 2 in Plate CCCXXIV. will render
                    evident.</p>
                <p>Let figure 1 represent the <hi rend="italic">bit</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >wet</hi> of a key curiously cut. The essential parts of such a key are the pipe
                    <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> which fits on to the pin of the lock, and the
                    extremity <hi rend="italic">be,</hi> which acts against the bolt. The
                    intermediate portions are required merely to connect these two; the greater
                    portion of the metal is therefore superfluous, and might clearly be removed, as
                    shown in figure 2, which retains all that is wanted for connection and strength.
                    But this facility of fabrication from an impression of the key is not the only
                    evil. There is the chance that out of many variously formed skeletons, one will
                    be found to pass almost any lock guarded by wards alone; to which may be added,
                    the fact that an impression of almost any fixed wards may be obtained by
                    introducing into the lock a blank key of proper size, having its bit covered
                    with wax or tallow.</p>
                <p>Whilst we are on the subject of keys, it may be noticed that some, instead of the
                    small piercings, such as are shown in figures 1 and 3, have considerable
                    portions of the bit cut away, more nearly resembling figure 2. In the former
                    cases the wards are formed of thin iron plate; in the latter, of solid brass,
                    and hence such locks are called solid warded. This peculiarity, however, adds
                    nothing to the difficulty of picking, or of making false keys. 'The best sort of
                    wards are those which intertwine from opposite sides of the bit, as in figure 3,
                    which, it is obvious, would require to be more nearly imitated than the more
                    numerous cuttings of figure 1. The bits of keys, as viewed end-ways, are
                    variously shaped; the ordinary form is figure 4; figure 5 is called a taper bit,
                    and figure 6 an S-shaped bit. No effect besides variety of pattern is obtained
                    from these devices.</p>
                <p>In reference to the operation called picking, the number and variety of the wards
                    afford no security whatever.</p>
                <p>There must always be a clear passage in the lock for the revolution of the
                    portion <hi rend="italic">be</hi> of the key, and through this passage the
                    pick-lock introduces his <hi rend="italic">pick,</hi> which is made semicircular
                    for the purpose of passing round the exterior circle of the wards.</p>
                <p>Locks destitute of tumblers may be generally recognized by a smart snapping noise
                    in the act of locking, which arises from the pressure of a spring formed in the
                    back of the bolt, and from which they are called back-spring locks. Figure 7
                    shows one of these locks, in which <hi rend="italic">a, a</hi> are two notches
                    on the underside of the bolt, connected by a curved part ∙. <hi rend="italic"
                    >b</hi> is the back-spring, which is here compressed by the passage of the curve
                    through a limited aperture in the rim <hi rend="italic">cc</hi> of the lock. The
                    bolt is in the state called half-shot; when it is wholly shot, or wholly
                    withdrawn, the notches <hi rend="italic">a, a</hi> rest upon the rim <hi
                    rend="italic">cc,</hi> and the force with which they fall into this position,
                    urged by the spring <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> gives rise to the noise before
                    mentioned. The back-spring lock is further objectionable from the facility with
                    which the bolt may be forced back by any pressure applied to its end; an
                    application which, on wooden doors and furniture, it is frequently possible to
                    make.</p>
                <p>The first improvement on the lock guarded by wards consisted in the addition of a
                    single tumbler, as seen in figure 8. The bolt is here also supposed to be half
                    shot, and it has two notches on its upper edge, which receive the stud <hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi> of the tumbler respectively, when the bolt is at one or
                    other end of its course. The tumbler turns on a pin at its other extremity; it
                    is forced downwards by a spring, and it is wide enough, lying behind the bolt,
                    as shown by the dotted lines, to be elevated by the bit of the key.</p>
                <p>This construction, in addition to a more or less perfect box of wards, forms what
                    is called the common-tumbler lock, and which, though better than the back-spring
                    lock, is easily picked, for this reason, that the tumbler merely requires to be
                    lifted sufficiently high; if it be raised more than is necessary, the bolt is
                    equally set free. An expert smith therefore finds little difficulty in throwing
                    out the tumbler, and at the same time moving the bolt.</p>
                <p>In this state the art of lock-making remained, when, in the year 1778, Mr Barron
                    obtained his patent for what may be called the first scientific attempt to
                    improve this very important instrument. Mr Barron increased the number of
                    tumblers to two or more, and he so applied them, that mere elevation was no
                    longer sufficient to release the bolt; they required a precise degree of
                    elevation, neither more nor less, and each tumbler a peculiar quantity. Figure 9
                    will explain this ingenious and effectual change; the tumblers are shown by
                    dotted lines behind the bolt, which latter has in its middle a groove or slit,
                    notched on both edges, through which are seen projecting the studs of the
                    tumblers. The bolt, as in the former cases, is supposed to be half shot; but it
                    will be easily perceived, that if the studs of the tumblers rested in the lower
                    notches, they would require to be elevated to the level of the groove before the
                    bolt could be moved; and it is equally clear, that if lifted too high, they
                    would be engaged in the upper notches, and would equally detain the bolt. The
                    tumblers were made unequally wide, and demanded therefore similar inequalities
                    in the bit of the key, which was stepped or notched, as shown in figure 3. The
                    relative positions of the bolt and tumblers are seen in the section of the lock,
                    figure 10. It must, however, be understood, that this and the former figures arc
                    not portraits of locks, but rather diagrams, to explain the theory of their
                    action.</p>
                <p>Barron’s lock, when well made, with two or three tumblers, and a good box of
                    wards, is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to pick; for the wards, which
                    are useless as preventives to the operation of throwing up a single tumbler,
                    greatly impede so delicate a proceeding as the eleva <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193206701" xml:id="kp-eb0713-6701-0406"/>tion of two or more to a
                    precise height; and this required ' delicacy of manipulation has formed the
                    basis of all the subsequent attempts at improvement.</p>
                <p>The first of these in time and ingenuity is that of Mr Bramah, who procured his
                    patent in 1784, but afterwards very materially modified his invention. Mr
                    Bramah’s lock, though presenting little that is novel in principle, is
                    singularly ingenious and compact in its arrangement; and it has the advantage of
                    being chiefly formed in the lathe, by which means the most perfect accuracy of
                    form is made compatible with very moderate cost.</p>
                <p>Mr Bramah rejected entirely the use of fixed wards, employing only moveable
                    guards, which we shall call tumblers, because they are analogous to the parts so
                    named in Barron’s and other locks. Of these he introduced never less than four,
                    and, frequently six or eight. Having no wards, he required no large bit on which
                    to cut their counterparts; and thus he effected the double purpose of giving
                    great portability to the key, and of so reducing the size of the key-hole as in
                    some measure to compensate for the absence of wards as checks to any fraudulent
                    attempts upon the tumblers.</p>
                <p>The general features of this lock will be best understood from an examination of
                    figures 11 to 16. It may be described as consisting of two brass barrels, the
                    outer one, <hi rend="italic">aaaa,</hi> being screwed to the plate or body of
                    the lock, which is, however, not shown, and the inner one, <hi rend="italic"
                    >ccccc,</hi> revolving within it. The inner barrel is shown detached in figures
                    14 and 15: it has a pin or stud <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> which moves the bolt
                    in the act of locking or unlocking, performing therefore the office of the bit
                    of the ordinary key. The security of this lock depends, then, on certain
                    contrivances, which prevent the revolution of this inner barrel, except on the
                    application of its proper key. For this purpose, it has an external circular
                    groove penetrating to the depth shown by the dotted circle in its section,
                    figure 15; and it has four internal longitudinal grooves, as seen also in figure
                    15, but here seen occupied by what are in fact double pieces of steel-spring,
                    formed like figure 16. These pieces of steel are the moveable guards or
                    tumblers; and they prevent, except under certain circumstances, the revolution
                    of the inner barrel. To do this, a thin plate of steel, called the
                    locking-plate, <hi rend="italic">d d,</hi> figures 11, 12, and 13, is screwed in
                    two portions to the outer barrel, and at the same time occupies the external
                    circular groove of the inner barrel, having four notches to receive the edges of
                    the tumblers, figure 16, which lie in the internal longitudinal grooves. It will
                    be seen now that the inner barrel is locked to the outer, because the tumblers
                    of the inner barrel are detained in the notches of the locking-plate <hi
                    rend="italic">d d,</hi> which is screwed to the outer barrel. If, however, the
                    tumblers be also notched as much as the locking-plate projects into their
                    grooves, and if these notches be brought into the plane of the locking-plate, it
                    is obvious that the barrel would then revolve, and the notches so formed would
                    traverse the projection of the locking-plate into the longitudinal grooves. Such
                    a notch is therefore formed in each tumbler; they are represented by the deepest
                    of the three notches shewn in the several figures, and are at various distances
                    from the end of the tumbler. The smaller notches need not be alluded to at
                    present. The tumblers have a projection at one end, by which they are pressed
                    upwards by means of the spiral spring shown in figures 11 and 12. In the former
                    figure, the tumblers occupy their usual position in the lock; in the latter they
                    are unequally depressed by the unequal slits in the pipe of the key, so that
                    their deep notches are now in the plane of the locking-plate, and the inner
                    barrel is free to revolve. As the tumblers are unequally depressed, it is clear
                    that only one of them (the lowest) can be supported by the spiral spring; the
                    other three would therefore be left unsupported, but that they have sufficient
                    friction in their grooves to retain them where they are placed, for the purposes
                    of locking and unlocking. This friction is given by bending outwards the
                    spring-plate of which they are made, as in figure 16; but it is not sufficient
                    to prevent the spiral spring from elevating them all to the same level as soon
                    as the key is withdrawn.</p>
                <p>Such was Bramah’s lock, as it first came extensively into use, and as it
                    continued for many years, employed for the most important purposes, and by the
                    most distinguished persons. At length an advertisement appeared in the public
                    papers, requesting those who had lost keys of Bramah’s locks, not, as had
                    hitherto been done, to break open their doors or drawers, but to apply to the
                    advertiser, who would undertake to save this destructive process by picking. And
                    it appeared that an individual of great dexterity could perform this operation
                    almost with certainty.</p>
                <p>The effect of this discovery on the demand for the locks may easily be imagined;
                    but the effect it had in stimulating ingenuity to provide a remedy, is one of
                    the best illustrations of the proverb, that necessity is the mother of
                    invention. Within a few days or weeks, Mr Russell, who was at that time employed
                    in Mr Bramah’s establishment, devised an alteration which at once, and without
                    any expense, entirely overcame the difficulty, and converted the lock into one
                    of perfect security. This contrivance is the most simple and extraordinary that
                    ever effected so important an object; but before we describe it, we will
                    endeavour to explain what has been called the <hi rend="italic">tentative</hi>
                    process of lock-picking, and which had been so successfully applied to Bramah’s
                    locks. To do this, we will refer to the diagram, figure 17, in which <hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi> represents a bolt fitting loosely an outer case, and
                    tending to move in the direction of the arrow. It is, however, prevented by
                    three studs, which are moveable upwards and downwards by their knobs, 1, 2, and
                    3; but it would be free to move if these studs were elevated or depressed to
                    correspond with the notches made in the end of the bolt. Now, if the case were
                    closed, it would be perfectly easy to place these studs in the requisite
                    position by the following process: Apply a pressure to the bolt, which can be
                    done in any lock, tending to move it for unlocking. This will of course be
                    resisted by the studs 1, 2, 3, but not by all equally; it will in fact be
                    resisted by only one of them; the necessary imperfections of all workmanship
                    would prevent more than one at a time from coming into sensible contact with the
                    bolt. Having therefore applied pressure to the bolt with one hand, with the
                    other the operator would ascertain which of the studs was most bound by the
                    pressure. This would be easily done, and then he would move the stud gently up
                    and down till he felt it catch in the notch to which it belonged. The bolt would
                    move till the next most prominent stud received it, which would be tracked to
                    its notch in the same manner, and so on till all were disposed of.</p>
                <p>By a similar process the picking of Bramah’s lock was effected. A tendency to
                    revolve was given with some force to the barrel; then, by means of a pair of
                    small forceps, the several tumblers were tried, and it was ascertained which was
                    most detained by the pressure against the locking-plate. That which offered most
                    resistance was gradually depressed till its notch was felt to hang itself upon
                    the locking-plate, and so on till the whole were depressed in succession,
                    exactly as they would have been depressed simultaneously by the key.</p>
                <p>Returning to figure 17, it will be easily understood, that if, in addition to the
                    three principal notches, a number of shallower notches, as indicated by dots, be
                    made, equal however in depth to any possible inequality in the projection of the
                    studs, the process we have described is entirely prevented, because it will be
                    perfectly impossible for the picker to tell whether he has brought the stud to
                    one <pb break="no" facs="nls:193206714" xml:id="kp-eb0713-6714-0407"/>of the
                    deep notches, or to one of the shallow or false notches; and he will of
                    consequence be entirely baffled.</p>
                <p>This was the happy suggestion to which we have alluded. This will explain the two
                    shallow or false notches which now appear in the edges of Bramah’s tumblers, and
                    which require corresponding false notches, or rather false widening in the
                    notches, of the locking-plate, as shown by the dots in figure 13.</p>
                <p>From this time the art of lock-making presents nothing very decidedly new, though
                    almost every year produces something which claims the public attention for a
                    time, and is forgotten. From this description must, however, be excepted the
                    lock of Mr Chubb, which has come into extensive use. It consists of Barron’s
                    tumblers, more or less numerous in proportion to the price, with few or no fixed
                    wards, and without the false notches, or any similar contrivance. But it has an
                    ingenious piece of mechanism called a <hi rend="italic">detector,</hi>
                    consisting of a lever, which, if any undue elevation be given to the tumblers,
                    catches into and detains the bolt, till, by a peculiar application of the proper
                    key, it is again released. Whether this detector be a more or less perfect guard
                    than the others we have described, and whether it be or be not an advantage to
                    learn that a false key has accidentally or designedly been introduced into a
                    lock, are questions which remain open to discussion. Certain, however, it is,
                    that by thus varying the construction of locks, we obtain the benefit of greater
                    variety in the keys, which would otherwise be so multiplied of similar makes, as
                    to neutralize in a great measure the benefits of the skill which has been
                    applied to the locks. On this point it may be mentioned, that Bramah’s keys, as
                    made by himself and by Mordan, are constructed by a beautiful tool, which
                    secures a constant change in the pattern, so that duplicates are not likely to
                    recur for a long series of years.</p>
                <p>Of the locks called “Combination Locks,” it will not be required to say much. The
                    common letter padlock is generally known; and, from the description here given
                    of other locks, it will be easily understood that the lettered rings of the
                    padlock are in fact tumblers, exposed to the operation of the hands, instead of
                    being subjected to the concealed application of a key. These locks are not
                    difficult to pick, though they might be made quite secure by the use of the
                    false notches. There is indeed no tumbler lock to which this most invaluable
                    idea might not be advantageously applied.</p>
                <p>We have reserved till now the notice of a very curious lock, which is said to
                    have been used for four thousand years in Egypt and Turkey, and which was first
                    made well known to Western Europe through the French invasion of Egypt at the
                    beginning of the present century, though it had been previously described by
                    Eton in his Survey of the Turkish Empire. It appears to be extensively, or
                    rather universally, employed for gates of towns and of houses, as well as for
                    the smallest articles of furniture. The evidence of its alleged antiquity is
                    derived, according to Μ. Denon (in whose magnificent work on Egypt it was
                    published), from the circumstance of finding one sculptured amongst the
                    bas-reliefs which decorate the great temple at Karnak, from which also it was
                    ascertained that during forty centuries the lock had undergone no sensible
                    change.</p>
                <p>However this may be, its construction is singular and interesting, and
                    particularly so because it makes exclusive use of <hi rend="italic"
                    >tumblers,</hi> which, it will have been seen, were the last means of security
                    adopted in this country. It will be understood by an examination of figures 18
                    to 21. In figures 18 and 19, <hi rend="italic">aa</hi> is the case screwed to
                    the door, and <hi rend="italic">bb</hi> is the bolt. In the case, above the
                    bolt, are a number of small cells containing headed pins, arranged in any form
                    chosen by the maker. The top of the bolt has a number of holes similarly
                    arranged, so that when brought into the right position, the ends of the headed
                    pins may drop into the corresponding holes in the bolt. In this state the bolt
                    is fastened. In order to unlock it, a large hollow or cavity is made at the
                    exposed end of the bolt, which extends under the holes occupied by the pins. The
                    key consists of a piece of wood, figs. 20 and 21, having pins arranged like
                    those in the lock, and as long as the thickness of the bolt above the cavity.
                    When therefore the key is introduced and pressed upwards, its pins exactly fill
                    the holes in the bolt, and of course dislodge those which had fallen from the
                    upper part of the case. The bolt may in consequence be withdrawn, as in fig. 19,
                    leaving the headed pins elevated in their cells, instead of occupying the
                    position shown by the dotted lines in fig. 18. It should be observed, that in
                    fig. 19 the key is shown in its place, diminishing therefore the apparent size
                    of the cavity in the bolt, which of course must be high enough to receive the
                    key and its pins before the latter are lifted into the holes.</p>
                <p>The attention excited by this lock when it was first made generally known caused
                    its merits to be greatly overrated. Μ. Denon described it as no less secure than
                    any other lock, and fit to be applied on all rural occasions. There would,
                    however, be little difficulty in picking it, or in obtaining a wax impression of
                    the holes; and there is an obvious awkwardness in the mode of using the key as
                    compared with those revolving round fixed centres, which quite disqualifies it
                    for superseding the modern lock. In other respects, it admits of considerable
                    variety in the number, arrangement, and length of the pins; and by grooves in
                    the top of the bolt they might be varied in the same lock. By a slight
                    modification, also, it might have the benefit of Barron’s invention, and require
                    a precise degree of elevation. In fact, it has this principle to some extent;
                    for if the pins be raised too much, whatever raises them will hold the bolt by
                    entering into the upper cells.</p>
                <p>Numberless contrivances for the improvement of locks, and some of great merit and
                    ingenuity, will be found in the Repertory of Patent and other Inventions, in the
                    Transactions of the Society of Arts, and in other scientific journals. Many of
                    these will be found more curious than useful; such, for instance, as the locks
                    which ring bells or discharge fire-arms when an attempt is improperly made to
                    open them. Such, also, are the propositions to enlist magnetism into the service
                    of lock-making, by employing polarized tumblers, and magnetic keys to act upon
                    them, through the agency of magnetic attractions and repulsions, instead of the
                    vulgar modes of pulling and pushing; and such are the locks made to open only by
                    a peculiar sleight of hand, as if it were possible to preserve such tricks from
                    the knowledge of those who are interested in acquiring them. A more useful class
                    of inventions are the shifting or combination keys, whose parts may be kept by
                    the owner in such a state of derangement as to require the knowledge of a
                    certain cipher or motto in order to use them.</p>
                <p>The theory of what have been called master keys, which figure more perhaps in
                    romances than in the real world, will be understood by considering figures 1 and
                    2 of the engraving. It is clear that a great variety of locks might be made,
                    with keys somewhat resembling figure 1; differing, however, sufficiently to be
                    opened only by their respective keys, yet all of them adapted to the skeleton,
                    or, in this case, the <hi rend="italic">master key,</hi> figure 2. In this
                    respect, the greatest facilities are presented by Bramah’s arrangement. Any
                    number of these locks, of the same size, and having the same quantity of
                    tumblers, may be made to open by one key, though each be proof against any other
                    of the series. For this purpose, nothing is required, but, after the completion
                    of the locks, to cut in each an additional set of notches adapted to the
                    intended master key, leaving the other notches to open it by the application of
                    its peculiar key.</p>
