                <p><label type="entry">LARDNER, <hi rend="smallcaps">Nathaniel</hi></label>, an
                    eminent English dissenting divine, was born at Hawkhurst, in Kent, on the 6th of
                    June 1684. After receiving a grammatical education, he was sent first to a
                    dissenting academy in London, which was under the care of the Rev. Dr Joshua
                    Oldfield; and thence, in his sixteenth year, he went to prosecute his studies at
                    Utrecht, under Professors d’Uries, Graevius, and Burmann. Here he remained above
                    three years, and then removed for a short time to Leyden. In 1703 he returned to
                    England, and at his father’s house employed himself in the most close and
                    diligent preparation for the sacred profession. But, notwithstanding his
                    qualifications, it was not till 1709 that he preached his first sermon, on the
                    authenticity and truth of the Christian revelation.</p>
                <p>A few years after this, Lardner was received into Lady Treby’s family as domestic
                    chaplain, and tutor to her son, and continued in this situation till her
                    ladyship’s death in 1721. This event threw him into some perplexity, having
                    preached to several congregations, during his residence with Lady Treby, without
                    obtaining the approbation or choice of any one. It has been said that it
                    reflects no honour upon the dissenters, that a man of such merit should so long
                    have been neglected. But the pulpit was not the place in which Mr Lardner was
                    calculated either to convey improvement or to acquire reputation. Dr Kippis
                    informs us, “that his mode of elocution was very unpleasant; that from his early
                    and extreme deafness he could have no such command of his voice as to give it a
                    due modulation; and that he greatly dropped his words.” It cannot, then, be
                    matter of surprise that he was not popular; nor can it be any reflection upon
                    the congregations to which he occasionally preached, that they did not choose a
                    man who, notwithstanding his great learning and eminent virtues, was so
                    deficient as a public speaker, that it was impossible to hear him with any
                    pleasure, and scarcely without pain.</p>
                <p>Though Mr Lardner had no church at which he officiated as minister, he was
                    engaged with some of his dissenting brethren in preaching a Tuesday evening
                    lecture at the Old Jewry. Acquainted probably with the direction of his studies,
                    they also appointed him to preach on the proof of the credibility of the gospel
                    history. This he discussed in two sermons; and prosecuting the subject which he
                    had taken up in these discourses, he, in February 1727, published, in two
                    volumes octavo, the first part of the Credibility of the Gospel History, or the
                    Facts occasionally mentioned in the New Testament, confirmed by Passages of
                    Ancient Authors who were contemporary with our Saviour or his Apostles, or lived
                    near their time. An appendix was subjoined, relating to the time of Herod’s
                    death.</p>
                <p>Thus Mr Lardner commenced author, and began his literary career with singular
                    reputation. “It is scarcely necessary to say,” observes Dr Kippis, “how well
                    this work was received by the learned world. Not only was it highly approved by
                    the Protestant dissenters, with whom the author was more immediately connected,
                    but by the clergy in general of the established church; and its reputation
                    gradually extended into foreign countries. It is indeed an invaluable
                    performance, and has rendered the most essential service to the cause of
                    Christianity. Whoever peruses this work will find it replete with admirable
                    instruction, sound learning, and just and candid criticism.” These two, with the
                    subsequent fifteen volumes octavo, and the four thin quartos entitled Jewish and
                    Heathen Testimonies, occupied him, with the interruption arising from some
                    smaller productions, during the space of forty-three years.</p>
                <p>Dr Kippis gives us a particular account of the time when each volume was
                    published, and of the subjects discussed in each. Speaking of the Supplement to
                    the Credibility, he says, “I cannot avoid strongly recommending this work to the
                    attention of all young divines. Indeed, I think that it ought to be read by
                    every theological student before he quits the university or academy in which he
                    is educated. There are three other works which will be found of eminent
                    advantage to those who are intended for, or beginning to engage in, the
                    Christian ministry. These are, Butler’s Analogy, Bishop Law’s Considerations on
                    the Theory of Religion, and Dr Taylor’s Key to the Apostolical Writings,
                    prefixed to his Paraphrase on the Epistle to the Romans. Without agreeing with
                    every circumstance advanced in these works, it may be said of them with the
                    greatest truth, that they tend to open and enlarge the mind; that they give
                    important views of the evidence, nature, and design of revelation; and that they
                    display a vein of reasoning and inquiry which may be extended to other objects
                    besides those immediately considered in the books themselves. It must not be
                    forgotten, that the Supplement to the Credibility has a place in the excellent
                    collection of treatises on divinity which have been published by Dr Watson,
                    bishop of Landaff. For a collection which cannot fail of being eminently
                    conducive to the instruction and improvement of younger clergymen, and for the
                    noble, manly, and truly evangelical preface by which it is preceded, this great
                    prelate is entitled to the gratitude of the Christian world.” It may not be
                    improper to add, that the Supplement to the Credibility has been published
                    separately by the booksellers, under the title of the History of the Gospels and
                    Epistles.</p>
                <p>Applauded as Dr Lardner’s works were, he received little recompense for them.
                    Some of the latter volumes of the Credibility were published at a loss; and at
                    last he sold the copyright and all the remaining printed copies to the
                    booksellers, for the trifling sum of L.150. His object, however, was not private
                    emolument, but to serve the interests of truth and virtue; and it pleased divine
                    providence to spare his life, both to complete his extensive plan, and to see
                    the last volume, the fourth of the Testimonies, published. This was in 1767. But
                    he was seized with a decline in the following summer, and carried off in a few
                    days, at Hawkhurst, the place of his nativity, where he had a small paternal
                    estate. He died in the eighty-fifth year of his age.</p>
