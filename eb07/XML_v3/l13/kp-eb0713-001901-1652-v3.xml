                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">LAHORE</label>, an extensive province of Hindustan, situated
                    between the thirtieth and thirty-fourth degrees of north latitude. It has been
                    estimated at 340 miles in length by 200 in average breadth. It is bounded on the
                    north by Cashmere and the course of the Indus; on the south by Delhi, Ajmeer,
                    and Moultan; on the east by the mountains of Northern Hindustan; and on the west
                    it is separated from Afghanistan by the Indus. The principal geographical and
                    territorial subdivisions are the Punjab, comprehending other minor subdivisions,
                    and the Kohistan of Lahore. Into these two districts the country is nearly
                    equally divided. The Kohistan is the mountainous tract which occupies the whole
                    north-eastern division, and the Punjab is the flat country to the south-west, so
                    called from the five celebrated rivers by which it is intersected. The
                    mountainous district is not so fertile as the plains. On the sides, however, of
                    those mountains, which are inhabited, wheat, barley, and various other small
                    grains, are produced. There are spaces which project from the body of the hills,
                    in separate flats, in the form of semicircular stairs. Into those projections
                    the soil is propelled by the rains which fall in this quarter from June to
                    October, and the earth washed down is preserved in that state by buttresses of
                    stones. Rice is cultivated in the narrow valleys, but the inhabitants subsist
                    chiefly on wheat-bread and peas made into a thick soup. Pines and willow trees
                    grow on the face of the mountains. The resinous part of the fir is cut into
                    slips, and supplies the place of a lamp. The climate is not favourable to fruits
                    and vegetables. Fossil salt is found in many parts, and the mountainous tracts
                    are supposed to be rich in minerals.</p>
                <p>The flat country called the Punjab, or the country of the five rivers, is by far
                    the most productive, though its fertility has been too much extolled, having
                    been represented as the garden of India, which, under a good government, it
                    might have been, from its advantageous situation and its numerous rivers. But it
                    has been exposed to such various revolutions, and has been so much harassed by
                    the contests of the petty Sikh chiefs by whom it is possessed, that it has not
                    profited so much as might have been expected of its natural advantages; and
                    accordingly, except in the immediate vicinity of the rivers, no portion of it is
                    to be compared with the British provinces in Upper Hindustan, and still less
                    with Bengal. The agricultural productions of the Punjab are, in general, wheat,
                    barley, rice, pulse of all sorts, sugar-cane, tobacco, and various fruits. The
                    province of Lahore is watered by the Indus, the Sutlege or Hysudrus, the Beyah
                    or Hyphasis, the Ravey or Hydraotes, the Chinaub or Aeesincs, and the Jhylum or
                    Hydaspes. That part of the Punjab east of the Jhylum, and the nearest to that
                    river, which is flat, is chiefly pastured by herds of oxen and buffaloes; and
                    that most to the east towards the Sutlege, which is wavy, though the most
                    sterile in quality, is the best cultivated. East of the Jhylum there is not a
                    hill; the trees are few, and cultivation is extremely scanty. It contains,
                    however, many fine villages, and some large towns. But the latter, with the
                    exception of Amritsir, the holy city of the Sikhs, are mostly tending to
                    decay.</p>
                <p>The commerce of this country was formerly much obstructed by the heavy duties
                    levied on all the goods as they passed through the different territories of the
                    petty Sikhs. It was in consequence carried to Hindustan Proper by the difficult
                    and mountainous route of Jamboe, Nadone, and Serinagur. The Sikh chiefs,
                    however, discovered their error, and many of these heavy and vexatious duties
                    have been reduced; and, by a more strict administration of justice, confidence
                    has been restored to the merchants. The exports from Lahore to the countries
                    west of the Indus are, sugar, rice, indigo, wheat, and white cotton cloths. The
                    imports from these countries are, swords, horses, fruit, lead, and spices. The
                    exports to Cashmere are nearly the same as to Persia; the imports being shawls,
                    a variety of cloths, saffron, and fruits. With Kohistan, the mountainous
                    division of Lahore, the inhabitants of the Punjab exchange cloth, matchlocks,
                    and horses, for iron and other smaller commodities. From the south arc imported
                    sulphur, indigo, salt, lead, iron, European coarse broad cloth, and spices. The
                    exports to the south arc, horses, camels, sugar, rice, white cloth, matchlocks,
                    swords, bows and arrows.</p>
                <p>Lahore contains a mixed population of Sikhs, Singhs, Jauts, Rajpoots, Hindus of
                    lower castes, and Mahommedans; the latter a poor, persecuted, despised race, and
                    not numerous. Few of their mosques have escaped destruction. The lower orders of
                    the Sikhs are protected from the tyranny and violence of their chiefs by the
                    precepts of their common religion, and by the privilege which they possess of
                    abandoning a leader whom they dislike, the distance of a few miles placing them
                    under the protection of his rival. In the Punjab it is reckoned that one third
                    of the inhabitants are Singhs or Sikhs. A considerable number of cultivators are
                    Jauts. The natives are composed of different classes, of Hindus. Amongst the
                    mountaineers the goitre or swelled throat is common. On the north-western
                    borders of Lahore the inhabitants are chiefly Afghans, who live in small forts
                    or walled villages, in mutual dread of each other. This quarter is exposed to
                    the depredations of the Sikhs on the Attock and on the adjacent districts. In
                    the Punjab, fakeers or religious devotees and mendicants are common, and are
                    frequently seen travelling about in a palanquin clad in silk, with a great
                    retinue of attendants on horse and foot. These are extremely proud, and in
                    general insolent and abusive to Europeans. The Singhs are active and robust, and
                    have in general the Hindu cast of countenance, somewhat altered by their long
                    beards. They are very courageous, and, under the influence of prejudice or
                    religion, are brave even to desperation. They are all horsemen, though they
                    serve as infantry in foreign armies; of a bold and rough address, speaking
                    invariably in a loud, bawling tone of voice.</p>
                <p>Sikh, or Siksha, is a Sanscrit word signifying disciple or devoted follower. The
                    founder of the sect was called Nanak, who was born at the village of Tulwundy,
                    in the district of Bhatti and province of Lahore, <hi rend="smallcaps">a.</hi>
                    D. 1419, and died at Kirthipoor Dehra, on the banks of the Ravey. He left two
                    sons, from whom are descended 1400 families, called Shahzadehs, who are greatly
                    respected, and live at Dera, in the Punjab. The descendants of this person ruled
                    amongst the Sikhs, who, during the succeeding centuries, gradually increased in
                    strength. Gooro Govind, who was expelled from Lahore during the reign of
                    Aurungzebc, and is supposed to have died in 1708, new-modelled the government of
                    the Sikhs, and converted them into a band of ferocious soldiers, changing their
                    name from Sikh to Singh, signifying a lion. This person is revered by the Sikhs
                    as the founder of their worldly greatness and political independence, as Gooroo
                    Nanak is of their religion. After the death of Aurungzebe, the Sikhs grew in
                    strength, and wasted the country. On the dissolution of the government which
                    took place at Lahore subsequent to Nadir Shah’s invasion of India, the power of
                    the Sikhs increased; and, during the first invasion of the Afghans in 1746, they
                    possessed themselves of a considerable portion of the country between the Ravey
                    and Jallinder. In 1762 and 1763 they were almost exterminated by Ahmed Shah
                    Abdalli and the Afghans; but by their undaunted resolution they still rose
                    superior to their misfortunes, and at last succeeded in acquiring and
                    consolidating their present territories. For many years prior <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193201665" xml:id="kp-eb0713-1665-0020"/>to the appearance of Runjeet
                    Singh, this whole country was distracted by the internal feuds that took place
                    between the different chiefs, every village being an object of dispute between
                    brothers and near relations. This powerful chieftain rose into political power
                    from small beginnings. So recently as the year 1805, when Lord Lake advanced
                    into the Punjab, he was contending for ascendency amongst merely rival chiefs.
                    But between this and the year 1812, he had brought almost the whole of the petty
                    princes in the Punjab under his authority, and was even encroaching to the
                    south-east, beyond the boundary of the Sutlege, when he was opposed by the
                    British, with whom, however, he showed not the least desire to contend. Being
                    sensible of his own inability to oppose the British power, he willingly agreed
                    to a treaty of alliance and friendship, by which the latter agreed to relinquish
                    all concern with the territories of the rajah to the north of the Sutlege; and
                    the rajah on his part agreed never to maintain, in the territories occupied by
                    him or his dependents to the south of that river, more troops than were
                    necessary to carry on the internal police of the country, and also to abstain
                    from encroaching on the chiefs to the south of that boundary. Runjeet Singh is
                    an ambitious chief, and he is extremely anxious to improve and increase the
                    warlike resources of his kingdom. His troops are manoeuvred according to the
                    European fashion; they are drilled by European officers, and make a formidable
                    appearance in the field. But they are still very far inferior to the British
                    troops in India in all military qualities; and the Sikh monarch is too wary to
                    risk his recently acquired power in such an unequal contest. He is perpetually
                    endeavouring to extend his territories towards the south and east. He has made
                    several attempts on the hilly country of Cashmere, which have all been
                    unsuccessful. We have no accurate estimate of the population of the Sikh
                    territories. It was the boast of these warlike tribes at one time that they
                    could bring 100,000 horsemen into the field; but at present so large a force
                    could not possibly be mustered among them.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Lahore,</hi> the capital of the above provincĕ, is situated
                    on the south side of the Ravey River, which is here about three hundred yards
                    wide. It is surrounded with lofty walls, decorated on the outside, but hastening
                    to ruin, as are most of the private buildings. It is still a place of
                    considerable size, with a good bazar; but it is not inhabited by wealthy people.
                    On account of the frequent sackings it has sustained, they have migrated for
                    safety to Amritsir. The palace was originally founded by Acbar, and enlarged by
                    his successors. Across the Ravey, at Shah Durra, about two miles north of
                    Lahore, stands the celebrated mausoleum of Jehangeer, within a wall of nearly
                    600 yards square. It is a magnificent building, sixty-six paces on each side,
                    and still in very good condition. To the southward of this, in the open plain,
                    is to be seen the tomb of Noor Jehan Begum, a building thirty-six paces square.
                    In 1812 Runjeet Singh was building a very thick wall and rampart round the city,
                    with a deep, broad ditch. The palace has also been surrounded by a deep and
                    broad ditch, the whole faced with brick, and the earth thrown inwards, so as to
                    form a broad rampart, with bastions at intervals. The city is verging to decay;
                    yet the domes and minarets of the mosques, the lofty walls of the fort, the
                    splendid mausoleum of Jehangeer, and the numberless inferior tombs and temples
                    that surround the town, still render it an object of curiosity and admiration.
                    Lahore was taken by Sultan Baber, <hi rend="smallcaps">a. d.</hi> 1520, and was
                    for some time the seat of the Mogul government. Since that period it has
                    undergone many revolutions, and was for a considerable time possessed by the
                    Abdalli Afghans of Cabul, by whom it is named Sikrei. For the last thirty years
                    it has been under the domination of the Sikhs, and has latterly been the
                    headquarters of Rajah Runjeet Singh, the powerful chieftain of that predatory
                    people. The travelling distance from Delhi is 380 miles, from Lucknow 639, from
                    Bombay 1070, and from Calcutta 1356 miles. Long. 74. 3. E. Lat. 31. 36. N.</p>
