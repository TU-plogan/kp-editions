                <p><label type="entry">LUTHER, <hi rend="smallcaps">Martin</hi></label>, the famous
                    author of the Reformation, was a native of Eisleben, in Saxony, and born in
                    1483. Though his parents were poor, he received a learned education, during the
                    progress of which, he gave many indications of uncommon vigour and acuteness of
                    genius. As his mind was naturally susceptiblç of serious impressions, and
                    somewhat tinctured with that religious melancholy which delights in the solitude
                    and devotion of a monastic life, he retired into a convent of Augustinian
                    friars, where he acquired great reputation, not only for piety, but also for
                    love of knowledge and unwearied application to <pb break="no"

                    retirement is said to have been, that he was once struck by lightning, whilst
                    his companion was killed by his side by the same flash. He had been taught the
                    scholastic philosophy which was in vogue in those pays, and had made
                    considerable progress in it; but happening to find a copy of the Bible which lay
                    neglected in die library of his monastery, he applied himself to the study of it
                    with an eagerness and assiduity which quite astonished the monks, and so much
                    increased his reputation br sanctity, that he was chosen professor, first of
                    philosophy, and afterwards of theology, at Wittemberg, on the Elbe, where
                    Frederick elector of Saxony had founded an miversity.</p>
                <p>Whilst Luther continued to enjoy the highest reputation br sanctity and learning,
                    Tetzel, a Dominican friar, came o Wittemberg in order to publish indulgences.
                    Luther ich eld his success with great concern; and having first <hi
                    rend="subscript"> ll</hi> nveighed against indulgences from the pulpit, he
                    afterwards published ninety-five theses, containing his sentiments on that
                    subject. These he proposed, not as points ally established, but as subjects of
                    inquiry and disputation. Ie appointed a day on which the learned were invited to
                    Impugn them either in person or by writing; and to the <hi rend="subscript">
                    l</hi> ∣∕hole he subjoined solemn protestations of his high respect or the
                    apostolic see, and of his implicit submission to its Authority. No opponent
                    appeared at the time fixed; but ⅜ιe theses spread over Germany with astonishing
                    rapidity, Ind were read with the greatest eagerness.</p>
                <p>I Though Luther met with no opposition for some little ’me after he began to
                    publish his new doctrines, it was not *∣mg before many zealous champions arose
                    to defend those pinions with which the wealth and power of the clergy jrere so
                    strictly connected. Their cause, however, was by no licans promoted by these
                    endeavours; for the people began I) call in question even the authority of the
                    canon law, and if the pope himself. The court of Rome at first despised i∣ιese
                    new doctrines and disputes; but at length the attention of the pope being
                    excited by the great success of the reformer, and the complaints of his
                    adversaries, Luther was, ∣∣ i the month of July 1518, summoned to appear at
                    Rome, i ithin sixty days, before the auditor of the chamber; and fi ne of his
                    adversaries, named Prierias, who had written Ii gainst him, was appointed to
                    examine his doctrines, and N &gt; decide concerning them. At the same time the
                    pope I rote to the elector of Saxony, beseeching him not to projet a man whose
                    heretical and profane tenets were so I locking to pious ears; and enjoined the
                    provincial of the ∣.ugustinians to check by his authority the rashness of an
                    ⅛τogant monk, which brought disgrace upon their order, H id gave offence and
                    disturbance to the whole church.</p>
                <p>I From these letters, and the appointment of his open ∣ιemy Prierias as his
                    judge, Luther easily foresaw what .1 ntence he might expect at Rome; and
                    therefore dis- ∣vered the utmost solicitude to have his cause tried in I ermany,
                    and before a less suspected tribunal. He wrote lsubmissive letter to the pope,
                    in which he promised an ∣lireserved obedience to his will, for as yet he
                    entertained to doubt of the divine origin of the papal authority; and ∣⅛ the
                    intercession of the other professors, Cajetan, the ∣&gt;pe’s legate in Germany,
                    was appointed to hear and de- <hi rend="superscript"> l</hi> irmine the cause.
                    Luther appeared before him without Imitation; but Cajetan thought it below his
                    dignity to dis- ∣hte the point with a person so much his inferior in rank, bd
                    therefore required him, by virtue of the apostolic powers With which he was
                    invested, to retract the errors which he ½d uttered with regard to indulgences
                    and the nature of ⅛th, and to abstain for the future from the publication of
                    ¢wand dangerous opinions, at the same time forbidding lini to appear in his
                    presence, unless he proposed to com-by with what had been required of him.</p>
                <p>√ ’ This haughty and summary manner of proceeding, together with some other
                    circumstances, gave Luther’s friends strong reason to suspect that even the
                    imperial safe-conduct would not be sufficient to protect him from the legate’s
                    power and resentment; and they prevailed on him secretly to withdraw from
                    Augsburg, where he had attended the legate, and to return to his own country.
                    But before his departure, he prepared, according to a form of which there had
                    been some examples, a solemn appeal from the pope ill informed concerning his
                    cause, to the pope when he should receive more full information with respect to
                    it. Cajetan, enraged at Luther’s abrupt retreat, and at the publication of his
                    appeal, wrote to the elector of Saxony, complaining of both, and requiring him,
                    as he regarded the peace of the church, or the authority of its head, either to
                    send the seditious monk as a prisoner to Rome, or to banish him out of his
                    territories. The elector had hitherto, from political motives, protected Luther,
                    thinking he might be useful in checking the enormous power of the see of Rome;
                    and though all Germany resounded with his fame, the elector had never yet
                    admitted him into his presence. But upon this demand being made by the cardinal,
                    it became necessary to throw off somewhat of his former reserve. He had been at
                    great expense, and bestowed much attention, on founding a new university, an
                    object of considerable importance to every German prince; and foreseeing how
                    fatal a blow the removal of Luther would be to its reputation, he not only
                    declined complying with either of the pope’s requests, but openly discovered
                    great concern for Luther’s personal safety.</p>
                <p>In the mean time, the situation of the reformer became daily more and more
                    embarrassing. He knew very well what were the motives which induced the elector
                    to afford him protection, and that he could by no means depend upon a
                    continuance of his friendship. If he should be obliged to quit Saxony, he had no
                    other asylum, and would stand exposed to whatever punishment the rage or bigotry
                    of his enemies could inflict; and so ready were his adversaries to condemn him,
                    that he had been declared a heretic at Rome before the expiration of the sixty
                    days allowed him in the citation for making his appearance. Notwithstanding all
                    this, however, he discovered no symptoms of timidity or remissness, but
                    continued to vindicate his own conduct and opinions, and to inveigh against
                    those of his adversaries with greater vehemence than ever. Being convinced,
                    therefore, that the pope would soon proceed to the most violent measures against
                    him, he appealed to a general council, which he affirmed to be the
                    representative of the Catholic church, and superior in power to the pope, who,
                    being a fallible man, might err, as St Peter, the most perfect of his
                    predecessors, had done.</p>
                <p>The court of Rome were in the mean time equally assiduous to crush the author of
                    these new doctrines, which gave them so much uneasiness. A bull was issued by
                    the pope, of a date prior to Luther’s appeal, in which he magnified the virtues
                    of indulgences, and subjected to the heaviest ecclesiastical censures all who
                    presumed to teach a contrary doctrine. Such a clear decision of the sovereign
                    pontiff against him might have been fatal to the cause of Luther, had not the
                    death of the Emperor Maximilian, which happened on the 17th of January 1519,
                    contributed to give matters a different turn. Both the principles and interest
                    of Maximilian had prompted him to support the authority of the see of Rome; but,
                    in consequence of his death, the vicariate of that part of Germany which is
                    governed by the Saxon laws devolved to the elector of Saxony; and, under the
                    shelter of his friendly administration, Luther himself erf-joyed
                    tranquillity,and his opinions took such root in different places, that they
                    could never afterwards be eradicated. At the same time, as the election of an
                    emperor was a point more interesting to the pope, Leo X., than a theological
                    controversy which he did not understand, and of which he <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193209197" xml:id="kp-eb0713-9197-0598"/>could not foresee the
                    consequences, he was so extremely *’ solicitous not to irritate a prince of such
                    considerable influence in the electoral college as Frederick, that he discovered
                    a great unwillingness to pronounce the sentence of excommunication against
                    Luther, which his adversaries continually demanded with the most clamorous
                    importunity.</p>
                <p>From the reason just now <hi rend="subscript"> i</hi> assigned, and Leo’s natural
                    aversion to severe measures, a suspension of proceedings against Luther ensued
                    for eighteen months, though perpetual negociations were carried on during this
                    interval in-order to bring the matter to an amicable issue. The manner in which
                    these were conducted having given our reformer many opportunities of observing
                    the corruption of the court of Rome, its obstinacy in adhering to established
                    errors, and its indifference about truth, however clearly proposed or strongly
                    proved, he began, in 1520, to utter some doubts with regard to the divine origin
                    of the papal authority, which he publicly disputed with Eccius, one of his most
                    learned and formidable antagonists. The dispute was indecisive, both parties
                    claiming the victory; but it must have been very mortifying to the partizans of
                    the Catholic church to hear such an essential point of their doctrine publicly
                    attacked.</p>
                <p>The papal authority being once suspected, Luther proceeded to push on his
                    inquiries from one doctrine to another, until at last he began to attack the
                    firmest foundations on which the wealth and power of the church were
                    established. Leo then began to perceive that there were no hopes of reclaiming
                    such an incorrigible heretic, and therefore prepared to denounce against him the
                    sentence of excommunication. The college of cardinals was often assembled, in
                    order to prepare the sentence with due deliberation; and the ablest canonists
                    were consulted how it might be expressed with unexceptionable formality. At last
                    it was issued on the 15th of June 1520. Forty-one propositions, extracted out of
                    Luther’s works, were therein condemned as heretical, scandalous, and offensive
                    to pious ears; all persons were forbidden to read his writings, upon pain of
                    excommunication; such as had any of them in their custody were commanded to
                    commit them to the flames; he himself, if he did not, within sixty days,
                    publicly recant his errors, and burn his books, was pronounced an obstinate
                    heretic, excommunicated, and delivered to Satan for the destruction of the
                    flesh; and all secular princes were required, under pain of incurring the same
                    censure, to seize his person, that he might be punished as his crimes
                    deserved.</p>
                <p>Luther was not in the least disconcerted by this sentence, which he had for some
                    time expected. He renewed his appeal to a general council; he declared the pope
                    to be the antichrist, or man of sin, whose appearance is foretold in the New
                    Testament; he declaimed against his tyranny with greater vehemence than ever;
                    and at last, by way of retaliation, having assembled all the professors and
                    students in the university of Wittemberg, with great pomp, and in the presence
                    of a vast multitude of spectators, he cast the volumes of the canon law,
                    together with the bull of excommunication, into the flames. The manner in which
                    this action was justified gave still greater offence than the action itself.
                    Having collected from the canon laws some of the most extravagant propositions
                    with regard to the plenitude and omnipotence of the pope’s power, as well as the
                    subordination of all secular jurisdiction to his authority, he published these
                    with a commentary, pointing out the impiety of such tenets, and their evident
                    tendency to subvert all civil government.</p>
                <p>On the accession of Charles V. to the empire, Luther found himself in a very
                    critical situation. Charles, in order to secure the pope’s friendship, had
                    determined to treat him with great severity. His eagerness to gain this point
                    rendered him not averse to gratify the papal legates in</p>
                <p>Germany, who insisted, that, without any delay or formal deliberation, the diet
                    then sitting at Worms ought to condemn a man whom the pope had already
                    excommunicated as an incorrigible heretic. Such an abrupt manner of proceeding,
                    however, being deemed unprecedented and unjust by the members of the diet, they
                    made a point of Luther’s appearing in person, and declaring whether or not he
                    adhered to those opinions which had drawn upon him the censures of the church.
                    Not only the emperor, but all the princes through whose territories he had to
                    pass, granted him a safe-conduct; and Charles wrote to him at the same time,
                    requiring his immediate attendance on the diet, and renewing his promises of
                    protection from any injury or violence. Luther did not hesitate one moment about
                    yielding obedience, and set out for Worms, attended by the herald who had
                    brought the emperor’s letter and safe-conduct. Whilst on his journey, many of
                    his friends, whom the fate of Huss, under similar circumstances, and
                    notwithstanding the same security of an imperial safe-conduct, filled with
                    solicitude, earnestly advised and entreated him not to rush wantonly into the
                    midst of danger. But Luther, superior to such terrors, silenced them with this
                    reply; “I am lawfully called to appear in that city; and thither will I go in
                    the name of the Lord, though as many devils as there are tiles on the houses
                    were there combined against me.”</p>
                <p>The reception which he met with at Worms was such as might have been reckoned a
                    full reward of all his labours, if mere vanity and the love of applause had been
                    the principles by which he was influenced. Greater crowds assembled to behold
                    him than had appeared at the emperor’s public entry; his apartments were daily
                    filled with princes and personages of the highest rank; and he was treated with
                    an homage more sincere, as well as more flattering, than any which pre-eminence
                    in birth or condition can command. At his appearance before the diet, he behaved
                    with decency and firmness. He readily acknowledged an excess of acrimony and
                    vehemence in his controversial writings; but refused to retract his opinions
                    unless he were convinced of their falsehood, or to consent to their being tried
                    by any other rule than the word of God. When neither threats nor entreaties
                    could prevail on him to depart from this resolution, some of the ecclesiastics
                    proposed to imitate the example of the council of Constance, and, by punishing
                    the author of this pestilent heresy, who was now in their power, to deliver the
                    church at once from such an evil. But the members of the diet refused to expose
                    German integrity to fresh reproach by a second violation of public faith, and
                    Charles being no less unwilling to bring a stain upon the beginning of his
                    administration by such an ignominious action, Luther was permitted to depart in
                    safety. A few days after he had left the city, a severe edict was published in
                    the emperor’s name, and by authority of the diet, depriving him, as an obstinate
                    and excommunicated criminal, of all the privileges which he enjoyed as a subject
                    of the empire; forbidding any prince to harbour or protect him; and requiring
                    all to seize his person as soon as the term specified in his protection should
                    have expired.</p>
                <p>But this vigorous decree had no considerable effect; the execution of it being
                    prevented partly by the multiplicity of occupations which the commotions in
                    Spain, together with the wars in Italy and the Low Countries, created to the
                    emperor, and partly by a prudent precaution employed by the elector of Saxony,
                    Luther’s steady patron. As Luther, on his return from Worms, was passing near
                    Alten-strain, in Thuringia, a number of horsemen in masks rushed suddenly out of
                    a wood, where the elector had appointed them to lie in wait for him, and,
                    surrounding his company, carried him, after dismissing all his attendants, to
                    Wortburg, a strong castle not far distant. There the elector <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193209210" xml:id="kp-eb0713-9210-0599"/>otered him to be supplied
                    with every thing necessary or aleeable; but the place of his retreat was
                    carefully con-cfiled, until the fury of the storm which had been raised aj∙inst
                    him began to abate, upon a change in the political sÿem of Europe. In this
                    solitude, where he remained nine ∏ttiths, and which he frequently called his <hi
                    rend="italic">Patmos,</hi> he c&gt;jrted his usual vigour and industry in
                    defence of his “trines, or in confutation of his adversaries, publishing sβeral
                    treatises, which revived the spirit of his followers, wD had been astonished and
                    disheartened at the sudden diíppearance of their leader.</p>
                <p>Luther, weary at length of his retirement, re-appeared puιlicly at Wittemberg,
                    upon the 6th of March 1522. This hlid without the elector’s leave, but he
                    immediately wrote Frclerick a letter to prevent his taking it amiss. The edict
                    o≡harles V., severe as it was, had given little or no check tJLuther’s doctrine;
                    for the emperor had no sooner retried to Flanders than his edict was neglected,
                    and the nl doctrine seemed to spread even faster than before. InLuther’s
                    absence, Carolostadius had pushed on things fair than his leader; he had
                    attempted to abolish the use oígass, to remove images out of the churches, to
                    set aside aι⅛ular confession, invocation of saints, and the abstaining fr⅛
                    meats; he had allowed the monks to leave their mo- n⅛ries, to violate their
                    vows, and to marry; in a word, hc⅛ad quite changed the doctrine and discipline
                    of the clwch at Wittemberg; all which, though not against Luthes sentiments, was
                    yet blamed by him, as being rashly ar&gt;unseasonably done. Lutheranism was
                    still confined to G∣∙nany. It had not yet extended to France; and Henry V∣(. of
                    England passed the most rigorous acts to prevent it⅛om invading his realm. Nay,
                    he did something more. Tfshow his zeal for religion and the holy see, and
                    perhaps als to exhibit his skill in theological learning, he wrote a tr'etise on
                    the Seven Sacraments, against Luther’s book on ∣⅛ptivity of Babylon, which he
                    presented to Leo X.</p>
                <p>tober 1521. The pope received it very favourably, ras so well pleased with the
                    king of England, that mplimented him with the title of Defender of the . Luther,
                    however, paid no regard to his rank as a so-in, but answered him with great
                    sharpness, treating us person and performance in the most contemptuous er. Henry
                    complained of Luther’s rude usage of him princes of Saxony; and Fisher, bishop
                    of Rochester, d to his answer, in support of Henry’s treatise; but &gt;r the
                    king’s complaint, nor the bishop’s reply, was led with any visible effects.</p>
                <p>ther, though he had put a stop to the more direct and t proceedings of
                    Carolostadius, now made open war he pope and bishops; and, that he might induce
                    the î to despise their authority, he wrote one book against ipe’s bull, and
                    another against the order called the • of Bishops. The same year, 1522, he wrote
                    a letter, the 29th of July, to the assembly of the states of Bo- ⅛ in which he
                    assured them that he was labouring to ish their doctrine in Germany, and
                    exhorted them i return to the communion of the church of Rome; he same year he
                    also published a translation of the Testament in the German tongue, which was
                    aftercorrected by himself and Melancthon. This transhaving been several·times
                    printed, and having passed in⅛l≡ very body’s hands, Ferdinand, archduke of
                    Austria, the em⅛ror’s brother, issued a severe edict, to prevent the
                    fur-thrpublication of it; forbidding all the subjects of his impel d majesty to
                    have any copies of it, or of Luther’s other boils, in their possession. Some
                    other princes followed his cx⅜ρle, and Luther was so incensed that he wrote a
                    trea-tisfe'on the secular power, in which he accused them of tyikny and impiety.
                    The diet of the empire was held at N∣pmberg, about the end of the year, and to
                    it Adrian VI. se≡his brief, dated the 25th of November; for Leo X. had died upon
                    the 2d of December 1521, and Adrian had been elected pope upon the 9th of
                    January following. In this brief he observes, amongst other things, to the diet,
                    how he had heard with grief, that Martin Luther, after the sentence of Leo X.
                    which had been ordered to be executed by the edict of Worms, continued to teach
                    the same errors, and daily to publish books full of heresies; that it appeared
                    strange to him, that so large and so religious a nation could be seduced by a
                    wretched apostate friar; that nothing, however, could be more pernicious to
                    Christendom; and therefore he exhorted them to use their utmost endeavours to
                    make Luther, and the authors of these tumults, return to their duty, or, if they
                    refused and continued obstinate, to proceed against them according to the laws
                    of the empire, and the tenor of the last edict.</p>
                <p>The resolution of this diet was published in the form of an edict, upon the 6th
                    of March 1523; but it had no effect in checking the Lutherans, who still went on
                    with undiminished boldness and confidence. This year Luther wrote a great many
                    pieces, amongst which was one upon the dignity and office of the supreme
                    magistrate, which Frederick, elector of Saxony, is said to have been highly
                    pleased with. About the same time he sent a writing in the German language to
                    the Waldenses in Bohemia and Moravia, who had applied to him about worshipping
                    the body of Christ in the Eucharist. He also wrote another book, which he
                    dedicated to the senate and people of Prague, concerning the institution of
                    ministers of the church; and he drew up a form of saying mass. He wrote a piece
                    entitled An Example of Popish Doctrine and Divinity, which Dupin calls “a satire
                    against nuns, and those who profess a monastic life.” He also wrote against the
                    vows of virginity, in his preface to his commentary on 1 Corinthians, chap,
                    viii.; and his exhortations were, it seems, followed with effects, for soon
                    afterwards, nine nuns, amongst whom was Catharine de Bore, eloped from the
                    nunnery at Nimptschen, and were brought, by the assistance of Leonard Coppen, a
                    burgess of Torgau, to Wittemberg. Whatever offence this proceeding mightgive to
                    the Catholics, it was highly extolled by Luther, who, in a book written in the
                    German language, compares the deliverance of these nuns from the slavery of a
                    monastic life, to that of the souls which Jesus Christ had delivered by his
                    death. This year Luther had occasion to canonize two of his followers, who, as
                    Melchior Adam relates, were burned at Brussels in the beginning of July, and
                    were the first who suffered martyrdom for his doctrine. He likewise wrote a
                    consolatory epistle to three noble ladies at Misnia, who had been banished from
                    the Duke of Saxony’s court at Friburg for reading his books.</p>
                <p>In the beginning of the year 1524, Clement VII. sent a legate to the German diet,
                    which was to be held at Nuremberg. Adrian VI. had died in October 1523, and, on
                    the 19th of November, been succeeded by Clement. A little before his death, he
                    canonized Benno, who had been bishop of Meissen in the time of Gregory VII. and
                    one of the most zealous defenders of the holy see. Luther, imagining that this
                    was done directly to oppose him, drew up a piece entitled Against the New Idol
                    and Old Devil set up at Meissen; a production in which he treats the memory of
                    Gregory with great freedom, and does not spare even that of Adrian. The legate
                    of Clement VII. represented to the diet of Nuremberg the necessity of enforcing
                    the execution of the edict of Worms, which had been strangely neglected by the
                    princes of the empire; but, notwithstanding the legate’s solicitations, which
                    were very pressing, the decrees of the diet were thought so ineffectual, that
                    they were condemned at Rome, and rejected by the emperor. In this year began the
                    dispute between Luther and Erasmus, about free-will. Erasmus had been much
                    courted by the Catholics to write against Luther; but he was all along of
                    opinion that writing would not be found an <pb break="no" facs="nls:193209223"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0713-9223-0600"/>effectual way to terminate the differences, and
                    re-establish the peace of the church. However, overcome by the importunities of
                    the pope and the Catholic princes, and desirous at the same time to clear
                    himself from the suspicion of favouring a cause which he would not seem to
                    countenance, he resolved to write against Luther, though, as he tells
                    Melancthon, it was with some reluctance, and chose the subject of free-will as
                    his theme. His book was entitled a Diatribe or Conference about Free-will, and
                    was written with much moderation, and without personal reflections. In the
                    preface, he tells Luther “that he ought not to take his dissenting from him in
                    opinion ill, because he had allowed himself the liberty of differing from the
                    judgment of popes, councils, universities, and doctors of the church.” Luther
                    was some time before he answered Erasmus’s book, but at last he published a
                    treatise <hi rend="italic">De Servo</hi><hi rend="italic">Arbitrio,</hi> or of
                    the Servitude of Man’s Will; and though Melancthon had promised Erasmus that
                    Luther should answer him with civility and moderation, yet Luther had so little
                    regard to Melancthon’s promise, that he never wrote any thing more severe. He
                    accused Erasmus of being careless about religion, and little solicitous what
                    became of it, provided the world continued in peace; and that his notions were
                    rather philosophical than Christian. Erasmus immediately replied to Luther in a
                    piece called <hi rend="italic">Hyperaspistes,</hi> in the first part of which he
                    answers his arguments, and in the second his personal reflections.</p>
                <p>In October 1524, Luther threw off the monastic habit, which, though not
                    premeditated or designed, was yet a very proper preparative to a step which he
                    took the year following; we mean his marriage with Catharine de Bore. Catharine
                    de Bore was a gentleman’s daughter, who had been a nun, and was taken, as we
                    have observed, out of the nunnery of Nimptschen, in the year 1523. Luther had a
                    design, as Melchior Adam relates, to marry her to Glacius, a minister of
                    Ortamunden; but she did not like Glacius, and so, on the 13th of June 1525,
                    Luther married her himself. This conduct of his was severely blamed, not only by
                    the Catholics, but, as Melancthon says, by those of his own party. He was even
                    for some time ashamed of it himself, and owns that his marriage had made him so
                    despicable, that he hoped his humiliation would rejoice the angels, and vex the
                    devils. Melancthon found him so afflicted with what he had done, that he wrote
                    some letters of consolation to him. It was not so much the marriage, as the
                    circumstances of the time, and the precipitation with which it was constituted,
                    that occasioned the censures which were passed upon Luther. He married all of a
                    sudden, and at a time when Germany was groaning under the miseries of a war
                    which was said to be owing to Lutheranism. Besides, it was thought to be an
                    indecent thing in a man of forty-two years of age, who was then, as he
                    professed, restoring the Gospel, and reforming mankind, to involve himself in
                    marriage with a woman of twenty-six, either through incontinence, or upon any
                    other account whatsoever. Bnt Luther, as soon as he had recovered himself a
                    little from this abasement, assumed his former air of intrepidity, and boldly
                    supported what he had done. “I took a wife,” says he, “in obedience to my
                    father’s commands; and hastened the consummation, in order to prevent
                    impediments, and stop the tongues of slanderers.” It appears, from his own
                    confession, that he was much attached to Catharine de Bore, and used to call her
                    by endearing names, which made profane people think and say wicked things of
                    him. “And therefore,” says he, “I married of a sudden, not only that I might not
                    be obliged to hear the clamours which I knew would be raised against me, but to
                    stop the mouths of those who reproached me with Catharine de Bore.” Luther also
                    gives us to understand that he did it partly as concurring with his grand scheme
                    of opposing the Catholics.</p>
                <p>Luther, notwithstanding, was not himself altogether satisfied with these reasons.
                    He did not think the step which he had taken could be sufficiently justified
                    upon the principles of human prudence; and therefore we find him, in other
                    places, endeavouring to account for it from a supernatural impulse. But whether
                    there was any thing divine in it or not, Luther found himself extremely happy in
                    his new state, especially after his wife had brought him a son. “My rib Kate,”
                    says he in the joy of his heart, “desires her compliments to you, and thanks you
                    for the favour of your kind letter. She is very well, through God’s mercy. She
                    is obedient and complying with me in all things, and more agreeable, I thank
                    God, than I could have expected; so that I would not change my poverty for the
                    wealth of Croesus.” According to Seckendorf, he had been heard to say, that he
                    would not exchange his wife for the kingdom of France, nor for the riches of the
                    Venetians, and that for three reasons; first, because she had been given him by
                    God, at the time when he implored the assistance of the Holy Ghost, in finding a
                    good wife; secondly, because, though she was not without faults, yet she had
                    fewer than other women; and, thirdly, because she religiously observed the
                    conjugal fidelity she owed him. At first a report was circulated that Catharine
                    de Bore had been confined soon after her marriage with Luther; but Erasmus, who
                    had communicated that piece of news to his friends, acknowledged a little
                    afterwards that there was no foundation for the scandal. His marriage, however,
                    did not retard his activity and diligence in the work of reformation. He revised
                    the Augsburg Confession of Faith, and Apology for the Protestants, when the
                    Protestant religion was first established on a firm basis.</p>
                <p>After this, Luther had little else to do than to sit down and contemplate the
                    mighty work which he had completed. That a single monk should have been able to
                    give the church so rude a shock, that there needed but such another entirely to
                    overthrow it, may very well seem a mighty work. Indeed he did little else; for
                    the remainder of his life was spent in exhorting princes, states, and
                    universities, to confirm the reformation which had been brought about through
                    him; and in publishing from time to time such writings as might serve to
                    encourage, direct, and aid them in doing so. The emperor threatened temporal
                    punishment with armies, and the pope eternal damnation with bulls and anathemas;
                    but Luther cared for none of their menaces. His friend and coadjutor Melancthon
                    was not so indifferent; for he had in his composition a great deal of softness,
                    moderation, and diffidence, which made him uneasy, and even sorrowful, on
                    account of the present disorders. Hence we find many of Luther’s letters written
                    on purpose to support and comfort him under these natural distresses and
                    anxieties.</p>
                <p>In the year 1533, Luther wrote to the citizens of Oschatz, who had suffered some
                    hardships for adhering to the Augsburg Confession of Faith, a consolatory
                    epistle, in which, amongst other things, he says, “The devil is the host, and
                    the world is his inn; so that wherever you come, you shall be sure to find this
                    ugly landlord.” He had also about this time a terrible controversy with George
                    duke of Saxony, who had such an aversion to Luther’s doctrine that he obliged
                    his subjects to take an oath that they would never embrace it. However, sixty or
                    seventy citizens of Leipzig were found to have deviated a little from the
                    Catholic way in some point or other, and they were known previously to have
                    consulted Luther about it; upon which George complained to the Elector John,
                    that Luther had not only abused his person, but also preached up rebellion
                    amongst his subjects. The elector ordered Luther to be made acquainted with
                    this; and to be told at the same time, that if he did not clear himself of the
                    charge, he could not possibly escape pun-isbment<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193209236" xml:id="kp-eb0713-9236-0601"/>. But Luther easily refuted
                    the accusation, by proving that he had been so far from stirring up his subjects
                    against him upon the score of religion, that, ∙on the contrary, he had exhorted
                    them to undergo the greatest hardships, and even suffer themselves to be
                    banished, rather than offer any resistance.</p>
                <p>The Bible translated by him into German was first printed in the year 1534, as
                    the old privilege, dated at Bibliopolis, under the elector’s hand, shows; and it
                    was published the year after. He also published, the same year, a book against
                    masses and the consecration of priests, in which he relates a' conference he had
                    with the devil upon those points; for it is remarkable in Luther’s whole
                    history, that he never had any conflicts of any kind within, but the devil was
                    always his antagonist. In February 1537, an assembly was held at Smalcalde,
                    about matters of religion, to which Luther and Melancthon were summoned. At this
                    meeting Luther was seized with so grievous an illness that there seemed to be no
                    hopes of his recovery. He was afflicted with the stone, and had a stoppage of
                    urine for eleven days. In this terrible condition he must needs undertake to
                    travel, notwithstanding all that his friends could say or do to prevent him. His
                    resolution, however, was attended with a good effect; for the night after his
                    departure he began to grow better. As he was carried along, he made his will, in
                    which he bequeathed his detestation of popery to his friends and brethren,
                    agreeably to what he often used to say, <hi rend="italic">Pestis eram
                    vivus,</hi><hi rend="italic">moriens</hi><hi rend="italic">ero</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">mors tua, papa</hi><hi rend="italic">; “</hi> 1 was the plague of
                    popery in my life, and shall continue to be so in my death.”</p>
                <p>This year the pope and the court of Rome, finding it impossible to deal with the
                    Protestants by force, began to have recourse to stratagem. They therefore
                    affected to think, that though Luther had indeed carried on things with a high
                    hand, and to a violent extreme, yet that what he had pleaded in defence of these
                    measures was not entirely without foundation. They talked with a seeming show of
                    moderation; and Pius III. who had succeeded Clement VII. proposed a reformation
                    first amongst themselves, and even went so far as to fix a place for a council
                    to assemble for that purpose. But Luther treated this farce as it deserved; he
                    unmasked and detected it immediately; and, to ridicule it the more strongly, he
                    caused a picture to be drawn, in which were represented the pope seated on high
                    upon <hi rend="italic">a</hi> throne, some cardinals about him with foxes’ tails
                    on, and seeming <hi rend="italic">sursum deorsum repurgare,</hi> as Melchior
                    Adam expresses it. This gross] design was fixed over against the title-page, to
                    let the reader see at once the scope and object of the book, which was, to
                    expose that cunning and artifice, with which those subtile politicians affected
                    to cleanse and purify themselves from their errors and superstitions. About the
                    same time, Luther published a Confutation of the Pretended Grant of Constantine
                    to Sylvester bishop of Rome, and also some letters of John Huss, written from
                    his prison at Constance to the Bohemians.</p>
                <p>In this manner was Luther employed until his death, which happened in the year
                    1546. His works were collected after his decease, and printed at Wittemberg in
                    seven volumes folio.</p>
