                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">LYCURGUS</label>, the celebrated legislator of the Spartans,
                    was the son of Eunomes, king of Sparta. He travelled in Greece, the island of
                    Crete, Egypt, and even proceeded to the Indies, to converse with the sages and
                    learned men of those countries, and to learn their manners, customs, and laws.
                    After the death of his brother Polydectes, who was king of Sparta, his widow
                    offered the crown to Lycurgus, promising that she would cause herself to
                    miscarry of the child of which she was pregnant, provided he would marry her;
                    but Lycurgus nobly refused these advantageous offers, and afterwards contented
                    himself with being tutor to his nephew Charillus, whom he restored to the
                    government when he came of age. Notwithstanding this honourable and generous
                    conduct, however, he was accused of a design to usurp the crown. This calumny
                    obliged him to retire to the island of Crete, where he applied himself to the
                    study of the laws and customs of nations. On his return to Lacedaemon, he
                    reformed the government, and, to prevent the disorders occasioned by luxury and
                    the love of riches, he prohibited the use of gold and silver; placed all the
                    citizens in a state of equality; and introduced the strictest temperance, the
                    most exact discipline, and those remarkable laws which, with few exceptions,
                    have been celebrated by all historians. It is said, that, to engage the
                    Lacedaemonians to observe them inviolably, he made them promise upon oath not to
                    change any part of them till his return; and that he afterwards went to the
                    island of Crete, where he killed himself, having ordered that his ashes should
                    be thrown into the sea, from fear lest, if his body should be carried to Sparta,
                    the Lacedaemonians would think themselves absolved from their oath. He
                    flourished about 870 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.</hi> c.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Lycürgus,</hi> one of the most celebrated orators of Greece,
                    was born at Athens about the year <hi rend="smallcaps">b. c.</hi> 400, and died
                    about B. c. 323. He was son of Lycophron, and grandson of Lycurgus, one or other
                    of whom was put to death by the Thirty Tyrants, <hi rend="smallcaps">b. c.</hi>
                    404 (Phot. <hi rend="italic">Cod.</hi> cclxviii. p. 1483). In his early years he
                    studied philosophy under Plato, and the political constitution of his country
                    under Isocrates. At what period he entered upon public life is nowhere recorded,
                    but we find him, <hi rend="smallcaps">b. c.</hi> 343, appointed, along with
                    Demosthenes, one of the ambassadors to counteract the proceedings of Philip in
                    different parts of Greece (Demosth. <hi rend="italic">Philipp,</hi> iii. p.
                    129). So much confidence had his fellow-citizens in his integrity, that he
                    continued to preside over the collection of the public revenue for twelve or
                    fifteen years. After the defeat of the Greeks at the battle of Chaeronea, <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b. c.</hi> 338, he brought Lysicles, the general of the
                    Athenians on that occasion, to trial before the people, and procured his
                    condemnation (Diodor. Sicul. xvi. 88). He restored the credit of comic
                    exhibitions at the Lenaean festival, and enacted honours for the three great
                    tragic poets <hi rend="italic">(</hi><hi rend="italic">Vit.</hi> X. Or. p. 841).
                    Lycurgus was one of the orators demanded by Alexander, after the destruction of
                    Thebes, <hi rend="smallcaps">b. c.</hi> 335; but the Athenians refused to give
                    him up (Plut. <hi rend="italic">Demosth. c.</hi> 23; Arrian, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Exp.</hi> i. 10). It would appear that Lycurgus died about the time of the
                    exile of Demosthenes, <hi rend="smallcaps">b. c.</hi> 323, the year before that
                    orator’s death (<hi rend="italic">Vit.</hi> x. Or. p. 842). There were fifteen
                    orations of Lycurgus extant in the time of Plutarch and Photius, but only one
                    has been preserved (against Leocrates), which was delivered <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b. c.</hi> 330. It is published by Hauptmann (Lips. 1751), by Schulze (Bruns.
                    1789), by Osann (Jena, 1821), and, along with other fragments, by Bekker
                    (Magdeb. 1821).</p>
