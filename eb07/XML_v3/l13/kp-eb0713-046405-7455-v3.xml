                    the fourth century, and for some time made a considerable figure.</p>
                <p>The name of <hi rend="italic">Lombards,</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >Longobards,</hi> is by some derived from the word <hi rend="italic">lack,</hi>
                    or <hi rend="italic">lache,</hi> signifying in the German tongue <hi
                    rend="italic">winter,</hi> because the Lombards, whilst in Seandinavia, lived in
                    marshes, or near to the sea; whilst others think that it comes from the two
                    German words <hi rend="italic">langen</hi><hi rend="italic">harden,</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">helleborden,</hi> that is, from the long halberts they were
                    supposed to use in war. But Paulus Diaconus their historian, and who was himself
                    a Lombard, tells us that they were called <hi rend="italic">Longobards,</hi>
                    from the length of their beards. A nation called <hi rend="italic">Lombards</hi>
                    is mentioned by Tacitus, Strabo, and Ptolemy; but these are different from the
                    Lombards who afterwards settled in Italy, and are reckoned the same with the
                    Gepidae, whom the Italian Lombards almost exterminated. The Lombards who settled
                    in Italy are first mentioned by Prosper Aquitanus, <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193207468" xml:id="kp-eb0713-7468-0465"/>bishop of Rhegium in the year
                    379. That writer tells us, that about the time referred to, the Lombards,
                    abandoning the distant coasts of the ocean, and their native country
                    Scandinavia, and seeking for new settlements, as they were overstocked with
                    people at home, first attacked and overcame the Vandals in Germany. They were
                    then headed by two chiefs, Iboreus and Aion, who, having died about the year
                    389, were succeeded by Agilmund, who is commonly reckoned the first king of the
                    Lombards.</p>
                <p>Before the time of Odoacer, Lombard history presents nothing very remarkable; in
                    his time, however, they settled on the Danube, in the country of the Rugians,
                    whom Odoacer had almost totally exterminated or carried into captivity. During
                    their stay in this country, they rendered themselves formidable to the
                    neighbouring nations, and carried on successful wars with the Heruli and
                    Gepidae. In 526 they were allowed by the Emperor Justinian to settle in
                    Pannonia; and here they made war a second time with the Gepidae. Alboin, the
                    Lombard king, killed the king of the Gepidae with his own hand, put his army to
                    the route, and cut in pieces such numbers of them, that they ceased from that
                    time to be a nation. Having caused the deceased king’s head to be cut off, he
                    made a cup of his skull, called in the language of the Lombards <hi
                    rend="italic">schala,</hi> which he made use of in all public entertainments.
                    However, having, amongst many other captives of great distinction, taken the
                    last king’s daughter, by name Rosamunda, he married her after the death of his
                    former wife Clodisvinta, the daughter of Clothaire king of France.</p>
                <p>By this victory Alboin gained such reputation that his friendship was courted by
                    Justinian; and, in consequence of the emperor’s application, a body of six
                    thousand Lombards was sent to the assistance of Narses against the Goths. The
                    success of the Romans in this expedition, the invasion of Italy by the Lombards,
                    and their successes in that country, have been noticed under the article <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Italy.</hi> At last, Alboin having made himself master of
                    Venetia, Liguria, Aemilia, Etruria, and Umbria, was slain by the treachery of
                    his wife, in the year 575, being the fourth of his reign. This princess was the
                    daughter of the king of the Gepidae, whom Alboin had killed in battle, and made
                    a cup of his skull, as above related. As he was one day feasting at Verona, with
                    his chief favourites and principal officers, in the height of his mirth he sent
                    for the queen, and, filling the detested cup, he commanded her to drink merrily
                    with her father. Rosamund, struck with horror, hurried out of the room; and,
                    highly incensed against her husband for thus barbarously triumphing over the
                    misfortunes of her family, resolved, at all events, to make him pay dear for his
                    inhuman and insulting conduct. She discovered her intention to Helmichild the
                    king’s shield-bearer, a youth of great boldness and intrepidity; but he
                    peremptorily refused to imbrue his hands in the blood of his sovereign, or to be
                    in any way accessory to his death; and in this resolution he persisted, until,
                    by a shameful stratagem, forced to comply with the queen’s .vishes. Knowing that
                    he carried on an intrigue with one of her ladies, Rosamund placed herself one
                    night in that ady’s bed, and receiving the youth, indulged him in his imorous
                    desires, as if she had been his own mistress. Then liscoveriug herself to the
                    deceived lover, she told him liât he must now either put the king to death, or
                    be out to death by him. Helmichild, well apprised that, af- ' er what he had
                    done, his safety depended upon the death if the king, engaged in the treason,
                    which he otherwise ιbhorred. One day, therefore, whilst Alboin was reposing n
                    his chamber after dinner, Helmichild, with some others vhom he had made privy to
                    his design, broke in unex-ιectedly, and fell upon the king with their daggers.
                    Al- &gt;oin started up and laid hold of his sword, which he had ffivays by him;
                    but having in vain attempted to draw it, the queen having beforehand fastened it
                    in the scabbard, he defended himself for some time with a footstool. In the end,
                    however, he was overpowered, and despatched with many wounds.</p>
                <p>Rosamund had promised to Helmichild, that, as soon as he had despatched the king
                    she would marry him, and, with her person, bestow upon him the kingdom of the
                    Lombards. The first part of her promise she immediately performed; but she was
                    so far from being able to bestow the crown upon him, that both of them were
                    obliged to save themselves by flight. They fled to Longinus the exarch of
                    Ravenna, taking with them all the jewels and treasure of the late king. Longinus
                    received her with the greatest marks of friendship and kindness, and assured her
                    of his protection. But she had not been long in Ravenna, before the exarch,
                    thinking that a favourable opportunity now offered for making himself king of
                    Italy by her means, imparted his design to her, and declared his intention to
                    marry her, provided, by some means or other, she despatched Helmichild.
                    Rosamund, highly pleased with the proposal, resolved to satisfy her ambition by
                    getting rid of the person whom she had only married in order to gratify <hi
                    rend="subscript"> k</hi> her revenge. Accordingly, having prepared a strong
                    poison, and mixed it with wine, she gave it to her husband as he came out of the
                    bath, and called for drink, according to his custom. Helmichild had not half
                    emptied the cup, when, by the sudden and strange sensation which he felt in his
                    bowels, he concluded what it was; and, with his sword pointed at the queen’s
                    breast, compelled her to drink the rest. The poison had the same effect on both,
                    for they died in a few hours. Longinus, on the death of the queen, laid aside
                    all thoughts of making himself king of Italy, and sent the king’s treasure to
                    Constantinople, together with Albisoinda, the daughter of Alboin by Rosamund,
                    whom she had brought along with her.</p>
                <p>After the death of Alboin, the Lombards chose Clephis, one of the nobility, as
                    their king. But he was murdered after a short reign of eighteen months; upon
                    which ensued an interregnum of ten years. During this time, they extended their
                    conquests in that country; but at length the Romans, jealous of their progress,
                    resolved to put a stop to their victories, and, if possible, to expel them from
                    the country. For this purpose, they entered into an alliance with the Franks;
                    which so alarmed the Lombards that they re-established the monarchical form of
                    government amongst themselves, and chose Aιιtharis the son of Clephis as their
                    king. This monarch, considering that the power of the dukes, who had governed
                    Lombardy for the space of ten years, was during that time tolerably well
                    established, and that they would not probably be willing to part with the
                    authority which they had so long enjoyed, allowed them to continue in their
                    government, but obliged them to contribute one moiety of their revenues towards
                    the maintenance and support of his royal dignity, suffering them to dispose of
                    the other as they thought proper. He reserved to himself the supreme dominion
                    and authority, and took an oath from the dukes, that in time of war they would
                    readily assist him to the utmost of their power. Though he could remove the
                    dukes at pleasure, yet he deprived none of them of their dukedoms, excepting in
                    cases of treason, nor gave them to others, except when their male issue failed.
                    Having settled matters in this manner, he enacted several very wholesome laws
                    against theft, rapine, murder, adultery, and other vices which prevailed amongst
                    his subjects, and was the first of the Lombard kings who embraced Christianity.
                    Most of his subjects followed the example of their monarch; but as they were all
                    instructed by Arian bishops, they continued long infected with that heresy,
                    which occasioned great disputes between them and the orthodox bishops of the
                    cities subject to their sway.</p>
                <p>From the re-establishment of the monarchy under Au <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193207481" xml:id="kp-eb0713-7481-0466"/>tharis, until the reign of
                    Kotharis in 636, the history of the Lombards affords nothing memorable. * This
                    period is remarkable for the introduction of written laws amongst the Lombards.
                    Before his time they had been governed only by tradition but Rotharis, in
                    imitation of the Romans and Goths, undertook the publication of written laws;
                    and to those which he enacted many were added by succeeding princes. Grotius
                    prefers the method which the Lombards followed in making laws, to that which was
                    practised by the Romans themselves. Amongst the latter the emperor was the sole
                    lawgiver; and whatsoever he decreed had the force of a law. But the Lombard
                    kings did not assume that power to themselves, since their laws were enacted in
                    public assemblies convened for the purpose, after they had been maturely
                    examined and approved of by all the lords of the kingdom. From these assemblies
                    were excluded the ecclesiastical order, and the people; so that the legislative
                    power was lodged exclusively in the king and the nobles.</p>
                <p>The reign of Rotharis is remarkable, not only for his introducing written laws
                    amongst his subjects, but for the conquests which he made, and the successful
                    wars which he carried on with the exarch of Ravenna, whom he totally defeated in
                    several engagements, at the same time making himself master of some part of his
                    territories. This monarch died in 652; and the affairs of the Lombards went on
                    prosperously, till the ambition of Luitprand laid the foundation of the total
                    ruin of his kingdom. He ascended the throne of Lombardy in 711, and watched
                    every opportunity of enlarging his dominions at the expense of the emperor. For
                    this a fair occasion offered in 716. The Emperor Leo Isauricus, who at that time
                    reigned in the East, having, by his famous edict, forbidden the worship of
                    images, and ordered them to be everywhere pulled down, the people were so
                    incensed at that innovation, that, in several places, they openly revolted, and,
                    falling upon the emperor’s officers, drove them out of the cities. In the East,
                    Germanus, the patriarch of Constantinople, opposed the emperor’s design with
                    great warmth; but Leo caused him to be deposed, and Anastasius to be raised to
                    that see in his room, at the same time ordering that all the images in the
                    imperial city should be pulled down and publicly burned. He strictly enjoined
                    his officers in the West, especially the exarch of Ravenna, to see his edict
                    punctually obeyed in their respective governments. In compliance with these
                    orders, Scholasticus, then exarch, began to pull down the images in all the
                    churches and public places in Ravenna; a proceeding which incensed the
                    superstitious multitude to such a degree, that, taking arms, they openly
                    declared that they would rather renounce their allegiance to the emperor than
                    give up the worship of images.</p>
                <p>A kind of civil war being thus kindled in the city, Luitprand thought he had now
                    a favourable opportunity of making himself master of the seat of the exarch, not
                    doubting but the conquest of such an important place would be followed by that
                    of the whole exarchate. Having therefore drawn together all his forces, he
                    unexpectedly appeared before Ravenna, which he closely besieged. The exarch had
                    little expected such a surprise, a friendly correspondence having been
                    maintained for many years between the exarchs and the Lombard kings. However, he
                    defended the place with such courage and resolution, that Luitprand, despairing
                    of success, raised the siege, and led his army against Classis, at a small
                    distance from Ravenna, which he took, plundered, and levelled with the ground.
                    The loss of this place, and the severe treatment which the inhabitants met with
                    from the king, threw the citizens of Ravenna into the utmost consternation.
                    Informed of this, Luitprand resolved to take advantage of their fears, and,
                    returning before Ravenna whilst the inhabitants were thus disheartened, to
                    attempt once more the reduction of the place. Accordingly he led his whole army
                    against it, and, by frequent attacks, tired the inhabitants and garrison to
                    such'a degree, that the exarch, finding they could hold out no longer, and
                    despairing of relief, withdrew privately. Luitprand, informed of his retreat,
                    attacked the town with more violence than ever; and, having carried it by storm,
                    gave it up to be plundered by his soldiers, who found in it an immense booty.
                    The king stripped it of most of its valuable monuments of antiquity, and,
                    amongst the rest, caused an equestrian statue of an emperor, of wonderful
                    workmanship, to be conveyed to Pavia, where it is to be seen to this day. The
                    reduction of Ravenna was followed by the surrender of several cities of the
                    exarchate, which Luitprand reduced to a dukedom, appointing Hildebrand his
                    grandson to govern it with the title of duke, and giving him, as he was yet an
                    infant, Peredeus duke of Vicenza as his guardian.</p>
                <p>The conquest of Ravenna and the greater part of the exarchate alarmed Gregory II.
                    bishop of Rome. He was then at variance with the emperor, whose edict against
                    the worship of images he had opposed with all his might, and thereby provoked
                    Leo to such a degree that he had threatened to drive him from the see, and send
                    him into exile. However, the pope, no less jealous of the power of the Lombards
                    than all his predecessors had been, resolved, by some means or other, to put a
                    stop to their conquests. The only prince in Italy to whom he could have
                    recourse, was Ursus duke of Venice. To him accordingly he wrote a very pressing
                    letter, conjuring him to assist his worthy son the exarch, and, for the love of
                    the holy faith, to attempt with him the recovery of the exarchate, which the
                    wicked nation of the Lombards had unjustly taken from his sons Leo and
                    Constantine, emperors. Ursus and the Venetians, moved with the pope’s letter,
                    and at the same time alarmed at the growth of so powerful a neighbour, promised
                    to assist the exarch with the whole strength of the republic; and accordingly
                    fitted out a considerable fleet, pretending that it was designed for the service
                    of the emperor against the Saracens. At the same time the exarch, who had taken
                    refuge in Venice, abandoning that place as it were in despair of bringing the
                    duke over to his party, raised, in the places still subject to the emperor, what
                    forces he could; and having got together a considerable body, he marched with
                    them towards Imola, giving out that he designed to besiege that city; but
                    turning on a sudden towards Ravenna, as had been agreed upon between him and the
                    Venetians, he laid siege to that city by land, whilst almost at the same instant
                    they invested it by sea. Peredeus defended the town for some time with great
                    courage and resolution, obliging all those who were able to bear arms to repair
                    to the walls. But the Venetians having, in spite of all opposition, forced open
                    one of the gates on the seaward face, the city was taken, and Peredeus slain,
                    whilst he was attempting, at the head of a chosen body, to drive the enemy from
                    the posts they had seized. As for Hildebrand, he fell into the hands of the
                    Venetians, who, having thus recovered Ravenna to the emperor, returned home,
                    leaving the exarch in possession of the city. Luitprand was then at Pavia; but
                    the town was taken before he could assemble troops to relieve it.</p>
                <p>Gregory, bishop of Rome, to whom the recovery of Ravenna was chiefly owing,
                    having persuaded himself that the emperor would, out of gratitude, give ear to
                    his remonstrances and admonitions, began to solicit him more pressingly than
                    ever to revoke his edict against the worship of images; but Leo, apprised that
                    the bishop, in all the measures he had taken, had been more influenced by a
                    regard to his own interest than to that of the empire, instead of listening to
                    his remonstrances, was still more provoked against him for thus obstinately
                    opposing the execution of his edict. Being therefore resolved at all events to
                    cause it ’ <hi rend="subscript"> ι</hi> to be observed in Rome itself, and, on
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:193207494" xml:id="kp-eb0713-7494-0467"/>the other
                    hand, not doubting but the pope would oppose it to the last, in order to remove
                    all obstacles, he sent three officers to Rome, with private orders, either to
                    despatch the pope, or to take him prisoner and convey him to Constantinople. At
                    the same time, he wrote to Mauritius, duke of Rome, secretly enjoining him to
                    assist his officers in their undertaking; but no favourable opportunity having
                    offered to put their design in execution, the emperor, in the year 725, recalled
                    Scholasticus, and sent Paul, a patrician, into Italy, to govern in his stead,
                    with private instructions to encourage the officers already mentioned with the
                    promise of great rewards, and to assure them of his protection.</p>
                <p>But, in the mean time, the plot was discovered, and two of the conspirators
                    having been apprehended by the citizens of Rome, were put to death; the third
                    escaped into a monastery, where he took the monastic habit, and ended his days.
                    Hereupon the exarch, in compliance with the emperor’s orders, resolved to
                    proceed no longer by secret plots, but by open force. Accordingly he drew
                    together a considerable body of troops, and set out at their head, on his march
                    to Rome, with the design of seizing the pope, and sending him, as he had engaged
                    to do, in chains to Constantinople. But, on this occasion, Luitprand, though
                    highly provoked against Gregory for having stirred up the Venetians against him,
                    resolved to assist him and the citizens of Rome against the exarch, in order to
                    keep the balance even between them, and, by aiding sometimes the one, and
                    sometimes the other, to weaken both. Pursuant to this resolution, he ordered the
                    Lombards of Tuscany, and those of the dukedom of Spoletto, to join the pope and
                    the inhabitants of Rome, who being by this reinforcement far superior in
                    strength and number to the exarch, obliged him to return to Ravenna, and give
                    over all thoughts of any further attempt on the person of the pope.</p>
                <p>In the mean time, Leo, persisting in his former resolution of suppressing
                    throughout his dominions the worship of images, sent fresh orders to the exarch
                    Paul, strictly enjoining him to cause his edict to be put in execution in ah the
                    cities of Italy, especially in Rome. At the same time, he wrote to the pope,
                    promising him his favour and protection, if he complied with the edict; and
                    declaring him, if he continued to oppose it, a rebel, and no longer invested
                    with the papal dignity. But Gregory was so far from yielding to the emperor’s
                    threats or promises, that, on the contrary, he solemnly excommunicated the
                    exarch for attempting to put the imperial edict in execution, and at the same
                    time wrote circular letters to the Venetians, to King Luitprand, to the Lombard
                    dukes, and to all the chief cities of the empire, exhorting them to continue
                    stedfast in the Catholic faith, and to oppose with all their might such a
                    detestable innovation. These letters made such an impression on the minds of the
                    people in Italy, that though of different interests, and often at war with one
                    another, they all united, protesting they would defend the Catholic faith, and
                    the life of the pope, in so glorious a cause, at the expense of their own; nay,
                    the citizens of Rome, and the inhabitants of Pentapolis, now the March of
                    Ancona, not content with such r protestation, openly revolted against the
                    emperor, and oulling down the statues, elected, by their own authority,
                    nagistrates to govern them during the interregnum. We ire even told, that,
                    transported with a blind zeal, they were for choosing a new emperor, and
                    conducting him to Constantinople, not doubting that the people would everywhere
                    join them. But the pope, thinking this resolution 'mseasonable and
                    impracticable, opposed it.</p>
                <p>In the mean time, the exarch Paul, having gained a considerable party in Ravenna,
                    began, pursuant to the repeated orders from the emperor, to remove the images,
                    as so many idols, out of the churches. Hereupon the adverse party, supported and
                    encouraged by the pope, flew to arms, and, falling upon the <hi rend="italic"
                    >iconoclasts,</hi> or image-breakers, as they styled them, raised a civil war
                    within the walls of Ravenna. Great numbers were killed upon both sides; but
                    those who were for the worship of images prevailed in the end; a dreadful
                    slaughter was made of the opposite party; and, amongst the rest, the exarch
                    himself was murdered. However, the city of Ravenna continued faithful to the
                    emperor; but most of the citizens of Romagna belonging to the exarchate, and all
                    those of Pentapolis or the March of Ancona, abhorring the emperor as an heretic,
                    submitted to Luitprand, king of the Lombards, who, pretending a zeal for the
                    Catholic religion, took care to improve the discontent of the people to his
                    advantage, by representing to them that they could never maintain their
                    religious rights under a prince who was not only an heretic, but a persecutor of
                    the faithful.</p>
                <p>In Naples, Exhilaratus, duke of that city, having received peremptory orders from
                    the emperor to cause his edict to be put in execution, did all that lay in his
                    power to persuade the people to receive it; but finding his endeavours thwarted
                    by the bishop of Rome, for whom the Neapolitans had a great veneration, he hired
                    assassins to murder the pontiff. But the plot being discovered, though carried
                    on with great secrecy, the Neapolitans, highly provoked against the duke, tore
                    both him and his son to pieces, and likewise put to death one of his chief
                    officers, who had composed a libel against the pope. Luitprand, and Gregory, at
                    that time Duke of Benevento, laying hold of so favourable an opportunity to make
                    themselves masters of the dukedom of Naples, did all in their power to persuade
                    the Neapolitans to submit to them. But the Neapolitans, bearing an
                    irreconcilable hatred to the Lombards, with whom they had been constantly at
                    variance, rejected every overture of that kind with the utmost indignation; and
                    continuing stedfast in their allegiance to Leo, received from Constantinople one
                    Peter, who was sent to govern them in the room of Exhilaratus. Some writers
                    suppose that the Neapolitans, in this general revolt of the cities of Italy, had
                    shaken off the yoke along with the rest, and appointed magistrates of their own
                    election to govern them, in the room of the officers hitherto sent from
                    Constantinople, or named by the exarch. But they are certainly mistaken; for it
                    is manifest from history that Peter succeeded Exhilaratus in that dukedom, and
                    that the Neapolitans continued to live under the emperors until they were
                    conquered many years afterwards by the Normans.</p>
                <p>In the mean time, Leo, hearing of the murder of the exarch, and the general
                    revolt of the cities, and not doubting that the pope was the chief author of so
                    much mischief, sent the eunuch Eutychius into Italy, with the title and
                    authority of exarch, strictly enjoining him to get the pope despatched by some
                    means or other, since his death was absolutely necessary for the tranquillity of
                    Italy. The exarch spared no pains to get the pope into his power. But a
                    messenger, whom he had sent to Rome, being apprehended by the citizens, and an
                    order from the emperor being found upon him to the imperial officers in that
                    city, commanding them to put the pope to death at all events, the pontiff’s
                    friends thenceforth guarded him with such care, that the exarch’s emissaries
                    could never afterwards find an opportunity of executing their design. As for the
                    messenger, the Romans were for putting him to death; but the pope interposed to
                    save him, and contented himself with excommunicating the exarch.</p>
                <p>And now the Romans, provoked more than ever against Leo, and, on the other hand,
                    unwilling to live under the Lombards, resolved to revolt against the emperor,
                    and appoint their own magistrates, keeping themselves united <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193207507" xml:id="kp-eb0713-7507-0468"/>under the pope, not as their
                    prince, but only as their head. This they did accordingly; and from these
                    slender beginnings the sovereignty of the popes in Italy took its rise, though
                    the pontiffs did not then, as is commonly supposed by historians, become
                    sovereign lords of Rome, but many years afterwards.</p>
                <p>Eutychius failed in his design upon the life of the pope; but having brought with
                    him from Constantinople a good number of troops, he easily quelled the rebellion
                    in Ravenna, and severely punished the authors of the late disturbances. As for
                    the rebellious Romans, he was well apprized that he could never reduce them, as
                    long as they were supported by the king of the Lombards; and therefore he
                    employed all his art and policy to detach that prince from the party of the
                    Romans, and to bring him over to his own interest.</p>
                <p>Luitprand for some time withstood all his offers; but Thrasimund, duke of
                    Spoletto, having revolted at that juncture, the exarch, taking advantage of the
                    opportunity which presented itself, offered to assist the king with all his
                    means against the rebellious duke, provided he would, in like manner, assist him
                    against the pope and the Romans. With this proposal Luitprand readily closed;
                    and a league being concluded upon these terms, between him and the exarch, the
                    two armies joined, and began their march towards Spoletto. At their approach,
                    the duke, despairing of being able to resist two such powers, came out with a
                    small attendance to meet them, and, throwing himself at the king’s feet, sued,
                    in that humble posture, for pardon; which Luitprand not only granted him, but
                    confirmed him in the dukedom, after he had obliged him to take a new oath of
                    allegiance, and to give hostages for his fidelity in time to come. From
                    Spoletto, the two armies marched, in pursuance of the treaty, to Rome, and
                    encamped in the meadows of Nero, between the Tiber and the Vatican.</p>
                <p>Gregory had caused the city of Rome to be fortified in the best manner he could;
                    but being sensible that the Romans alone could not long hold out against two
                    such armies, and reflecting on the kind treatment the duke of Spoletto had met
                    with upon his submitting to the king, he resolved to follow his example; and
                    accordingly, taking with him some of the clergy, and the principal inhabitants
                    of the city, he went to wait upon the king in his camp, where, by a pathetic
                    speech, he softened Luitprand to such a degree, that throwing himself at his
                    feet, in the presence of the whole army, he begged pardon for entering into an
                    alliance against him, and, assuring him of his protection for the future, he
                    went with them to the church of St Peter, where, disarming himself in the
                    presence of his principal officers, he laid his girdle, his sword, and his
                    gauntlet, with his royal mantle, his crown of gold, and cross of silver, on the
                    apostle’s sepulchre. After this, he reconciled the pope with the exarch, who was
                    thereupon received into the city, where he continued for some time, maintaining
                    a friendly correspondence with the pope. At this time an impostor, taking the
                    name of Tiberius, and pretending to be descended from the emperors, seduced a
                    great many people in Tuscany, and was by them proclaimed emperor. The exarch
                    resolved to march against him; but as he had not sufficient forces to oppose the
                    rebels, Gregory, who let slip no opportunity of obliging Leo, persuaded the
                    Romans to attend the exarch in this expedition, by which means the usurper was
                    taken in a castle, his head sent to the emperor, and the rebellion utterly
                    suppressed.</p>
                <p>But the emperor still insisting upon his edict against the images being received
                    in Rome, the Romans, at the instigation of the pope, publicly renounced their
                    allegiance to Leo, paid him no more tribute, and withdrew for ever their
                    obedience to the emperors of the East.</p>
                <p>Leo, informed of this revolt, and not questioning that the pope was the author of
                    it, immediately caused all the patrimony of the church of Rome in Sicily,
                    Calabria, and his other dominions, to be confiscated. At the same time he
                    ordered a powerful army to be raised, with the design of recovering the towns
                    which had revolted, chastising the Romans for their rebellion, and, above all,
                    being revenged on the pope, who had raised these disturbances, by himself
                    opposing, and persuading others to oppose, the execution of bis edict. Gregory,
                    alarmed at the warlike preparations which were making throughout the empire, and
                    well apprised that they were chiefly designed against himself and the Romans,
                    resolved to recur to the protection of the French, the only nation at that time
                    capable of coping with the emperor, and upon whom, on account of their zeal for
                    religion, he thought he might depend. The Lombards were then very powerful; but,
                    as they wanted to be masters <hi rend="italic">of</hi> Rome, he did not think it
                    advisable to trust them. The Venetians, though zealous in the defence of the
                    pope, were not yet in a condition to withstand the power of the emperor, and,
                    besides, were jealous of the Lombards, who watched all opportunities of
                    enlarging their dominions at the expense of their neighbours. As for Spain, it
                    was then in a deplorable condition, being overrun, and almost wholly ruined, by
                    the Saracens.</p>
                <p>The French nation was at this time governed by the celebrated Charles Martel, who
                    had distinguished himself in an eminent degree in the wars of France and
                    Germany; and having, not long before, gained a signal victory over the Saracens
                    in the neighbourhood of Tours, he was generally reputed the best commander, and
                    the greatest hero, of his time. To him, therefore, Gregory sent a solemn
                    embassy, with a great number of relics, earnestly entreating him to take the
                    Romans, and the church, under his protection, and to defend them against the
                    attempts of Leo. The ambassadors were received with extraordinary marks of
                    honour, and a treaty was soon concluded between them and Charles, who engaged to
                    march into Italy in person, at the head of a powerful army, in defence of the
                    Romans and the church, if they should be attacked either by the emperor or the
                    Lombards. On the other hand, the Romans were bound to acknowledge him as their
                    protector, and to confer upon him the honour of the consulship, as it had been
                    formerly conferred on Clovis by the Emperor Anastasius, after that prince had
                    defeated the Visigoths. The ambassadors returned from France loaded with rich
                    presents. But Gregory did not long enjoy the fruit of their negociations; for he
                    died the same year, 731, and was succeeded by Gregory III., in whose time some
                    have placed the embassy here mentioned.</p>
                <p>At this time the French nation had just recovered from its distressed situation
                    under the descendants of Clovis; and, by the bravery and conduct of Charles
                    Martel, it had become the most powerful kingdom in the west. His successor Pepin
                    was no less wise and powerful than his father had been; and as the ambition of
                    the Lombard princes would be satisfied with nothing less than the entire
                    conquest of Italy, the French monarch, Charlemagne, under colour of assisting
                    the pope, at last put an end to the empire of Lombardy.</p>
