                    learned and distinguished writer, descended from an ancient family in Cheshire,
                    was the eldest son of George Warburton, an attorney at Newark in the county of
                    Nottingham, and was born on the 24th of December 1698. He was first sent to
                    school there under a Mr Twells, but had the chief part of his education at
                    Okeham in Rutlandshire, where he continued till the beginning of the year 1714.
                    He then returned to his native town, and for a short time was under the care of
                    his cousin William Warburton, who had recently been appointed head master of
                    Newark school. Being destined for the profession which had been followed by his
                    father and grandfather, he was placed as a clerk to Mr Kirke, an attorney of
                    East Markham in Nottinghamshire, with whom he continued till April 1719, when he
                    was qualified to engage in business on his own account. Having been admitted as
                    an attorney of one of the courts at Westminster, he settled at Newark, where he
                    continued to practise for some years. His father had died about the year 1706,
                    leaving a widow and five children. Warburton’s success as a country attorney
                    does not appear to have been very considerable, but he was destined to reach an
                    eminent station in another profession.</p><p>He had always expressed a strong inclination to take orders; and the love of
                    letters, which tended to retard rather than forward his progress in the
                    profession chosen for him by his friends, growing every day stronger in him, it
                    was deemed expedient to give way to that inclination. He therefore devoted
                    himself to the studies necessary to fit him for the church, and at length in
                    1723 he was ordained deacon, and priest in 1727. In 1728 he was presented by Sir
                    Robert Sutton to the rectory of Brand-Broughton, in the diocese of Lincoln,
                    where he spent the greater part of his life, and composed all the great works
                    which will carry his fame down to posterity. During the same year he was put
                    upon the king’s list of Masters of Arts, created on his majesty’s visit to the
                    university of Cambridge. He had already published some juvenile performances,
                    which displayed genius and reading, and attracted considerable notice; but it
                    was not till the year 1736 that he may be said to have emerged from the
                    obscurity of a private life into the notice of the world. The first publication
                    which rendered him famous now appeared, under the title of “The Alliance between
                    Church and State; or, the Necessity and Equity of an Established Religion and a
                    Test Law; demonstrated from the Essence and End of Civil Society, upon the
                    fundamental Principles of the Law of Nature and Nations.”</p><p>At the close of the Alliance was announced the scheme of the Divine Legation of
                    Moses, in which he had then made considerable progress. The first volume of this
                    work was published in January 1737-8, under the title of “The Divine Legation of
                    Moses demonstrated on the Principles of a religious Deist, from the Omission of
                    the Doctrine of a future State of Rewards and Punishments in the Jewish
                    Dispensation, in six books.” The arrogance of the author was at least equal to
                    his learning; and this work, as he afterwards observed, was fallen upon in so
                    outrageous and brutal a manner as had been scarcely pardonable had it been “The
                    Divine Legation of Mahomet.” It produced several answers, and so much abuse from
                    the authors of “The Weckly Miscellany,” that in less than two months he was
                    constrained to defend himself, in “A Vindication of the Author of the Divine
                    Legation of Moses, from the Aspersions of the Country Clergyman’s Letter in the
                    Weckly Miscellany of February 24, 1737-8.” His extraordinary merit had attracted
                    the notice of the heir-apparent to the crown, in whose immediate service we find
                    him in June 1738, when he published “Faith working by Charity to Christian
                    Edification, a Sermon, preached at the last Episcopal Visitation for
                    Confirmation in the Diocese of Lincoln; with a Preface, showing the Reason of
                    its Publication; and a Postsβript, occasioned by some Letters lately published
                    in the Weckly Miscellany; by William Warburton, M. A. Chaplain to his Royal
                    Highness the Prince of Wales.”</p><p>The “Essay on Man” had now been published some years; and it has sometimes been
                    supposed that the author had, in the composition of it, adopted the philosophy
                    of Lord Bolingbroke, whom on this occasion he had followed as his guide, without
                    understanding the tendency of his principles. In 1738, M. de Crousaz wrote some
                    re- . marks on it, accusing the author of Spinozaism and naturalism; which
                    falling into Warburton’s hands, he published a defence of the first epistle, and
                    soon afterwards of the remaining three, in seven letters; of which six were
                    printed in 1739, and the seventh in 1740, under the title of “A Vindication of
                    Mr Pope’s Essay on Man, by the author of the Divine Legation.” The opinion which
                    Pope conceived of these defences, as well as of their author, will be best seen
                    in his letters. In consequence, a firm friendship was established between them,
                    which continued with undiminished fervour until the death of Pope; who, during
                    the remainder of his life, paid a deference and respect to his friend’s judgment
                    and abilities, which will be considered by many as almost bordering on
                    servility.</p><p>Towards the end of the year 1739, Warburton published a new and improved edition
                    of the first volume of the Divine Legation; and in 1741 appeared the second
                    part, which completed the argument, though not the entire plan of that work; “a
                    work,” says Bishop Hurd, “in all views <pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=811" xml:id="kp-eb0721-0811-0771"/>of
                    the most transcendant merit, whether we consider the invention or the execution.
                    A plain simple argument, yet perfectly new, proving the divinity of the Mosaic
                    law, and laying a sure foundation for the support of Christianity, is there
                    drawn out to great length by a chain of reasoning so elegantly connected, that
                    the reader is carried along it with ease and pleasure; while the matter
                    presented to him is so striking for its own importance, so embellished by a
                    lively fancy, and illustrated from all quarters by exquisite learning and the
                    most ingenious disquisition, that in the whole compass of modern or ancient
                    theology there is nothing equal or similar to this extraordinary
                    performance.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Hurd’s
                    Life of Warburton, prefixed to his Works.</p></note></p><p>This is the panegyric of a man reflecting with tenderness on the memory of his
                    friend and benefactor; but it approaches much nearer to the truth than the
                    censures of those cabalistic critics who, fastening upon some weak part of the
                    Divine Legation, or perhaps never having looked into it, have ridiculously
                    contended that the author was far from being eminent as a scholar, and that his
                    work is inimical to the cause of Christianity. Putting partiality aside, there
                    is in the Divine Legation of Moses abundant evidence of the malignant folly of
                    this charge, as no man can read and understand that work without being convinced
                    that its author was a Christian, not only sincere, but zealous; that he was what
                    Johnson calls him, “a man of vigorous faculties, of a mind fervent and vehement,
                    supplied, by unlimited and incessant inquiry, with a wonderful extent and
                    variety of knowledge, which had neither depressed his imagination nor clouded
                    his perspicacity; and that to every work, and this work in particular, he
                    brought a memory full fraught, with a fancy fertile of original combinations,
                    exerting at once the powers of the scholar, the reasoner, and the wit.” But we
                    think it must be acknowledged, that his learning was too multifarious to be
                    always exact, and his inquiries too eagerly pushed to be always cautious.</p><p>In the summer of 1741, Pope and Warburton, in a country ramble, took Oxford in
                    their way. The university was naturally pleased at the arrival of two such
                    strangers, and seemed desirous of enrolling their names among their graduates.
                    The degree of D. D. was intended for the divine, and that of LL. D. for the
                    poet: but intrigue and envy defeated this scheme; and the university lost the
                    honour of decorating at the same time the two greatest geniuses of the age, by
                    the fault of one or two of its members. Pope retired with some indignation to
                    Twickenham, where he consoled himself and his friend with this sarcastic
                    reflection: “We shall take our degree together in fame, whatever we do at the
                    university.”</p><p>The friendship of this eminent poet was of service to Warburton in more respects
                    than that of increasing his fame. He introduced and warmly recommended him to
                    most of his friends, and among others to Mr Murray, afterwards earl of
                    Mansfield, and Ralph Allen, Esq. of Prior Park. In consequence of this
                    introduction, we find Warburton at Bath in 1742. There he printed a sermon which
                    had been preached at the Abbey-church on the 24th of October, for the benefit of
                    Mr Allen’s favourite charity, the General Hospital or Infirmary. During this
                    year also he printed a Dissertation on the Origin of books of Chivalry, at the
                    end of Jarvis’s preface to a translation of Don Quixote; of which Pope tells him
                    he had not got over two paragraphs before he cried out, <hi rend="italic">Aut
                    Erasmus, aut Diabolus.</hi></p><p>In 1742, Warburton published “A Critical and Philosophical Commentary on Mr
                    Pope’s Essay on Man, in which is contained a Vindication of the said Essay from
                    the Misrepresentation of M. de Resnel, the French Translator, and of Μ. de
                    Crousaz, Professor of Philosophy and Mathematics in the Academy of Lausanne, the
                    Commentator.” It was at this period, when he had the entire confidence of Pope,
                    that he advised him to complete the Dunciad, by changing the hero, and adding to
                    it a fourth book. This was accordingly executed in 1742, and the poem was
                    published early in 1743, with notes by Warburton; who, in consequence of it,
                    received his share of the abuse which Cibber liberally bestowed on both Pope and
                    his annotator. In the latter end of the same year he published complete editions
                    of “The Essay on Man,” and “The Essay on Criticism and from the specimen which
                    he there exhibited of his abilities, it may be presumed Pope determined to
                    commit to Warburton’s care the publication of those works which he should leave.
                    At Pope’s desire, he about this time revised and corrected the “Essay on Homer,”
                    as it now stands in the last edition of that translation.</p><p>The publication of the Dunciad was the last service which our author rendered
                    Pope in his lifetime. After a lingering and tedious illness, the event of which
                    had been long foreseen, this great poet died on the 30th of May 1744; and by his
                    will, dated the 12th of the preceding December, bequeathed to Warburton one half
                    of his library, and the property of all such of his works already printed as he
                    had not otherwise disposed of or alienated, and all the profits which should
                    arise from any edition to be printed after his death: but at the same time
                    directed that they should be published without any future alterations.</p><p>In 1744, Warburton turned his attention to the several attacks which had been
                    made on the Divine Legation, and defended himself in a manner which, if it did
                    not prove him to be possessed of much humility or diffidence, at least
                    demonstrated that he knew how to wield the weapons of controversy with the hand
                    of a master. His first defence now appeared, under the title of “Remarks on
                    several occasional Reflections, in answer to the Reverend Dr Middleton, Dr
                    Pococke, the Master of the Charterhouse, Dr Richard Grey, and others; serving to
                    explain and justify divers Passages in the Divine Legation, objected to by those
                    learned Writers. To which is added, a genera) Review of the Argument of the
                    Divine Legation, as far as it is yet advanced; wherein is considered the
                    Relation the several Parts bear to each other and the whole. Together with an
                    Appendix, in Answer to a late Pamphlet entitled An Examination of Mr W—’s second
                    Pro position.” This was followed next year by “Remarks on several occasional
                    Reflections, in Answer to the Reverend Doctors Stebbing and Sykes; serving to
                    explain and justify the two Dissertations in the Divine Legation, concerning the
                    command to Abraham to offer up his Son, and the Nature of the Jewish Theocracy,
                    objected to by these learned Writers. Part II. and last.” Both these answers are
                    couched in those high terms of confident superiority which marked almost every
                    performance that fell from his pen during the remainder of his life.</p><p>On the 5th of September 1745, the friendship between him and Mr Allen was more
                    closely cemented by his marriage with Miss Tucker. At that important crisis he
                    preached and published three seasonable sermons: L “A faithful Portrait of
                    Popery, by which it is seen to be the Reverse of Christianity, as it is the
                    Destruction of Morality, Piety, and Civil Liberty. Preached at St James’s,
                    Westminster, October 1745.” 2. “A Sermon occasioned by the present unnatural
                    Rebellion, &amp;c. Preached in Mr Allen’s chapel at Prior Park, near Bath,
                    November 1745.” 3.</p><p>“The Nature of National Offences truly stated. Preached on the General Fast-day,
                    December 18, 1745-6.” On account of the last of these sermons, he was again
                    involved in a controversy with his former antagonist Dr Stebbing, <pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=812" xml:id="kp-eb0721-0812-0772"/>which occasioned “An Apologetical Dedication to the Reverend Dr Henry
                    Stebbing, in Answer to his Censure and Misrepresentations of the Sermon preached
                    on the General Fast,” <hi rend="italic">&amp;c.</hi></p><p>Notwithstanding his great connections, his acknowledged abilities, and his
                    established reputation, a reputation founded on the durable basis of learning,
                    and upheld by the decent and attentive performance of every duty incident to his
                    station, we do not find that he received any addition to the preferment given
                    him in 1728 by Sir Robert Sutton (except the chaplainship to the prince of
                    Wales), until April 1746, when he was unanimously called by the Society of
                    Lincoln’s Inn to be their preacher. In November he published “A Sermon preached
                    on the Thanksgiving appointed to be observed the 9th of October, for the
                    Suppression of the late unnatural Rebellion.” In 1747 appeared his edition of
                    Shakspeare and his Preface to Clarissa; and in the same year he published, 1. “A
                    Letter from an Author to a Member of Parliament concerning Literary Property.”
                    2. “Preface to Mrs Cockburn’s Remarks upon the Principles and Reasonings of Dr
                    Ruther-forth’s Essay on the Nature and Obligations of Virtue, &amp;c.” 3.
                    “Preface to a Critical Inquiry into the Opinions and Practice of the ancient
                    Philosophers, concerning the Nature of a Future State, and their Method of
                    teaching by double Doctrine,” (by Mr Towne) 1747, second edition.</p><p>“In 1749,” says Bishop Hurd, “a very extraordinary attack was made on the moral
                    character of Mr Pope, from a quarter where it could be least expected. An
                    insignificant pamphlet, under the name of <hi rend="italic">A Patriot King,</hi>
                    was that year published by Lord Bolingbroke, or by his direction, with a preface
                    to it, reflecting highly on Mr Pope’s honour. The provocation was simply this:
                    the manuscript of that trivial declamation had been intrusted to the care of Mr
                    Pope, with the charge (as it was pretended) that only a certain number of copies
                    should be printed. Mr Pope, in his excessive admiration of his guide,
                    philosopher, and friend, took that opportunity, for fear so invaluable a
                    treasure of patriot eloquence should be lost to the public, to exceed his
                    commission, and to run off more copies, which were found, after his death, in
                    the printer’s warehouse. This charge, however frivolous, was aggravated beyond
                    measure, and, notwithstanding the proofs which Lord Bolingbroke had received of
                    Pope’s devotion to him, envenomed with the utmost malignity. Mr Warburton
                    thought it became him to vindicate his deceased friend; and he did it so
                    effectually, as not only to silence his accuser, but to cover him with
                    confusion.”</p><p>About this time the publication of Dr Middleton’s Inquiry concerning the
                    Miraculous Powers of the Christian Church, gave rise to a controversy, which was
                    managed with great warmth and asperity on both sides, and not much to the credit
                    of either party. On this occasion Warburton published in 1750 an able
                    performance, written with a degree of candour and temper which, it is to be
                    lamented, he did not always exercise. The title of it is “Julian; or a Discourse
                    concerning the Earthquake and fiery Eruption which defeated that Emperor’s
                    attempt to rebuild the Temple at Jerusalem.” A second edition of this discourse,
                    with additions, appeared in 1751. During this year, he gave the public his
                    edition of Mr Pope’s Works, with notes, in nine volumes 8vo; and in the same
                    year he printed “An Answer to a Letter to Dr Middleton, inserted in a Pamphlet
                    entitled The Argument of the Divine Legation fairly stated,” &amp;c.; and “An
                    Account of the Prophecies of Arise Evans, the Welsh Prophet in the last
                    century,” annexed to the first volume of Dr Jortin’s Remarks on Ecclesiastical
                    History</p><p>In 1752, Warburton published the first volume of a course of Sermons, preached at
                    Lincoln’s Inn, entitled “The Principles of Natural and Revealed Religion
                    occasionally opened and explained and this was two years afterwards followed by
                    a second. After the public had been some time promised, it may, from the alarm
                    which was taken, be almost said threatened with, the appearance of Lord
                    Bolingbroke’s Works, they were about this time printed. The known abilities and
                    infidelity of this nobleman had created apprehensions in the minds of many
                    people, of the pernicious effects of his doctrines; and nothing but the
                    appearance of his whole force could have convinced his friends how little was to
                    be dreaded from arguments against religion so weakly supported. Many answers
                    were soon published, but none with more acuteness, solidity, and sprightliness,
                    than “A View of Lord Bolingbroke’s Philosophy, in two Letters to a Friend.” The
                    third and fourth letters were published in 1755, with another edition of the two
                    former; and in the same year a smaller edition of the whole; which, though it
                    came into the world without a name, was universally ascribed to Warburton, and
                    was afterwards publicly owned by him. To some copies of this is prefixed an
                    excellent complimentary epistle from the president Montesquieu, dated May 26,
                    1745.</p><p>At this advanced period of his life, that preferment which his abilities might
                    have claimed, and which had hitherto been withheld, seemed to be approaching
                    towards him. In September 1754, he was appointed one of his majesty’s chaplains
                    in ordinary; and in the next year was presented to a prebend in the cathedral of
                    Durham. About this time the degree of D. D. was conferred on him by Dr Herring,
                    archbishop of Canterbury. A new impression of the Divine Legation being now
                    called for, he printed a fourth edition of the first part of it, corrected and
                    enlarged, divided into two volumes, with a dedication to the earl of Hardwicke.
                    During the same year appeared “A Sermon preached before his Grace Charles Duke
                    of Marlborough, President, and the Governors of the Hospital for the Smallpox
                    and for Inoculation, at the Parish-church of St Andrew, Holborn, April the 24th,
                    1755.” And in 1756 he published “Natural and Civil Events the Instruments of
                    God’s Moral Government; a Sermon preached on the last public Fast-day, at
                    Lincoln’s Inn Chapel.”</p><p>In 1757, Dr Warburton meeting with Mr Hume’s tract entitled “The Natural History
                    of Religion,” filled the margin of the book, as well as some interleaved slips
                    of paper, with many severe and shrewd remarks on the infidelity and naturalism
                    of the author. These he put into the hands of his friend Dr Hurd, who, making a
                    few alterations of the style, added a short introduction and conclusion, and
                    published them in a pamphlet, entitled “Remarks on Mr David Hume’s Natural
                    History of Religion, by a Gentleman of Cambridge, in a Letter to the Reverend Dr
                    Warburton.” This fierce attack upon Mr Hume gave him so much offence that he
                    thought proper to vent his indignation on the supposed author in the posthumous
                    discourse which he called his <hi rend="italic">Life;</hi> and thus to do
                    greater honour to Dr Hurd than to any other of his numerous antagonists.</p><p>Towards the end of the year 1757, Dr Warburton was promoted to the deanery of
                    Bristol; and in the beginning of the year 1760, he was, through Mr Allen’s
                    interest with Mr Pitt, afterwards earl of Chatham, advanced to the bishopric of
                    Gloucester. That great minister is known to have declared, “that nothing of a
                    private nature since he had been in office had given him so much pleasure as
                    bringing our author on the bench.” There was however another minister who
                    dreaded his promotion, and thought he saw a second Atterbury in the new bishop
                    of Gloucester; but Warburton, says Bishop Hurd, had neither talents nor
                    inclination for parliamentary intrigue or parliamentary eloquence: he had other
                    instruments of fame in his hands, and was infinitely above the vanity of being
                    caught</p><p>With the fine notion of a busy man.</p><pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=813" xml:id="kp-eb0721-0813-0773"/><p>He was consecrated on the 20th of January 1760, and on the 30th of the same month
                    preached before the House of Lords. In the next year he printed “A Rational
                    Account of the Nature and End of the Sacrament of the Lord’s Supper.” In 1762 he
                    published “The Doctrine of Grace; or the Office and Operations of the Holy
                    Spirit vindicated from the Insults of Infidelity and the Abuses of Fanaticism,”
                    2 vols. 12mo; and in the succeeding year drew upon himself much illiberal abuse
                    from some writers of the popular party, on occasion of his complaint in the
                    House of Lords, on the 15th of November 1763, against Mr Wilkes, for putting his
                    name to certain notes on the infamous “Essay on Woman.”</p><p>In 1765 he published a new edition of the second part of the Divine Legation, in
                    three volumes; and as it had now received his last hand, he presented it to his
                    great friend Lord Mansfield, in a dedication which deserves to be read. It was
                    the appendix to this edition which produced the well-known controversy between
                    him and Dr Lowth, which we have noticed elsewhere as doing no great honour, by
                    the mode in which it was conducted, to either party. In the next year he gave a
                    new and much improved edition of the Alliance between Church and State. This was
                    followed, in 1767, by a third volume of Sermons, to which is added, his first
                    triennial Charge to the Clergy of the Diocese of Gloucester; which may be safely
                    pronounced one of the most valuable discourses of the kind that is to be found
                    in our own or any other language. With this publication he closed his literary
                    course; except that he made an effort towards publishing, and actually printed,
                    the ninth and last book of the Divine Legation. This book, with one or two
                    occasional sermons, and some valuable directions for the study of theology, has
                    been given to the world in the splendid edition of his works by his friend and
                    biographer the late bishop of Worcester. That prelate confesses that the ninth
                    book of the Divine Legation displays little of that vigour of mind and fertility
                    of invention which appear so conspicuous in the former volumes; but he adds,
                    perhaps truly, that under all the disadvantages with which it papears, it is the
                    noblest effort which has hitherto been made to give a <hi rend="italic">rationale</hi> of Christianity.</p><p>While the bishop of Gloucester was thus exerting his last strength in the cause
                    of religion, he projected a method by which he hoped to render it effectual
                    service after his death. He transferred L.500 in trust to Lord Mansfield, Sir
                    Eardley Wilmot, and Mr Charles Yorke, to found a lecture, in the form of a
                    course of sermons, to prove the truth of revealed religion in general, and of
                    the Christian in particular, from the completion of the prophecies in the Old
                    and New Testament, which relate to the Christian church, especially to the
                    apostasy of Papal Rome.</p><p>It is a melancholy reflection, that a life spent in the constant pursuit of
                    knowledge frequently terminates in the loss of those powers, the cultivation and
                    improvement of which are attended to with too strict and unabated a degree of
                    ardour. This was the case with Dr Warburton; and it seems probable that the
                    decline of intellectual vigour was aggravated by the loss of his only son, a
                    promising young man, who died of a consumption but a short time before the
                    bishop, who himself closed his career on the 7th of June 1779. In August 1781
                    his widow married John Stafford Smith, B. D., who had been his chaplain, and who
                    in her right became owner of Prior Park. At her expense, and under the
                    superintendence of Bishop Hurd, a collective edition of Warburton’s Works was
                    published in 1788 in seven vols. 4to. In 1794 he added “A Discourse by way of
                    general Preface to the quarto Edition of Bishop Warburton’s Works, containing
                    some Account of the Life, Writings, and Character of the Author.” This
                    biographical work is liable to many objections. It is not only meagre and
                    unsatisfactory in many of its details, but is deeply tinctured with the narrow
                    prejudices and cool malignity of the writer. He left for publication, after his
                    own death, “Letters from a late eminent Prelate to one of his Friends.” This
                    collection has no tendency to increase our reverence for either Warburton or
                    Hurd. Here we must not entirely overlook the singular publication of Dr Parr,
                    entitled “Tracts by Warburton and a Warburtonian, not admitted into the
                    respective collections of their Works.” Lond. 1789, 8vo.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
