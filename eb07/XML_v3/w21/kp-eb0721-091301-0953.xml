                    Westerham, in the county of Kent, about the beginning of the year 1726. His
                    father was Lieutenant-general Edward Wolfe. He went into the army when very
                    young, and applying himself with unwearied assiduity to the study of his
                    profession, soon became remarkable for his knowledge and his genius. He
                    distinguished himself at the battle of Lafelt when little more than twenty, and
                    received the highest encomiums from the commanderin-chief. After the peace he
                    still continued to cultivate the art of war. He contrived to introduce the
                    greatest regularity and the exactest discipline into his corps, and at the same
                    time to preserve the affection of every soldier. In 1758 he was present as a
                    brigadier-general at the siege of Louisbourg. He landed first on the island at
                    the head of a division; and in spite of the violence of the surf, and the force
                    and well-directed fire of the enemy, drove them from their post with great
                    precipitation. The surrender of the town, which happened soon after, was in a
                    great measure owing to his activity, bravery, and skill. The fame which he
                    acquired during this siege pointed him out to Mr Pitt, who was then minister, as
                    the most proper person to command the army destined to attack Quebec. This was
                    the most difficult and the most arduous undertaking of the whole war. Quebec was
                    the capital of the French dominions in North America; it was well fortified,
                    situated in the midst of a hostile country, and defended by an army of 20,000
                    men, regulars and militia, besides a considerable number of Indian allies. The
                    troops selected for this expedition consisted of ten battalions, making up
                    altogether about 7000 men. Such was the army destined to oppose three times
                    their own number, defended by fortifications, in a country altogether unknown,
                    and in a late season in that climate for military operations. But this little
                    army, was always sanguine of success; for they were commanded by an officer who,
                    by a very uncommon magnanimity and nobleness of behaviour, had attached the
                    troops so much to his person, and inspired them with such resolution and
                    steadiness in the execution of their duty, that nothing seemed too difficult for
                    them to accomplish. The admirable skill with which his measures were planned,
                    and the prudence and vigour with which they were executed, are well known. He
                    landed his army on the northern shore of the river St Lawrence, in spite of the
                    enemy, and forced them to a battle, in which they were completely defeated. The
                    consequence of this battle was the reduction of Quebec and the conquest of
                    Canada. In the beginning of the battle General Wolfe was wounded in the wrist by
                    a musket-ball; he wrapt his handkerchief round it, continued to give his orders
                    with his usual calmness and perspicuity, and informed the soldiers that the
                    advanced parties on the front had his orders to retire, and that they need not
                    be surprised when it happened. Towards the end of the battle he received a new
                    wound in the breast; he immediately retired behind the rear rank, supported by a
                    grenadier, and laid himself down on the ground. Soon after a shout was heard,
                    and one of the officers who stood by him exclaimed, “See how they run !" The
                    dying hero asked with some emotion, “Who run ?” “The enemy,” replied the
                    officer; “they give way everywhere.” The general then said, “Pray, do one of you
                    run to Colonel Burton, and tell him to march Webb’s regiment with all speed down
                    to Charles river, to cut off the retreat of the fugitives from the bridge. Now,
                    God be praised, I shall die happy !” He then turned on his side, closed his
                    eyes, and expired.</p><p>The death of General Wolfe was a national loss universally lamented. He inherited
                    from nature an animating fervour of sentiment, an intuitive perception, an
                    extensive capacity, and a passion for glory, which stimulated him to acquire
                    every species of military knowledge that study could comprehend, or that actual
                    service could illustrate and confirm. This noble warmth of disposition seldom
                    fails to call forth and unfold all the liberal virtues of the soul. Brave above
                    all estimation of danger; generous, gentle, complacent, and humane, he was the
                    pattern of the officer, the darling of the soldier. There was a sublimity in his
                    genius which soared above the pitch of ordinary minds; and had his faculties
                    been exercised to their full extent by opportunity and action, had his judgment
                    been fully matured by age and experience, be would in all probability have
                    rivalled in reputation the most celebrated captains of antiquity. His body was
                    brought to England, and buried with military honours in Westminster Abbey, where
                    a magnificent monument is erected to his memory.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
