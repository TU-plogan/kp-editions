                    significant corrections to the OCR text, predominantly in cases of confusing "c"
                    and "e." Isolates 90 entries that were mistakenly included at the end of prior
                    entries in v1 and v2. Normalizes ordinal numbers. Separates metadata in
                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,
                    the end fragment is now joined to the start fragment, making a machine-readable
                    word.</change>

                <p><label type="entry">WILMOT, <hi rend="smallcaps">John</hi></label>, earl of
                    Rochester, a great wit in the reign of Charles IL, the son of Henry earl of
                    Rochester, was born on the 10th of April 1647, at Ditchley in Oxfordshire. He
                    was instructed in classical learning at the free-school at Burford, where he
                    obtained a quick relish of the beauties of the Latin tongue, and afterwards
                    became well versed in the authors of the Augustan age. In 1659, he was admitted
                    a nobleman of Wadham College, Oxford, where he was created A. M. He afterwards
                    travelled through France and Italy, and at his return was made one of the
                    gentlemen of the bedchamber to the king, and comptroller of Woodstock Park. In
                    1665, he went to sea, and was in the Revenge, commanded by Sir Thomas Tiddiman,
                    when an attack was made on the port of Bergen in Norway. During the whole action
                    he shewed the greatest resolution, and gained a high reputation for courage,
                    which he supported in a second expedition, but afterwards lost it in a private
                    adventure with Lord Mulgrave.</p>
                <p>Before the earl of Rochester travelled, he had indulged in the most disorderly
                    and intemperate way of living: at his return however he seemed to have got the
                    better of it entirely. But falling into the company of the courtiers, who
                    continually practised these excesses, he became so sunk in debauchery that he
                    was for five years together so addicted to drinking that during all that time he
                    was never cool enough to be master of himself. His violent love of pleasure, and
                    his disposition to extravagant mirth, carried him to great excesses. The first
                    involved him in sensuality, and the other led him into many adventures and
                    ridiculous frolics. Once disguising himself so that he could not be known by his
                    nearest friends, he set up in Tower-street for an Italian mountebank, and there
                    dispersed his nostrums for some weeks. He often disguised himself as a porter,
                    or as a beggar, sometimes to follow a mean amour; at other times he would go
                    about merely for diversion in odd shapes, and acted his part so naturally that
                    he could not be known even by his friends. In short, by his constant excesses,
                    he entirely wore out an excellent constitution before he was thirty years of
                    age. In October 1679, when recovering from a violent disease which ended in a
                    consumption, he was visited by Dr Burnet, upon an intimation that such a visit
                    would be agreeable to him. Burnet published their conferences in “Some Passages
                    of the Life and Death of John Earl of Rochester;” from which it appears, that
                    though he had lived the life of a libertine and atheist, he died the death of a
                    penitent Christian. His death happened on the 26th of July 1680. His Poems have
                    been several times printed; but when once he obtained the character of a lewd
                    and obscene writer, every thing in that strain was ascribed to him; and thus
                    many pieces not of his writing have crept into the later editions of his works.
                    The earl of Oxford observes, that he was “a man whom the Muses were fond to
                    inspire and ashamed to avow, and who practised without the least reserve that
                    secret which can make verses more read for their defects than their merits. Lord
                    Rochester’s poems have much more obscenity than wit, more wit than poetry, and
                    more poetry than politeness.” Besides three daughters, the earl left an only
                    son, Charles, who died in 1681, and thus the title became extinct.</p>
