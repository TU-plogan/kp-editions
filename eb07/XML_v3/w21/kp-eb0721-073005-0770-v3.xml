                <p><label type="entry">WALTON, <hi rend="smallcaps">Isaac</hi></label>, an early
                    writer of great popularity, was born on the 9th of August 1593, in the parish of
                    St Mary and town of Stafford. The condition of his father is not mentioned, but
                    his mother is described as the daughter of Edmund Cranmer, archdeacon of
                    Canterbury, and the niece of the archbishop. His own occupation was that of a
                    shopkeeper; but his love of literature, as well as his upright and amiable
                    simplicity of character, recommended him to the favour and friendship of many
                    individuals distinguished by their talents and station. In 1624 we find him
                    residing on the north side of Fleet-street, two doors west of Chancery-lane; and
                    in 1632 he had removed to a house in the lane. The tradition of his family
                    represented him as a Hamburg merchant, or wholesale linen-draper; but, according
                    to Anthony Wood, he followed the occupation of a sempster. He married Anne the
                    sister of Thomas Ken, afterwards bishop of Bath and Wells. While an inhabitant
                    of St Dunstan’s in the West, he was a regular attendant on the ministrations of
                    Dr Donne, then vicar of the parish; and with this witty poet and divine he
                    contracted a friendship, which was only terminated by death. Walton visited him
                    in his last sickness, and wrote a circumstantial account of his life, which in
                    1640 accompanied a collection of the dean’s Sermons. Another of his
                    distinguished friends was Sir Henry Wotton, whose life he also undertook to
                    write, and finished it about the year 1644. It was prefixed to the “Reliquiae
                    Wottonianae,” which he edited in 1651. It is to be regretted that he did not
                    execute his design of writing the lives of other two individuals connected with
                    Eton, Sir Henry Savile and John Hales, both very eminent in their generation.
                    About the year 1643, we are informed, he left London, and, with a fortune very
                    far short of what would now be called a competency, seems to have retired
                    altogether from business. While he resided in the metropolis, angling had been
                    his favourite recreation, and in that art he arrived at great skill and
                    proficiency. The result of his experience he embodied in a very pleasing volume,
                    entitled “The complete Angler, or contemplative Man’s Recreation.” Lond. 1653,
                    8vo. This work was so favourably received, that other four editions were
                    published during the author’s lifetime, namely, in 1655, 1664, 1668, and 1676.
                    To this last impression a second part, containing instructions how to angle for
                    trout or grayling, was added by his friend Charles Cotton. Of both parts there
                    are many subsequent editions, and the popularity of the work continues
                    unimpaired. An elaborate edition, with a life of the author, was published by
                    Sir John Hawkins in the year 1760. Walton having resumed his biographical
                    labours, published the life of Hooker in 1662, that of Herbert in 1670, and that
                    of Sanderson in <pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=771"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0721-0771-0731"/>1678. His Lives were afterwards collected
                    together, and in this form have repeatedly been printed. An edition, containing
                    an account of the author, together with annotations, was published by Dr Zouch.
                    York, 1796, 4to. The work, thus illustrated, reached a third impression. York,
                    1817, 2 vols. 8vo. These specimens of circumstantial biography are rendered very
                    interesting by the native kindness of the author’s disposition, and by the
                    garrulous simplicity of his narrative. In 1680 he published, but without his
                    name, “Love and Truth: two modest and peaceable Letters, concerning the
                    Distempers of the present Times: written from a quiet and conformable Citizen of
                    London, to two busie and factious Shopkeepers in Coventry.” Lond. 1680, 4to.
                    This tract was reprinted in Dr Zouch’s edition of the Lives. At the age of
                    ninety, he edited “Thealma and Clearchus; a Pastoral History in smooth and easie
                    verse: written long since by John Chalkhill, Esq <hi rend="superscript"> r</hi>.
                    an acquaintant and friend of Edmund Spencer.” Lend. 1683, 8vo. As to the author,
                    he states “that he was in his time a man generally known, and as well beloved;
                    for he was humble, and obliging in his behaviour, a gentleman, a scholar, very
                    innocent and prudent; and indeed his whole life was useful, quiet, and
                    virtuous.” Of this poem there is a recent edition. Chiswick, 1820, 12mo. The
                    name of Chalkhill is otherwise so entirely unknown, that Mr Singer, who
                    published this edition, is inclined to doubt whether the poem may not have been
                    a youthful production of its first editor. Having attained to a healthful and
                    happy old age, he died on the 15th of December 1683, at Winchester, in the
                    prebendal house of his son-in-law Dr Hawkins, and was interred in the cathedral
                    of that city. His wife died in 1662. Their son Isaac Walton having been educated
                    at Oxford, became rector of Polshot, and canon residentiary of Salisbury. He
                    died unmarried, in the year 1716. His only sister Anne was married to William
                    Hawkins, rector of Droxford, and prebendary of Winchester. Their only son,
                    William Hawkins, was the author of a well-known “Treatise of the Pleas of the
                    Crown.” (x.)</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Walton,</hi><hi rend="italic">Bryan,</hi> a very eminent
                    biblical scholar, was born in the year 1600, at Seymour in the district of
                    Cleveland in Yorkshire. He is said to have been admitted a sizar of Magdalene
                    College, Cambridge, in the month of July 1616. In 1618 he became a sizar of
                    Peter House. He took the degree of A. B. in 1619, and that of A. Μ. in 1623. He
                    left the university for a curacy and the mastership of a school in Suffolk. He
                    next removed to the metropolis, as an assistant at the church of Allhallows,
                    Bread-street; and in 1626 he was collated to the rectory of St Martin’s Orgar.
                    On the 15th of January 1635-6, he was instituted to the rectories of St
                    Giles-inthe-Fields, and of Sandon in Essex. The former he does not appear to
                    have retained. About this time, he is supposed to have been chaplain to the
                    king, and to have been collated to a prebend of St Paul’s. In 1639 he took the
                    degree of D. D. at Cambridge; and in the public act, he maintained a thesis
                    against the infallibility of the pope. His wife, Anne Claxton, died in the
                    course of the following year.</p>
                <p>Dr Walton was involved in the troubles which ensued; and in 1641 he is supposed
                    to have been dispossessed of both his rectories. Towards the close of the year
                    1642 he was ordered into custody as a delinquent. Like many other members of his
                    order, he afterwards sought a place of refuge at Oxford; and on the 12th of
                    August 1645 he was incorporated doctor of divinity. Here, among the learned
                    fugitives, he met with Dr Fuller, dean of Ely, whose daughter Jane became his
                    second wife. On his return to London, he resided in the house of his
                    father-in-law. Undismayed by the change of his circumstances, he planned and
                    executed one of the greatest, if not the very greatest, literary enterprise of
                    which his country can boast. This was the famous Polyglott Bible, of which the
                    plan appears to have been brought to considerable maturity in the year' 1652.
                    The design was approved by the Council of State, who exempted from duty all the
                    paper to be employed in the edition; and to the credit of the age it must be
                    recorded, that in the month of May 1653 subscriptions bad been obtained to the
                    amount of L.9000. Dr Walton had various coadjutors, but the very laborious task
                    of editorship devolved upon himself. As a precursor, he published “Introductio
                    ad Lectionem Linguarum Orientalium." Lond.</p>
                <p>1654, 8vo. This introduction was reprinted at London in</p>
                <p>1655. The great work itself was completed in the space of about four years, and
                    made its appearance under the title of <hi rend="italic">Biblia Sacra
                    Polyglotta,</hi> &amp;c. Lond. 1657, 6 tom. fol. In this edition, nine languages
                    are employed, but not a single book is printed in so many. The four evangelists
                    are in six, the other books of the New Testament only in five, and those of
                    Judith and the Maccabees only in three. The Prolegomena have been repeatedly
                    printed in a separate form, and are allowed by the most competent judges to be a
                    work of great erudition, as well as of great value. The last edition is that of
                    Wrangham, published at Cambridge in 1825, in 2 vols. 8vo.</p>
                <p>Among those who assisted Walton in his very arduous undertaking, we must first of
                    all mention the venerable Archbishop Usher, who not only aided and directed him
                    by his counsel, but likewise furnished him with a collation of sixteen
                    manuscripts. His learning was so variegated and so profound, that it was of no
                    small importance for the editor to have access to him on all occasions of doubt
                    and difficulty. Another able coadjutor was Dr Lightfoot, and a third was Dr
                    Pocock. The services of Abraham Wheelock, Patrick Young, Dudley Loftus, Herbert
                    Thorndike, Thomas Hyde, Thomas Greaves, and several other individuals, are
                    likewise commemorated. Selden, who possessed a great fund of oriental learning,
                    was a zealous promoter of the design; and he joined with Usher in signing a
                    recommendation, which was printed with the prospectus. He was one of those to be
                    consulted in the progress of the work, and his valuable library was open to the
                    editor.</p>
                <p>One fellow-labourer, Edmund Castell, demands a more particular notice. He not
                    only rendered important assistance to Walton, but likewise compiled a most
                    learned and elaborate work, which is always regarded as a necessary
                    accompaniment of the Polyglott. It was published under the title of “Lexico
                    Heptaglotton, Hebraicum, Chaldaicum, Syriacum, Samaritanum, Aethiopicum,
                    Arabicum, conjunction; et Persicum separation,” &amp;c. Lond. 1669, 2 tom. fol.
                    This Lexico is a work of stupendous labour; and, according to Dr Clarke, it “is
                    probably the greatest and most perfect work of the kind ever performed by human
                    industry and learning.” He was aided by Dr Lightfoot, and by some other
                    orientalists, one of whom was Beveridge, and another Golius. In the preparation
                    of this work, and in labouring at the Polyglott, Dr Castell spent seventeen
                    years, and generally sixteen or eighteen hours a day. In the progress of his
                    work, he maintained in his own house seven Englishmen, and seven foreigners, in
                    the capacity of copyists. He spent the large sum of L.12,000, and contracted
                    debt to the amount of L.1800; and the recommendations of the king and the
                    archbishop of Canterbury only procured him contributions to the amount of L.700.
                    “Though I perish,” said this learned and excellent person, “it comforts me not a
                    little to see how holy writ flourishes.” He was not however left to perish. At
                    the time of his death, which occurred in 1685, he was professor of Arabic in the
                    university of Cambridge, prebendary of Canterbury, rector of Higham Gobion in
                    Bedfordshire, and chaplain in ordinary to his majesty.</p>
                <p>Dr Walton’s next publication bears the title of“Dissertatio, in qua de Linguis
                    Orientalibus, Hebraica, Chaldaica, <pb break="no"

                    followed by Wower’s “Syntagma de Graeca et Latina Bibliorum Interpretatione.”
                    His meritorious labours were not duly appreciated by some of his contemporaries;
                    and he was very unadvisedly attacked by Dr Owen, in “Certain Considerations on
                    the Prolegomena and Appendix to the late <hi rend="italic">Biblia
                    Polyglotta</hi> " The writer was himself a man of learning; but the dangers
                    which he contemplated were imaginary, and he ventured upon ground which he could
                    not maintain against such an antagonist. His work was very ably refuted by Dr
                    Walton, in “The Considerator considered.” Lond. 1659, 8vo.<note anchored="true"

                <p>At the period of the Restoration, his great and conspicuous merits could not be
                    disregarded. He was speedily restored to his former preferments, and was
                    nominated to the bishopric of Chester. On the 2d of December 1660, he was
                    consecrated in Westminster Abbey. In March following he was one of the
                    commissioners at the Savoy conference; a conference which so strikingly
                    displayed the unmitigated bigotry of the triumphant churchmen. The bishop of
                    Chester however appears to have acted with sufficient moderation. His new
                    honours were very short and fleeting. He reached his episcopal seat on the 11th
                    of September 1661; and having soon afterwards returned to London, he died there
                    on the 29th of the ensuing November, in the sixty-second year of his age.
