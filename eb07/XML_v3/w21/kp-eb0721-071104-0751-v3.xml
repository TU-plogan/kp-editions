                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">WALES</label>, a country situated in the south-west part of
                    Britain, into which the ancient Britons retired from the persecution of the
                    Saxons. Anciently it was of greater extent than it is at present, and
                    comprehended all the country beyond the Severn; that is, besides the twelve
                    counties included in it at present, those of Herefordshire and Monmouthshire,
                    which now are reckoned a part of England, were then inhabited by three different
                    tribes of the Britons, namely the Silures, the Dimetae, and the Ordovices. The
                    Romans were never able to subdue them till the reign of Vespasian, when they
                    were reduced by Julius Frontinus, who placed garrisons in their country to keep
                    them in awe. Though the Saxons made themselves masters of all England, they
                    never could get possession of Wales, except the counties of Monmouth and
                    Hereford. About the year 870, Roderic king of Wales divided his territories
                    among his three sons; and the names of these divisions were, De-metia, or South
                    Wales; Povesia, or Powis-Land; and Ve-nedotia, or North Wales. Another division
                    is afterwards mentioned in the records, viz. North Wales, South Wales, and West
                    Wales; the last comprehending the counties of Monmouth and Hereford. The country
                    derived the name of <hi rend="italic">Wales,</hi> and the inhabitants that of
                    <hi rend="italic">Welsh,</hi> from the Saxons, who by those terms denote a
                    country and people to which they are strangers; for the Welsh in their own
                    language call their country <hi rend="italic">Cymry,</hi> and their language <hi
                    rend="italic">Cymraeg.</hi> They continued under their own princes and laws from
                    the above-mentioned period, and were never entirely subjected to the crown of
                    England till the reign of Edward I., when Llewellin ap Gryffith, prince of
                    Wales, lost both his life and dominions. Edward, the better to secure his
                    conquest, and to reconcile the Welsh to a foreign yoke, sent his queen to lie in
                    at Caernarvon, where she was delivered of a prince; to whom the Welsh, on that
                    account, the more readily submitted. Ever since that time, the eldest sons of
                    the kings of England have commonly been created princes of Wales, and as such
                    enjoy certain revenues from that country.</p>
                <p>Wales is bounded on all sides by the sea and the Severn, except on the east,
                    where it joins to the counties of Chester, Salop, Hereford, and Monmouth. Its
                    length, from the southernmost part of Glamorganshire to the extremity of
                    Flintshire north, is computed at about 113 miles; and its breadth, from the
                    river Wye east to St David’s in Pembrokeshire west, is nearly of the same
                    dimensions, being about ninety miles.</p>
                <p>After the conquest of Wales by Edward I. very material alterations were made in
                    their laws, so as to reduce them nearer to the English standard, especially in
                    the forms of their judicial proceedings; but they still retained very much of
                    their original polity, particularly their rule of inheritance, viz. that their
                    lands were equally divided among all the issue male, and did not descend to the
                    eldest son alone. By other subsequent statutes their provincial immunities were
                    still further abridged: but the finishing stroke to their dependency was given
                    by the statute 27 Henry VIII. c. 26, which at the same time gave the utmost
                    advancement to their civil prosperity, by admitting them to a thorough
                    communication of laws with the subjects of England. Thus were this brave people
                    gradually conquered into the enjoyment of true liberty; being insensibly put
                    upon the same footing and made fellow-citizens with their conquerors.</p>
                <p>It is enacted by 27 Hen. VIII. 1. That the dominions of Wales shall be for ever
                    united to the kingdom of England. 2. That all Welshmen born shall have the same
                    liberties as other king’s subjects. 3. That lands in Wales shall be inheritable
                    according to the English tenures and rules of descent. 4. That the laws of
                    England, and no other, shall be used in Wales; besides many other regulations of
                    the police of this principality. And the 34th and 35th Hen. VIII. c. 26,
                    confirms the same, adds further regulations, divides it into twelve shires, and
                    in short reduces it to the same order in which it stands at this day; differing
                    from the kingdom of England in only a few particulars. See <hi rend="smallcaps"
