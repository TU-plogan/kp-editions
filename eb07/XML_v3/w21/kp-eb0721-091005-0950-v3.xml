                    the year 1679. His father, James Wodrow, a man of piety and learning, had been
                    licensed to preach in 1673; but during the times of persecution he obtained no
                    settled charge, and was obliged to live a considerable time under concealment,
                    occasionally preaching to the proscribed presbyterians in the west of Scotland.
                    After the Revolution, he became one of the ministers of Glasgow; but resigned
                    his pastoral charge in 1692, on being elected professor of divinity in that
                    university. Robert, his second son, entered the university in 1691; and after
                    passing through the usual academical course, with the view of qualifying himself
                    for the sacred ministry, he became a student of divinity under his father. About
                    the same time (in 1698) he was chosen librarian to the university; an office
                    which he held for four years, availing himself of the opportunities it afforded
                    for carrying on his literary and antiquarian pursuits, and also for becoming
                    acquainted with many persons of eminence, with whom, in after life, he
                    maintained a regular correspondence. On leaving the university, he resided for a
                    short time in the family of Sir John Maxwell of Nether Pollock, one of the
                    senators of the College of Justice; and having offered himself as a probationer
                    to the presbytery of Paisley, he was licensed to preach the gospel in March
                    1703. In the summer following, the parish of Eastwood, where Sir John Maxwell
                    resided, became vacant by the death of the Rev. Matthew Crawford, the author of
                    a history of the Church of Scotland (a work of some value, which still remains
                    unpublished); and Wodrow having received an unanimous call from the heritors,
                    elders, and congregation, to supply the charge, he was ordained minister of that
                    parish on the 28th of October 1703. As Eastwood was at the time one of the
                    smallest parishes in the west of Scotland, he was the better enabled to devote
                    his leisure hours to the prosecution of his favourite pursuits, which then
                    included natural history as well as antiquities. To Edward Lhuyd, the learned
                    keeper of the Ashmolean Museum at Oxford, he writes in August 1790, “My lott is
                    by providence cast in the parish of Eastwood, and my house within a quarter of a
                    mile from the Aldhous-bourn, where you and I were a-lithoscoping. My pastorall
                    charge does not allow me that time I once had to follow out these subterranean
                    studyes, but my inclination is just the same as when I saw you, or rather
                    greater; and I take it to be one of the best of diversions from more serious
                    work, and in itself a great duty, to view and admire my Maker in his works as
                    weel as his word. I have gott together some store of our fossiles hereabout from
                    our marle, our limestone, &amp;c., and heartily wish I had the knowing Mr Lhuyd
                    here to pick out what he wants, and to help me to classe a great many species I
                    know not what to make of.”</p><p>Throughout the whole of his extensive correspondence, Wodrow evinces his
                    inquisitive turn of mind, thirsting to acquire information on all subjects,
                    whether as regarded science, literature, or the state of religion; and he often
                    apologizes for his “Athenian disposition,” or, as in one place he more quaintly
                    terms it, “his Athenian or queristicall temper.” Thus, soon after his settlement
                    at Eastwood, we find him availing himself of his acquaintance with the Rev.
                    Patrick Simpson of Renfrew, and other aged ministers, who had been ordained
                    before the Restoration, to glean their recollections of the more eminent
                    presbyterians who flourished during the period usually called the Second
                    Reformation; and many of their memorials are treasured up in his MS. volumes of
                    Analecta. These pursuits, however, never interfered with his parochial duties,
                    and his success and faithfulness as a Christian minister endeared him to his own
                    people, while his reputation as a preacher was considerable; yet, not being
                    given to change, he resisted all attempts made to translate him to some more
                    important field of labour in the church, to Glasgow in 1712, to Stirling in
                    1717, to the same place in 1726, and finally to Renfrew in 1729. He was regular
                    in his attendance on the several ecclesiastical courts, and he availed himself
                    of his periodical visits to Edinburgh during the meetings of the General
                    Assembly to prosecute his historical researches. As might have been expected
                    from a person of his habits, pursuits, and education, he took a lively interest
                    in all ecclesiastical proceedings; and in questions involving matters either of
                    sound doctrine, or of discipline and church government, he was invariably found
                    on the popular side. Thus we find him a steady opponent to the imposition of the
                    abjuration oath, hostile to the restoration of lay-patronage, and taking a
                    decided though <pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=951" xml:id="kp-eb0721-0951-0911"/>reluctant part in the well-known case of his
                    father’s successor, Professor Simson of Glasgow, who was finally deposed from
                    his office for teaching erroneous doctrines. However much he might lament the
                    exercise of the powers conferred by the obnoxious act alluded to, which was
                    passed by the Jacobite party for the evident purpose of subverting the church as
                    an establishment, he uniformly inculcated submission to the civil power in such
                    matters, and used his best endeavours to promote peace and harmony in cases of
                    disputed settlements. It might not indeed be possible to overestimate the amount
                    of injury done to the interests of religion, and of the country at large, by
                    this act of Queen Anne, restoring to lay-patrons the exercise of a civil right,
                    in regard to the presentation of ministers to vacant parishes, without some
                    efficient check on its due exercise. In his MS. correspondence we find Wodrow
                    often expressing his deep-felt regrets at the evil effects it was then beginning
                    to produce. “If the Lord open not a door of relief (so he writes in 1717), we
                    are in the utmost hazard of a corrupt ministry.” And the reiterated expression
                    of his fears of “a corrupt ministry,” and his remarks on “the servile crouching
                    (of the probationer) to every thing his patron happens to be for,” were but too
                    fully justified by the declining state of the church during the last century.
                    Looking at its effects during Wodrow’s own time, it was the primary cause of
                    ejecting from the bosom of the church some of her most faithful ministers, of
                    alienating the affections of the humbler classes of the people, who retained a
                    longing after the fruits of gospel ministrations, and of fostering in those who
                    continued within its pale a growing laxity of principle, however outwardly its
                    standards were professed; and thus, while no adequate means were provided for
                    the spiritual wants of an increasing population, and no attempts made to win
                    back to their fold the people who had left it in search of more faithful and
                    devoted pastors, the church as an establishment seemed fast verging into a state
                    of languor and spiritual death. But it would be out of place to enlarge on such
                    a topic, even if Wodrow had filled a more conspicuous situation in the church.
                    His reputation is founded on his literary labours as a diligent and successful
                    investigator of the history of the church prior to his own times.</p><p>The work by which Mr Wodrow is best known, is “The History of the Sufferings of
                    the Church of Scotland from the Restoration to the Revolution.” Edinb. 1721-2, 2
                    vols. fol. It was the labour of many years. In 1717, having prepared the first
                    portion of it, the manuscript was submitted to George Ridpath and other literary
                    friends, and he profited by their suggestions. Two years later, the plan was
                    laid before the General Assembly, when it was cordially approved of, and an act
                    was passed recommending the members of assembly and the several ministers of the
                    church to subscribe for copies, and “to deal” with such in their bounds as were
                    well disposed to encourage the work, “now ready for the press.” He obtained by
                    those means a most respectable list of subscribers; and on its publication, the
                    work being dedicated to George the First, copies of it were presented, through
                    Dr Fraser, to the king, the queen, the prince and princess of Wales, by all of
                    whom it was most graciously received. In fact, the reception of the work by the
                    public must have been gratifying to the author; and he appears from his
                    correspondence to have received with comparative indifference some scurrilous
                    attempts to depreciate his labours by the nonjuring episcopalians, or rather by
                    one of their adherents, Alexander Bruce, advocate, first in an anonymous tract,
                    “The Scottish Behemoth dissected, in a Letter to Mr Robert Wodrow, &amp;c;”
                    Edin. 1722, folio; and then in the preface to a Life of Archbishop Sharpe, 1723,
                    8vo. Mr Bruce next announced, in 1724, a great work, an “Impartial History of
                    the Affairs in Church and State in Scotland from the Reformation to the
                    Revolution,” in two volumes folio. He did not survive long enough to make much
                    progress in this work, which was taken up by Bishop Keith, who published only
                    the first volume in 1734, bringing the history down to the year 1568. Keith’s
                    history is only important as a collection of materials, for the author was
                    equally destitute of acuteness and liberality. To what extent he may have
                    profited by Bruce’s labours, is nowhere stated.</p><p>It does not appear in what manner Wodrow’s History was again brought under the
                    notice of George the First; but his majesty, “to certify our esteem of the said
                    author and his works, by bestowing on him some mark of our bounty,” ordered the
                    sum of one hundred guineas to be paid to the Rev. Robert Wodrow by the Treasury.
                    This grant is dated the 26th of April 1725; and such a mark of royal favour,
                    wholly unexpected on Wodrow’s part, was well bestowed on one whose labours
                    served by contrast to exhibit in lively colours the advantages which were
                    secured to Great Britain by the Hanoverian succession. In more recent times
                    public attention was directed to the work by the high eulogium of Mr Fox on its
                    fidelity and impartiality; and the demand having increased its price beyond the
                    means of ordinary purchasers, a new edition in a more commodious form was
                    published at Glasgow in 1830, 4 vols. 8vo, with a memoir of the author prefixed,
                    by Robert Burns, D. D., one of the ministers of Paisley. The work itself was
                    seasonably undertaken, the materials were ample, and in general not difficult of
                    access; the events were still recent, and many of those who had experienced the
                    hardships and sufferings of the times were either still alive or had been
                    personal friends of the author; and he brought to the task a singular degree of
                    industry, and a fidelity and impartiality which compensated for his want of
                    literary skill and elegance of composition; and by incorporating such a mass of
                    original and authentic documents, he has rendered his work interesting by the
                    copiousness and minuteness of its details, no less than by exhibiting an
                    appalling picture of the times.</p><p>The publication of this great work had no effect in relaxing Wodrow’s literary
                    ardour. It had always been with him a cherished plan to form a series of
                    biographical memoirs of the more eminent ministers in the church of Scotland;
                    and he took every opportunity of collecting materials for that design. Before
                    proceeding with this task, he wrote a memoir of his father, Professor Wodrow,
                    who was well entitled by his learning and usefulness to such a mark of filial
                    affection and regard. He commences this memoir with the following remark: “When
                    I have a design of making all the collections I can now recover, concerning the
                    lives of persons in this church and nation, remarkable for piety and usefulness,
                    the apostolical rule of shewing first piety at home, and requiting parents,
                    seems to lead me to begin with my worthy and excellent father.” It is dated
                    February 5th, 1724, and the MS. remained in the possession of the family for
                    more than a century. This “Life of James Wodrow, A. M., Professor of Divinity in
                    the University of Glasgow,” was published at Edinburgh in 1828, under the
                    direction of the late Dr John Campbell, one of the ministers of that city. The
                    series of lives, chiefly compiled between 1726 and 1733, forms ten volumes in
                    folio, with four quarto volumes of appendix. These volumes are preserved in the
                    library of the University of Glasgow; and a selection was commenced in 1834 for
                    the members of the Maitland Club, under the title of “Collections upon the Lives
                    of the Reformers and most eminent Ministers of the Church of Scotland.” This
                    work is certainly not the most important of Wodrow’s labours. The lives are
                    compiled and filled with extracts from works now much better known and more
                    accessible than in his days, and being in most instances only first draughts
                    hastily put together, the style is remarkably careless and slovenly. The lives
                    already printed, however, are rendered of much greater value by the copious
                    illustrations of the editor, Mr <pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=952" xml:id="kp-eb0721-0952-0912"/>W.
                    J. Duncan, whose researches have been most assiduous and successful.</p><p>Wodrow’s studious habits appear to have injured his health; and during the latter
                    years of his life his usual pursuits were often interrupted by sickness, and he
                    at length sunk under a gradual decline on the 21 st of March 1734, in the 55th
                    year of his age. In the year 1708 he was married to Margaret, daughter of
                    Patrick Warner, minister of Irvine, and grand-daughter of William Guthrie,
                    minister of Fenwick, author of a well-known practical treatise, “The Trial of a
                    saving Interest in Christ.” Of a family of sixteen children, nine, with their
                    mother, survived him. His last illness he bore with much Christian fortitude and
                    faith in the gospel, thus giving “a testimony in his practical experience to the
                    efficacy of those holy truths which he preached so faithfully, and vindicated so
                    nobly by his writings.”</p><p>In the course of his researches Mr Wodrow had industriously formed an extensive
                    and important collection of manuscripts, chiefly relating to ecclesiastical
                    affairs in Scotland. Some years after his death, the collection was offered for
                    sale by his family. In May 1742, a portion of the MSS. was purchased by
                    direction of the General Assembly, and this portion now remains the property of
                    the Church. Fifty years later (in 1792) the great mass of his other MSS. and
                    printed tracts was sold to the Faculty of Advocates, with the exception of his
                    Biographical Collections (already mentioned), which were obtained about the same
                    time by the University of Glasgow. In June 1828, the Faculty of Advocates
                    likewise secured, what cannot fail to be esteemed an important accession to the
                    Wodrow Manuscripts, 1st, his “Analecta,” in six volumes, closely written, being
                    a kind of note-book or diary, in which he has preserved a valuable and amusing
                    record of literary intelligence, as well as remarkable occurrences, and the news
                    of the day; 2d, a collection of his own letters, in three volumes, closely
                    written (the first volume not being discovered), from March 1709 to December
                    1731, comprising copies of nearly 600 letters, which are well worthy of
                    publication; and, 3d, the regular series of Letters addressed to him by literary
                    persons, or by friends and relations, arranged by himself in chronological
                    order, in twenty-two volumes 4to, and containing upwards of 3880 letters,
                    between the years 1694 and 1733. In mentioning these collections, it may be
                    proper to add, that, for illustrating the literary and ecclesiastical history of
                    the period which they embrace, the publication of no similar works would be of
                    greater importance than that of Wodrow’s Analecta, with an extensive but
                    judicious selection from his Correspondence. (c, c. c.)</p></div></body></text></TEI>
