                <p><label type="entry">MACHIAVELLI, <hi rend="smallcaps">Nicoo</hi></label>, for
                    many years secretary of the republic of Florence, and justly celebrated for his
                    political, historical, and other writings, was born at Florence on the 3d of May
                    1469, being descended from a family which traced its origin up to the ancient
                    marquises of Tuscany, particularly to the Marquis Hugo, who lived about the
                    middle of the ninth century. The Machiavellis were signors or lords of
                    Monte-Spertoli; but preferring the right of citizenship in Florence to the
                    useless conservation of privileges which were daily becoming more and more
                    obnoxious to the rising commonwealth, they prudently submitted to its laws in
                    order to accept employment in the highest offices of the magistracy. This family
                    was one of those attached to the Guelfic party which abandoned Florence in the
                    year 1260, after the defeat at Monte-Aperti. But their secession was merely
                    temporary. Having returned to their native country, they regained their
                    influence, and occupied some of the first offices of the state; no less than
                    thirteen of their number having held the situation of gonfaloniere of justice,
                    and fifty-three that of prior, dignities which were then considered as the most
                    important in the republic. The father of Machiavelli was a jurisconsult, and
                    lived in a state but little removed from poverty. His mother, who appears to
                    have been a woman of talent, loved poetry, and composed verses with facility. It
                    is believed that, about the year 1494, he was placed under the-tuition of the
                    learned Marcello di Virgilio, professor of Greek and Latin literature, and the
                    translator of Dioscorides. How long he remained under the care of this master,
                    or what advantages he derived from his instructions, has not been ascertained.
                    But, five years later, when he had scarcely completed his twenty-ninth year, he
                    was preferred, amongst four competitors, to the employment of chancellor of the
                    second chancery of the Signory; a few months afterwards, he was appointed, by
                    the Signory and the colleges, secretary to the ten magistrates of liberty and
                    peace, which constituted the general government of the republic; and with this
                    employment he continued invested for about fourteen years and a half. His
                    ordinary occupations, when he resided at Florence, comprehended the political
                    correspondence, both internal and external, the recording of the deliberations
                    of the council of magistrates, and the redaction of treaties with foreign
                    states.</p>
                <p>But the Florentine government, justly appreciating the talents of Machiavelli,
                    were not long in extending his functions; and he was in consequence successively
                    intrusted with no less than twenty-three foreign legations, besides frequent
                    commissions to the cities dependent on the republic. The first mission on which
                    he was despatched was to France, where he arrived in 1500, soon after the
                    raising of the siege of Pisa. Louis XII. had furnished to the Florentines troops
                    and artillery to form the siege of that place; and the republic had sent to the
                    camp two commissioners, besides its secretary Machiavelli, who carried on the
                    correspondence. The Pisans, however, negociated with the king, and at the same
                    time gained over the principal officers in the besieging army. The French troops
                    were to be paid by the Florentines, but some delay having occurred in forwarding
                    their pay, they availed themselves of this as a pretext, and having disbanded,
                    the siege was in consequence raised. The French king reproached the Florentines
                    for the disgrace which had thus been brought on his arms; and it was to appease
                    him, and if possible to obtain fresh succours, that they sent to France
                    Machiavelli, and Francisco della Casa, who had been one of the commissioners in
                    the camp before Pisa. During this negociation, which lasted five months, the
                    deputies followed the court to Saint-Pierre-le-Moutier, Montargis, Melun, Blois,
                    Nantes, and Tours. They had several audiences of the king, and his minister
                    Cardinal d’Amboise; but these led to no satisfactory result. The envoys were
                    continually met with the same reproaches, and the court was only appeased by the
                    reimbursement of the sums which the king had advanced to the troops.<note

                <p>In the year 1502 Machiavelli was sent to the Duke di Valentino (Cesare Borgia) at
                    Imola, and next to Rome. He also went a second time to France, and afterwards to
                    Siena, to Piombino, and to Perugia. In 1507 he proceeded by Geneva to Constance,
                    and from thence to Bolzano, at that time the residence of the Emperor
                    Maximilian, with whom he treated of important affairs. The relation of this
                    mission is printed amongst his complete works, under the title of <hi
                    rend="italic">Rap-porto di cose della Magna, fatto</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >questo</hi><hi rend="italic">di</hi> 17 <hi rend="italic">giugno</hi> 1508. In
                    1510 he re-appeared in France, and, after passing about two months at Blois,
                    witnessed the opening of the national council at Tours. A fourth mission to the
                    court of Louis XII. is commonly referred to the following year, 1511; but it
                    appears uncertain whether it was actually undertaken. It may with truth be said,
                    however, that if Machiavelli failed to secure the complete independence of his
                    country, this proceeded from no îàult of his own; inasmuch as the accomplishment
                    of such an object would have required more confidence on the part of his
                    fellow-citizens, greater harmony between the different opinions which then
                    divided the city, and times less turbulent and unpropitious. But the glory
                    cannot be denied him of· having attempted this noble enterprise, and devoted to
                    its accomplishment all his genius, and all the influence which he was permitted
                    to exercise in the conduct of public affairs.</p>
                <p>This is fully established by his political correspondence, which, besides, is in
                    the highest degree valuable and interesting. His despatches, indeed, form one of
                    the most amusing and instructive collections extant. In them we meet with none
                    of that mystical and verbose jargon which is so common in modern state-papers.
                    The narratives are clearly and agreeably written, and the remarks on men and
                    things are equally shrewd and judicious. We are introduced into the presence of
                    men who, during twenty years, swayed the destinies of Europe. Their wit and
                    their folly, their gloom and their gaiety, are alike exposed to us; we are
                    admitted to overhear their familiar talk, to see the masters of the world in
                    undress, and to observe the manifestations of their real characters. It is
                    interesting and curious to recognise, in circumstances which commonly elude the
                    notice of historians, the feeble violence and the shallow cunning of Louis XII.;
                    the bustling insignificance of Maximilian, a prince afflicted with an impotent
                    desire of renown, rash yet timid, obstinate yet fickle, always in a hurry, yet
                    always too late; the fierce and haughty energy which gave dignity to the
                    eccentricities of the magnificent Julius; and the soft, smooth, calm, graceful
                    manners which masked the insatiable ambition and deadly hatred of Cesare Borgia.
                    The meeting of the Florentine secretary and the Duke di Valentino, of the
                    greatest speculative and the ablest practical statesman of the age, is a
                    memorable occurrence in the history of both. Upon two important occasions
                    Machiavelli was admitted to the society of Borgia; once, at the moment when his
                    splendid villany had achieved its most signal triumph, when he caught in one
                    snare, and crushed at one blow, all his most formidable rivals;<note

                    deadliest enemy of his house. These interviews are fully described in the
                    correspondence. Several writers have supposed that there existed a close and
                    intimate connexion between these remarkable men, and the secretary-envoy has
                    even been accused of prompting the crimes of this artful and merciless tyrant;
                    but, from the official documents, it is evident that their intercourse, though
                    ostensibly of an amicable, was in reality of a hostile description. “It cannot
                    be doubted, however,” says an able writer, “that the imagination of Machiavelli
                    was strongly impressed, and his speculations on government coloured, by the
                    observations which he made on the singular character, and equally singular
                    fortunes, of a man who, under such disadvantages, had achieved such exploits;
                    who, when sensuality, varied through innumerable forms, could no longer
                    stimulate his sated mind, found a more powerful and durable excitement in the
                    intense thirst of empire and revenge; who emerged from the sloth and luxury of
                    the Roman purple the first prince and general of the age; who, after acquiring
                    sovereignty by destroying his enemies, acquired popularity by destroying his
                    tools; who had begun to employ for the most salutary ends the power which he had
                    attained by the most atrocious means; who tolerated within the sphere of his
                    iron despotism no plunderer or oppressor but himself; and who fell at last,
                    amidst the mingled curses and regrets of a people, of whom his genius had been
                    the wonder, and might have been the salvation.”<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Review,</hi> vol.
                    xlv. pp. 283, 284.</p></note> Some of the crimes of Borgia, which appear to us
                    the most revolting, would not have been viewed with equal horror by an Italian
                    of the fifteenth century; and, besides, patriotic feeling might induce
                    Machiavelli to regard with indulgence and regret the memory of the only leader
                    capable of defending the independence of Italy against the confederate spoilers
                    who were then plotting the dismemberment of that divided and unhappy
                    country.</p>
                <p>But whilst Machiavelli deeply regretted the misfortunes of his country, he
                    clearly discerned the cause and the remedy of these. It was the military system
                    of the Italian people which had extinguished their valour and discipline,
                    destroyed their independence, and rendered their wealth an easy prey to every
                    foreign plunderer. Machiavelli projected a scheme for abolishing the practice of
                    employing mercenary troops, and organizing a national militia; and the exertions
                    which he made to accomplish this grand object are alike honourable to his
                    understanding and his patriotism. He studied with assiduity the art of war, and
                    made himself master of all its details<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p><hi rend="superscript"> â</hi> See his treatise <hi
                    rend="italic">DeW Arte della Guerra,</hi> passim.</p></note>? When levies were
                    decreed, he flew from place to place to superintend the execution of his design,
                    and availed himself of every circumstance which could contribute to its success.
                    For a time the scheme promised well, and the new troops acquitted themselves
                    respectably. But the fury of parties continued to increase, and the tide of
                    misfortune came on before the barriers which should have withstood it were
                    prepared. The emperor and the pope wished to re-establish the Medici, and the
                    moment was favourable for such an enterprise. Florence was then governed by the
                    gonfaloniere Soderini, a man equally presumptuous and feeble, who obstinately
                    adhered to France, without discerning that that power was not in a condition to
                    afford him any aid. It was in reference to this inconsiderate policy that
                    Machiavelli observed, “The good fortune of France has made us lose half the
                    state; her bad fortune will cause the loss of our liberty.”<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Speaking, on one occasion, of the alliance
                    with France, he observed, <hi rend="italic">che</hi><hi rend="italic">la

                    not long in being verified. As soon as the French armies had lost their
                    superiority in Italy, the storm burst upon Florence. In 1512, the pope and the
                    emperor combined against their common enemy, and, contrary to the faith of
                    treaties, imposed a contribution of a hundred thousand florins. Machiavelli flew
                    through· the territory of the republic, to examine the state of the fortresses,
                    and organize a vigorous resistance; but all his efforts were unavailing, and
                    divided Florence soon opened its gates to the Medici, who re-conquered at once
                    their property and their ancient authority.</p>
                <p>This revolution, which caused the ruin of the gonfaloniere, proved also the
                    signal for the fall of the secretary. The new Signory immediately attacked him
                    in two decrees, dated the 8th and 10th of November 1514. By the one he was
                    deprived, “absolutely despoiled,” of his offices of chancellor and secretary to
                    the ten magistrates of liberty and peace; by the other he was exiled for a year
                    to a part of the Florentine territory, which he was forbidden to quit under the
                    penalty of incurring the displeasure of the Signory. A third decree, dated the
                    17th of the same month, prohibited him from entering the palace of the high and
                    magnificent signors. On this subject Ginguené has omitted some facts.
                    “Machiavelli,” says he, “after fourteen years of service useful to his country,
                    was first deprived of his employment, and then confined for a year to the
                    territory of the republic, with a prohibition not to set foot in the palace of
                    the Signory. Nor was this the term, it was in fact only the commencement of his
                    misfortunes.” And he adds in a note, that the fate of the secretary was decided
                    by three decrees of the 8 th, 1 Oth, and 17 th of November. There appears to be
                    some confusion in this statement. The decree of the 17th was evidently a
                    mitigation of that of the 10th. The latter banished him for a year, and
                    intimated to him that he was not to leave the territory of the republic; that
                    is, it ordained him to quit Florence in order to live in the Florentine
                    dominions, exclusive of the city properly so called. The third decree, dated the
                    17th, only prohibited him from entering the palace of the Signory, without
                    ordaining him to leave the city; but another decree of the same date was
                    published, in which he was perhiitted to enter the palace during the whole of
                    the day of the 17th; and the same liberty was granted him on the 4th of December
                    1512, and on the 21st of March and 9th of July 1513. Ginguené has refuted some
                    of the statements published respecting the treatment Machiavelli is alleged to
                    have experienced after the return of the Medici; but it is not the less true, as
                    appears by the subsequent modifications of the original decree, to the extent
                    already stated, that the removal of the secretary was considered as an affair of
                    some difficulty, and one the accomplishment of which required management and
                    address. But when this object had been effected, he found himself exposed to the
                    greatest dangers. Accused of being concerned in the conspiracy formed by Capponi
                    and Boscoli against Cardinal de’ Medici, afterwards Leo X., he was thrown into
                    prison, and put to the torture, which he endured with unflinching resolution. “I
                    have been near losing my life,” said he, “which God and my own innocence have
                    saved; I have supported all evils, including imprisonment and others.” On the
                    accession of Leo X. he was included in an amnesty, and owed his deliverance to
                    the generosity of that liberal and accomplished pontiff.</p>
                <p>These terrible trials, which extraordinary courage can alone withstand, attest
                    the energy and the force of character which belonged to the fallen statesman.
                    Instead of yielding to despondency, he sought for an alleviation of his lot in
                    study and in literature; and it is to his misfortunes that we are indebted for

                    to be classed amongst the most remarkable monuments of modern literature. From
                    his retreat, however, he wrote to the friends whom he had still preserved,
                    signifying his desire to be again emfjioyed in the conduct of affairs; and his
                    wishes in this respect were to a certain extent gratified. After the death of
                    Lorenzo de’ Medici, Leo X. who possessed great influence in the government of
                    Florence, recalled Machiavelli, and requested him to point out the means of
                    reforming the administration. In 1521, there was confided to him a mission to
                    the minor brothers at Carpi. He was next ordered to fortify anew the city, and
                    to treat of some affairs with Francisco Guicciardini, then governor of Romagna.
                    Finally, he was employed in the army of the league against Charles V. This
                    commission was the last remarkable occupation of his life. He returned to
                    Florence in one of the last days of May 1527, and having, not long afterwards,
                    suffered much inconvenience from pains in the stomach, he took a medicine in
                    which he had great faith for relieving this disorder; but being soon attacked by
                    violent spasms in the bowels, be expired on the 22d of June, at the age of
                    fifty-eight, after having received all the sacraments of the church. The
                    following lett⅛r from his son Pietro to Francisco Nelli, professor at Pisa,
                    annihilates all the fables which have been circulated respecting his death :—“I
                    cannot tell you without tears, that, on the 22d of this month, our father Nicoo
                    died of pains in the bowels, caused by a medicine which he had taken two days
                    before. He was made to confess his sins by the friar Matteo. who kept him
                    company till his death. Our father has left us in great poverty, as you know.”
                    Machiavelli was in his person of the ordinary size, his complexion was of an
                    olive hue, and his physiognomy animated and expressive; in conversation he was
                    at once simple and lively, and his repartee was prompt and piquant. Conversing
                    one day with Clodio Tolooeeo, the latter said to him, “At Florence the men have
                    less science, and are less learned, than at Siena, always excepting yourself to
                    which Machiavelli replied, *∙ At Siena the men are greater fools than at
                    Florence-not even excepting you.” Some one having remarked to him that he had
                    taught princes to be tyrants, he replied. If I have taught princes to be
                    tyrants, I have also taught the people to destroy tyrants.” He was interred in
                    the church of Santa-Croce, in the burying-płace of bis Laoeiìy: but for more

                    treatise.</p>
                <p>At the head of the works generally admitted to have established beyond all
                    dispute the reputation of Machiavelli as a profound thinker, and a politician of
                    inexhaustible genius, may be placed those lettersor despatches, published under
                    the title of <hi rend="italic">Legazioni,</hi> of which we have already spoken
                    incidentally. Ginguené has observed, in reference to these letters, that one
                    would not willingly read the collection, which he considers somewhat diffuse,
                    but that, in regard to the character and life of the secretary, and the history
                    of his own time, it may be consulted with advantage. In this opinion, however,
                    we cannot by any means concur. The collection is suited to the taste of the age,
                    and the country to which it belongs; nor has this taste materially changed; for
                    even the Italian diplomatists of the present day frequently indulge in similar
                    details, introducing such arguments as they think fitted to support their
                    observations, and to create a favourable impression of their zeal and industry.
                    That the <hi rend="italic">Legazioni</hi> sometimes descended into minutiae
                    which may be considered as trifling or irrelevant, we readily admit; but even
                    these particulars are by no means devoid of interest; and as to the entire
                    collection, a reader of intelligence cannot peruse it without being at once
                    amused and instructed by it.</p>
                <p>The seven books on the Art of War <hi rend="italic">ÇDeli Arte della Guerra)</hi>
                    show that Machiavelli was profoundly conversant with the principles of military
                    science. An Italian writer, adverting to this circumstance, observes, that such
                    knowledge is not only wonderful in a man devoted to civil occupations, but might
                    even be considered as extraordinary in an old general. According to the author
                    of the preface to the edition of 1813, Machiavelli had acquired this insight
                    into military science in consequence of profound meditations on the works of the
                    ancient Romans, who may be regarded as the first masters of the art of war; and,
                    in fact, the combinations of the secretary have constant reference to those of
                    Vegetius. His principal object was to establish the superiority of infantry, at
                    a time when this branch of the service had fallen into general discredit; and
                    his theories fortunately attracted so much regard, that to him may, in a great
                    measure, be attributed the return of sound tactics, and the perfection to which
                    the art of war subsequently attained. Algarotti, in his fourth discourse on the
                    studies of Palladio, gives us to understand that that celebrated architect
                    learned the military art in the writings of the Florentine secretary; Frederick
                    II. has described, in agreeable verses, some of his military precepts; and there

                    express here any opinion. But the treatise is able and interesting; as a
                    commentary on the history of the times it is invaluable; whilst the ingenuity,
                    grace, and perspicuity of the style, and the eloquence and animation of
                    particular passages, must give pleasure even to readers who take no interest in
                    the subject which the author treats with so much skill and ability.<note

                    officer of distinguished merit in the service of the king of Spain. After some
                    preliminary conversation, Fabrizio expresses lit regret that those who in later
                    times affected the manners of the old Romans, should select for imitation their
                    most trwcanŗ τ irsrīts. This leads to a discourse on the decline of military
                    discipline, and the best means of restoring it. The institutam. of ĩhe
                    Florentine militia, to which we have already alluded, is very ably defended; and
                    several improvements are suggested ia the details.</p><p>The Swiss and the
                    Spaniards were ar tins tune regarded as the best soldiers in Europe. The Swiss
                    battalion consisted of pikemen in deep formation, and bore a close resemblance
                    to the Grecian phalanx. The Spaniards, like the soldiers of Rome, were armed <pb
                    corresp="kp-eb0713-9834-0647" xml:id="pbn7647"/> with the sword and the shield.
                    But the victories gained by Flaminius and Aemilius over the Macedonian kings
                    seemed to prove that the weapons used by the legions were superior to those of
                    the phalanx. And the same experiment had been recently tried with the same
                    result at the battle of Ravenna, “one of those tremendous days into which human
                    folly and wickedness compress the whole devastation of a famine or a plague.” In
                    that dreadful conflict, the infantry of Aragon, deserted by their allies, hewed
                    a passage through the thickest of the imperial pikes, and effected an unbroken
                    retreat, in the face of the gensdarmerie of De Foix and the artillery of Este.
                    Machiavelli, struck with these facts, proposes to combine both systems; to arm
                    the foremost lines with the pike, for the purpose of repulsing cavalry, and
                    those in the rear with the sword, as being a handy weapon, adapted to almost
                    every exigency.. He expresses the highest admiration of the military science of
                    the ancient Romans, and the greatest contempt for theŵaxims in vogue amongst the
                    Italian commanders of the preceding generation; he prefers infantry to cavalry,
                    and fortified camps to fortified towns; he recommends the substitution of rapid
                    movements and decisive engagements for the languid and dilatory operations of
                    his countrymen; and he attaches but little importance to the invention of
                    gunpowder, which, he seems to think, ought scarcely to produce any change in the
                    mode of arming or disposing troops. The artillery of those days was ill
                    constructed, ill served, and consequently of little use in the field of battle;
                    this arm was then in a rude, inefficient state, and hence might in a great
                    measure be disregarded in a general system of tactics; but if Machiavelli could
                    have foreseen the improvements which were destined to take place, particularly
                    in point of mobility, he would have been convinced that a change both in the
                    mode of arming and disposing troops would in consequence become necessary, and
                    that the deep formations of ancient times durst no longer be opposed to the
                    ravages of shot, shells, grape, canister, and the other destructive missiles
                    discharged by modern artillery.</p></note></p>

                    that his views and observations had always a character of justness, depth, and
                    gravity. The Roman republic, in its constitution and its establishments,
                    contained the germs of its greatness; and the inroads committed upon these were
                    the causes of its decline. Machiavelli followed this fatal progress beyond the
                    history of Livy ∙, he discerned and meditated on it in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Annals</hi> and in the <hi rend="italic">History</hi> of Tacitus. He there
                    found not only facts, but results; a manner and a style, which he adopted as
                    models. Tacitus became his master in the art of observing, and also, in one
                    sense, in the art of writing; what he had acquired in the study of the former of
                    these two great historians he carried to the school of the latter; and it may be
                    said that he learned from Tacitus to read and explain Livy. After having laid
                    the foundations of his work on the history of Rome, Machiavelli employed himself
                    in following Livy step by step in the perusal of that history; stopping short at
                    every thing which suggested a reflection, or indicated the application of a
                    principle. The text of the historian disappears, or is but rarely cited;
                    actions, institutions, and laws, are alone discussed. The objects of comparison,
                    ancient as well as modern, spring up, so to speak, every instant; luminous
                    results are thence deduced; and an inexhaustible variety of facts continually
                    supports the evidence of the reasonings and the solidity of the maxims.
                    Throughout we discover a mind habituated to profound meditations, and a firmness
                    of soul tried and exercised by the storms of liberty. See, for example, to what
                    he reduces, in his fourth chapter, all the noise made by the quarrels between
                    the senate and the Roman people, which he does not hesitate to regard as the
                    primary cause of the liberty of Rome. Observe also, in his seventh chapter, the
                    strong reasons upon which he grounds the utility, or rather the necessity, of
                    public accusations; and with what justness of discrimination he distinguishes,
                    in his eighth chapter, the effect of public accusations, preferred on public
                    grounds, from those of adulation and calumny. In a word, he reasons inductively
                    from history as he finds it, and deduces his conclusions, not from any appeal to
                    general or speculative principles, but from the facts as these are detailed in
                    the pages of the historian. If he errs, it is only because his experience,
                    acquired in a peculiar state of society, does not always enable him to calculate
                    the effect of institutions differing from those of which he had observed the
                    operation; but in regard to all that comes within the sphere of his own
                    observation or experience, his sagacity is seldom at fault, and he may justly be
                    considered as the founder of that science which has been somewhat vaguely
                    denominated the philosophy of history.</p>

                    are altogether an admirable composition, and entitle Machiavelli to a separate
                    place amongst historians, seeing that the ancients have not left any model on
                    which he could form a particular style. The first book displays the science and
                    penetration of the writer; and it may be supposed that Bossuet was filled with
                    admiration of his free, bold, rapid, and independent manner, when he sketched
                    the plan of his Discourse on Universal History. The narrative in the seven other
                    books proceeds with the same vivacity; nor can the most careless reader fail to
                    receive from it a vivid and faithful impression of the national character and
                    manners of the Florentines. This work was undoubtedly the last of the author. He
                    is believed to have completed it in 1525; and it was his intention, we are told,
                    to continue it, which is rendered probable by the fragments collected after his
                    decease. The general character of Machiavelli’s style, particularly in the
                    History and in the Life of Castruccio, is elegance and simplicity. He is always
                    full of grace without artifice, and of elegance without insipidity; he is clear
                    without being verbose, and concise without obscurity or pretension to the
                    mysterious; and such is the transparency of the medium through which his ideas
                    are conveyed, that the actual depth of the current of thought is not at first
                    discernible.</p>
                <p>Although the real merit of the Florentine secretary consists in his profound
                    knowledge of the science of government, in which he has not been surpassed
                    either amongst the ancients or the moderns, yet he is also entitled to a
                    distinguished place amongst comic authors. His <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mandragola,</hi> which, according to Voltaire, surpasses all the comedies of
                    Aristophanes, is superior to the best of Goldoni, and inferior only to the best
                    of Molière; in fact, it is the work of a man who, if he had devoted himself to
                    the drama, would probably have attained the very highest excellence, and
                    produced a permanent and salutary impression upon the national taste. By the
                    correct and vigorous delineation of human character, it produces interest
                    without a skilful or pleasing plot, and laughter without the least ambition or
                    affectation. Machiavelli had an exquisite sense of the ridiculous, and his
                    dramatic humour, which has often been compared to that of Molière, and certainly
                    resembles it in comic force, if not in benevolent gaiety and chastened morality,
                    seldom fails to prove effective. The <hi rend="italic">Clizia</hi> is an
                    imitation of the <hi rend="italic">Casina</hi> of Plautus, which is itself an
                    imitation of the lost Kaijpouμsκ)∕ of Diphilus. Machiavelli has executed his
                    task with judgment and taste, accommodating the plot to a different state of
                    society, and dexterously connecting with it the history of his own times.
                    Besides these, the <hi rend="italic">Maschere,</hi> the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Andria</hi>, and two other comedies without titles, the one in prose and the
                    other in verse, appear amongst the works of Machiavelli. The charming little
                    novel of <hi rend="italic">Belphegor</hi> is also pleasantly conceived and
                    wittily told; but the extravagance of the satire in some measure injures its
                    effect. Machiavelli was unhappily married; and his wish to avenge his own cause
                    as well as <pb break="no" facs="nls:193209847" xml:id="kp-eb0713-9847-0648"
                    />that of his brethren in misfortune carried him beyond even the license of
                    fiction.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The subject of
                    this <hi rend="italic">novella ρiacevolissima</hi> cannot be better described
                    than in the words of the argument prefixed: “Befagor ar-cidiavolo è mandato da
                    Plutone in questo mondo, con obligo di dover prender moglie. Ci viene, la
                    prende; e non potendo soffe-rire la superbia di lei, ama meglio retornarsi in
                    Inferno, che ricogiugnersi seco.” Ben Jonson, in the plot of <hi rend="italic"
                    >The Devil ìi an Αss,</hi> appears to have taken some hints from this tale, with
                    others from Boccacio.</p></note></p>
                <p>Machiavelli was also a poet, though, in this capacity, he is not perhaps entitled
                    to a very high place. The <hi rend="italic">Decennali</hi> are merely abstracts
                    in verse of the history of his own times. The style and versification are
                    sedulously modelled on those of Dante; but the manner of hante, like that of
                    every other great original poet, was suited only to his own genius and his own
                    subject, and did not therefore admit of being copied or imitated. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Assino d’Ora</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Capitali</hi> are also
                    formed on the same model, and are in every respect superior. The Golden Ass
                    indeed has nothing but the name in common with the romance of Apuleius, which,
                    in spite of its irregular plan and vicious style, is one of the most fascinating
                    books in the Latin language, combining the various merits of Le Sage and
                    Radcliffe, Bunyan and Crébillon. The poem of Machiavelli, which is evidently
                    unfinished, is copied from the earlier cantos of the Inferno; whole lines are
                    transferred without acknowledgment, and all without producing their wonted
                    effect; the flowers of language which have bloomed upon one soil, wither when
                    transplanted to another. Yet the <hi rend="italic">Assina</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >d</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">Oro</hi> is not altogether destitute of merit; the
                    allegory displays considerable ingenuity, and there is some vivid colouring in
                    the descriptions.</p>
                <p>But, of all the works of Machiavelli, that which has excited the greatest
                    attention is the celebrated treatise entitled <hi rend="italic">II
                    Principe.</hi> This production, in which the ferocious Borgia is, according to
                    the supposition of several writers, presented as a model to sovereigns who wish
                    to govern absolutely, has acquired a deplorable reputation in Europe, and made
                    the author himself be regarded by many as an incarnation of the evil
                    principle.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>' <hi

                    d’Asola, appeared at Rome on the 4th of January 1532, accompanied with a
                    privilege of Pope Clement VII. and dedicated to Philip Strozzi, the friend of
                    the author. Bayle speaks of an edition of 1515, which no one has seen, there
                    being, in all probability, a misprint in the date. The Giunta reprinted the <hi
                    rend="italic">Prince</hi> the same year, 1532, and again in 1540. The sons of
                    Aldus also published it at Venice in 1540; and Gabriel Giolito gave an edition
                    of it in 1550. It was successively translated into German, Montbéliard, 1626;
                    twice into Latin; then into French by Amelot de la Houssaye (Amsterdam, 1683,
                    and Hague, 1743), and, lastly, by Giraudet in 1799, along with the complete
                    works of the author.</p>
                <p>We know not of any work which has excited so much discussion and controversy as
                    this, or which has been so often and so vehemently assailed. The intentions of
                    the author have been variously interpreted. Some, thinking they saw in it a
                    complete system of irréligion, impiety, and tyranny, have cried out “Wolf, wolf
                    ;”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>preface to the French
                    edition of 1813.</p></note> whilst others have demanded that, according to the
                    rules of just criticism, the work should be judged of as a whole, not by
                    detached or disfigured fragments, and that, above all, the disapprobation with
                    which the author always accompanies the exposition of the perverse principles he
                    has developed, should not be dissembled or concealed. Voltaire, writing to the
                    prince-royal of Prussia (20th May 1738), observes: “The first thing I am obliged
                    to advert to is the manner in which you think of Machiavel. Why should you be
                    moved with the virtuous displeasure which you express against me because I have
                    praised the style of a bad man ?, It is for the Borgias, father and son, and all
                    those petty princes who require crimes to effect their elevation, to study this
                    infernal policy. It belongs to such a prince as you to detest it. This art,
                    which may be classed with that of the Locustes and the Brinvilliers, may give to
                    some tyrants a temporary sway, just as poison may procure an inheritance; but
                    most assuredly it has never made men either great or happy. What, then, can any
                    one accomplish by pursuing this frightful policy? Nothing but misery to others,
                    and also to himself. These are the truths which should form the catechism of
                    your exalted soul.” On the 26th of June 1739, the prince replies to this
                    flattering homage in the true French style, by informing his correspondent that
                    what he meditates against Machiavelism is properly a continuation of the
                    Henriade. “It is out of the noble sentiments of Henri IV.” says he, “that I am
                    forging the thunderbolt which will crush Cesare Borgia.” On the 27th of
                    December, Voltaire renders homage for homage. “We shall at length,” says he,
                    “have a book worthy of a prince; and I doubt not that an edition of Machiavel,
                    with this counter-poison at the end of each chapter, will be one of the most
                    precious monuments of literature.” “The <hi rend="italic">Anti-Machiavel?</hi>
                    he adds, “ought to become the catechism of kings, and of their ministers.” The
                    book which, in this commerce of flattery, Voltaire denominates <hi rend="italic"
                    >Anti-Machiavel,</hi> is the <hi rend="italic">Examen</hi><hi rend="italic">du
                    Prince</hi><hi rend="italic">de Machiavel,</hi> by the prince-royal, afterwards
                    king of Prussia, who, in his preface, declares that “he always looked upon the
                    <hi rend="italic">Prince</hi> as one of the most dangerous works that ever was
                    published,” though he afterwards lived long enough to find some of its maxims
                    more convenient and agreeable than he had at first anticipated.</p>
                <p>It would be equally endless and impqrtinent to relate the host of criticisms and
                    apologies, of accusations and defences, of which Machiavelli has been the
                    object, in almost all the languages of Europe. But we shall cite the authority
                    of a judge whom it will not be easy to refute; we mean that of the Florentine
                    secretary himself. Before finishing his treatise of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Prince,</hi> he wrote to one of his friends, Francisco Vettori, a letter, which
                    discloses without any reserve his real position and his motives, and thus puts
                    an end to all speculation upon the subject. This letter, found in the Barberini
                    library at Rome, was published for the first time by Angelo Ridolfi, in a work
                    entitled <hi rend="italic">Pensieri intarna allo scapa di Nicoa Machiavella nel
                    libra II Principe,</hi> Milan, 1810; and Ginguenê has also cited it in his <hi

                    has divided it into two parts, giving the one half in the text, and the other
                    half in a note. The first part contains details which may perhaps be considered
                    as ignoble, but which nevertheless make known the peculiar cast of character, as
                    well as the patience, of the author; the second shows him in all the dignity of
                    his talent. We shall only cite the portion which has immediate reference to the
                    subject before us.</p>
                <p>“On the approach of evening,” says he, continuing the description of his habits
                    and mode of life, “I retire to my dwelling, and enter my cabinet; at the door I
                    divest myself of my peasant’s garb, bedaubed with mud and dirt, put on proper
                    attire, and thus decently dressed I enter the ancient courts of men of old.
                    Being well received by them, I fill myself with that nourishment which alone
                    agrees with <pb break="no" facs="nls:193209860" xml:id="kp-eb0713-9860-0649"

                    inquire the motives of their actions; whilst they, on the other hand, being full
                    of humanity, reply to my inquiries. For four hours I experience no weariness; I
                    forget all sorrow; I have no dread of poverty, and death no longer alarms me; I
                    transport myself entirely to them; and, as Dante says that <hi rend="italic"
                    >there will never be science unless we retain what we have learned,</hi> I have
                    noted down the substance of my conversation with them, and composed a work, <hi
                    rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Principatibus,</hi> in which I enter as
                    deeply as I can into this subject, with a view to fathom it. I examine what a
                    principality is; how many kinds there are of them; how they are acquired, how
                    maintained, how lost; and if ever any trifle <hi rend="italic"

                    It should also be acceptable to a prince, more especially to a new one;

                    in detail of the subject itself, and the arguments I have had with him; and as
                    to myself, I am now occupied in extending and correcting it. You wish that I
                    should abandon my actual mode of life, and go to enjoy yonrs; I will do so
                    gladly; but I am prevented at present by some affairs which will be settled in
                    about six weeks. The only thing which makes me hesitate is, that, near these
                    Soderini, I shall be obliged, on my arrival, to visit and to speak with them. I
                    am also apprehensive that, upon my return, instead of stopping at my own house,
                    they would make me alight at the barigel (prison); for although this state
                    stands on solid foundations, and enjoys great security, still it is new, and
                    consequently suspicious; nor are there wanting meddling intriguers <hi

                    score, and leave me to pay the reckoning. I beseech you to save me from this
                    danger, and I will by all means come to yon at the time I have mentioned. I have
                    been talking with Philip about my little work (the <hi rend="italic"

                    besides, every one should be eager to employ a man who has acquired experience
                    at the expense of others. Of my fidelity no doubt can reasonably be entertained,
                    because, having always acted with good faith, I am not likely now to sacrifice

                <p>This letter requires no explanation or commentary. In it Machiavelli lays bare
                    his whole soul, disclosing without reserve his vexation, his dread of misery,
                    the shame with which he regarded the almost disgusting situation to which he had
                    been reduced, and his desire at any sacrifice to be again employed in public
                    affairs; nor will the attentive observer, who reads it with care, fail to
                    discover in it a key to the treatise of the <hi rend="italic">Principe.</hi>
                    Indeed the Italian writers no longer judge of that work without referring to the

                    liberty of Florence, was inclined to support any government which might secure
                    its independence. But this is a refinement wholly unsupported by evidence. The
                    motive which impelled him to the composition of the work was actual indigence,
                    and the prospect of still greater misery; the object which he sought to attain
                    by it was immediate employment under the new masters of Florence, were it only
                    in the first instance to roll a stone. None of the designs which have been so
                    freely imagined, and so confidently ascribed to the fallen secretary, seems ever
                    to" have entered his mind. He wanted bread, and thinking that his book,
                    containing the results of his experience and observation, would be acceptable to
                    a prince, especially a new one, he tenders it through Vettori, in the hope that
                    it might be instrumental in saving him from that destitution, the prospect of
                    which he contemplated with so much horror. It is also to be observed that the
                    book, when first published, did not appear to the Italians in the light in which
                    it was afterwards regarded. This is sufficiently evident from the fact that it
                    was printed in virtue of a privilege granted by Pope Clement VII., dated the 23d
                    of August 1531. Italy was then abandoned to such disorders, that some sovereigns
                    hoped to find useful counsels, where, in point of sound morality, they could
                    meet with nothing but odious precepts. At the same time, if we separate the
                    author from his work, it may be observed, that Machiavelli could not know that
                    his work would ever be published. He composed it in the form of a memoir to
                    Lorenzo de’ Medici; and in his dedication to that young prince, he tells him
                    that he has nothing to offer him but the knowledge of the actions of great men,
                    which he had acquired by long experience in modern affairs; and at the close he
                    adds, “If your magnificence, from the elevated station you occupy, would deign
                    to cast an eye on this lower region, you would learn how unjustly I suffer under
                    the great and continual malignity of fortune.”<note anchored="true"

                <p>With regard to the general character of Machiavelli as a writer, and also to the
                    particular question, whether the treatise of the <hi rend="italic">Prince</hi>
                    was a serious production, or, as Bacon seems to suggest,<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>“Est quod gratias agamus Machiavello et
                    hujusmodi scriptoribus, qui aperte et indissimulanter proferunt quid hotnines
                    facere soleant, non quid debeant.” (Z)e <hi rend="italic">Augment.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Scient,</hi> lib. viii. c. 2.)</p></note> merely a piece of grave
                    irony, intended to put nations on their guard against the arts of new and
                    ambitious princes, we refer the reader to the judicious and discriminating
                    remarks upon both points, contained in the First Preliminary Dissertation (pp.
                    32-37). The <hi rend="italic">Prince</hi> is an account of the means by which
                    tyrannical power is to be acquired and preserved; it is a theory of that class
                    of phenomena in the history of mankind. Hence it is essential to its purpose
                    that it should contain an enumeration and exposition of tyrannical arts; and on
                    this account it may not only be viewed, but used, as a manual of such arts. A
                    philosophical treatise on poisons would, in like manner, determine the quantity
                    of each poisonous substance capable of producing death, the circumstances
                    favourable or adverse to its operation, and every other information essential to
                    the purpose of the poisoner, though not intended for his use. But the general
                    utility of such a work is, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193209873"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0713-9873-0650"/>nevertheless, indisputable; and it is also plain,
                    that a calm unvarnished exposition of tyrannical arts is the bitterest satire
                    against them. Of this Machiavelli himself seems to have been fully aware, when
                    he observed, in reply to a remark which had been made upon this very work, that
                    if he had taught princes to be tyrants, he had also taught the people to destroy
                    tyrants. ⅛ ’ he <hi rend="italic">Prince</hi> must, therefore, have had the
                    double aspect here pointed out, though neither of the objects thereby indicated
                    had actually been in the contemplation of the author. It may not be the object
                    of the chemist to teach the means of exhibiting antidotes, any more than of
                    administering poisons; but his pupils or readers may employ his discoveries for
                    both objects. Aristotle had long before given a similar theory of tyranny, but
                    without the suspicion of an immoral intention; nor was it any novelty, in more
                    recent times, amongst those who must have been the first teachers of
                    Machiavelli. The schoolmen followed the footsteps of Aristotle too closely to
                    omit so striking a passage as that to which we have alluded <hi rend="italic"
                    >{Politic,</hi> lib. v. c∙ 3); and, in fact, Aquinas explains it in his
                    commentary, like the rest, with most unsuspecting simplicity. To us,
                    accordingly, the plan of Machiavelli, like those of former writers, appears to
                    have been purely scientific; and so Lord Bacon seems to have understood him,
                    where he gives him thanks for exposing openly, and without reserve, what princes
                    actually do, not what they ought to do. Great defects of character are no doubt
                    manifested by the writings of Machiavelli. But if a man of so powerful a genius
                    had shown a mind utterly depraved, it would have been a painful and perhaps
                    solitary exception to the laws of human nature; and certainly no depravity can
                    be conceived greater than a deliberate intention to teach perfidy and cruelty.
                    That a man who was a warm lover of his country, who underwent cruel sufferings
                    for her liberty, and who was esteemed by the very best of his countrymen (e. <hi
                    rend="italic">g.</hi> Guicciardini, his political opponent), should fall into
                    such unparalleled wickedness, may be considered as wholly incredible. The author
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Prince,</hi> according to the common notion of its
                    intention, could never have inspired such sentiments, had he been a man steeped
                    in depravity, and devoid of all virtuous feeling. To possess the power, however,
                    of contemplating tyranny with scientific coldness, and of rendering it the mere
                    subject of theoretical speculation, must be owned to indicate a defect of moral
                    sensibility. But, to say nothing of the political maxims then received, and of
                    the lenity with which the Italians regarded those crimes which required
                    self-command, address, quick observation, fertile invention, and profound
                    knowledge of human nature, the <hi rend="italic">Prince</hi> was obviously wrung
                    from the author by the pressure of severe distress; and it is more than
                    probable, that, but for his misfortunes, this famous treatise would never have
                    seen the light.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See <hi

                <p>The most ample and esteemed edition of the works of Machiavelli is that of 1813,
                    <hi rend="italic">Italia</hi> (Florence), in eight vols. 8vo. The best of the
                    French translations is that of Giraudet and Hochet, Paris, 1799, in nine vols.
                    8vo. Those of Gohorry, Paris, 1571 and 1635, of the Sieur de Brien-cour, Rouen
                    (Paris), 1669, and of Têtard, Hague, 1691— 1696, reprinted in 1743, were very
                    incomplete. The only English translation to which we have had access is that of
                    Farneworth, London, 1762, in two vols. 4to, which is overloaded with a great
                    deal of rubbish that might well have been spared, and is, besides, defective in
                    several respects, particularly in regard to the life of the author, and some of
                    his minor productions. <hi rend="smallcaps">(a.)</hi></p>
