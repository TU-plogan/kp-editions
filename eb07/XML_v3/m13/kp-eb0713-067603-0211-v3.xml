                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                    rend="smallcaps">Cilnius,</hi> the friend and counsellor of Augustus Caesar, a
                    man whose name has become a synonyme for a patron of literature, from the
                    munificent and generous support he afforded to the learned. He flourished from
                    about 41 to 8 <hi rend="smallcaps">b. c.</hi> He was very generally considered
                    by the ancients as descended from the royal line of Etruria. The family of the
                    Cilnii is mentioned by Livy (x. 3) as very powerful at Arretium, now Arrezzo, B.
                    c. 300. We have no account of the early years of Maecenas, but there is little
                    doubt that his education was carefully attended to, and becoming the dignity of
                    his birth. In what way he acquired the friendship of Octavius we have no means
                    of knowing; but we find him actively engaged in his cause immediately after the
                    murder of Julius Caesar, <hi rend="smallcaps">b. c.</hi> 44. His talents seem to
                    have been particularly adapted for the administration of the civil affairs of
                    government, and we find him more frequently thus engaged than in the active
                    business of war. He was employed <hi rend="smallcaps">(b. c.</hi> 40) to
                    negociate the marriage between Augustus and Scribonia, the sister of Scribonius
                    Libo, the father-in-law of Sextus Pompey, with the view of securing a channel by
                    which he might obtain peace with Pompey if circumstances should require it
                    (Appian, <hi rend="italic">ß.</hi> C ’. v. 53). The same year Maecenas was one
                    of the commissioners appointed to negociate the peace between Antony and
                    Octavius at Brundusium, which was sealed by the marriage of Octavia and Antony
                    (v. 64). He was again the principal person employed in the conference between
                    Octavius and Antony <hi rend="smallcaps">(b.</hi> c. 37), on the banks of the
                    river between Metapontum and Tarentum, when peace was agreed upon (v. 92). He
                    had the command of the whole of Italy and Rome at the time of the battle of
                    Actium, <hi rend="smallcaps">b. c.</hi> 31, at which period he put down a
                    conspiracy entered into by Lepidus the son of the triumvir (iv. 50; Veil. Pat.
                    ii. 88). The victory at Actium having placed the Roman empire in the hands of
                    Octavius, he consulted with his friends, Agrippa and Maecenas, whether he ought
                    not to abdicate his authority. Agrippa advised him to restore the republic, but
                    Maecenas was of a contrary opinion. The speeches which they each delivered are
                    given by Dion Cassius (411, 1-40). Augustus adopted the opinion of Maecenas, and
                    was guided in all his more important transactions by his advice, having
                    confidence not only in his good sense and discretion, but in the integrity of
                    his character. To Maecenas therefore may, in a great measure, be ascribed the
                    glory of his reign. After his death, Augustus frequently regretted that he had
                    no longer a friend to assist him; and when he had committed any act of which he
                    repented, he used to say, that if Maecenas or Agrippa had been alive, he would
                    not have had cause to reproach himself for the folly of his conduct (Sen. De <hi
                    rend="italic">Bener.</hi> vi. 32). It is said that Maecenas one day observed
                    Augustus on the point of condemning some persons to death, and being unable to
                    approach the tribunal on account of the crowd, he threw a paper to him, on which
                    he had inscribed these words, “Descend from the tribunal, thou butcher ;” upon
                    which Augustus, struck by the admonition, left the judgment-seat without passing
                    sentence. The palace of Maecenas was on the Esquiline Hill, and his gardens are
                    frequently mentioned as occupying the ground which had been previously employed
                    as the place of burial for the poor (Tacit. <hi rend="italic">Ann.</hi> xv. 39).
                    It is, however, to his generous patronage of the learned that he is principally
                    indebted for his fame; and their gratitude has amply repaid all the attention he
                    may have bestowed on them. His palace was the common resort of all the literary
                    characters of his age. There might be found Virgil and Horace, Varius, famed for
                    his tragedies, Propertius, Domitius Marsus the rival of Catullus, Valgius,
                    Plotius, and Tucca. It was through Maecenas that the learned had access to the
                    emperor, and were loaded with his favours. Horace gives a very interesting
                    account of his introduction to Maecenas, which must have taken place as early as
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">b. c.</hi> 40, when both the poet and Maecenas were still
                    young. To Maecenas Horace was indebted for his Sabine farm; and Virgil was
                    through him restored to his paternal estate, near Mantua. Virgil dedicated the
                    Georgies to his patron; and to him Propertius has dedicated several of his
                    poems. It is needless to add, that much of the poetry of Horace was also
                    addressed to him. Maecenas has been accused, however, of being devoted to
                    pleasure; but his faults were those of the age in which he lived, and his
                    virtues were his own (Sence. <hi rend="italic">Epist.</hi> 92, 114). Virgil died
                    many years before Maecenas, B. c. 19; but whether Horace predeceased Maecenas or
                    not is uncertain. Horace died in the month of November <hi rend="smallcaps">b.
                    c.</hi> 8 (Sueton.); and Dion Cassius (41, 3) mentions the death of Maecenas
                    towards the close of the same year. The clause in the will of Maecenas, in which
                    he recommends to Augustus his friend Horace, would lead us to conclude that
                    Horace survived him. At all events, only a few months could have intervened
                    between their deaths. He was married to Terentia, a woman of a disagreeable
                    temper, from whom he frequently separated; but found his happiness so dependent
                    on her smiles, that he soon received her back to his arms (Sen. <hi
                    rend="italic">De Prov.</hi> 3). Pliny states that the health of Maecenas was at
                    all times delicate; and that for the last three years of his life he scarcely
                    enjoyed an hour’s sleep (vii. 52, 2). Of the writings of Maecenas we have
                    nothing retnaining except a few epigrams, which are published in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Anthologia Latina</hi> of Burmann (i. 53, ii. 225, iii. 149). He
                    was also the author of two tragedies, Prometheus and Octavia; and is supposed to
                    have written Memoirs to serve for the history of Augustus. (See Fabricius, <hi
