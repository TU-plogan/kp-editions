                <p><label type="entry">PALLAS, <hi rend="smallcaps">Simon Peter</hi></label>, a
                    distinguished naturalist and geographer, born on the 22d of September 1741, was
                    the son of Simon Pallas, a surgeon in the Prussian army, and professor of
                    surgery at Berlin.</p>
                <p>He received the early part of his education in his father’s house, and his
                    instructors bore ample testimony to the rapidity of his progress. At the age of
                    fifteen he began to attend medical lectures, and he applied himself so closely
                    to practical anatomy, that in 1758 he was found qualified to deliver a course of
                    public lectures on that science. In the same year he went to Halle, and became
                    the pupil of Segner, continuing also his studies of zoology, and, in particular,
                    of entomology, with great assiduity. In <pb break="no" facs="nls:194566884"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0716-6884-0770"/>1759 he removed to Göttingen, where he made a
                    variety of experiments on poisons, and on other active medical substances, and
                    commenced his observations on parasitical animals. In July 1760, he went on to
                    Leyden, in order to attend the lectures of Albinus, Gaubius, and Muschenbroeck;
                    and at the end of the same year he took his degree of doctor of physic. The
                    following summer he proceeded to England, principally with the view of
                    completing his medical education, although he devoted the greater part of his
                    time to the active pursuit of natural history, being assisted and encouraged by
                    the friendship of Peter Collinson, and of some other British naturalists, which
                    procured for him a few years afterwards the distinction of having his name
                    inserted in the list of the foreign members of the Royal Society, at the early
                    age of twenty-three. He visited several parts of the coast of England, in order
                    to examine its marine productions; and his love of natural history enabled him
                    to profit in a similar manner by an accident which detained him for some time at
                    Harwich, on his return to the Continent, in the spring of 1762.</p>
                <p>Having paid a visit to his native city, he went again to the Hague, and
                    established himself as a resident there under the patronage of Gaubius. On
                    occasion of the publication of a miscellaneous work on zoology, which he
                    dedicated to the Prince of Orange, he proposed a plan for an expedition to the
                    Cape of Good Hope, and to the Dutch East Indies, which he offered to conduct in
                    person; but although the project was encouraged by Gaubius, and approved by the
                    prince, his father’s interference prevented its execution, and obliged him to
                    return to Berlin. His filial affection, however, was not strong enough to induce
                    him to refuse the invitation of the Empress Catharine to St Petersburg, where he
                    accepted, in the year 1767, the appointment of professor of natural history in
                    the Imperial Academy of Sciences.</p>
                <p>The first few months of his residence at St Petersburg were employed in preparing
                    his Zoological Gleanings for publication, and in making catalogues of some
                    collections of natural history. It was now that the more active career of his
                    public life was about to commence; and in 1768 he undertook, in common with
                    Falk, Lepechin, and Gulden-àtadt, the conduct of an expedition sent out by the
                    empress, for the joint purposes of observing the transit of Venus, and of
                    investigating the natural history and geography of Siberia, and the neighbouring
                    countries. The object of their researches for the first summer was the province
                    of Kasan, and the winter was passed at Simbirsk: the next year they examined the
                    shores of the Caspian, and the borders of Calmuck Tartary; after which they
                    returned through Orenburg, and passed the winter at Ufa. In 1770 Pallas crossed
                    the Uralian Mountains to Catharin-enburg, and, after examining the mines in that
                    neighbourhood, proceeded to Tobolsk. The next year he went to the Altaic
                    Mountains, traced the course of the Irtysch to Kolyvan, went on to Tomsk, and
                    observed the natural freezing of quicksilver at Krasnoyarsk, on the Yenisei, in
                    latitude 56½° north. He proceeded in March 1772 by Irkutsk across the Lake
                    Baikal, as far as Kiatka, and returned to Krasnoyarsk. In 1773 he visited Tara,
                    Astracan, and Tzaritzin, on the Volga, and returned to St Petersburg in 1774,
                    after an absence of six years. About ten years later he was made a member of the
                    Board of Mines, with an additional salary of L.200a year; and he was
                    complimented with the title of a knight of St Vladimir. The empress purchased
                    his collection of natural history for a price one third greater than his demand,
                    and allowed him, at the same time, to keep it in his possession for the
                    remainder of his life.</p>
                <p>In 1794 he took a journey into the Crimea, and was captivated with the beauty of
                    the country and its productions; the climate also appearing to be such as his
                    health was supposed to require, he obtained from his munificent patroness not
                    only permission to establish himself there, but a grant of a large and fertile
                    estate, and a sum of 10,000 rubles to assist him in his outfit. He was thus
                    enabled to build a little palace rather than a country house, ’in which a
                    traveller from the north of Europe was sure to receive the most obliging
                    hospitality, as Dr Clarke has made well known to the English reader. It appears,
                    however, that the air was not altogether exempt from the miasmata, which are the
                    causes of paludal fevers; and some other circumstances, besides the distance
                    from all civilized society, seem to have made the old age of Pallas more
                    cheerless than he had anticipated to find it, in the independence and
                    tranquillity of his patriarchal establishment at Akmetshet. About ten years
                    after the period of Dr Clarke’s travels, he undertook a journey to Berlin to pay
                    a visit to his brother, and died there in September 1811.</p>
                <p>Linné the younger has given him a genus, <hi rend="italic">Pallasia</hi><hi
                    rend="italic subscript"> i</hi> in his <hi rend="italic">Supplementum</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Plantarum</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> a compliment to which his
                    unremitting labours, in every department of natural history, had amply entitled
                    him.' His collection of dried plants was purchased by Dr Clarke’s
                    fellow-traveller, Mr Cripps, and passed into the possession of Aylmer Bourke
                    Lambert.</p>
                <p>The general character of Professor Pallas’s acquirements appear to have been that
                    of extent and variety, together with fidelity. He was not the author of any new
                    theories or improved systems; and it has sometimes been observed, as by Murray
                    in his System of Vegetables, that his descriptions were somewhat defective, from
                    the omission of correct specific distinctions; but this omission is of such a
                    nature as to affect a compiler or a book-maker much more than an actual student
                    of natural history who is studying for his own improvement only, and who is
                    capable of entering into a detailed examination of the objects concerned. To
                    such a detail the principal part of Professor Pallas’s works have relation; and
                    it is impossible to enumerate the whole of his memoirs without making a pretty
                    extensive catalogue of the productions of the various kingdoms of nature.</p>
                <p>1. His Dissertatio Inauguralis de Insectis Viventibus intra Viventia, 4. Leyden,
                    1760, containing a systematic account of intestinal worms, is said to have been
                    previously published in another form at Göttingen, a short time before he went
                    to Leyden. 2. We find in the Philosophical Transactions for 1763, p. 62, a short
                    note On the Cold observed at Berlin the preceding winter. 3. In the volume for
                    1766, p. 186, a description of the jaculator fish, or Sciaena jaculatrix of the
                    Indian Ocean, which catches insects by darting drops of water at them: this
                    description is repeated in the <hi rend="italic">Spicilegia</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Zoologica</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> i</hi> fasc. 8. 4.
                    Elenchus Zoophytorum, 8. Hague, 1766; containing nearly three hundred species;
                    Dutch by Boddaert, with figures, 8. Utrecht, 1768. 5.Miscellanea Zoologica, 4.
                    Hague, 1766; consisting of descriptions and dissections. 6. Spicilegia
                    Zoologica, 4. Berl. 1767-1780. Of this valuable collection of memoirs, intended
                    for the description and illustration of new or little-known species of animals,
                    there appeared in the whole fourteen fasciculi; some of them were published by
                    Professor Martin during the author’s absence in Siberia. We find, amongst other
                    articles, an interesting account of the musk-deer, of various species of the
                    antelope, and on the different varieties of sheep, both wild and tame; the
                    latter has been published in English, On Russian and Tartar Sheep, 8. Edinb.
                    1794. 7. In the <hi rend="italic">N. Act. Αeαd. Nat. Cur.</hi> iii. p∙ 430,
                    Phalaenarum biga; an account of two species of moth, of which the females are
                    without wings, and spontaneously fertile. 8. A variety of miscellaneous papers,
                    by Pallas, appeared in the Stralsund Magazine, which began to be published at
                    Berlin in 1767: they <pb break="no" facs="nls:194566897"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0716-6897-0771"/>chiefly relate to the Winter Residence of
                    Swallows, vol. i. p. 20; to Hydatids found in the abdomen of ruminant animals,
                    and supposed to be a species of taenia, p. 64; to the Birds of Passage of
                    Siberia, p. 145, from Heller’s Notes; to Firmin’s supposed discovery of the

                <p>10. Professor Pallas’s contributions to the Memoirs of the Imperial Academy of St
                    Petersburg are also very numerous, and on miscellaneous subjects. In the <hi
                    rend="italic">Novi</hi><hi rend="italic">Commentarii</hi> we find an account of
                    the Tubularia Fungosa, vol. xii∙, observed near Wolodinier; Lepus pusillus, and
                    Fossil Bones of Siberia, vol. xiii.; Quadrupeds and Birds observed in 1769, vol.
                    xiv. 1; Remains of Exotic Animals in Northern Asia, vol. xviii., especially the
                    skulls of the rhinoceros and the buffalo; Tetrao arenaria, Equus hemionus, and
                    Lacerta apoda, vol. xix.; the last also in Geneesk. Jaerboek, ii. In the <hi
                    rend="italic">Acta</hi> for 1777, ii., An Account of the Teeth of an Unknown
                    Animal, like those which have been found in Canada; Observations, from Camper’s
                    Letters, on a Myrmecophaga and a Didelphis, and Equus asinus in the wild state.
                    In the volume for 1779, ii., a Description of Plants peculiar to Siberia; Capra
                    Caucasica, also in Lichtenberg’s <hi rend="italic">Magazin,</hi> ii. For 1780,
                    part i. Galeopithecus vitans; part ii. On the Variations of Animals, and
                    Didelphis brachyura. For 1781, part i., Felis manui, a new Asiatic species of
                    Felis; ii., On some Species of Sorex. In the volume for 1783, New Species of
                    Fishes; and 1784, On some new Marine Productions.</p>
                <p>11. The Observations sur la Formation des Montagnes, et les Changemens arrivés au
                    Globe, particulièrement à l’égard de l’Empire Russe, published separately, 4.
                    Petersb. 1777, were also inserted in the <hi rend="italic">Acta</hi> of the
                    Academy for 1777, having been read at a public sitting before the king of
                    Sweden. A translation of this discourse is inserted in Tooke’s Russian Empire,
                    and some remarks on it are found in the <hi rend="italic">Journal de
                    Physique,</hi> vol. xiii.</p>
                <p>12. The most considerable of the separate publications of Pallas was the account
                    of his travels, entitled Reise durch verschiedene provinzen des Russischen
                    Reichs, 3 vols. 4. Petersburg, 1771-3-6; French, 8vo, 8. Par. 1803; English, 2
                    vols. 4. London, 1812; a work of the highest authority in geography and natural
                    history. 13. It was in the course of these travels that Pallas observed in
                    Siberia an insulated mass of native iron, which he described in a paper
                    addressed to the Royal Society of London, and printed in the Philosophical
                    Transactions for 1776, p. 523; a substance which has become the subject of many
                    discussions, from its resemblance to some of the specimens of well-ascertained
                    aerolites; the author mentions also the remains of an unmineralized rhinoceros,
                    which had been found in the same country.</p>
                <p>14. In the <hi rend="italic">Beschaftigungen Naturforschenden Freunden,</hi>
                    published at Berlin about 1777, we find a letter on the Acipenser ruthenus, or
                    sturgeon, vol. ii. p. 532; and An Account of a Monstrous Horse, vol. iii. p.
                    226. 15. Some Mineralogical Observations, addressed to Born, are published in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Böhmische Abhandlungen,</hi> vol. iii. p. 191. 16. In the
                    Swedish <hi rend="italic">Handlingar</hi> for 1778, we have the Alauda
                    Mongolica, and the Sturnus Daauricus; the Anas glocitans, in 1779.</p>
                <p>17. Novae species Glirium, 4. Erlang. 1778. 18. Icones, Insectorum, praesertim
                    Rossiae Sibiriaeque, 4. Erlang. 1781. 19. Enumeratio Plantarum Procopii a
                    Demidoff, 8. Petersb. 1781.</p>
                <p>20. Another channel in· which a number of Pallas’s most valuable essays appeared,
                    is the work entitled <hi rend="italic">Neue Nordische</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Beytrage,</hi> which he published at St Petersburg and Leipzig in 1781 and the
                    following years. The most remarkable of the subjects of these are, A great
                    Exotic Animal found in Kasan in the year 1776; on the Migration of the water-Rat
                    on the Volga, and Observations on Taeniae, vol. i.; further Remarks on Taeniae;
                    on American Monkeys bred at St Petersburg; on the Ardea helias; on the Culex
                    lanio, sometimes fatal to Cattle; on the Phalangium, or Scorpion Spider; and on
                    Copper Island, in the Sea of Kamtschatka, vol. ii.: on Two Birds; and on the
                    Labrador Stone, vol. iii.: on a Cross of the Black Wolf with the Dog; on a Mine;
                    on the Oriental Turquois; and Mineralogical Novelties from Siberia, vol. V.</p>
                <p>21. In the <hi rend="italic">Physische Arbeiten</hi> of Vienna, we have a
                    geological Essay on the Orography of Siberia, vol. i. 1.</p>
                <p>22. Flora Rossica, f. vol. i. Petersb. 1784; ii. 1788, published at the expense
                    of the empress.</p>
