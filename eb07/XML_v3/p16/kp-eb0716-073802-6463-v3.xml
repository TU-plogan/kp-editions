                <p><label type="entry">PALENCIA</label>, a province in Spain, forming part of the
                    ancient kingdom of Leon. It extends 145 square leagues, and the number of its
                    inhabitants is 118,064, a density of population much greater than the general
                    average of the kingdom presents. As the province is well watered, the riches and
                    population, which in Spain must arise from the abundance of that element, are on
                    the advance. The rivers that water it discharge themselves at last into the
                    Duero, and are the Pisuerga, the Carrion, the Arlanza, and the Arlanzon. The
                    country is generally fertile in the valleys, and yields wheat, barley, and
                    wines. There are some coarse woollen manufactories scattered over the province,
                    as well as in the capital city. The Canal of Castille runs through this province
                    as far as it is executed. This, like the Canal of Aragon, is designed to promote
                    two important objects, that of internal navigation and that of irrigation. The
                    part of this valuable and costly work that is completed begins in the village of
                    Alar del Rey, in latitude 42. 5l., taking its water from the Pizuerga, the left
                    bank of which it follows. It enters the kingdom of Leon by crossing that river,
                    and then continues on its right bank, crossing also the Cieza, when it makes a
                    turn to the city of Palencia, and terminates in the Carrion, a little below it.
                    A branch called the Canal de Campos runs from it to the westward, towards
                    Beceril. The masonry of this work is stupendous and well executed, as are all
                    the locks, sluices, and other appendages. Such great operations always proceed
                    slowly in Spain, and the recent struggles have created considerable impediments;
                    but if the project be successfully pursued, and the original plan completed,
                    this canal will connect itself with that of Aragon, and thus create an internal
                    navigation across the whole of Spain. There are made in this province 500,000
                    hogsheads of wine, and 2000 of brandy. It possesses 3050 horses, 6500 mules,
                    3800 asses, 9300 oxen, 318,500 sheep, 11,300 goats, and 5500 pigs. It is in the
                    captain-generalship of Zamora, and enjoys the privileges and laws of
                    Castille.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Palencia,</hi> a city of Spain, the capital of the province
                    of Leon. It is situated on the banks of the river Carrion, after that river has
                    been increased by the junction of the Cieza. It is the see of a bishop, and has
                    a large and ancient cathedral. The country around produces good wheat, barley,
                    and wine, especially in moist summers; but it has a barren appearance, from
                    being almost wholly destitute of trees. It is a manufacturing place, and
                    furnishes blankets, coverlets, baize, serges, and hats, to a great portion of
                    the inhabitants of its own and the surrounding provinces. It is not considered
                    as a healthy city, from its vicinity to a most pestiferous stagnant lake called
                    Nava. It is situated in longitude 4. 34. west, and latitude 42. 10. north, has a
                    population of 8292 souls, and contains five churches, eleven monasteries, and
                    two hospitals.</p>
