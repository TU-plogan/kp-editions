                    Colombia, in the department of Boyaca. It is separated from Socorro on the south
                    by the river Galinazo or Sogamoso; on the west from Mariquita and Rio Hacha by
                    the great Magdalena; on the north it is bounded by Maracaybo, Rio Hacha, and
                    Merida; and on the east by Varinas, at that part of the country where are
                    collected the waters of the valley of Savateca, the sources of the Apure, a
                    tributary of the Orinoco. The eastern branch of the Andes almost fills this
                    province, and forms numerous valleys, by which the inhabitants easily
                    communicate with the Gulf of Mexicoby the Zulia, which forms a confluence with
                    the Catatumba, near the Lake of Maracaybo. The towns situated to the west have
                    likewise easy communications by the Sogamoso and the Canaverales, both navigable
                    rivers. There are other streams besides, which are valuable to Pamplona in an
                    agricultural or commercial point of view. The mineral riches of <pb break="no" facs="nls:194567001" xml:id="kp-eb0716-7001-0779"/>this province
                    are little known. It is reported that immense quantities of gold were obtained
                    from the mines of Beta and Montuosa; and, in fact, the remains of great works
                    can still be traced. Now, however, comparatively little is obtained, and that is
                    conveyed to Giron by the waters which form the Canaverales. The sand of this
                    river contains gold of twenty-three carats. There are also silver mines, and the
                    metal which they yield is at the rate of eight ounces to one quintal of ore. The
                    copper mines are rich; but from the very awkward manner in which they have been
                    worked, they have proved of little benefit to the country. The soil of the
                    territory upon which the city of Pamplona is built abounds with mica, which is
                    occasionally found in large sheets, and is split into thin plates, which answer
                    as a substitute for window-glass. Fancy articles of various kinds are likewise
                    manufactured from it. Quartz, felspar, and granite are everywhere met with; and
                    the whole geological features of the country attest the metallic and
                    mineralogical wealth of Pamplona ;. but from the works being wretchedly
                    conducted, it might as well be at the bottom of the Atlantic.</p><p>The soil of this province is upon the whole fertile, but the country remains
                    comparatively a desert, from the indolence of the inhabitants. The district in
                    which the capital is situated produces wheat, oats, maize, celery, cabbages,
                    beans, French beans, and an infinite variety of other vegetables. Here they also
                    cultivate some indigenous plants which are very useful, such as the common pine,
                    the resin of which is used medicinally; the myrica, which produces the wax
                    called laurel; a galium, the root of which furnishes an excellent yellow dye for
                    cottons; and also several other kinds of dye-stuffs. One of the most remarkable
                    spots of this district is Surata, the climate of which place is temperate. Ten
                    thousand loads of meal are annually prepared here, the greater part of which
                    passes through Ocaña, a place dependent on the province of Maracaybo, on its way
                    to Monpox and Carthagena. The wheat is generally of an excellent quality, and
                    affords two crops in the course of the year. At other places in this district
                    wheat, sugar-cane, and rice are cultivated; but in none of the villages, with
                    the exception of those of Mantanza and Ecce Homo, in the valley of Surata, is
                    sufficient corn gathered to admit of exportation. The olive-tree is very common
                    at Pamplona; but the mode of preparing the oil is either not known or not
                    practised. In the valley of Taupa the nopal is literally laden with the
                    cochineal insects, which are sent into the province of Tunja. Cotton is
                    cultivated in the district of Giron, particularly in the parish of Rio Negro;
                    and great quantities of it are annually sent to Monpox and Carthagena. Near to
                    the parish just named an abundant amber mine has been discovered. The tobacco
                    raised at Giron is of a very superior quality; and the entrepôt established at
                    Piedecuesta contributes to the comfort of the people. Cocoa, of which
                    considerable quantities are disposed of, succeeds very well on the banks of the
                    Sogamoso, Surata, and Canaverales. These countries also furnish large quantities
                    of capaiva balsam, and some building timber. If the road were open from Giron to
                    the Magdalena, this place would enjoy very great commercial advantages. By this
                    means the rocks of the Sogamoso, so destructive to boats, would be avoided; and,
                    besides, a vast extent of unknown lands, situated between the Sogamoso and the
                    Canaverales, would thereby be much frequented. The navigation of this river is
                    far preferable to that of the other, although its waters are too shallow to
                    allow very deeply laden vessels to traverse them. This stream is of great
                    utility to the inhabitants of Rio Negro, who transport their grains by it much
                    more quickly and cheaply than by Ocaña. Great quantities of Brazil wood are
                    found at some places on the Sogamoso; and on the banks of other rivers there are
                    several very fine cocoa plantations. The Cucuta cocoa, call ed Magdalena cocoa,
                    from its being brought down by that river, is very much esteemed. Coffee and
                    indigo are likewise cultivated in the province, but of much inferior quality to
                    the cocoa. The fertility of the soil is not the only cause of the abundance of
                    the cocoa-trees; the care of the cultivators contributes much to it. Experience
                    has taught them to protect this plant by the shade of the ceibas and
                    erytahrinas, and to surround them with flourishing hedges of citrons, fagaras,
                    and acacias, which are highly ornamental as well as useful. The inhabitants also
                    carefully water the cocoa-trees; but great ravages are committed on them by the
                    <hi rend="italic">tinea falsa.</hi> This insect is likewise very destructive to
                    the corn and grain of the Surata. A considerable quantity of Cucuta silver
                    passes by San Christoval into the Varinas. It is expended in the purchase of
                    mules and cattle, of which nearly ten thousand head are bought annually; for
                    although the province abounds in pastures which promise sufficient food for
                    immense herds of cattle, yet the climate is very unfavourable to the raising of
                    such stock. However, some horses, mules, sheep, and goats are bred; and a
                    tolerably good morocco leather is prepared from the skins of the last. The
                    dearness of meat causes a scarcity of tallow, for which vegetable wax is used as
                    a substitute. A country which has but few articles to export cannot be accounted
                    very rich; and Pamplona would even be very poor, were it not for the extreme
                    division of property, which is the means of diffusing comfort through a great
                    number of families. The llanos adjoining the valley of Savateca would be an
                    advantageous opening for the grains of the country in exchange for cattle, were
                    there any road to facilitate commercial intercourse. This might, however, be
                    effected by following the direction of the valley watered by the Chitoya, which
                    would appear to be one of the head streams of the Apure. By this means Pamplona
                    would be brought into communication with Guiana. Giron might do so likewise with
                    the distant provinces by the same road; and instead of paying very dearly for
                    the provisions which this town draws from the llanos of Casanare by the salt
                    mine of Chita (that article being chiefly derived from this place or from
                    Zipaquira), it would procure them at a moderate price from those of Varinas.
                    This article carries almost all the specie from Giron.</p><p>The most flourishing towns of this province are those of St Joseph and of Rosaria
                    de Cucuta, notwithstanding the disadvantages under which they labour from want
                    of an opening for their productions. Their territory, varied by the valleys
                    watered by the Jachira, the Pamplona, and the Zulia, has some fine cocoa
                    plantations. The appearance of Rosaria de Cucuta is extremely pleasing.
                    Surrounded by rich haciendas in excellent cultivation, it stands as it were in
                    the midst of a delightful garden. The perspective at the extremity of each
                    street terminates in a beautiful vista, with high mountains in the back-ground.
                    The town, which is not large, is neat and well built. The houses have a clean
                    appearance, but are not large. The streets are paved, and have a current of
                    water running through the middle. This town will ever be famed in the annals of
                    Colombia, as the place in which the first general congress was held, and where
                    the constitution was framed. It was also the place understood to have been fixed
                    on as the future capital of Colombia, under the name of the City of Bolivar; but
                    such has not taken place. The town of Salazar de las Palmas has declined in
                    proportion as those of the valley of Cucuta have advanced in prosperity. Some
                    rich parishes, however, particularly St Jago and Cayetano, may be reckoned
                    amongst its dependencies. This town owes its name to the great variety of palms
                    which cover that part of the province where it is situated. The different kinds
                    found here are the royal palm, which affords wine and butter; the negro-head
                    palm, the fruit of which can be worked like ivory; the noli and the murap-po<pb break="no" facs="nls:194567014" xml:id="kp-eb0716-7014-0780"/>,
                    which latter is used in covering houses, and the twigs of which are eaten. Much
                    of this province, from being traversed by the Andes, is of course very elevated.
                    The town of Pamplona, situated in 8° north latitude, is about eight thousand
                    feet above the level of the sea. This elevation, however, serves to moderate the
                    temperature, which averages about 60° of Fahrenheit. But the climate is by no
                    means agreeable, on account of the vapours which continually darken the heavens.
                    Pamplona is situated in a valley about a league in extent, and is surrounded on
                    all sides by high hills. It possesses a great many churches; and as the houses
                    stand pretty well apart, from each having a portion of garden-ground attached to
                    it, the city at a little distance has a spacious appearance. The surrounding
                    fields are enclosed by stone walls in a very regular manner, imparting to the
                    scene an air of proprietorship which is not often met with. The effect, however,
                    which Pamplona has, as seen from the adjacent eminences, is considerably abated
                    when the town is entered. It exhibits little of its former wealth and
                    importance. Many of the houses are found to be abandoned, the streets are
                    overgrown with grass, and the gardens are neglected. This city was founded by
                    Pedro de Ursua in the year 1549. The gold and copper mines in the vicinity
                    formerly gave it an importance which it does not now possess. The gold mines of
                    Veta, which are within two days’ journey of this place, have not been regularly
                    worked for more than a century; but the Indians occasionally bring grains to
                    sell of a considerable size. Not many years ago a mass of pure gold was found
                    which weighed upwards of six pounds. The parish church of Pamplona is reckoned
                    one of the most handsome in the kingdom. The Jesuits had formerly a college
                    here; and there were also several monasteries, which are now abandoned. The
                    population of this town has been estimated at 3200. It is situated 180 miles
                    west-southwest of Merida, 131 west of Varinas, and 270 north-east of Bogota.
                    There appears to be no other place in this province deserving of particular
                    mention. The whole population of Pamplona, consisting of whites, half-whites,
                    and Indians, has been estimated at 75,000. <hi rend="smallcaps">(r. r.
