                    of</hi> ST, a distinguished naval officer, was born at Meaford, in
                    Staffordshire, on the 9th of January 1734, old style. His father, Lwynfen
                    Jervis, Esq., was counsel and solicitor to the admiralty, and treasurer of
                    Greenwich Hospital. Young Jervis was destined for the law, but having contracted
                    a dislike to that profession, and a strong predilection for the sea, he ran away
                    from school, and expressed his determination to be a sailor. He was therefore
                    placed under Commodore Townsend, who was at that time going out in the
                    Gloucester as commander-in-chief to Jamaica. This was in the year 1748. In 1754
                    he was made a lieutenant out of the Prince into the Royal Anne; and in the year
                    1759 he distinguished himself very much at the siege and capture of Quebec, when
                    General Wolfe was killed. He was in consequence promoted by Sir Charles
                    Saunders, the commander-in-chief, to the rank of commander into the Porcupine
                    sloop of war. In the following year he was made a post-captain. He commanded the
                    Foudroyant in July 1788, when the memorable rencontre took place between Admiral
                    Keppel and Count d’Orvilliers, and bore a very distinguished part in that
                    action. In 1782, Captain Jervis fell in off Brest harbour with the French ship
                    Pegase, of seventy-four guns and 700 men, and took her after an engagement which
                    lasted three-quarters of an hour. The Pegase had eighty men killed and wounded,
                    while Captain Jervis and four men only were wounded on board the Foudroyant. In
                    consequence of this action, which at once raised his renown to the highest
                    pitch, he was created a knight companion of the Bath. In 1784 he was elected
                    member of parliament for Launceston, and he afterwards sat for North Yarmouth.
                    In 1787 he was advanced to the rank of rear-admiral of the blue, in 1793 to that
                    of vice-admiral, and in 1795 he became admiral.</p>
                <p>In November 1793 an expedition was fitted out to attack the French Carribee
                    islands, and Sir Charles Grey and Sir John Jervis were nominated respectively to
                    command the land and sea forces to be employed on the occasion. The expedition
                    was at first completely successful, and Martinique, St Lucia, and Guadaloupe,
                    were surrendered to the British arms. The French however succeeded in retaking
                    Guadaloupe, and the rainy season and the yellow fever frustrated all the efforts
                    of the British to regain possession of it. In 1795, on the resignation of
                    Admiral Hood, Jervis was appointed to the command of the British fleet in the
                    Mediterranean, and was employed in blockading the French fleet in Toulon, and
                    protecting our trade in the Levant, a service which he performed with consummate
                    skill and success.</p>
                <p>In 1797 Admiral Jervis, with only fifteen ships of the line, gained his
                    celebrated victory over the Spanish fleet, consisting of twenty-seven ships of
                    the line. The engagement, which took place off Cape St Vincent. on the 14th of
                    February, lasted about ten hours. The Spaniards were completely defeated, and
                    four sail of the line, two of 112, one of 84, and one of 74 guns, were taken.
                    The thanks of both houses of Parliament were voted to the fleet, and <pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0721-0692-0652"/> the commander-in-chief was created a peer, by the
                    title of Earl of St Vincent. This victory was much more important in its
                    consequences than might be supposed from the mere numerical loss which it caused
                    to the enemy. It paralyzed the power of Spain, gave encouragement to our allies,
                    and added fresh vigour to the efforts of the government in prosecuting the war.
                    The battle of Cape St Vincent was followed by the mutiny of the British fleet at
                    Spithead; and in the month of May and June following its effects were felt in
                    the fleet which was cruizing before Cadiz under the command of Lord St Vincent.
                    But the ringleaders were executed, and the mutiny speedily repressed by the
                    resolute and determined conduct of the commander-in-chief, with a combination of
                    humanity and ingenuity eminently characteristic of the man: he contrived to make
                    one execution produce the effect of many, by ordering it on an unusual day,
                    Sunday morning. It was the practice to dispatch mutinous vessels to serve under
                    his orders; and by his masterly operations of combined mercy and justice, he
                    soon reduced them to order, restoring discipline by such examples as should be
                    most striking, without being more numerous than absolute necessity required. In
                    June 1799 he resigned the command of the fleet, in consequence of ill health,
                    and returned to England in the month of August following. On the resignation of
                    Lord Bridport, and his final retirement from active service, he was appointed to
                    the command of the Channel fleet, and in the spring of 1800 hoisted his flag in
                    the Ville de Paris. In the following year, on the formation of the Addington
                    ministry, he was made first lord of the admiralty, and in that important office
                    the great capacity for business with which he was endowed by nature shone forth
                    in all its lustre. He instituted the celebrated Commission of Naval Inquiry,
                    which not only led to numberless discoveries of abuse and extravagance, but laid
                    the foundation of a system of economical administration, which has since been
                    extended from the navy to all the departments of the state. The extent of
                    corruption brought to light by the Commissioners of Naval Inquiry almost exceeds
                    belief. From the dockyard only the government was plundered at the rate of a
                    million sterling annually, and the same nefarious practices prevailed in all the
                    other departments. Lord St Vincent grappled boldly with these monstrous and
                    deep-rooted abuses, and by his unsparing rigour, inflexible honesty, and
                    resistless energy, succeeded in putting them down. “It is impossible,” says Lord
                    Brougham “to calculate what would have been the saving effected to the revenues
                    of this country, had Lord St Vincent presided over any great department of
                    national affairs from the beginning of the war, instead of coming to our
                    assistance after its close.” The resignation of Mr Addington in 1804 put an end
                    to the naval administration of St Vincent. as first lord of the admiralty; but
                    the exigencies of the state caused him in 1806 to be called from his well-earned
                    retirement, and from the enjoyment of his domestic comforts, at the age of
                    seventy-two, to take the command of the Channel fleet. He was at the head of the
                    expedition, and the commission sent to the court of Portugal in 1806; and his
                    conduct in that delicate and important affair displayed great talents and
                    address. In the spring of 1807, advanced age and impaired health compelled him
                    finally to resign his command. The remainder of his life was spent in retirement
                    at his beautiful seat of Rochetts, where he died on the 14th of March 1823, in
                    the eighty-eighth year of his age. The character of Lord St Vincent presented an
                    admirable union of the brightest qualities which can adorn both civil and
                    military life. As a statesman, he was distinguished for his sagacity and
                    foresight, and the profoundness of his views. He was a steady and consistent
                    supporter of liberal principles, ever preferring the side of humanity and
                    freedom. He was not more distinguished for his great talents than for his
                    magnanimity and complete freedom from every feeling of jealousy or envy. And it
                    has been justly said by one who knew him well, that “all good officers, all men
                    employed under him, whether in civil or military service, spoke of him as they
                    felt, with admiration of his genius approaching to enthusiasm.” (Captain
