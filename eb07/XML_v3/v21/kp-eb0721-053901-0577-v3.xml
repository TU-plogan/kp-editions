                    of Christians in the Cottian Alps, well known under these names, whether used as
                    a territorial or ecclesiastical distinction. They formerly peopled a continuous
                    and extensive mountain tract of country both in France and Italy, in the
                    provinces of Dau phiné and Provence, and in Piedmont, when these provinces were
                    under one sovereignty; but, reduced by a long series of persecutions, they are
                    now confined to the three valleys of Perosa, San Martino, and Lucerna, on the
                    Italian side of the mountains, in the dominions of the king of Sardinia.</p>
                <p>In these beautiful valleys, extending up the slopes of mount Vise and mount
                    Genevre, and lying between the rivers Pelice and Clusone, which come to a point
                    of junction a little before they fall into the Po, the remnant of the Valdenses
                    still have their existence as an established church of regular organization.
                    They have endowments of land, churches, schools, and institutions peculiar to
                    themselves; they have a liturgy of their own; they are recognised by the laws of
                    the country to which they belong, and protected by treaties and compacts with
                    the Protestant powers of Europe. It has not been accurately determined at what
                    time, or how, they obtained the appellation of Valdenses, under which they have
                    been known since the 12th century, and which, from the resemblance in sound and
                    orthography, has been erroneously thought to identify their derivation with that
                    of the disciples of Valdo, the Lyonese reformer. From the circumstances of the
                    times, and, from the fact, that the fugitives from Lyon took refuge<note

                    come into historical notoriety under the name of Vaudois and Waldenses
                    contemporaneously with Valdo; but traces of them, as a body of subalpine
                    Christians, protesting against the errors of Rome, are found in ecclesiastical
                    records of a much earlier date.</p>
                <p>That the Cottian Alps have been inhabited by a relatively pure association of
                    Christians from time immemorial, who have testified for the truth, upon the same
                    articles of faith, as the Protestant churches of modern times, is a tradition
                    not unsupported by documentary evidence, but still open to discussion. The
                    Valdenses of these regions maintain that they are descended from a race, who
                    peopled the same villages, and professed the same gospel, in the first centuries
                    of the Christian era. “We have inherited our religion,” say they, “with our
                    lands, from the primitive Christians.” This is no modern pretension, put forth
                    since the Reformation; for the same language, as to their antiquity, was held by
                    their ancestors, not only after the time of Valdo, but in the age before that
                    reformer, to whom their origin is sometimes imputed.</p>

                    ages.</p>
                <p>The inquirer, who would make himself master of the religious character of the
                    Valdensian church, must take care not to be led out of his way in search of it.
                    He must confine his attention to one particular locality, that is, the subalpine
                    territory lying between Mount Genevre and Mount Viso. It has been the mistake of
                    many writers and readers to ask among the heretics of all times and places for
                    the creed of the Valdenses. But, if we would do them justice, and ascertain the
                    articles of faith really maintained by them, we should look to three periods of
                    time for this information.</p>

                <p>The <hi rend="italic">third</hi> is the age immediatialy before that of Valdo.
                    The authorities to be consulted for the religious opinions of the Valdenses at
                    these periods, are, 1. the public acts of synod, and the liturgy of the
                    Valdensian church, as it now exists; 2. the account given of the Valdenses by
                    Claude Seyssel, archbishop of Turin, after his visitation of the diocese in
                    1517; and, 3. that admirable monument of faith, hope, and charity, called the
                    <hi rend="italic">Nobla Leyczon,</hi> alleged to have been written in the year
                    1100. These represent the Valdenses as rejecting image worship, the invocation
                    of saints, the necessity of auricular confession, the obligations to celibacy,
                    papal supremacy and infallibility, and the doctrine of purgatory; as professing
                    to take scripture for the only rule of faith; and believing in the holy Trinity,
                    in original sin, in the atonement and mediation of Christ alone, in
                    justification by faith, in the two sacraments of baptism and the Lord’s Supper,
                    and in the apostolical ordinance of holy orders.</p>
                <p>The misrepresentations of friends and enemies, and the destruction of their
                    documents in the course of numberless persecutions, render it a hard task to
                    disentangle Valdensian history from the confusion under which it lies.
                    Notwithstanding all that has been written on the subject, we still want evidence
                    of a more convincing and irresistible nature, as to their origin,<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>On the origin of the
                    Valdenses, some curious materials for conjecture will be found in the history of
                    the Gothic Christians of the fifth century, and their relics in France and
                    Italy. Salvianus de Gub. Dei, 1. 7, Alcuin in his Epistles, and Theodolphus,
                    three hundred years later, speak of the purity of their lives, while they allude
                    to the imperfections of their notions in relation to church
                    observances.</p></note> succession, and progress. There are provoking
                    uncertainties attending the inquiry; but amidst all the clouds in which it is
                    involved, one bright truth gleams strongly out of the darkness, even from the
                    time when the Valdenses came first into notoriety and conflict. The little
                    Christian flock has been indestructible, in defiance of those who strove to be
                    its destroyers, and, like the flaming bush. It has burned, but has not been
                    consumed. Neither executions nor arguments, neither violence nor calumnies, have
                    prevailed for its extinction. To what can this be attributed? Not to the
                    protection of situation only, not to accidental causes, but, under the divine
                    blessing, to the stronghold which the sanctity of truth has upon the sympathies
                    of men, in spite of their angry passions. The Valdenses found favour with their
                    sovereigns, and obtained immunities, privileges, and pledges of security from
                    time to time, which could not have been forced from the strong by the weak, and
                    never would have been conceded to fanatical or rebellious subjects. The very
                    fact of their existence is an attestation to the purity of their faith and
                    conduct, and a refutation of those who reproached them with gross errors. He who
                    has made darkness his secret place, has mysteriously preserved them; and
                    astonished the pride of Christian orthodoxy, by making a fold, for these few
                    sheep in the wilderness, from whence they might rebuke error, and bear witness
                    to the truth.</p>

                    truth of history been so concealed.</p>
                <p>Another circumstance which has contributed to darken Valdensian history, is the
                    doubtful line of separation between kingdom and kingdom, diocese and diocese,
                    during the middle ages, and the frequent transfers from one authority to
                    another. The bishops of Turin and Embrun sometimes exercised jurisdiction almost
                    indiscriminately on each side of the Cottian Alps; and in many of the old
                    documents, when we read of the valleys of Fraissiniere, Pragela, Clusone, and
                    others. It is difficult to understand to what localities or people they refer.
                    Need it therefore occasion surprise, if many links are found to be wanting, in
                    the chain of documentary evidence necessary to unite the present with the past,
                    in the annals of an obscure district, belonging to a realm whose entire history
                    is wrapt in mystery?</p>
                <p>In a few years, perhaps. It will be more easy to give a satisfactory account of
                    the Valdenses, because the present king of Sardinia is permitting the ancient
                    records of his states to be examined and published; and an historical commission
                    at Turin, has already sent many important documents to press, which throw light
                    on subalpine affairs.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                <p>It is in vain to pretend to reduce the annals of the Valdensian church to any
                    thing like connected history, till we descend to the period when persecution
                    brought it into notice. We may. It is true, pick up a few materials relating to
                    the country, and to the general aspect of religion, from the early documents
                    which have come down to us, but these are scanty and unsatisfactory. For
                    example, we learn that the Cottian Alps received the gospel in the second
                    century, and that Irenaeus, bishop of Lyon, made himself master of the Celtic
                    language, that he might minister among the mountaineers; that facilities of
                    intercourse between the subalpines and the inhabitants of the plain, were
                    secured by good roads leading through the centre of the valleys now called
                    Protestant, in the direction of Mount Genevre, Oulx and Fenestrelle; that the
                    village of St Secondo, in the valley of the Clusone, is so called from a martyr
                    of that name in the year 120; that Crisolo, near Rora in Val Lucerna, was the
                    place of St Geoffrey’s concealment, before his martyrdom in 297; and that,
                    during the persecution of Diocletian, many Christians of the Theban legion found
                    refuge in these regions.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    have no ground for maintaining that the Valdenses were in a state of secession
                    from the provincial bishops of France or Italy, within whose dioceses they were
                    situated, at either of the periods to which we have just referred, the fourth
                    and the ninth centuries. In those days, and for two or three hundred years after
                    Claude, the truth might be held, and public testimonies for the truth might be
                    given, and protests against the errors of Rome might be made, without the
                    necessity of separation from the church called catholic: witness the great
                    Iconoclastic question which agitated Christendom in the ninth and tenth
                    centuries. There is reason therefore to believe that, until a much later period,
                    congregations of the Cottian Alps may have continued to maintain a purer faith
                    than that of Rome, without leading to any proceedings in those parts, which
                    could be called acts of schism on the one side, or of persecution on the
                    other.</p>
                <p>The accusing and remonstrating voice within the church, and not open secession
                    from her, may have distinguished the Valdensian from the Romanist, for a series
                    of ages; and the political condition, as well as the natural position of the
                    territory, to which he belonged, may have proved his security. There was no
                    occasion for him to separate, so long as he was not compelled to do violence to
                    his conscience; so long as the civil rights enjoyed in Ostro-gothic and feudal

                    exhibits too many marks of suppression not to excite our fears that much
                    information relating to the “Evangelical Valleys of Piemont” has been withheld.
                    Enough has however been brought to light, to satisfy us, that the political
                    condition of the Cottian Alps, and of the people whom some ecclesiastical
                    writers are fond of deriding under the term “brutae gentes Alpium,” (between the
                    age of Claude and the first public persecution of the Valdenses) was exactly
                    such as to secure religious objectors from molestation, and to justify the
                    language, which the Valdenses have invariably held in all their petitions to
                    their sovereigns, when their religious liberties have been threatened—“We have
                    asserted our right to enjoy liberty of conscience,” "da ogni tempo,” “da tempo
                    immemoriale,” from time immemorial. “Is it not extraordinary,” says the
                    historian Leger, “that it has never once happened that any one of our princes or
                    their ministers should have offered the least contradiction to their Valdensian
                    subjects, who have again and again asserted in their presence, 'We are descended
                    from those who, from father to son, have preserved entire the apostolical faith,
                    in the valleys which we now occupy. Permit us therefore to have that free
                    exercise of our religion, which we have enjoyed from time out of mind, before
                    the dukes of Savoy became princes of Piemont ?’”</p>
                <p>The supreme authority of the princes of the house of Savoy was not fully
                    established in Piedmont until the middle of the thirteenth century, (before that
                    time the emperors of Germany exercised all the rights of suzerainté) and it is a
                    curious fact, that the house of Savoy arrived at absolute power by means of the
                    public confidence which it enjoyed, in consequence of its equitable government,
                    and faithful adherence, for many ages, to compacts made with its subjects. These
                    compacts were the origin and the preservatives of the religious liberties of the
                    Valdenses. “We, are obliged to tolerate heresy in the valleys of our realm,” was

                <p>The fiercest deciaimers against Valdensian schismatics might find some
                    extenuation for a people who were forced into secession; first, by the
                    corruptions and spiritual neglect of the clergy of the dominant church; and,
                    secondly, by excommunication. Every ecclesiastical history makes mention of the
                    utter depravity of most of the Romish clergy of the tenth, eleventh, twelfth,
                    and thirteenth centuries; and we gather from the first volume of the Piedmontese
                    Historical Documents, published in 1836, that at one time nearly all the
                    ecclesiastics of the Cottian Alps fled from before the Saracen invaders, and
                    never returned to their parishes; and at another time that there was a wreck of
                    churches <hi rend="italic">(naufragatis ecclesiis,)</hi> and destitution of
                    pastors throughout the whole diocese of Turin. Endowments for parochial service
                    were transferred to monasteries at a distance, and villages were left without
                    regular pastoral superintendence. One charter states that a third of the whole
                    mountain territory between Mount Cenis and Mount Genèvre was made over to a
                    distant convent. Another consigns no less than half of all the lands lying
                    between Pignerol and Col Sestrières to an abbey at Pignerol. A third despoils
                    the whole of Val Guichard of its rents, for the enrichment of a fraternity of
                    monks in another part of the country, in the plains on the banks of the Po. All
                    this must have contributed to produce that state of spiritual destitution which
                    ultimately led to, and warranted separation; and when the severance was once
                    completed, the hierarchy of Rome could never re-establish its authority over
                    those valleys of Piedmont which are now called Protestant. They were so free
                    from Romish intrusiveness at one period, that Vin-centius Ferrerins, the
                    Dominican, who preached to the Val-denses in the year 1405,<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See Praef. Ricchini ad Monetam, p.
                    xvi.</p></note> reported to the principal of his order, that they had not heard
                    the voice of a minister of the church for thirty years before; and Claude
                    Seyssel declared a century afterwards, that so entirely had they been abandoned
                    by priests and bishops, no prelate but himself had dared to approach them within
                    the memory of man.</p>
                <p>The transfer of property in the valleys, to monasteries and convents, was the
                    first step that led to persecution. The possession of lands in signoralty
                    carried with it certain rights of jurisdiction, which enabled the monastic
                    bodies to exercise temporal as well as spiritual tyranny. They acquired the
                    power of holding local courts for the adjudication of all criminal causes,
                    co-extensive with that which had been originally conferred on the feudal
                    proprietors for the protection of the people of their domains; so that the very
                    privileges which were favourable to religious liberty, while they were exercised
                    by lay superiors, became dangerous to the vassals of estates, in process of
                    time, when they were made over to ecclesiastics. The commencement of the
                    thirteenth century is the era from which we date those horrible atrocities with
                    which religion has been insulted, and humanity outraged, to appease the offended
                    majesty of Rome. Innocent the Third, and Dominic, the father of the Inquisition,
                    (the seraphic spirit of Dante’s commendation) divide the honour of having let
                    loose fire and sword against those who presumed to question the dogmas of the
                    Vatican, in two new forms, impiously called “missions of peace and good will.”
                    The one was the crusade against the Albigenses, which swept multitudes from the
                    face of the earth in open warfare; and the other was the institution of a secret
                    tribunal, which had its informers and its executioners every where, and, as an
                    “act of faith,” condemned thousands, after the mockery of a trial, to expire in
                    the flames, or to linger out life in a dungeon. But though some martyrs were
                    dragged to the stake from the vicinities of the Cottian Alps, nearest to the
                    plains of Piedmont on the one side, and to the cities of Dauphiné on the other,
                    yet the more secluded of these regions continued to be secure asylums until the
                    end of the fourteenth century. The communes of Fressinière and Argentière, in
                    the diocese of Embrun, on the French side of the mountains, were then ransacked
                    for victims, in obedience to a papal bulh<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>This and the document next quoted are published in the works

                    were sacrificed, and others were obliged to fly to the very edge of the glaciers
                    for safety. But it is remarkable, that although a similar bull was issued
                    against the nonconformists of the valleys of Lucerna and San Martino on the
                    Italian border, no means were there found of putting the exterminating
                    commission in execution. Again and again the temporal sovereigns of the
                    Piedmontese Valdenses received mandates from Rome to draw the sword against
                    them, and to “crush the serpent,” but they would not. Even when the persecuting
                    storm of 1400 extended from Dauphiné to the Italian valley of Pragela, which was
                    then under the dominion of France, the adjoining valleys of Lucerna and San
                    Martino heard the pontifical thunder, but were unscorched by its lightning.</p>

                    frontier, often operated in their favour, in the moment of danger; and even at
                    times when the sovereigns of the principality consented to their destruction,
                    the lords of the soil became their advocates. Thus, in the year 1553, when the
                    havoc which was made among the nonconformists of Provence and Dauphiné, reached
                    the valleys of Piedmont. It would have been more fatal, had not Blanche,

                <p>In 1560, the dark cloud which had long been gathering over the mountain church,
                    burst upon it with all its fury; and never did the majesty of truth and
                    innocence stand out more brightly to view, than during the tempests of
                    persecution, which raged at intervals for the next hundred years and more.</p>
                <p>The subalpine communities, which had been placed under papal interdicts, saw
                    themselves exposed to the hostile power of the French king on one side, and to
                    that of the duke of Savoy on the other. They were commanded by edicts to banish
                    their ministers and schoolmasters, to abstain from the exercise of their own
                    forms of worship, and to attend the services of the Romish church. They refused,
                    and orders for confiscation, imprisonment, and death, were launched against
                    them. Hundreds perished on the scaffold, or at the stake; and the villages
                    swarmed with brigands, who, under the name of officers of justice, plundered the
                    wretched inhabitants, and haled them to prison, until the dungeons were choked
                    with victims.</p>
                <p>The population of the valleys still remaining faithful to the religion of their
                    forefathers, the sword was openly unsheathed, and the scabbard thrown away. An
                    armed force, commanded by a chief whose name was in terrible contrast with his
                    character, the Count de la Trinité, poured into the proscribed territory. But a
                    spirit stronger than the sword upheld the Valdenses, and an arm more powerful
                    than that which assailed them, fought on their side. The villages near the
                    plains were deserted, the women, the children, the feeble, and the aged, were
                    sent for refuge to the heights of the mountains, to the rocks and to the
                    forests. Every man and boy who could handle a weapon, planted himself against
                    the invaders, and a successful guerilla warfare was carried on by small brigades
                    of peasants, against the veteran troops who were let loose upon them. Greater
                    exploits, and instances of more enduring fortitude, were never recounted, than
                    those which have immortalized the resistance offered by the Valdenses to their
                    oppressors. It must however suffice to say, that the history of the Valdenses,
                    from the year 1560 to the close of the eighteenth century, is a narrative of
                    sanguinary struggles for existence, with very few intervals of repose.</p>
                <p>If the churches of the valleys had an intermission of suffering under one reign,
                    they were driven to desperation in another. The years 1565, 1573, 1581, 1583,
                    and the period between 1591 and 1594, are memorable as dates of religious and
                    civil conflict.</p>
                <p>In 1595, the duke of Savoy smiled upon his Protestant subjects; in 1596 and 1597
                    he persecuted them. From 1602 to 1620, a series of edicts,<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See Raccolta degh' Editti.</p></note> some
                    threatening, and others indulgent, kept the Valdenses in a state of perpetual
                    suspense and agitation; but the tenor of the most alarming of these, which
                    confined them within certain limits, proves that they had rights and privileges,
                    within those limits at least, which nothing but the importunity and the
                    misrepresentations of the Romish hierarchy, could induce their sovereigns
                    reluctantly to violate.</p>
                <p>Of the twenty years that followed, almost all were distinguished by some act of
                    cruelty or oppression. In 1640,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    appointment of an English envoy at the court of Turin, and his occasional
                    residence at La Tour, the principal village of the Valdenses, shed a ray of
                    transient sunshine over this afflicted people; but this was shortly followed by
                    a hurricane of persecution similar to that of 1560, and unutterable atrocities
                    were committed by the soldiery employed to enforce the destroying edict of 1655.
                    That year would have seen the last of the Valdenses, had not all the Protestant
                    powers of Europe interposed, especially England, whose supreme ruler, Oliver
                    Cromwell, under the influence of Milton, became their protector.</p>
                <p>In 1686, Victor Amadeus, the young duke of Savoy, instigated by the courts of
                    France and Rome, and ambitious of succeeding where his ancestors had failed,
                    sent an overwhelming body of troops into the valleys of Lucerna, Perosa, and San
                    Martino, to compel the inhabitants to go to mass. During three years and a half,
                    the exercise of the ancient religion of the Valdenses had to all appearance
                    ceased in Piedmont. Those who would not conform were obliged to flee for their
                    lives. But the return of eight hundred Valdensian exiles in 1689,<note

                    their native mountains, for the recovery of their rights, was signalised by
                    incidents un surpassed in the history of providential and romantic events, and
                    was crowned with success. At this critical juncture, a quarrel arose between the
                    king of France and Victor Amadeus, which induced the latter to take this heroic
                    band and the scattered remnant of his Protestant subjects into favour.
                    “Hitherto,” said he, “we have been enemies, but from henceforth we must be
                    friends; others are to blame more than myself for the evils you have suffered.”
                    This happy turn in their affairs was followed by treaties between the English
                    and Piedmontese governments, in the reigns of William the Third and Queen Anne,
                    articles of which were meant to secure to the Valdenses the undisturbed exercise
                    of their religion within certain territorial limits.<note anchored="true"

                <p>But the wrongs of the Valdenses were not yet at an end, and their sovereigns,
                    under their new title of kings of Sardinia, forgot to be generous and just.
                    Again and again these sufferers have had to contend not only against petty
                    injuries and harassing grievances, but also against absolute oppression. By an
                    act of open violence, the valley of Pra-gela was dragooned into conformity with
                    Rome, in the year 1727, on the diplomatic pretence, that this region was not
                    included in the articles of treaty which secured toleration within defined
                    boundaries. The English ambassador at Turin remonstrated, and urged the sacred
                    engagements which guaranteed toleration and safety to the Protestants of
                    Piedmont, but he was not properly supported by his government at home, and the
                    objects of his sympathy cried for redress in vain.<note anchored="true"

                    of Savoy to the kingdom of Sardinia, four days after the king had taken
                    possession of his palace at Turin, they were replaced under their former

                    Ferdinand dal Pozzo, late Maitre des Requetes, and First President of the
                    imperial Court of Genoa, entitled “The complete Emancipation of the Vaudois
                    advocated.” In this the author maintains, that by the treaty of Paris, May 31,
                    1814. the Valdenses were put in possession of all the rights acquired by the
                    inhabitants of Piedmont under the French dominion, and that, in violation of
                    these rights, there are no Protestants now in Europe, in so low and degraded a
                    position as they.</p></note> The restored prince acknowledged, on more occasions
                    than one, “the constant and distinguished proof which the Valdenses had ever
                    given to his predecessors of attachment and fidelity and bore this testimony to
                    their merit: “I know I have faithful subjects in the Vaudois; they will never
                    dishonour their character.” But still he listened to evil counsel, and the yoke
                    was again placed upon their necks. And evil counsellors still prevail. In 1832,
                    the measures adopted against the Valdenses were so threatening, that the British
                    parliament took up their cause; and extracts of the treaties between Great
                    Britain and the dukes of Savoy and kings of Sardinia, were ordered by the House
                    of Commons to be printed, on the motion of Sir R. Inglis, with the
                    correspondence of the British minister at Turin, relative to the treatment of

                <p>The reigning king of Sardinia, Charles Albert, is disposed to shew them kindness,
                    and to place them on a level with his other subjects. He has proved this by
                    numberless acts of favour; but the tiara and the mitre are too strong for the
                    crown in Piedmont; and the baneful influence of the papal authority, so late as
                    September 1837, wrung from the reluctant king two articles in the new code of
                    Sardinia, by which the intolerant edicts of the 16th and 17th centuries<note

                    or to offer any opposition to the conversion of Protestants by Roman Catholics;

                    and may be put in force as soon as the Roman hierarchy shall feel itself strong
                    enough to do so. In the meantime, another engine is employed against the hapless
                    Valdenses. The rich order of St Maurice and St Lazarus has contributed 238,617
                    francs, (L.9544) and an income of 17,000 francs (L.680) a-year, towards the
                    establishment of a fraternity of missionary priests at La Tour, whose business
                    it will be to make proselytes from among the descendants of a race which has
                    never yet swerved from its faith, but which will now be exposed more than ever,
                    to the threats and artifices of an adversary who knows well how to turn
                    opportunities to advantage.</p>
                <p>The Protestants of England have not been inattentive to the condition of their
                    brethren in the valleys of Piedmont. Public collections have on several
                    occasions been made throughout the kingdom; and the Society for the Propagation
                    of the Gospel in Foreign Parts is the trustee of considerable funds raised in
                    their behalf. A committee in London, consisting of the archbishop of Canterbury,
                    several bishops, and other persons of distinction, has also been employing
                    contributions in aid of the clergy, hospitals, and schools of the Valdenses, and
                    watching over their interests since the year 1825.</p>
                <p>The difficulties with which the Valdenses have now to contend are, poverty, and
                    reduced numbers, being confined to limits which do not produce subsistence for
                    more than a very limited population. They also labour under the disadvantage of
                    having to learn three languages before they can receive competent instruction.
                    Their national language is Italian; their vernacular tongue is a provincial
                    dialect, peculiar to their district; and the language of instruction is French,
                    because in that only they can obtain books of devotion used by Protestants.</p>
                <p>If the government of Great Britain should cease to exercise its good offices at
                    the court of Turin, in behalf of the Protestants of Piedmont; or, if the people
                    of Great Britain should become indifferent to the moral and spiritual wants of
                    this impoverished community, the religious liberties of the Valdenses will be no
                    more, and the lamp of this little mountain-church will be extinguished for
                    ever.</p>
                <p>Since this article went to press, some additional information on the sacred
                    literature and religious prospects of this interesting community has transpired.
                    Their liberties have been further threatened by three intimations, which strike
                    at the very root of their Christian privileges. The first is an article of the
                    code promulgated at Turin, which forbids the printing of manuscripts, for their
                    use, in other countries, unless they shall have previously passed the censorship
                    at Turin. This will have the effect of cutting off the future supply of
                    religious books and tracts, because the board of censors is composed entirely of
                    Roman Catholics. The second is an order published in the Turin Gazette of 27th
                    December 1840, to this effect :—“By decree of the holy congregation of Rome, the
                    New Testament of our Lord Jesus Christ, translated into the Piedmontese
                    language, is condemned and prohibited.” This prohibition, made at the
                    instigation of Rome, appears seven years after the book had passed the
                    censorship, and had been introduced by legal permission into the Protestant
                    valleys of Piedmont. The third is a message sent to the Valdensian moderator, by
                    the president of revision at Turin, demanding by what authority the College of
                    the Holy Trinity at La Tour has a library of books !!</p>
                <p>The other intelligence is of a more pleasing nature, viz. the existence of three
                    copies of the ancient Valdensian version of the New Testament. It was feared
                    that all the manuscripts of this valuable and vernacular translation had
                    perished, but some recent inquiries made by the Rev. Dr. Gilly have led to the
                    announcement that three at least remain. In the public library of Grenoble, the
                    Codex No. 488, is a relic of the thirteenth century. It is a manuscript on
                    vellum, a small 4to, containing, in the following order, the four Gospels, the
                    Epistles of St. Paul, St. James, St. Peter, St. John, and St. Jude, the Acts of
                    the Apostles, the Apocalypse, the Proverbs of Solomon, Ecclesiastes, Wisdom,
                    Ecclesiasticus, and the Song of Solomon; all in the Piedmontano-Provenyal
                    dialect of the Valdenses.</p>
                <p>In the library of Trinity College, Dublin, a transcript of the same version, on
                    parchment, is preserved, which is said to have been written in 1522. In the
                    public library of Zürich, there is also to be seen a copy of an ancient
                    Valdensian translation of the New Testament, which differs in some degree from
                    the two above-mentioned, but is believed to have been written between the years
                    1350 and 1400. This manuscript is thus described:—“Codex MS. Novi Testamenti
                    Valdensis, C. <hi rend="superscript"> 169</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 706</hi>
