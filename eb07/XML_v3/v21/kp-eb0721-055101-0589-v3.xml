                    >Tasmania.</hi> This island was long considered to form the southern termination
                    of the great island of New Holland; and it was only ascertained to be an island
                    in 1798, by Surgeon Bass and Lieutenant Flinders. It is situated between the
                    parallels of 41° 20’ and 43° 40' S., and the meridians of 144° 40' and 148° 20'
                    E. It is of an irregular shape, somewhat in the form of a heart. Its broadest
                    part toward the north. Its greatest extent from north to south is estimated at
                    about 210 miles, and from east to west 150 miles. It is nearly about the size of
                    Ireland, covering an area of about 24,000 square miles. This country was first
                    discovered by Tasman in 1642. In 1773 it was visited by Captain Furneaux, and by
                    Captain Cook in 1777, since which period it has been visited by different
                    navigators. Among others, Bruny d’Entrecasteaux made this coast in 1792, and
                    afterwards revisited it in 1793. He entered a channel, which he spent some time
                    in exploring, and which is since known by the name of D’Entrecasteaux’s channel.
                    These discoveries were further prosecuted by subsequent navigators, and
                    particularly by Lieutenants Bass and Flinders, who, in different voyages, in
                    which they were occupied from 1795 to 1803, made a complete survey of this
                    coast, and also a great part of the coast of New Holland.</p>
                <p>In 1803, a detachment of troops under Lieutenant Bowen arrived here from Sydney,
                    for the purpose of establishing a penal settlement; but nothing appears to have
                    been effected at that time beyond the selection of a spot for that purpose.
                    Early in 1804, Lieutenant-Governor Collins, having in view a settlement on the
                    southern coast of New Holland, arrived from England with a more considerable
                    expedition; and having altered his determination, he directed his course to the
                    river Derwent, when the island was formally taken possession of in the name of
                    his Britannic Majesty. After various surveys of the Derwent, the present site of
                    Hobart-Town was decided upon for head-quarters. Besides several individuals of
                    respectability, he had with him about 400 pensioners, with about fifty
                    prisoners. The colony being thus planted, continued to take r∞t, although at
                    times suffering great hardship. For the first three years the inhabitants were
                    wholly dependent on foreign supplies of food, and were occasionally reduced to
                    great straits, insomuch that kangaroo meat was purchased at 1s. 6d. per lb., and
                    sea-weed, or any other vegetable substance fit for food, likewise at a high
                    price. About this time sheep and cattle began first to be imported into the
                    colony; and fresh arrivals of prisoners increased the population, which still
                    preserved the character of a penal settlement for convicted felons. In 1810
                    Governor Collins died, and was succeeded by his second in command, and by other
                    three provisional governors. In 1813 Lieutenant-Colonel Davey arrived from
                    England as lieutenant-governor; and about this period the rising importance of
                    the colony began to be gradually developed, and its prosperity was greatly
                    favoured by its port, from which hitherto all merchant vessels, except those
                    from England and New South Wales, had been interdicted, being declared free to
                    the ships of all nations. This wise and necessary measure was followed by the
                    most beneficial effects; trade began to improve. Its surplus produce was freely
                    exported, and such returns were received as were calculated greatly to increase
                    the wealth of the colony. Society began to assume the appearance of
                    civilization; and although the stream of emigration from home had not begun to
                    flow in this direction, yet the officers of the different regiments which had
                    been stationed in the colonv, and so remained in it, with the settlers brought
                    from Norfolk Island on its evacuation, besides occasional arrivals from New
                    South Wales, and emancipated convicts, formed a considerable addition to the
                    population. A greater quantity of land was cultivated, houses multiplied in
                    different quarters, farms were inclosed, and symptoms of growing wealth and
                    prosperity began daily to appear. Colonel Davey’s administration lasted till the
                    year 1817. He was succeeded by Colonel Sorell, who was intent on the internal
                    improvement of the colony, and who directed the formation of new roads, the
                    erection of bridges, and the establishment of schools and other institutions. In
                    1821 emigrants<pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=590"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0721-0590-0552"/> began to resort in great numbers to this country;
                    and as they brought with them an increase of capital, cultivation was rapidly
                    extended on all sides. A regular trade was begun, distilleries and breweries
                    were erected, the Van Diemen’s bank was established, St. David’s church at
                    Hobart-Town was completed, and every thing now indicated the rapid progress of
                    this rising community. According to a census taken in 1821, the inhabitants were
                    found to amount to 7185; the acres in cultivation to 14,940; sheep, to 170,000;
                    cattle, 35,000; and horses, 350. The colony was still dependent on New South
                    Wales, and had no regular civil or criminal courts, occasional sessions being
                    only held by judges who arrived from New South Wales. In 1825 this defect was
                    remedied: Van Diemen’s Land was declared by the king in council independent of
                    the colony of New South Wales; the chief authority was vested in a
                    lieutenant-governor and council, the latter consisting, according to the 9th
                    Geo. IV. c. 83, of fifteen members; civil and criminal courts were established;
                    and the sole dependency of the colony was in future on the mother country.</p>
                <p>The prosperity of the colony was long retarded, and the lives and properties of
                    the inhabitants endangered by a banditti of runaway convicts, who took shelter
                    in the woods, and issued in bands from these hiding-places, to plunder the
                    settlements and to murder their proprietors. They were known under the title of
                    bush-rangers; and they even proceeded so far as to write threatening letters to
                    the magistracy and the lieutenant-governor. A feeling of insecurity pervaded the
                    more remote settlements; and the most respectable farmers, with one accord,
                    betook themselves to the towns as the only certain refuge from the violence of
                    these wretches, who scrupled not at conflagration, robbery, and murder. They
                    long continued their depredations with impunity, owing to the insufficiency of
                    the military force, the ample subsistence afforded by the abundance of game, and
                    the superior local knowledge which they acquired in the course of their
                    wandering life. In order to abate this growing evil, Colonel Davey proclaimed
                    the whole island under martial law; and the military being seconded by the
                    respectable inhabitants, succeeded in apprehending the most daring of these
                    offenders, who were executed and hung in chains as a terror to their associates.
                    The proclamation of a general amnesty induced others to surrender. But many of
                    these again escaped into the woods, and renewed their lawless outrages against
                    the persons and properties of the settlers; and it was not till the year 1817,
                    that, by great exertions of the troops, aided by the settlers, this gang of
                    banditti was rooted out, most of them being apprehended by the activity of the
                    troops, and executed.</p>
                <p>Van Diemen’s Land, seen from the coast, has a more agreeable aspect than New
                    Holland. Many fine tracks of land are found on the very borders of the sea; and
                    the interior is almost invariably possessed of a soil admirably adapted to all
                    the purposes of civilized man. The island is upon the whole decidedly
                    mountainous. In the interior it is extremely diversified in its surface; not so
                    much, however, by continuous ranges of mountains, as by insulated peaks, with
                    intervening tracks of table land, and extensive and fertile valleys. On the
                    south of the island, the country presents a peculiarly bold and rude aspect,
                    hills being piled upon hills, all densely covered with trees to the top, and
                    presenting one impervious forest, except here and there a rocky eminence
                    towering to a majestic height. Farther inward the country assumes a less stern
                    and forbidding aspect, and many fine open spots meet the eye, lightly timbered
                    and extending for miles; the prospect, however, being still closed by a
                    background of lofty mountains. Between Hobart-Town and Launceston, towards the
                    north, there is a fine champaign country intersected by streams, and of great
                    extent; and towards the north coast the scenery consists of every variety of
                    hill and dale, woodland and plain, forest and village, that forms the perfection
                    of a rural landscape. The western parts of the island, though they have been
                    imperfectly explored, are represented as abounding in bold and mountainous
                    scenery, although possessing well watered and fertile plains. Here the ground
                    generally rises to a great elevation, and has consequently a milder climate in
                    winter than the inhabited districts towards the east. Of the mountains there are
                    several which rise to a great height. Mount Wellington, which is only a few
                    miles west from Hobart-Town, is 4000 feet above the level of the sea. It has a
                    magnificent appearance; and its bold and rugged hills are diversified with
                    occasional spots of sombre foliage. During eight months of the year it is
                    covered with snow; but so pure is the atmosphere, that its summit is seldom
                    obscured with clouds. Being so near Hobart-Town it has frequent visitors in
                    summer. The southern mountains near Port Davey form a long range, which
                    stretches into the interior for several miles, and in some places rises 5000
                    feet above the sea. They are covered with snow during the greater part of the
                    year. The other principal mountains in the colony are Benlomond, distant about
                    100 miles from Hobart-Town, and rising 4200 feet; the Table mountains near
                    Jericho, 3800 feet; Peak of Teneriffe, or Wylede’s Craig, 4500; Quamby’s Bluff,
                    3500; Mount Field, 3000; St. Paul’s Dome, 2500; with several others, from 1000
                    to 2000 feet in elevation.</p>
                <p>The country is well watered, numerous streams flowing from the mountains; and on
                    the summits of many of them are large lakes, which are the sources of
                    considerable rivers. The Derwent is a noble and magnificent stream, varying in
                    breadth, from its entrance up to Hobart-Town, from six to twelve miles, having
                    everywhere deep water, without rocks or sand-banks, and navigable at all
                    seasons, even by strangers, with the most perfect ease and safety. The mouth of
                    the Derwent is formed on the right by Brune island and D’Entrecasteaux’s
                    channel, and on the left by Iron Pot island and the South Arm; the latter
                    presenting for six miles a coast of highly luxuriant appearance, and then
                    abruptly terminating in the centre of the Derwent, where the river, uniting with
                    the waters of Double Bay, extends its width to nearly twelve miles. This river
                    takes its rise in a lake to the westward, and flows with considcrable rapidity,
                    receiving numerous tributary streams until it reaches New Norfolk, where it is
                    almost as wide as the Thames at Battersea, whence it pursues its course towards
                    the ocean, widening as it goes, with the finest scenery on its banks. The water
                    continues fresh for about six miles below New Norfolk. The Huon is nearly of
                    equal magnitude with the Derwent, and runs westerly until it falls into the sea
                    in one of its arms or creeks not many miles from Hobart-Town. Though it be a
                    navigable river. It is however of little value to the colony, the land on its
                    banks being so heavily timbered, that it is neither arable nor fit for
                    pasturage. It is occasionally resorted to by vessels of considerable burden for
                    the timber on its shores, which is taken in as ballast. The Tamar, formed by two
                    rivers, the North and South Esk, is navigable for its whole course, though, on
                    account of a bar and other intricacies of navigation. It requires great skill
                    and management on the part of the pilot to take up or down large vessels with
                    safety. Among the rivers of the second class that water fine districts, and are
                    extremely useful, though they are not navigable, may be enumerated the Shannon,
                    the Clyde, and the Jordan, all of which fall into the Derwent, either singly, or
                    having previously united above New Norfolk; the Coal river, which falls into the
                    sea near Richmond; and the two Esks, which join and form the Tamar at
                    Launceston. There is still a numerous class of smaller rivers, which have an
                    abundant supply of water all the year round for mills, cattle, and domestic<pb
                    break="no" facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=591"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0721-0591-0553"/> use. There are the Thames or Lachlan at New
                    Norfolk; the Plenty, the Styx, Jones’s river, and Russell’s falls, which are
                    also tributaries of the Derwent; the Macquarrie and Elizabeth rivers, more in
                    the interior, and which are tributaries of the Esk; Blackman’s river, also in
                    the heart of the colony. Farther north is the Lake river passing through Norfolk
                    plains, the Western river, the Isis, and several others of less note. More to
                    the westward are the Mersey, the Meander, the Forth, the Iris, the Leven, the
                    Emu, the Cam, the Inglis, and numerous others, which are spread over all parts
                    of the colony. Around the coast of the island many streams fall into the ocean,
                    having spread fertility over the districts through which they have previously
                    flowed. Among these may be mentioned the Carlton, Prosser’s river, Great Swan
                    Port river, Piper’s river, &amp;c.; also North-west Bay river, a few miles from
                    Hobart-Town. Others again are found in desert situations in the country, where
                    cultivation has made little progress. There are several lakes, generally in the
                    centre of the island among the mountains, of considerable extent, which abound
                    with water-fowl of all descriptions. Great Lake is about ninety miles north-west
                    of Hobart-Town, and eighty feet above the level of the sea. It is twenty miles
                    long and ten broad, with deep bays and indentations, and many promontories and
                    peninsulas extending into it. It contains five islands, covered with a species
                    of cedar, and numerous shrubs. Its greatest depth is only three fathoms. Around
                    the coast are numerous bays and harbours that afford secure anchorage. The
                    entrance from the ocean to the Derwent presents two lines of continuous bays or
                    anchorage of unrivalled excellence. The one most commonly used leads through
                    Storm bay, and the other through D’Entrecasteaux’s channel, which is one string
                    of little bays or anchorages for nearly forty miles. On the eastern coast of the
                    island is Oyster bay and Great Swan Port; on the north, Port Dalrymple, or the
                    mouth of the Tamar, Port Sorell, and Circular Head; westward, Macquarrie harbour
                    and Port Davey. Besides, there are many of smaller note, capable of affording
                    secure shelter to craft of light burden.</p>
                <p>The climate of this island is equally healthy, and more congenial to the
                    constitution of Europeans, than that of Port Jackson, not being subject to any
                    remarkable variations either of beat or cold. Generally speaking, throughout the
                    summer, alternate land and sea-breezes prevail every twenty-four hours; the wind
                    blowing from the land from sun-set till ten or eleven o’clock the following day,
                    when it is succeeded by the sea-breeze, which continues till the evening. Its
                    influence extends many miles inshore, and diffuses a refreshing coolness, even
                    in the hottest days of summer. The average thermometer is 70°, although the heat
                    is occasionally much greater, the mercury rising to 100° or 110°. This sudden
                    heat is occasioned by the north and north-west wind, which is felt at Port
                    Jackson, and here, though not in the same degree, though its effects are seen on
                    the growing crops, producing blight and other injurious consequences. The rain
                    which is almost certain to succeed in a few hours, again cools the atmosphere,
                    and corrects the bad effects of the previous sultriness. Thunder-storms are
                    rare, nor are they ever violent. During spring, which is in the months of
                    September, October, and November, the weather is usually bright and clear, with
                    occasional rain and high winds; when the average range of the thermometer is
                    between fifty and sixty degrees. The summer, which is in December, January, and
                    February, is generally dry; during which the vegetable productions arrive at
                    maturity one month earlier than they would in England, namely, in December,
                    which corresponds to June of the northern hemisphere. Autumn, which is in March,
                    April, and May, is the pleasantest season in the year; the air being clear and
                    bright, free from clouds and vapours, and the medium heat of the day about 65°.
                    The nights are cool and refreshing, which indeed is generally the case in the
                    height of summer. The winter, which is in June, July, and August, is not severe.
                    In the high and exposed situations, the snow falls thick, and lies a good part
                    of the year, and the frosts are severe; but in the lower valleys and plains, the
                    sun never loses its power during the day, and under its influence, frost and
                    snow quickly disappear; so that the winter is not regarded by the inhabitants as
                    the cold and dismal period of the higher latitudes, but as the season of
                    moderate and genial rain, which facilitates the labours of the husbandman in the
                    ensuing spring. The average range of the thermometer is from forty to
                    forty-eight degrees, though sometimes it falls lower, but seldom continues above
                    a day or two.</p>
                <p>Van Diemen’s Land abounds in every variety of soil, and with much less of an
                    indifferent quality than is to be found in New Holland. Large tracks of land,
                    perfectly free from timber or underwood, are to be found in all directions, and
                    covered with luxuriant herbage; where the colonist, entering on the possession
                    of the best land, incurs no expense in clearing his farm, but has only to set
                    fire to the grass, in order to prepare his land for immediate tillage. There are
                    other two circumstances which are extremely favourable to the colonist. The
                    rivers have all a sufficient fall to prevent any excessive accumulation of water
                    from heavy and continued rains, and are consequently free from those violent and
                    destructive inundations to which the rivers of New Holland are subject; and here
                    the colonist may settle securely without the dread of having his lands submerged
                    and his produce swept away by the devouring flood. The seasons are more regular,
                    and not liable to the same inequalities, and to those periodical droughts by
                    which New Holland is visited. In the years 1813, 1814, 1815, and likewise in
                    1839, when the whole face of the other colony was burnt up, when vegetation was
                    completely at a stand, and the cattle were perishing for want of rain, there
                    were abundant harvests in this more fruitful island, and no want of rains.
                    Within a period of about forty years since the country was settled, the crops
                    have sustained no serious detriment from the want of rain, and the harvests have
                    in general been productive; while the parent colony, since it Has been
                    established, has been repeatedly in the greatest distress from dearth and from
                    inundation. The agricultural products, with some differences arising from the
                    climate, are nearly the same as at Port Jackson. Indian corn or maize is not
                    cultivated here; but wheat, barley, and oats are raised of a very superior
                    quality. Nor is there such a variety or abundance of fruit; the finer fruits of
                    those latitudes that are nearer the equator, such as the orange, the lemon, the
                    citron, the pomegranate, &amp;c., which grow in the greatest perfection at Port
                    Jackson, are not known in this island, while the peach, the nectarine, and the
                    grape arrive at an inferior degree of maturity, and can only be raised by
                    artificial means. But on the other hand, all the fruits, such as the apple, the
                    currant, the gooseberry, and all vegetables and herbs that grow in the northern
                    climate of Europe, thrive equally well in this congenial climate. The vegetable
                    kingdom is similar to that in New South Wales. The forests abound in woods that
                    are adapted to all the various purposes of life. In many places there is no
                    underwood, the ground being covered with tall ungainly trees, standing at some
                    distance from each other, and rising up to a great height, before they shoot out
                    their branches. Much of the timber is extremely serviceable for the purpose of
                    building; while there are ornamental woods, which are highly esteemed for
                    cabinet work, and for fitting up and embellishing the interior of houses; and
                    others for their hardness and durability. All the trees are evergreens, and some
                    of them, particularly the mimosas, put forth very rich blossoms in spring. But
                    the colour has been remarked to partake more or less of yellow. The foliage of
                    the trees is generally dark green, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=592" xml:id="kp-eb0721-0592-0554"
                    />which gives rather a sombre aspect to the forests; the eye wandering over the
                    wide expanse every where presented, and in vain seeking relief from any variety
                    of hue. There is a great variety of shrubs, many of which are extremely
                    beautiful, and some of them have very elegant flowers. Among the most valuable
                    plants yet discovered, may be classed the pepper tree, the trunk of which
                    contains many medicinal properties. The tea tree is also deserving of notice,
                    the leaves serving at times as a substitute for those of the Chinese plant, and
                    though the beverage is not equally good. It has the recommendation of being much
                    cheaper.</p>
                <p>The island has not yet been sufficiently explored for the discovery of its
                    mineral treasures. Its geology is very varied. Basalt is however supposed to be
                    the principal substratum of the soil, and all along the coast it presents itself
                    in rocky precipitous heights, standing on beautiful columnar pedestals. Among
                    these may be mentioned Fluted Cape at Adventure Bay. It is so called from the
                    circular columns standing up close together, in the form of the barrels of an
                    organ. Circular Head is another singular specimen of the basaltic formation. It
                    is a curious rock, standing out of the sea, exactly like a huge round tower or
                    fortress, the work of art. Mount Wellington, already mentioned, is composed of
                    this rock, as well as the rocky banks of many of the mountain rivers. In some
                    parts, both on the coast and in the interior, the columns appear in insulated
                    positions, springing up from the grass or the ocean like obelisks or huge
                    needles. There are several specimens of this curious formation on the south side
                    of Bruné island; and the rocks on the land stand erect upon their several
                    blocks, gradually diminishing as they rise, so that the force of a well-aimed
                    stone would seem sufficient to drive the uppermost from its precarious base.
                    Limestone is almost the only mineral that has been brought into general use. It
                    has been found in abundance in most parts of the island; and a very fine species
                    of lime, used in the better sort of plastering and stuccoing, is made in
                    considerable quantities, by burning the oyster shells that are found in beds
                    along various parts of the coast. Other calcareous substances occur in different
                    parts of the island. Marble of a white mixed grey colour, susceptible of a good
                    polish, has frequently been found. Around Hobart-Town, strata of soft clayey
                    marl occur, which has been found very useful as a manure. Much of the common
                    limestone is of a yellowish or reddish colour, derived from the oxide of iron
                    with which it is mixed, and which is so generally scattered throughout the
                    island. Of the metallic ores, that of iron abounds, of a red, brown, and black
                    colour. In one or two instances in which it has been analyzed. It has been found
                    to contain eighty per cent. of the pure mineral. It also occurs, though more
                    rarely, and in smaller quantities, under the form of red chalk. Specimens of red
                    and green copper ore, lead, zinc, manganese, and, as some say, silver and gold,
                    have been occasionally met with. Indications of coal have been found all across
                    the island, commencing at South Cape, and shewing themselves in various parts;
                    at Satellite island in D’Entrecasteaux’s channel, on the banks of the Huon, at
                    Hobart-Town, New Norfolk, the Coal river, Jerusalem, Jericho; and excellent coal
                    and very rich iron ore have also been discovered in Richmond district and other
                    places. The stratum of the South Cape is situated on the north side of the bay,
                    and extends almost two miles along the coast. This coal has been analyzed, and
                    has been found of a superior quality, and well adapted for the raising of steam.
                    Excellent roof slate appears at a certain spot between Launceston and
                    George-Town; and in the form of mica in large masses on the rocks round Port
                    Davey, on the southern corner of the island, where, being much exposed to the
                    winds and waves of the southern ocean, they have become so much worn by the
                    weather as to exhibit the appearance of snow. Excellent sandstone for building
                    is found in almost every part of the island, and most of the houses in
                    Hobart-Town are now built with it, instead of badly made bricks as formerly. A
                    quarry has also been recently discovered at Port Arthur, where the manufacture
                    of filtering-stones is expected to be commenced. Flints are scattered in great
                    plenty upon the hills, especially where basalt abounds. Other rarer stones have
                    been found in different parts of the island, especially in those which appear to
                    have been washed in former times by the ocean, and which have been deposited in
                    certain ranges or linear positions, by the lashing of the waves and the
                    subsiding of the waters; such as hornstone, schistus, wood-opal, bloodstone,
                    jasper, and that other singular species called the cat’s eye, which reflects
                    different rays of light according to its position. Petrified remains of wood and
                    other vegetable productions, entirely converted into siliceous matter, and
                    capable of the finest polish, are occasionally met with in different parts of
                    the island, especially in the Macquarrie district.</p>
                <p>The animals resemble those of New South Wales, comprising the kangaroo, of which
                    there are three different species, the forest, the brush, and the wallapy, the
                    chief difference between them being the size. The hyena, opossum, or tiger,
                    measures six feet from the snout to the tail, and is exceedingly destructive
                    among the flocks. It is beautifully striped with black and white on the back,
                    and the belly and sides are of a grey colour. The <hi rend="italic">dasyurus
                    ursinus,</hi> known by the ordinary name of the devil, is another animal of the
                    same species, extremely ugly, the head resembling that of the otter, but quite
                    disproportionate to its body. It is very destructive to the flocks, issuing at
                    night from the rocky hills which it frequents, in search of its prey. The native
                    porcupine resembles the common hedgehog, and is quite harmless. The wombat is a
                    singular anima), and when full grown weighs nearly forty-three pounds. The head,
                    which is large and flattish, forms an equilateral triangle. It has extremely
                    short legs, ears sharp and erect, eyes small and sunken, but lively, and the
                    feet are formed like those of a badger; the tail is an inch in length. The flesh
                    is very delicate. The <hi rend="italic">platypus</hi> is an animal apparently
                    allied to the beaver tribe. The body is about ten inches long, and about as many
                    in circumference. This animal is very shy, and is only found in unfrequented
                    places. Several species of wild cats are found in the woods. One is called the
                    tiger-cat, from its resemblance to that animal; others partake of the character
                    of the weasel. The kangaroo rat and the kangaroo mouse possess, with the size of
                    these animals, all the characteristics of the kangaroo. There are several
                    species of opossums, all perfectly harmless. The bandicot is a small animal,
                    which makes great havoc in the potato grounds when it visits them.</p>
                <p>The feathered tribes are numerous, of every description, and many of them of the
                    most beautiful plumage. Among the birds of prey are eagles, hawks of all sorts,
                    kites, ravens, and the common carrion-crow. Among the water-fowl are many
                    varieties of the gull, pelican, the kingfisher, black swans of very majestic
                    appearance, wild ducks, also the musk duck, teal, widgeon, and a variety of
                    others. Among that class which belong neither to birds of prey nor to
                    water-fowl, are emus, black and white and satin cockatoos, parrots and
                    parroquets in great variety, large black magpies, the white or the whistling
                    magpie, the laughing jackass, so called from its singular noise; with many
                    others of smaller size, but of more beautiful appearance. Quails, snipes, and a
                    species of pigeon of a splendid bronze colour, in flavour resembling a
                    partridge, are the chief birds that, in addition to water-fowl, attract the
                    attention of sportsmen.</p>
                <p>All the inlets and bays of the coast abound with fish. Among those which may be
                    purchased at Hobart-Town, are the salmon, so called in the colony, but in
                    reality a very poor fish; perch, rock-cod, bream, mullet, whitings, flat-hearts,
                    leather-jackets, tailors, parrots, guard-fish, cray-fish, nearly<pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=593" xml:id="kp-eb0721-0593-0555"/>
                    as good as lobsters, oysters, good and plentiful, eels, skate, and shrimps. Some
                    years ago mackarel, of a very small species, were caught, but they have since
                    disappeared. Black-fish are plentiful in the Mersey, and generally weigh from
                    five to fifteen pounds; they have no scales. The interior rivers and lakes
                    abound with very fine eels, but, except the mullet, they are of little value.
                    The toad-fish, found in the bays and shores of the island, is a strong poison.
                    This poison is of a powerful sedative nature, producing stupor, and acting on
                    the nervous system. The black whale resorts during the breeding season to the
                    deep estuaries of rivers, and to the bays and inlets around the island. This
                    fishery is pursued with great activity and success. There are several kinds of
                    snakes, some of them poisonous; the most common one a large black snake, the
                    diamond snake, and a smaller brown sort. In the reptile family may be classed
                    the guanas and lizards, said to be harmless; centipedes of two sorts, scorpions
                    and tarantulas, the latter often met with in rotten wood. There are many curious
                    and beautiful varieties of the beetle; three or four sorts, some of which are an
                    inch long, and sting sharply. The wild bee is found, and a variety of spiders.
                    All the domestic animals of Europe thrive, and increase in size.</p>
                <p>The population here, as in New South Wales, consists of three classes, the
                    aborigines, the convicts, and the free inhabitants. The aborigines, or blacks,
                    more resemble in their countenance and appearance the African negro than those
                    of New South Wales, though living under a colder climate. Their hair is
                    woollyand their complexion black, and they are said to be inferior in ingenuity,
                    as well as in muscular strength. For several years an inveterate hostility
                    prevailed between them and the civilized inhabitants; and the defenceless
                    farmers and stock-keepers were often murdered by the natives. These outrages at
                    last roused the spirit of the whole country; and the troops, and all those that
                    were capable of bearing arms, formed a cordon round the aborigines, with the
                    intention of confining them in the peninsula called Tasman’s Head, where all
                    their wants were to be supplied, and an attempt was to be made to civilize them.
                    They however broke through this cordon like so many wild beasts; but by the
                    humane exertions of some of the settlers, aided by a few of the more civilized
                    aborigines of Sydney, they have been removed to Flinders Island, in Bass’s
                    straits, where they are clothed and fed, and attempts are made to civilize them.
                    Their numberdoes not exceed 300, and, as usually happens with savages when they
                    are brought within the bounds of civilization, they are gradually decaying.</p>
                <p>The convicts amount to 12,000. Every convict who is transported to Van Diemen’s
                    Land, without any reference to previous circumstances, is either placed in the
                    public service or is assigned to individuals immediately on landing. The first
                    are compelled to devote their whole time to the service of the crown, and
                    receive in return food, lodging, and clothes. Labourers and mechanics reside in
                    barracks built for the purpose; clerks employed in the public offices are
                    permitted to live elsewhere, and receive a small pittance; those who are
                    assigned to individuals are still under the closest surveillance, and can go
                    nowhere without a pass. The convict prisoners are divided into classes: 1. Such
                    labourers or mechanics as, on account of especial good conduct, are permitted to
                    sleep out of the barracks, and to work for themselves the whole of each
                    Saturday. 2. Those who still lodge in the barracks, but who are allowed to work
                    for themselves the whole of each Saturday. 3. Those who are employed on the
                    public works, and are released from work every Saturday at noon. 4. Refractory
                    or disorderly characters, worked in irons for crimes committed in the country,
                    under a sentence of the magistrate. 5. Men of the most degraded and incorrigible
                    character, worked in irons under the sentence of a magistrate, and kept entirely
                    separate from the other prisoners. 6. Men removed for crimes to penal
                    settlements, which are distant stations under the governments of New South Wales
                    and Van Diemen’s Land, where none but prisoners and their guards are allowed to
                    remain, and where the former are kept to unremitting labour. The rewards to
                    prisoners for good conduct consist of tickets of leave, which exempt the holder
                    from compulsory labour, and emancipations, which restore freedom, but without
                    permission to leave the country.</p>
                <p>The free population ranges between 15,000 and 20,000. The following is an account
                    of the population from a recent census:—Free persons, 20,686; convict ditto,
                    11,938; Port Arthur, 1137; Flinders’ Island (black and white), 183; other
                    islands, 50; military (with wives,&amp;c.), 1054. Total, 35,250. The number of
                    emigrants that embarked from the united kingdom to this colony in 1839 only
                    amounted to 328; while those to Sydney amounted to 8455.<note anchored="true"

                <p>The supreme authority is vested in a lieutenant-governor and executive council,
                    consisting of the lieutenant-governor, chief-justice, colonial secretary,
                    treasurer, chaplain, attorney-general, and collector of customs, together with
                    eight private gentlemen of the colony, nominated by the crown for life. The
                    governor, with the concurrence of at least two-thirds of the council, possesses
                    the power of making laws, if not repugnant to the laws of England. He, along
                    with the council, may also impose taxes for local purposes. The laws are
                    administered by a supreme court, consisting of a chief-justice and one puisne
                    judge. It is a civil and criminal court. Appeals may be made from its decisions
                    in civil cases, only when the matter exceeds L.1000 in value, and then direct to
                    the king in council. Either judge may hold a court of circuit in different parts
                    of the colony, for the trial of offences, or for civil actions.</p>
                <p>Van Diemen’s Land was originally divided into two counties, those of Buckingham
                    and Cornwall. These indeed continue to be its only counties, although in 1826 it
                    was divided into nineteen police districts. Orders were then received from the
                    home government for forming this colony into counties, hundreds, and parishes,
                    in the same manner as England. Each of these districts is under the charge of a
                    public magistrate, and a chief and other constables, to whose exertions the good
                    order of the colony is mainly indebted.</p>
                <p>The clergy of the church of England consist of a rural dcan, one senior, and
                    seven junior chaplains. Van Diemen’s Land is included in the diocese of
                    Australia. There are three Presbyterian ministers, one Independent, one
                    Wesleyan; and one Roman Catholic priest, all paid by the government. The income
                    of the senior chaplain at Hobart-Town is estimated at L.1000 a-year, arising
                    from the glebe, fees, &amp;c. Education is well attended to by the government,
                    which supports the King’s Orphan Schools, one for male and another for female
                    children, and seventeen elementary schools throughout the colony. The king’s
                    schools are for those who are entirely destitute, or who have one parent living,
                    or whose parents, though both alive, have not the means of giving their children
                    education; and, lastly, for those who are able to contribute annually the sum of
                    L.12. There are besides numerous private seminaries throughout the colony, where
                    all the elementary branches of education are taught. The press is free, and
                    being neither restrained by stamp duties nor taxes on the paper, is conducted
                    with ability and spirit. There are no less than eight newspapers published at
                    Hobart-Town, and two at Launceston, besides monthly magazines, annuals, and
                    almanacks. Various religious, benevolent, and literary institutions are
                    established, which contribute to the improvement of morals, as well as to the
                    diffusion of knowledge.</p>
                <p>The public revenue is derived from customs, duties, excise, fees, sale of land,
                    quit-rents, &amp;c. A duty of five per <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=594" xml:id="kp-eb0721-0594-0556"
                    />cent. is imposed on the importation of British goods; of 10s. per gallon on
                    foreign spirits; 7s. 6d. on British gins; and 6d. per pound on tobacco; L.25
                    a-year on a license to distil spirits; of 5s. on one to bake bread or to
                    slaughter cattle; 5s. to keep a dog on a chain, 10s. off a chain; 5s. to keep a
                    cart for hire. An auctioneer’s license costs L.3, 3s.; marriage license, L.4,
                    4s.; and there are fees, which are equivalent to stamp duties, on grants of
                    land, on the registering of deeds, &amp;c. The annual revenue amounts to
                    L.90,000, of which one half arises from the customs. The expenditure amounts to
                    about the same sum. The staple products of the colony are wool, whale oil,
                    cattle, and provisions, the same as in New South Wales. The following table
                    shows the progress of the trade.</p>

                <p>Since this period the commerce from Britain does not appear to have increased. In
                    1838 and 1839 the number of ships that arrived was 41 and 38; the amount of the
                    tonnage 12,598 and 11,946.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                <p>In 1834 the imports at Hobart-Town amounted in value to L.355,273, and at
                    Launceston to L.1 15,961. The exports for the same year were, from Hobart Town,
                    L. 117,323, of which oil amounted to L.45,513; wool, L.43,765; and whale-bone,
                    L.8217 ;—and from Launceston, L.85,919, of which wool was L.59,015. The currency
                    is the same as in the mother country, though dollars, rupees, and other foreign
                    coins are in circulation. There are three banks at Hobart-Town, and one at
                    Launceston, which issue notes, and transact all the ordinary business of money
                    dealers, discounting bills and remitting money, also collecting debt on
                    commission. They have generally carried on a successful business, having divided
                    between twelve and fifteen per cent. on their capital stock.</p>
                <p>The progress of this colony in improvement has hitherto been remarkable, and its
                    future prospects are not less promising. With a mild climate exactly adapted to
                    the European constitution, a fruitful soil, and an industrious population. It
                    must continue in its course with increased rapidity. The fine wool which it
                    produces is a great commercial staple, which must command its price in the chief
                    manufacturing districts of Europe; and this valuable produce will increase as
                    cultivation extends over the interior deserts; as well as its surplus produce of
                    grain, which by the introduction of steam engines, may be easily converted into
                    flour, and thus supply a valuable article of exportation. The nature of the
                    country, both in point of climate and soil, presents every inducement to
                    emigrants, who have of late been drawn thither in great numbers, bringing with
                    them their capital, and their European skill and industry. With such external
                    aids, and the natural vigour that exists within, the internal resources of the
                    colony will be developed; the country will rapidly fulfil its destiny, and the
                    time cannot be far distant when we may expect to see a populous and flourishing
                    country redeemed from a wilderness, and exhibiting all the arts and refinements
                    of Europe.</p>
