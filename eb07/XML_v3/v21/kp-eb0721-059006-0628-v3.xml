                <p><label type="entry">VENDEE</label>, a department of the south-west of France,
                    formed out of the western part of the ancient Lower Poitou. It extends in north
                    latitude from 46° 19’ to 47° 7', and in east longitude from 0° 44' to 2° 32'. It
                    is bounded on the north by the departments of the Lower Loire and Mayenne-Loire,
                    on the east by that of the two Sèvres, on the south by the Lower Charente, and
                    on the west and south-west by the ocean. Its shape is nearly a square, and it
                    extends over 2662 square miles. It is divided into three arrondissements; and
                    those into thirty cantons, comprehending 294 communes, and contained in 1836 a
                    population of 341,312 persons, who, with the exception of a few scattered
                    families, adhere to the Catholic church. They have been commonly described as
                    hospitable, good tempered, faithful to their engagements, simple and antique in
                    their manners, averse to any changes in their customs, and attached almost to
                    superstition to the doctrines and observances of the Romish religion. The noble
                    families, the ancient chief proprietors of the land, were only distinguished
                    from the rest of the inhabitants, their feudal tenants, by a greater degree of
                    cleanliness in their dwellings, their clothing, and their food; but were equally
                    resolute in their opposition to the changes operated by the Revolution, and the
                    whole were alike distinguished by their bravery, their perseverance, and their
                    endurance of those hardships which they brought on themselves by the political
                    party they embraced. The civil war whose name was derived from this department,
                    extended to all the district round it, in a greater or less degree; and its long
                    continuation may be attributed to the peculiarities of the country, and its
                    capabilities for defensive warfare, as much as to the resolute courage of the
                    population.</p>
                <p>The surface of this department is an extensive plain, uninterrupted by any hills
                    except by two chains in the eastern part, separated from each other by a valley
                    about two miles in breadth, none of the points of which exceed 400 feet in
                    height. This more hilly part is distinguished by the name of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Boccage,</hi> on account of the great number of trees and bushes
                    with which it is covered, and it was the chief theatre of the long and bloody
                    civil war, whose traces are even now far from extinct. The western and southern
                    parts consist of the <hi rend="italic">Marais</hi> or marsh land, which contains
                    excellent pasture land, protected by embankments and drained by artificial
                    canals. Another part along the coast, including the islands Bouen, Dieu, and
                    Noirmoutier, contains much fertile soil, of which about two-thirds are used as
                    pasture, and one-third produces corn.</p>
                <p>The rivers are of no great importance. The chief of them, from which the
                    department takes its name, is a moderate stream issuing from the Sèvres, and
                    falling into the Mortaise. It supplies water to several small canals, and is
                    navigable for barges carrying sixteen or eighteen tons from Fontenoy, where it
                    is about 120 feet in breadth. The Mortaise is navigable through its whole extent
                    for small vessels, and enters the sea through several marshes near to the city
                    of Aiguillon, in the bay of that name. The other streams, the Lay, the Isle, the
                    Ausance, and the Pairay, with some others, are navigable but a short distance
                    from their respective mouths.</p>
                <p>The agriculture is in a low state. Little of the land is cultivated by the
                    proprietors, but chiefly by metayers, who divide the gross product in equal
                    parts with their lords. Except in the lands on the three principal streams, the
                    common rotation of grain is, two corn crops after a year’s clear fallow. The
                    ploughing is performed almost exclusively by oxen. The wheat is good, and much
                    of it is converted into flour for exportation to the French West India islands.
                    The other kinds of corn produce good crops, and of late years the cultivation of
                    potatoes has been introduced and extended. The breed of horses is of an
                    indifferent kind, but many of them are used to mount the hussar troops. The
                    black cattle are numerous, but the sheep very few and not good, though of late
                    years attempts have been made to improve the race, as regards the fineness of
                    the wool, by crosses with Spanish rams. Silk was once a part of the agricultural
                    pursuits; but during the disturbed state of the country, the planting of
                    mulberry trees was neglected, and some years must pass before the produce can
                    amount to its former quantity. Wine is extensively made, the quality is good,
                    and much of it will bear to be kept a long time without the aid of brandy. The
                    manufactures are few. The most considerable are those of linen, but some woollen
                    cloths for home use are made. The department furnishes two deputies to the
                    Chamber of Representatives. It is included in the tenth military division, and
                    is in the diocese of Montauban.</p>
