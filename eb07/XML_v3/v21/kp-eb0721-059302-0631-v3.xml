                    long. 12° 20', in the midst of a lagune, or shallow lake, which extends about
                    twenty miles in length from north to south, and about six in breadth, divided
                    from the sea by the two islands, or sand-banks, of Malamocco and Palestrina,
                    each about nine miles long, but only half a mile in breadth. The city occupies a
                    tract of dry ground about seven miles in circumference, but divided into a great
                    number of islands by canals, the principal of which, the Canale Grande, extends
                    in a great curve through the heart of the town, with a width of 200 feet, and is
                    crossed near its middle by the Rialto bridge, a magnificent structure of marble,
                    consisting of a single arch overtopped by two ranges of shops, which form three
                    roadways. The principal part of the city is, moreover, divided by a still wider
                    canal, that of Giudeca, (which varies in width from about 1200 feet to 2160,)
                    from a long and narrow series of islands, the most easterly of which contains
                    the fine church of San Giorgio Maggiore, built by <pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=632" xml:id="kp-eb0721-0632-0594"/>Palladio. Venice is considered to be one of the finest cities of Europe,
                    though its streets are very narrow and winding, and most of them only calculated
                    for foot passengers, the great thoroughfares being the canals. But in the midst
                    of its labyrinth of canals and streets there are several large piazzas, or open
                    areas, almost every one of which is adorned with a fine church or palace. The
                    principal of these areas is the Piazza di San Marco, a large oblong measuring
                    562 feet by 232, surrounded with elegant buildings on a regular plan, and
                    terminated at its eastern extremity by the metropolitan church of St. Mark, a
                    singular but splendid combination of the gothic and the oriental styles of
                    architecture. The Piazza likewise contains the campanile or belfry of St.
                    Mark’s, a lofty square tower, 316 feet high and forty-two on each side,
                    terminated by a pyramidal top, to which the ascent is formed by an easy inclined
                    plane instead of a stair. Adjoining the church is the Doge’s palace, a marble
                    edifice in the Saracenic style; the prisons and other public offices of the late
                    republic of Venice; and in front of the palace is the Piazzetta, which forms the
                    communication between the great piazza and the lagune, and is as it were the
                    state entrance to Venice. On the quay of the Piazzetta are placed two
                    magnificent monolithic granite columns, one crowned with the winged lion of St.
                    Mark, and the other with the statue of St. Theodore, the first patron of the
                    republic. Between these columns is the place for public execution.</p><p>Venice is said to contain one hundred and twenty churches, and seven synagogues.
                    It is divided into six quarters, which are subdivided into thirty parishes; each
                    of the smaller islands in the lagune has also its church, generally that of a
                    convent, some houses, and a few trees. There are seven theatres. The principal
                    scientific and literary institutions are, the lyceum, which possesses a rich
                    physical cabinet, and a botanical garden; the two royal and the patriarchal
                    gymnasia; the college of the Salesiane for young ladies; the college for marine
                    cadets; the principal normal school; the section of the Imperial and Royal
                    Institute of arts and sciences, and the Venetian Atheneum, a union of the old
                    learned societies of Venice; the academy or school of the fine arts, whose rooms
                    may be ranked among the finest in Europe, containing a choice collection of
                    casts, a superb picture gallery adorned with the works of the greatest masters
                    of the Venetian school, and a considerable library formed of the most important
                    works relative to the fine arts, and the celebrated collection of original
                    designs of the ancient schools formed by the chevalier Bossi. Although entirely
                    re-organized in 1807, this academy may be regarded as the oldest establishment
                    of the kind, for the statutes of the fraternity of artists which it represents,
                    are of a date anterior to the year 1345. Lastly, we may notice the library of
                    St. Mark, one of the richest in Italy, with a fine cabinet of antiquities and
                    medals, now placed in the great council-hall of the ducal palace. There is,
                    besides, the Cornarian museum, an immense collection of pictures, medals, books,
                    and curiosities of every kind, bequeathed to the city by a noble Venetian of the
                    Comoro family. The principal public walks of Venice are the Piazza of San Marco,
                    the Piazzetta, and the Riva degli Schiavoni, a long quay leading to the public
                    gardens, which sire finely situate at the south-eastern extremity of the city.
                    The great number of bridges, which all have steps, and the narrowness of the
                    streets, render the use of wheeled carriages impossible; but in their stead
                    there is a great number of boats, named gondolas, which form one of the
                    principal characteristics of this singular city.</p><p>The most important public institution now at Venice is the arsenal, which is very
                    spacious, being about two miles in compass, and containing workshops of all
                    kinds, large stores of every article requisite for the outfit of ships of war,
                    and a series of halls in which immense quantities of arms and munitions of war
                    are grouped in a tasteful manner. The hall of models contains a large collection
                    of models of all sorts of ships; and in an adjoining chamber there are busts by
                    Canova of Emo, a naval hero celebrated in Venetian history, and of General
                    Galtamelta, a commander of high repute. The same apartment likewise contains a
                    fine model of the Adriatic, with its rocks, cliffs, and islands. The arsenal
                    contains thirty-two covered slips for ships of the line, fifty-four slips for
                    smaller vessels, four large basins, five cannon foundries, a ropewalk 910 feet
                    long, extensive workshops for carpenters, ship-builders, &amp;C. The number of
                    people employed is from 1000 to 1200. Only a few fragments of the celebrated
                    Bucentaur remain. The arsenal, however, is inaccessible to line-of-battle ships,
                    or even frigates with their guns on board; and even when the bulwark of
                    Malamocco, now in progress, is completed. It will only have twenty-four feet
                    water. Venice is the head-quarters’ of the Austrian imperial navy.</p><p>For a number of years after the downfall of the republic, Venice exhibited such
                    symptoms of rapid decay, that many were induced to prognosticate that ere long
                    it would be abandoned, and its foundations again buried in the waters. In 1815,
                    many Venetians entertained a natural and laudable wish for the regeneration of
                    their country; but the force of circumstances prevailed, and Venice continued to
                    be an appendage of the Austrian empire. By commerce Venice had become great; and
                    by new commercial regulations, the people believed that she could again be
                    raised to prosperity. The wish for the establishment of a free port was
                    expressed so generally and so loudly, that the government at length consented;
                    and in 1830, the wished-for object was attained. But though there has been a
                    decided increase in the maritime traffic, yet the magnificent expectations of
                    the citizens have not been realised. Neither have manufactures on an extended
                    scale been yet introduced, though the abundance of low-rented houses and cheap
                    labour seem to offer many advantages. Mirrors, straw-hats, wax candles, cat-gut,
                    which are the staple productions of Venice, and the like, are articles of
                    trifling importance compared with objects of universal consumption. It is
                    however already a great point gained, that a stop has been put to the diminution
                    of trade and population, which were rapidly melting away. During the last
                    fifteen years, the progress of decay has been arrested, and things are again
                    improving, though but slowly. The Venetians are recovering their ancient habits
                    of prudence and activity; but much yet remains to be done before they can be
                    relieved of the general reproach of indolence. Scarcely any kind of labour in
                    Venice is performed by natives; and many strangers find employment as
                    water-carriers, servants, &amp;c. Even the patricians deem it less disgraceful
                    to enrol their names as paupers than to apply themselves to labour; and,
                    according to Raumer, more idle people are to be seen in St. Mark’s Piazza in one
                    day, than in England during a whole year.</p><p>All Italy is distinguished for the number of its charitable institutions, and in
                    this respect Venice holds a prominent place. In the city there is one house with
                    accommodation for 700 poor people; while many more have free lodgings elsewhere,
                    and receive pecuniary assistance out of the establishment. There is an
                    orphan-house for about 335 children, a lying-in hospital for thirty-six women, a
                    wealthy institution for the reception of penitent women, an hospital for 1000
                    patients, a house of education for 90 young girls, a foundling hospital, &amp;c.
                    And the revenues of all these, arising chiefly from endowments, amount to about
                    580,000 florins, or L.60,000 sterling a-year. The French government united all
                    these institutions and endowments into one, without respect for their origin,
                    their object, or the directions of their founders; but in 1826, each foundation
                    was again placed under a separate administration, the whole being still
                    subjected to the inspection of government. In <pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=633" xml:id="kp-eb0721-0633-0595"/>1836, daily relief was afforded to 3200 permanent paupers, and occasional
                    relief to 4000. The number of those whose names were enrolled as paupers, and
                    who in the course of one year received occasional assistance in the shape of
                    money, medicine, &amp;c., amounted to 41,300 persons; in another year to 40,782.
                    If to these be added the several institutions for lunatics, sick, orphans,
                    foundlings, &amp;c.. It will appear that no fewer than 52,443 persons, or more
                    than one-half of the population of the city, receive charitable assistance. The
                    population of Venice is about 103,000, without including the garrison, which is
                    inconsiderable. Eight hundred patricians receive a kind of daily wages from the
                    government. The number of foundlings now maintained in the city is stated to be
                    3338; and for the country districts of Venice, 10,625. There is no want of
                    elementary schools for reading, writing, and arithmetic; and infant schools have
                    recently been introduced.</p><p>A railroad has been projected, and is now in progress, to connect Venice with
                    Milan, passing through Padua, Vicenza, Verona, Mantua, and Brescia, a distance
                    of 166 miles, nearly upon one level. The greatest, and indeed almost the only
                    serious obstacle to the execution of the work, is the carrying of the road
                    across the lagune, exceeding two miles of mud and water.</p><p>To the north of the city is the small town of <hi rend="italic">Murano,</hi>
                    whose glass-works were in great repute for several centuries, though their
                    productions are now inferior to those of France, England, and Bohemia; and to
                    the eastward is <hi rend="italic">San Lazzaro degli Arment,</hi> an island with
                    a convent inhabited by Armenian monks, who devote themselves to the education of
                    their countrymen, and the cultivation of their national literature. They have
                    published several useful works in their national language, and they issue a
                    weekly journal, which is circulated throughout the East. For an account of the
                    Venetian territory, see <hi rend="smallcaps">Lombardy, (c.h.)</hi></p></div></body></text></TEI>
