                <p><label type="entry">VOET, <hi rend="smallcaps">Gisbert</hi></label>, an eminent
                    divine, was born at Heus-den on the 3d of March 1589, being the descendant of an
                    ancient and considerable family. The earlier part of his education he received
                    at the school of his native place, and there he astonished his teachers by his
                    uncommon powers of memory. It is said that he could repeat three entire comedies
                    of Plautus, as many of Terence, the first book of Horace’s Odes, the first book
                    of Ovid’s Metamorphoses, and many other ample portions of the authors whom he
                    had read. In 1604 he was sent to the university of Leyden, where he prosecuted
                    his studies for seven years. During his theological course, he gave private
                    lectures on logic, and among his pupils he numbered the celebrated Burgersdick.
                    Having completed his academical studies in 1611, he became a candidate for the
                    ministry. His professional career was retarded by a long illness; but on his
                    recovery, he was appointed to officiate in the church of Vlymen, and he preached
                    occasionally at Engelen, about a league distant. In 1617 he accepted a call to
                    Heusden, where he continued to officiate for seventeen years. In 1619 he
                    assisted for six months at the famous synod of Dordrecht, and proved himself a
                    most zealous supporter of the doctrines of Calvin. In 1634 he became one of the
                    ministers of Utrecht; and, on the foundation of a university in that city, he
                    was appointed professor of divinity. He now took his doctor’s degree at
                    Groningen. During the vacation of 1637 he paid a visit to England, where he
                    inspected the public libraries, and formed a personal acquaintance with many
                    learned men. For three years after his return, he discharged his duties in a
                    very laborious manner: besides his private lectures, he gave eight public
                    lectures a-week, and likewise taught Hebrew, Syriac, and Arabic. Before he
                    settled at Utrecht, he was accustomed to preach eight times a-week. He rendered
                    himself very conspicuous by the zeal and pertinacity with which he opposed the
                    philosophy of Des Cartes. This philosopher, who had fixed his residence at
                    Utrecht, was exposed to a great variety of attacks, literary and juridical, from
                    the professor of divinity, by whom the tendency of some of his speculations was
                    considered as highly pernicious. His public opposition commenced in 1639, and
                    gave rise to much controversy. Voet was seconded by Rivet, Des Marets, and other
                    divines eminent for the extent of their learning and the soundness of their
                    theology. Having continued his labours till a very advanced period of life, he
                    died on the first of November 1676, in the eighty-eighth year of his age. Among
                    many other works, he published “Selectae Disputationes Theologicae.” Ultraj.
                    &amp; Amst. 1648-69, 5 tom. 4to. But his principal work bears the title of
                    “Politeia Ecclesiastica.” Amst. 1663-76, 4 tom. 4to.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Voet, John,</hi> the grandson of this theologian, was born
                    at Utrecht on the 3d of October 1647. His father, Paul Voet, who was born at
                    Heusden on the 7th of June 1619, became successively professor of logic and
                    metaphysics, the Greek language, and the civil law, in the university of
                    Utrecht, and died in that city on the first of August 1677. He was likewise the
                    author of various works. His son was appointed professor of law at Herborn, and
                    afterwards at Utrecht, and was finally removed to Leyden, where he died on the
                    11th of September 1714. We subjoin a list of his principal publications. De Jure
                    Militari liber singular. Ultraj. 1670, 8vo. De Familia Erciscunda liber
                    singularis. Ultraj. 1672, 8vo. Compendium Juris juxta seriem Pandectarum. Lugd.
                    Bat. 1693, 4to. Commentarius ad Pandectas. Lugd. Bat. 1698, Hagae Com. 1704, 2
                    tom. fol. This last is an elaborate, and upon the whole an able work; nor has it
                    yet lost its high forensic, as well as academical reputation.</p>
