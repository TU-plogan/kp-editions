                        area or apartment with an adequate supply of air, in a condition suitable to
                        the purposes for which it may be required. The air is usually introduced in
                        a stream which maintains a freshness and purity of atmosphere in the place
                        that is ventilated, any contaminated air being withdrawn as the pure air
                        enters.</p><p>In numerous operations of nature and of art, and more especially during
                        combustion, respiration, and the decay that attends the putrefaction of
                        animal and vegetable matter, unwholesome products are evolved; and so
                        deleterious are these to animal life, that death is the necessary
                        consequence when they accumulate in a more concentrated form around the
                        person. In a smaller proportion, they produce an endless variety of
                        discomfort or disease, from the most trifling sense of languor or debility
                        to the more violent apoplectic headache, for the time suppressing all
                        attempts at exertion either of mind or body, while on other occasions a slow
                        and insidious action gradually undermines the constitution, and induces a
                        permanent loss of health. In extreme cases death is induced, more or less
                        rapidly, according as the oxygen of the atmosphere is withdrawn, or an
                        impregnation of poisonous gases communicated to it.</p><p>The air of respiration is the great <hi rend="italic">pabulum vitae:</hi> we
                        draw upon it no less than twelve hundred times an hour, on an average, for
                        nourishment and support, during the whole period of our existence; we
                        consume oxygen, and replace it by carbonic acid; and were it withdrawn from
                        us, or changed in its qualities, death would inevitably ensue.</p><p>The air acts incessantly, not only on the blood as it passes through the
                        lungs, but also on the surface of the body; and disease and death may ensue
                        from an unwholesome atmosphere in contact with the skin, even when the lungs
                        are supplied with pure air. Well attested cases are recorded where severe
                        oppression has attended the action of an amount of impurity so small as from
                        1-15000th to l-5000th part of sulphureted hydrogen gas; while the absolute
                        amount of impurity in air tainted by miasma is so excessively minute, that
                        its precise nature, as well as the minuteness of its weight in the most
                        pestilential atmosphere, is unknown.</p><p>A supply of a fresh and wholesome atmosphere may accordingly be ranked among
                        the first and most essential necessaries of life. In the atmospheric ocean
                        which rests on the surface of the terraqueous globe, a perpetual movement,
                        <hi rend="italic">or natural ventilation,</hi> is sustained on a great scale
                        by numerous causes, more especially however by the unequal action of the
                        rays of the sun on the equator and at the poles; the colder air moving along
                        the surface from the poles to the equator, while the warmer air from the
                        equator ascends and proceeds in a contrary direction towards the poles.
                        These great and primary currents are modified in endless variety by the
                        attraction of the sun and moon, the rotation of the earth upon its axis, the
                        relative effect of the land and water, the ever-varying influence of local
                        temperature, volcanic action, meteoric phenomena, more especially the
                        evaporation and deposition of moisture, the electrical condition of the air
                        and of the surface of the earth, and the innumerable changes that attend
                        chemical action in the mineral kingdom, as well as in those that occur in
                        the organic world. The animal and vegetable kingdoms not only contribute to
                        the movement of the air, but are at once the great causes of the most
                        important changes induced upon it, and of its restoration to its former
                        composition; the animal kingdom consuming its oxy- ' gen and producing
                        carbonic acid, while in the vegetable kingdom, the great tendency is to
                        absorb carbonic acid and replace oxygen. But where these great movements are
                        interrupted by local causes, or an undue accumulation of vegetable and
                        animal debris takes place, there the due balance is not sustained,
                        pestilential effluvia contaminate the air, and were it not for the wind, the
                        rain, and the impetuous storms which from time to time visit such
                        localities, and the operation of a peculiar diffusive power, in consequence
                        of which no gas can accumulate permanently on the surface of the earth,
                        whatever may be its specific gravity, they would in general become at last
                        as fatal as the valley of death in Java, or the carbonic acid springs in
                        Bavaria, in the grotto del Cano, and other places, which are so notorious
                        for their destructive atmosphere.</p><p>In selecting a site either for a house, a city, or any establishment where
                        persons are crowded together, too much attention cannot be paid to its
                        natural ventilation; an aspect towards the south, a dry gravelly soil and
                        moderate elevation, securing efficient drainage and freedom of access to the
                        air, with protection from offensive currents, and an immunity from local
                        impurities, are the great desiderata.</p><p>In the open air the temperature is generally under that of the body; and the
                        air expired from the lungs, and also that in contact with the surface of the
                        body, being expanded by the heat which it receives, escapes, from its
                        levity, and a fresh stream is immediately supplied; but when the body is
                        confined within a limited space, special means must be employed to sustain a
                        constant renewal of fresh air.</p><p>This artificial ventilation. It is obvious, must be modified and adapted to
                        the peculiar circumstances of each individual case, and the state of the
                        external air which is supplied. It is a subject therefore of great extent,
                        and as various in its details, as the climate in which man lives, the
                        habitations in which he dwells, the occupations in <pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=634" xml:id="kp-eb0721-0634-0596"/>which he is engaged, the food upon which he lives, the means of protection
                        against heat and cold which he can command, and the peculiarity of
                        constitution which he may present. We shall therefore content ourselves, in
                        the remaining space allotted to this article, by pointing out the leading
                        facts connected with the more prominent objects which it includes in
                        reference to the frame of man. It must not however be forgotten that this
                        branch of science is as yet in its infancy, that the history of numerous
                        points connected with the motion of aerial fluid, is only beginning to be
                        minutely investigated; and that, in a practical point of view. It is as yet
                        so imperfectly attended to, that it is impossible to turn to any city
                        without seeing discomfort, disease, and even death, from time to time
                        induced by ignorance of the laws of ventilation; and in assemblies of every
                        variety, the whole audience is not only too frequently subjected to extreme
                        uneasiness, but the tone of the mental faculties, and the capacity for
                        exertion and attention are often affected by the state of the
                        atmosphere.</p></div><div type="section"><p>I. <hi rend="smallcaps">Source of Air</hi>.—This cannot be too particularly
                        examined. Many of the public buildings in this country are supplied with air
                        from the lowest levels, principally with the view of facilitating the
                        movement of the air through the flues. Hence at night, in clear weather
                        especially, when the cold produced by radiation from the ground is great,
                        and more or less at all times, cold air is supplied from the surface of the
                        ground, or the public streets, loaded with the offensive emanations which
                        they evolve, and which become much more disagreeable when subjected to the
                        action of heat in a warming apparatus. By taking air from the highest
                        attainable point, avoiding merely the immediate vicinity of chimneys, and
                        any ingress of air at the same level, a much purer atmosphere is secured;
                        and it may be conducted downwards to any required depth with a flue. In
                        extensive public buildings situated in localities noted for the inferiority
                        of their atmosphere, the erection of air towers to draw down a comparatively
                        wholesome atmosphere from a height of two or three hundred feet, would be an
                        object of great importance. In large towns, such as London and Manchester,
                        where local impurities abound, and particularly when fog and frost arc
                        observed at the same time, special means may be adopted for removing those
                        that are most offensive. Filter beds may be constructed for air on the same
                        principle as for water; but few of the more simple arrangements of this kind
                        that have been sustained for any length of time, have been found more
                        desirable than filtration through any porous texture to exclude suspended
                        blacks (soot), and in some cases also washing with water (particularly lime
                        water), to condense sulphurous acid and other gases.</p></div><div type="section"><p>II. AMOUNT OF AIR NECESSARY FOR VENTILATION.—</p><p>Few subjects present a greater diversity of practice than this. From two to
                        four cubic feet per minute for each person have usually been considered a
                        large supply, but this is far beyond the amount usually allowed. A very
                        slight examination will however show that even this amount is too Small; for
                        if the process of respiration be accurately examined. It will be observed
                        that a cubic foot of air or more is involved or mixed and contaminated with
                        the air discharged from the lungs at each expiration, independently of that
                        affected by the skin. Such a supply, thθrefore, is at least desirable, were
                        the air always at a mild and genial temperature. According to Dr D. B.
                        Reid’s experiments, where the effects of variable quantities of air were
                        tried upon numbers included in an experimental apartment, not less than ten
                        cubic feet of air per minute should always be allowed when it is at an
                        agreeable temperature; and to sustain the atmosphere in all its freshness
                        and purity, even a much larger quantity is at times desirable. In the
                        present Houses of Parliament, from 36,000 to 50,000 cubic feet per minute
                        have occasionally been given in warm weather to one apartment alone, or
                        about 60 feet per minute to each individual in a crowded house. This
                        question, however, of the amount of air necessary for ventilation, taking
                        the deterioration produced by the human frame alone into account, is
                        exceedingly complicated, and is influenced by a vast variety of
                        circumstances, of which the following are the most important. In the
                        preceding and following remarks, a temperature of 65° may be considered as
                        the average most generally desired when there is a steady but gentle
                        movement in the air. It is not so much the amount of supply with which life
                        can be sustained, which is here investigated, as that which it may be
                        desirable to afford, so as to maintain the system in its highest vigour and
                        perfection.</p><p>1. <hi rend="italic">The purify of the air supplied.—</hi> In general, the
                        less pure the air, the greater the amount necessary for vertilation,
                        especially if it be loaded with moisture, and charged with offensive
                        exhalations from the lungs and skin. But cases do occur, when an atmosphere
                        is so largely charged with poisonous effluviae, that it becomes an object to
                        use as little as possible to avoid this source of contamination, if it be
                        not removed by special arrangements.</p><p>2. <hi rend="italic">The temperature.—</hi> This is much the most important
                        circumstance affecting the supply necessary for ventilation. When the air is
                        very cold, and the moisture of the breath is condensed in hoar-frost as fast
                        as it escapes from the lungs, a proportion of air, extremely small compared
                        with the usual desirable allowance, will be sufficient for ventilation. Air,
                        under ordinary circumstances, is below the temperature of the body in most
                        parts of the globe. It therefore acts as a cooling power. But. the higher
                        its temperature, and the more nearly it approaches that of the body, the
                        larger is the quantity required to produce an equivalent cooling power.
                        Further, in warm weather the air is charged with more moisture than in the
                        cold season, while the body is at the same time more exhalent of moisture.
                        These and other circumstances tend to render the supply of air, desirable in
                        warm weather, far greater than the mere arithmetical increase in the
                        temperature would at first sight appear to indicate. But here we must advert
                        to the popular error that the temperature, as indicated by the thermometer,
                        is a proper guide to the quality of air, in respect to the warmth that may
                        be most agreeable. The temperature, as a moment’s reflection will show, is
                        no indication, unless the velocity of movement and chemical qualities of the
                        air, especially in reference to moisture, be also taken into consideration.
                        A small quantity of air stagnant, and at 32°, may not cool the body more
                        than a larger supply at 40°, 50°, 60°, 80°, or 90°, and, indeed, at any
                        temperature below that of the living system. A large quantity of air not so
                        cold may be made to produce the same amount of cooling effect as a less
                        quantity of the colder air. It is equally obvious that a large quantity of
                        air charged with much moisture, but not saturated, may produce the same
                        amount of evaporation from the system as a less quantity of air containing
                        little moisture associated with it.</p><p>3. <hi rend="italic">Idiosyncracy.—</hi> A very wide range of experiments has
                        shewn that the constitutional peculiarities of different individuals vary as
                        much in respect to the amount of air desired, and the temperature at which
                        it is preferred, as in respect to food or drink, In the houses of
                        parliament, no temperature below 52°, or above 76°, has been demanded for
                        several years. It is often very difficult to determine, however, how much is
                        due to absolute peculiarity of constitution, and what is dependent on the
                        circumstances of the moment, more especially, the state of occupation or
                        excitement, the time that has elapsed since any refreshment was taken, and
                        the nature and quality of the repast, the clothing in use, the previous
                        exposure, the temperature, moisture, and other circumstances affecting the
                        quality of the air. The brilliancy of the illumination also affects the
                        supply of air required by some constitutions.</p><pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=635" xml:id="kp-eb0721-0635-0597"/><p>The force of habit is nowhere exemplified in a more marked manner, than in
                        the amount of contamination which different individuals can bear. Some
                        miners pass habitually much of their time in air in which a candle does not
                        bum, though a lamp may be maintained in combustion in the same air.</p><p>4. <hi rend="italic">Moisture in the air.—</hi> Air, in winter, usually
                        requires the addition of moisture when introduced into any apartment and
                        warmed, as at this season it has deposited a large proportion of the
                        moisture associated with it in summer. Were it warmed by the approach of
                        summer. It would, in this country, gain moisture from the surface of the
                        earth or the ocean, and thus acquire more of the pleasing and agreeable
                        qualities which a summer atmosphere presents; but, if warmed and introduced
                        into any apartment without the previous addition of moisture, then, having
                        had its power of action upon moisture increased without receiving a
                        corresponding supply. It absorbs moisture with extreme rapidity from the
                        surface of the body and the lungs, and, taking away an undue proportion,
                        produces a harsh and disagreeable impression. The injection of steam into
                        the air, or the evaporation of water from shallow metallic pans, placed over
                        the heating apparatus, removes the defect.</p><p>On the other hand, moisture is frequently communicated to the air with the
                        view of cooling it, by the reduction of temperature attending
                        evaporation.</p><p>In some climates, again, a redundancy of moisture forms one of the greatest
                        sources of oppression to the European constitution, and is regarded as one
                        of the most powerful causes in developing the activity of miasmatous
                        influence.</p><p>The influence of different degrees of moisture in the air is as various upon
                        different constitutions as that of different temperatures. Further, some
                        individuals exhale moisture almost solely by the lungs, while, in others,
                        the skin is equally active. According to the relative conditione of the
                        living system, the air, in reference to moisture, may either exhale, or
                        absorb moisture from it.</p></div><div type="section"><p>III. <hi rend="smallcaps">Equalization.—</hi> Air entering by doors and
                        windows, and rushing in a well-defined stream, so as to produce local
                        currents, may be exceedingly offensive; while, if divided into innumerable
                        streams, by causing it to pass through a porous texture, having the most
                        extensive possible surface. It may escape so insensibly as not to be
                        perceived. Air ought always to be admitted in this manner, or at such a
                        distance from those upon whom it is to act, that its movement may be greatly
                        moderated before it reaches the person. Wherever a proper supply of air is
                        admitted, this equalization of movement is essential, more particularly in
                        crowded apartments; and the greater degree to which it is carried, the
                        larger is the quantity of air which the system can bear. Nothing is more
                        common than to see apartments ventilated effectually, so far as may be
                        necessary for removing the foul air; but this very ventilation induces a
                        most offensive series of chilling draughts, if means be withheld for warming
                        the larger supply now rendered necessary, and for introducing an effective
                        equalization. In rooms for invalids, this subject becomes of great
                        consequence, especially in diseases of the chest. And, generally speaking,
                        to a great number of constitutions, unequal currents are more dangerous and
                        offensive than an oppressive atmosphere.</p></div><div type="section"><p>IV. <hi rend="smallcaps">Nature of Heating Power.</hi> —Few circumstances
                        require more care and attention in connection with ventilation, than the
                        nature of the heating power employed. The open fire, so much prized in this
                        country from its lively and cheerful appearance, exerts also an agreeable
                        effect upon the animal system, by the light radiated along with the heat
                        which it evolves, and the movement of air which it sustains, as it draws off
                        the air and ventilates the apartment in which it is placed; but, in point of
                        economy of fuel, or facility of regulation, so as to maintain an equal
                        temperature. It is perhaps the least desirable of all kinds of heating
                        apparatus. The great beauty, therefore, which its appearance presents, the
                        absolute purity of the heat which it conveys by radiation, and the extreme
                        facility of access which it affords, so important for a variety of different
                        purposes, ought to be contrasted with the attendance which it requires, the
                        dust and ashes which it leaves, and the tendency, when neglected, to produce
                        back-smoke, if the circulation be not maintained in proper force. In
                        connection with ventilation, the following points require especial attention
                        in the construction of the common fireplace. 1. It should be provided with
                        an independent supply of air entering in its immediate vicinity, to be
                        employed when heat is required in any apartment without changing the air
                        there, as in warming the apartment before it is occupied, or moderating
                        offensive currents near the fire-place. 2. An open fire-place, unless the
                        air enters from the ceiling, often produces little or no ventilation above
                        the level of the chimney-piece, and, even then. It does not afford the best
                        and purest atmosphere. 3. The air above may be comparatively stagnant, and
                        offensive in the extreme, from lamps and the products of respiration, while
                        a fresh current moves along the floor to the fire-place.</p><p>Of other arrangements for heating apartments, the mild hot-water apparatus,
                        when the water is always under a boiling temperature, affords the most
                        perfect and equal diffusion, when properly arranged; a point of great
                        importance in producing equality of ventilation. Stoves of low combustion,
                        presenting an extensive surface at a moderate temperature, varying from 100°
                        to 200°, according to their size, as the Russian, Prussian, and Swedish
                        porcelain stoves, or Dr Arnott’s stove, come next in order. Those varieties
                        should be preferred which are provided with chimneys, both for the ingress
                        and egress of air, having no communication with the apartment in which they
                        are placed, otherwise, when worked most economically, they are all liable,
                        occasionally, to evole carbonic acid, if they are not adjusted to the smoke
                        chimney by persons who thoroughly understand their operation. Stoves and
                        other apparatus, where the iron is heated to a high temperature, may be in
                        many cases more economical than the preceding; but from the manner in which
                        they affect the air, they are not so conducive to health, and greatly impede
                        all regularity of ventilation, the hot air from them ascending rapidly to
                        the ceiling, while a cold atmosphere, almost unaltered, is often left
                        below.</p><p>In public assemblies, subject to great and sudden fluctuation of attendance,
                        hot and cold air chambers are provided, from which any supply of warm or
                        cold air may be obtained; and a mixing chamber, for mingling the various
                        proportions that may be supplied, must also be constructed.</p></div><div type="section"><p>V. <hi rend="smallcaps">Source of Movement.</hi> —An alteration of specific
                        gravity in the air, dependent on an alteration of temperature, produced by
                        expired air and the warmth of the body, is the great, the more natural, and
                        the most economical source of movement under all ordinary circumstances.
                        When the openings for ingress and egress are arranged on the best footing,
                        any ventilated apartment may be compared to a piece of apparatus in which
                        the current of air, entering rapidly by a narrow channel, expands with the
                        greatest possible diffusion into a slow moving stream, occupying the entire
                        area of the place to be ventilated, and gathering together again in a
                        smaller channel, by which it escapes where the velocity of movement
                        increases as the area diminishes. In ordinary apartments, where nothing more
                        can be afforded, two openings, at different levels, will always give much
                        relief; the one usually admitting cold, and the other, which should be as
                        high as possible, discharging hot and foul air.</p><p>A movement in the air may be induced by mechanical means, more especially by
                        pumps and fanners, or the impetus communicated to it by high-pressure steam.
                        All <pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=636" xml:id="kp-eb0721-0636-0598"/>these means may be seen advantageously
                        employed where peculiar facilities are presented, as in manufactories.</p><p>The moving power of air itself is constantly taken advantage of, both for
                        forcing and exhausting air. The wind-sail and the cowl are familiar
                        illustrations where this power is resorted to; but the continuity of its
                        action cannot be depended on, and it is perpetually varying in intensity. A
                        large shaft or chimney, with a good fire, is more generally employed at
                        present than mechanical means, though both may occasionally be introduced in
                        the same place with advantage. In ships, Captain Warrington has proposed the
                        introduction of a fanner; and a number of experiments was made on board the
                        Benbow a few years ago by Dr Reid, who proposed the use of the same
                        instrument, but who did not consider that it would attain all the purposes
                        desired, unless conjoined with a system of diffusion and equalization, which
                        has been partially introduced in the steam boats Albert, Wilberforce, and
                        Soudan, constructed for the African expedition. There, arrangements have
                        also been proposed for purifying the air, as the expedition traverses the
                        most unwholesome districts.</p></div><div type="section"><p>VI. <hi rend="smallcaps">Ingress and Egress of Air.</hi> —Doors and windows,
                        the only sources for the ingress of air in ordinary apartments, should be
                        avoided as a means of introducing air in all new buildings, and independent
                        apertures and flues provided, entirely under the control of valves, by whose
                        action the amount of ingress can be regulated with precision. Further, in
                        every apartment foul air should be led from the greatest altitude by similar
                        independent flues. The ordinary construction often interferes seriously with
                        ventilation, foul air descending sometimes in one and escaping in another.
                        Analteration in the structure of houses, introducing one principal chimney,
                        in which the flues from all the apartments ultimately join, would be a great
                        improvement in this respect; and even for whole streets and districts one
                        large shaft would be sufficient. To any who studies attentively the movement
                        of currents of air, numerous other changes will present themselves as being
                        equally desirable in the habitations of the rich and of the poor. In public
                        buildings, the foul air, from hundreds of apartments, will be removed by a
                        single shaft.</p><p>The reader who is anxious to extend his knowledge of this subject, will find
                        much information in the Parliamentary Reports, particularly on the
                        Ventilating and Acoustic arrangements of the present House of Commons, on
                        the Ventilation of Mines, in many of the Reports on Education and on
                        Manufactures, in which the health of the children has more particularly
                        engaged attention; in the Reports on Improving the Health of Large Towns,
                        and in some Statistical Reports on the Health of the Army and Navy. Tredgold
                        on Warming and Ventilating, is a work of great value, and the different
                        memoirs and treatises of D'Arect, present numerous important details. In Dr
                        Arnott’s work on Warming and Ventilating, a full description of his stove is
                        given; and in Hood’s, and also Richardson’s treatise on the same subjects,
                        the different varieties of hot water apparatus are explained. In Dr Reid’s
                        Chemistry of the Atmosphere, and Illustrations of Warming and Ventilating,
                        the result of numerous experiments is given on the ventilation of public
                        buildings and private dwelling-houses, and the ventilation of ships,

                        bear practically on ventilation. The peculiar arrangements in various mines,
                        hospitals, and manufactories, especially where offensive vapours are
                        condensed or destroyed, likewise afford many valuable illustrations of its
