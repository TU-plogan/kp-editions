                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">MARANHAM, or <hi rend="smallcaps">Maranhao</hi></label>, a
                    province of Brazil, in South America. This name, which is common to the
                    province, the capital, the island on which it stands, the river Meary, and the
                    Amazons, is derived from <hi rend="italic">Maranon,</hi> the appellation which
                    the navigator Pinzon first bestowed on the estuary of the Amazons, upon finding
                    that its waters did not possess the saline properties of the ocean. It lies
                    between 1. 20. and 10. 50. of south latitude, and 45. 10. and 53. 20. of west
                    longitude, being nearly 400 miles in length from north to south, and having an
                    average breadth of about 200 miles. It is bounded on the east by Piauhy, on the
                    west by Para, on the south by Goyaz, and on the north by the Atlantic Ocean. Its
                    bending line of coast extends above 300 miles, and so difficult is the
                    navigation from north to south, both wind and current setting in from the south,
                    that it is easier for Para and Maranham to communicate with Lisbon than with Rio
                    or Bahia. It is very dangerous, and, especially after passing Rio Grande, has a
                    bleak and dismal appearance. Although but thinly peopled in the interior, a
                    considerable portion of territory being still in possession of savage tribes, it
                    has increased in importance with extraordinary rapidity. Until about the middle
                    of the last century, no cotton was sent out of the country; and an attempt was
                    made by the inhabitants to prevent its exportation when the growers were about
                    to make their first shipment. The reason of this was a dread lest there should
                    not be enough for home consumption. The cultivation of rice, when first
                    introduced, was regarded as a foolish innovation; but now these productions
                    constitute almost the only articles of export, for the soil, although rich, is
                    reported to be unfit for the culture of the sugar cane. Annati, capsicum,
                    ginger, and the best fruits of Europe, grow in great abundance throughout the
                    province. Cattle, sheep, and goats, are stated to be more prolific than in
                    Europe, but they degenerate. There is said to be a native silk-worm here, whose
                    cone is thrice the size of the European one, the colour of the silk being a deep
                    yellow. It feeds upon the <hi rend="italic">pinheira</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >atta,</hi> an indigenous tree, and upon the leaves of the orange. The principal
                    river is the Itapicura, which originates near the southern extremity of the
                    province, and takes first a north-easterly and then a north-westerly course. Its
                    current is rapid, and it flows for the most part through extensive woods. It
                    abounds with a species of eel, which, though small, has great electrical
                    powers.</p>
                <p>Maranham, or St Luiz, the capital, is situated on an island of the same name, of
                    about forty-two miles in circumference. It forms the south-east side of the bay
                    of <pb break="no" facs="nls:194202955" xml:id="kp-eb0714-2955-0241"/>Marcos,
                    having to the eastward the bay of San Jose, in latitude 2. 32. south, and
                    longitude 43. 40. west. It is fertile and well inhabited, there being, besides
                    the capital, numerous small hamlets belonging to the natives. Much difficulty is
                    experienced in reaching this islańd, on account of the rapidity of three rivers
                    at the mouth of which it is situated. The harbour, which is formed by a narrow
                    creek, is of sufficient depth to admit of merchantmen entering; but it is so
                    beset with shoals as to require a pilot, and its depth is diminishing. It is
                    defended by several forts, which are not, however, in a very effective
                    condition. The city of Maranham is built upon very unequal ground, commencing
                    from the water’s edge, and extending to the distance of about one mile and a
                    half in a northeasterly direction. It covers a considerable space of ground, the
                    houses being built in a straggling manner; and there are several broad streets
                    and spacious squares. Its situation upon the western part of the island, and
                    upon one side of a creek, almost excludes it from the sea breeze, by which it is
                    rendered less healthy than if it stood in a more exposed position. The streets
                    are mostly paved, but are kept in bad repair. Many of the houses have a neat and
                    genteel appearance, and are of one story in height. The lower part of them is
                    appropriated to servants, to shops without windows, to warehouses, and other
                    purposes. The family occupy the upper story, the windows of which reach down to
                    the floor, and are ornamented with iron balconies. The churches are numerous,
                    and there are likewise Franciscan, Carmelite, and other convents. The insides of
                    the churches are gaudily decorated, but no regular plan of architecture has been
                    followed in their construction. The governor’s palace stands upon rising ground,
                    not far from the water side, with the front towards the town. It is a long
                    uniform stone building, of one story in height. The western end joins the
                    town-hall and prison, which gives them the appearance of being one edifice.
                    There is an oblong piece of ground in front, one end of which is open to the
                    harbour, and to a fort in the hollow close to the water; the other extremity is
                    nearly closed up by the cathedral. This church, which formerly belonged to the
                    Jesuits, is said to be the finest of any in the maritime cities, with the
                    exception of that of Para. The Jesuits’ college is now the episcopal palace, the
                    space opposite to which is occupied by dwelling-houses, and streets loading to
                    other parts of the city. The ground upon which Marannam stands is composed of a
                    soft red stone, so that the smaller streets leading from the town into the
                    country, some of which are not paved, are full of gullies, through which the
                    water runs in rainy seasons. These streets consist <hi rend="italic">of</hi>
                    houses having only a ground floor. They have thatched roofs, the windows are
                    destitute of glass, and altogether they have a mean and impoverished appearance.
                    The city contains a <hi rend="subscript"> ι</hi> customhouse and treasury; ' the
                    former is small, but was, until lately, large enough for the business of the
                    place. The air here is serene, the place being seldom incommoded with storms,
                    excessive drought, or moisture, except in the time of the periodical rains,
                    which continue from February till June. With regard to the number of
                    inhabitants, little reliance can be placed upon the testimony of travellers, as
                    by some they are estimated at 12,000, and by others at 30,000, including
                    negroes. These are numerous, the streets being generally crowded with
                    slaves.</p>
                <p>The bay of St Marcos is studded with several islands. The width of the bay from
                    Maranham to the opposite shore is between four and five leagues, but its length
                    is considerably greater. Towards the south end it receives the waters of the
                    river Meary, along the banks of which are several cattle estates. On the
                    opposite side of the island is a smaller bay, called San Jose. These bays are
                    connected by a strait which separates the island from the continent. The
                    Itapicura discharges its waters into San Jose, and the banks of this river are
                    the best cultivated and most fertile lands in the province. The town of
                    Alcantara, which is situated on the continent, to the west of Maranham, contains
                    four hermitages, two convents, a town-hall, and prison; and a fort occupies the
                    site of the Jesuits’ <hi rend="italic">hospicio.</hi> The town is built on a
                    semicircular hill, and, when seen from a distance, has a pretty appearance; but
                    this favourable impression is dissipated by a nearer approach. Many of the
                    houses are of one story, and built of stone; but the greater number of
                    dwelling-houses have only a ground floor. Alcantara extends back to some
                    distance in a straggling manner, with gardens and large spaces between the
                    houses. It is a thriving place, and has rapidly increased in importance, from
                    the lands in the neighbourhood being in request for cotton plantations. Not far
                    from the mouth of the port of this town stands an island of about three miles in
                    length by one in breadth, called the <hi rend="italic">Ilha do Livra-mento.</hi>
                    It is only inhabited by two persons, who have under their care a chapel
                    dedicated to our Lady of Deliverance; and thither the inhabitants of the
                    neighbouring shores come once a year for the purpose of celebrating, by a
                    festival, this invocation of the Virgin. Cachias, a populous place, of some
                    commercial importance, is situated on the eastern margin of the Itapicura,
                    upwards of 200 miles southeast of Maranham. Great quantities of rice and cotton
                    are raised here; but the inhabitants are addicted to gambling to a ruinous
                    extent. This place forms the central point of communication between Maranham,
                    Piauhy, and Goyaz. Large flat-bottomed boats, fit for navigating in shoal water,
                    ascend the river thus far, and convey the produce downwards. Opposite to Cachias
                    is Trezedellas, inhabited by descendants of the aborigines, where the Jesuits
                    formerly had a seminary, to which the people of Piauhy were in the custom of
                    sending their children to be educated. The river is navigable by canoes ninety
                    miles higher, to the small town of Principe Regente, thirty miles
                    south-southwest of which is St Bento das Balsas, situated amongst small hills
                    adapted for pasture. It is ten miles from the Pannahiba, and twenty-eight from
                    the Itapicura, and the whole of the territory lying between these two rivers has
                    been evacuated by the Indians. All the other towns of the province are
                    inconsiderable. The Meary or Mearim, the next river in size, is navigable to the
                    centre of the province, where the further progress of boats is interrupted by a
                    fall; but its course lies chiefly through the territories of barbarous tribes.
                    The number of farms in Maranham is estimated at 4856, and the number of
                    proprietors at 2683. The average number of slaves imported is 5000, for whom a
                    considerable duty is paid. With regard to exports and imports, there are no
                    returns which can be relied on later than the year 1820. From 1815 to 1820, the
                    average number of bags of cotton exported was 68,000. The exports of rice varied
                    during these years from 56,000 to 82,000 bags. The other articles sent out of
                    the country consisted of hides, tanned and untanned, skins, and gums. The entire
                    population of the province amounted in 1821 to 182,000. Upon the whole, this
                    province might be made one of great importance, for it possesses vast
                    capabilities; but as yet it is in an infant or semi-barbarous state.</p>
