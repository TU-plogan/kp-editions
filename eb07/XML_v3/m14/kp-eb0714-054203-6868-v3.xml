                    Roxburghshire, on the south side of the river Tweed, near the northern base of
                    the Eildon hills, and thirty-five miles from Edinburgh. It is pleasantly
                    situated in a picturesque and fertile country, the scene of many a border
                    legend; the streets form a kind of triangle, in the centre of which stands the
                    cross, a structure supposed to be coeval with the abbey itself. The cross is
                    supported by the endowment of a small portion of land, called the Corse-rig,
                    which the proprietor holds upon the sole condition of “keeping up the cross.”
                    Melrose Abbey must have first occasioned the rise of the <pb break="no" facs="nls:194206881" xml:id="kp-eb0714-6881-0543"/>village, and
                    continues to be its chief support to the present day; it was founded by King
                    David I. in 1136, and dedicated to the Virgin Mary; and it was furnished with
                    monks of the Cistercian order from Rivale Abbey in Yorkshire. The nave which
                    lies due east and west is in length 258 feet, and in breadth 79 feet; at the
                    distance of fifty feet from the eastern extremity it is intersected at right
                    angles by the transept which is 130 feet in length, and44 in breadth. The pious
                    founder, whom James VI. calls a “sair sainct for the croune,” conferred
                    extensive lands and valuable privileges on the abbot and monks of this abbey,
                    which was one of the most magnificent institutions of the kind in Scotland. They
                    held by charter the lands of Melrose, Eldun, and Dernervie, the lands and wood
                    of Gattonside, with the fishings of the Tweed along the whole extent of those
                    lands, the right of pasturage and pannage in the king’s forests of Selkirk,
                    Traquair, and in the forest lying between the Gala and the Leader, and also the
                    privilege of taking wood for building and burning, from the same forests. During
                    the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, the piety of princes and nobles continued
                    adding to the privileges and wealth of the monks of Melrose, who accumulated
                    vast possessions in Ayr, Dumfries, Selkirk, Berwick, and other places. Monastic
                    institutions were generally considered as sacred by contending paι ’ ties, and
                    thus the protection afforded by the abbey of Melrose must have been exceedingly
                    serviceable in a district peculiarly exposed to the marauding incursions of
                    barbarous freebooters, and which was the field of frequent sanguinary conflicts,
                    infuriated by national antipathies and personal wrongs. Being situated, however,
                    close by the hostile borders, it could hardly be expected that it should always
                    escape. In 1322 the abbey was burned by Edward II., and several of the monks,
                    with William de Peebles, the abbot, were slain. It was repaired and endowed with
                    most munificent grants by Robert Bruce, whose heart was buried here, after the
                    unsuccessful attempt tô have it deposited in the holy sepulchre at
                    Jerusalem.</p><p>During the reformation in England under Henry VIII., the dilapidation of the
                    monasteries in the south of Scotland commenced. In 1545 a great part of the
                    ^.bbey of Melrose was destroyed by Sir Ralph Eure and Sir Bryan Layton. In the
                    same year, Melrose, with its monastery, was again wasted by the English army
                    under the Earl of Hertford, and in a few years afterwards it became the prey of
                    the Scotish reformers. The act of annexation first placed the lands and revenues
                    of this wealthy establishment in the hands of Queen Mary; they then passed to
                    various favourites of royalty, until at length the abbey and a great part of its
                    domains were acquired by the family of Buceleuch. The ruins of the monastery
                    afford the finest specimens of Gothic architecture and Gothic sculpture of which
                    this country can boast; and it is singularly fortunate that this is not only one
                    of the most exquisitely beautiful, but one of the most entire of the
                    ecclesiastical ruins in Scotland. Till within these few years the abbey was used
                    as the parish church; there is now, however, a church built at some distance
                    from it, and the abbey has been disincumbered of the clumsy and discordant
                    galleries or lofts erected for the accommodation of the congregation. The rents
                    of this abbey at the reformation were, in money, £1758 Scots; in wheat, 19
                    chalders, 9 bolls; in bear, 77 chalders, 3 bolls; in oats, 47 chalders, 1 boll,
                    2 firlots; meal, 14 chalders, with 8 chalders of salt, 105 stones of butter, 10
                    dozen of capons, 26 dozen of poultry, 376 muirfowl, and 360 loads of peats.
                    Alexander II. was buried beneath the great altar, and the remains of many of the
                    illustrious line of Douglas rest within the abbey, which was also the place of
                    interment of other powerful families. The population of the village of Melrose,
                    in 1835 amounted to 689∙</p></div></body></text></TEI>
