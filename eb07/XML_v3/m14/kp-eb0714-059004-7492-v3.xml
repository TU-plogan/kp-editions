                    manufactures were accounted degrading and dishonourable employments; and what
                    was done in that way was performed by slaves. None who had been employed in
                    trade, or whose father had been a slave, could be chosen into the senate; and no
                    senator, or father of a senator, could by law keep a bark above a certain small
                    burthen, in order no doubt to prevent his engaging in commerce. The canonists
                    likewise despised trade; and at the council of Melfi it was solemnly determined
                    that none could exercise any traffic, nor follow the profession of the law, with
                    a safe conscience.</p><p>These notions, however, were singular, and very different from the policy which
                    has ever prevailed in this country. According to a law of Athelstan, if any
                    merchant made three voyages on his own account beyond the British channel, or
                    narrow seas, he was entitled to the privileges of a Thane; and it is specially
                    provided by Magna Charta, (c. 30), that all merchants, unless publicly
                    prohibited beforehand, shall have safe conduct to depart from, to come into, or
                    to tarry in and go through the realm, for the exercise of merchandise, without
                    any unreasonable imposts, except in time of war; and that if a war breaks out
                    between us and another country, the merchants of that place shall be attached,
                    but in their person only, till the king is informed how our merchants are
                    treated in the land with which we are at war, and if our merchants are secure
                    theirs shall be so too. Upon this Montesquieu remarks with admiration, that the
                    English have made the protection of foreign merchants one of the articles of
                    their national liberty; and also that the English know much better than any
                    other people on earth how to value at the same time these three things,
                    religion, liberty, and commerce. These, indeed, are the common rights of
                    mankind. They are also inseparably connected together; and as liberty is the
                    life of commerce, so commerce is in its turn the parent of many advantages,
                    moral and physical, personal and political. Its protection and encouragement are
                    now, therefore, an established principle of the law of nations.</p><p>Trade and commerce being thus the immediate offspring of natural liberty, the <hi rend="italic">lex</hi><hi rend="italic">mercatoria,</hi> or the law of
                    merchants, is less a branch of this or that system of municipal law, than of the
                    law of nations, or that universal law which reason teaches all men. It is, if
                    one may so call it, an ambulatory system of civil law, not confined to any one
                    place or locality, but attaching to the persons of men in all their commercial
                    transactions throughout the world; the custom of merchants being every where
                    acknowledged, as their persons and property are by the law of nations every
                    where protected.</p><p>Thus, not to enter here at large into all the details of mercantile law, which
                    will be found in other parts of this work, divers sorts of writings used amongst
                    merchants and trading people in commercial transactions, are sustained in our
                    courts, after the example of other states, although not executed with all the
                    formalities of common deeds. Missive letters, <hi rend="italic">in re</hi><hi rend="italic">mercatoria,</hi> are valid although not holograph, and commissions
                    from merchant to merchant, though not signed before witnesses; nor do fitted
                    accounts amongst merchants, in mercantile matters, require the writer’s name or
                    witnesses. But of all obligations, <hi rend="italic">bills of exchange,</hi>
                    which owe their origin to merchants, are the most favoured. The risks and
                    accidents of trade have also caused particular favour to be extended to persons
                    engaged therein, who have fallen into bankruptcy; provision being made by
                    statute for their entire discharge, on their surrendering their effects to their
                    creditors.</p><p>We find also in many parts of Europe merchant courts or judicatories vested in
                    merchants chosen for that purpose to decide and determine in a summary way their
                    peculiar differences. Of this sort are the guildry courts of the Scottish
                    burghs, which are particularly approved of by statute, 1593, c. 184, as a speedy
                    method of determining all questions between merchant and merchant, and between
                    merchant and mariner, and are declared to have “full strength, force, and
                    effect, according to the lovable form of judgment used in all gude towns of
                    France and Flanders, where burses’ are erected, and specially in Paris, Roan,
                    Bourdeaux, and Rochelle.” Particular attention, indeed, seems to have been paid
                    in Scotland in early times, to the regulation of trade. Before the close of the
                    twelfth century, William the Lion granted to the burgesses of Aberdeen, and the
                    burgesses of Moray, and all his burgesses dwelling north of <pb break="no" facs="nls:194207505" xml:id="kp-eb0714-7505-0591"/>the Grampians,
                    the privilege of a free <hi rend="italic">hanse,</hi> or mercantile association,
                    as fully and completely as they had enjoyed the same in time past. In the
                    southern part of the kingdom"the court of four burghs had met annually from a
                    remote time; but in addition to this, deputies from the royal burghs south of
                    the Spey were in 1405 appointed to meet in convention with the court of four
                    burghs, to treat, ordain, and determine in all things concerning the utility of
                    the commonweal of the burghs, their liberties and court. The disadvantage,
                    however, of two contemporary assemblies in a country so limited in extent as
                    Scotland, which had also now become a consolidated kingdom, with one common
                    interest, appears to have been quickly felt; for by statute 1487, c. 111,
                    deputies from all the royal burghs, “baith south and north,” were appointed to
                    meet in convention, not with the court of four burghs, as before, but by
                    themselves, yearly, to commune and treat upon the welfare of merchandise, the
                    good rule and statutes for the common profit of the burghs, and to provide
                    remedy for all skaith and injury sustained within burghs. Since this enactment,
                    the burghal parliament, or convention of burghs, has continued to our own
                    time.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
