                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">MASTER</label>, a title given to several officers and persons
                    of authority and command, particularly to the chiefs of the orders of
                    knighthood, and some others. Thus we say, the grand master of Malta, of St
                    Lazarus, of the golden fleece, of the free masons, and so of others.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Master</hi><hi rend="italic">(Magister)</hi> was a title
                    frequent amongst the Romans. They had their master of the people, <hi
                    rend="italic">magister</hi><hi rend="italic">populi,</hi> who was the dictator;
                    the master of the cavalry, <hi rend="italic">magister</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >equitum,</hi> who held the second post in an army after the dictator; and there
                    were also masters of the infantry, <hi rend="italic">magistri peditum,</hi> and
                    a master of the census, <hi rend="italic">magister census,</hi> who had nothing
                    of the charge of a censor, or subcensor, as the name seems to intimate, but was
                    the same with the <hi rend="italic">proepositus</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    >of the Militia (magister</hi><hi rend="italic">militiae)</hi> was an officer in
                    the lower empire, created, as is said, by Diocletian, and having the inspection
                    and government of all the forces, somewhat like a constable of France. At first
                    there were two of these officers instituted, the one for the infantry and the
                    other for the cavalry; but the two were united into one under Constantine.
                    Afterwards, as their power was increased, so was also their number; and there
                    was one appointed for the court, another for Thrace, a third for the East, and a
                    fourth for Illyria. They were afterwards called <hi rend="italic">comites</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">clarissimi.</hi> Their power was only a branch of that of
                    the <hi rend="italic">ļrreefectusproctorii,</hi> who by this means became a
                    civil officer.</p>

                    >magisteria.</hi> This officer was the same in the western empire with the
