                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                <p><label type="entry">MENDICANTS, or Begging Friars</label>, several orders of
                    religious, who, having no settled revenues, are supported by the charitable
                    contributions they receive from others. Thia sort of societybegan in the
                    thirteenth century; and the members of it, by the tenor of their institution,
                    were destined tore-main entirely destitute of all fixed revenues and
                    possessions; though in process of time their number became a heavy tax upon the
                    people. Innocent III. was the first of the popes who perceived the necessity of
                    instituting such an order: and accordingly he conferred on those monastic
                    societies, who made a profession of poverty, the most distinguishing marks of
                    his protection and favour. They were also encouraged and patronized by the
                    succeeding pontiffs, after experience had demonstrated their public and
                    extensive usefulness. But when it became generally known, that they had such a
                    peculiar place in the esteem and protection of the rulers of the church, their
                    number increased to such a degree that they became a burden, not only to the
                    people, but even to the church itself. The great inconvenience which arose from
                    the excessive multiplication of the mendicant orders was remedied by Gregory X.
                    in a general council, which he assembled at Lyons in the year 1272. Here all the
                    religious orders which had sprung up after the council held at Rome in 1215,
                    under the pontificate of Innocent III. were suppressed; and the disproportionate
                    number of mendicants was reduced to four societies or denominations; namely,
                    those of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Dominicans, Franciscans, Carmelites,</hi> and
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Augustinians</hi> or hermits of St. Augustin,</p>
                <p>As the pontiffs allowed these four mendicant orders the liberty of travelling
                    wherever they thought proper, of conversing with persons of every rank, of
                    instructing the youth and the multitude wherever they went; and as those monks
                    exhibited, in their outward appearance and manner of life, more striking marks
                    of gravity and holiness than were observable in the other monastic societies;
                    they rose all at once to the very summit of fame, and were regarded with the
                    utmost esteem and veneration throughout every country of Europe. The
                    enthusiastic attachment to these sanctimonious beggars went so far, indeed,
                    that, as we learn from authentic records, several cities were divided or
                    cantoned out into four parts, with a view to provide for the orders in question;
                    thefirstpartbeing assigned to the Dominicans, the second to the Franciscans, the
                    third to the Carmelites, and the fourth to the Augustinians. The people were
                    unwilling to receive the sacraments from any other hands than from those of the
                    mendicants, to whose churches they crowded to perform their devotions, whilst
                    living, and where they were also extrerfιely desirous that their remains should
                    be deposited after death. Nor did the influence and credit of the mendicants end
                    here. For we find in the history of this and of the succeeding ages, that they
                    were employed not only in spiritual matters, but also in temporal and political
                    affairs of the greatest consequence; in composing the differences of princes,
                    concluding treaties of peace, concerting alliances, presiding in cabinet
                    councils, governing courts, levying taxes, and in other occupations, not only
                    remote from, but altogether inconsistent with, the monastic, character and
                    profession. However, the power of the Dominicans and Franciscans greatly
                    surpassed that of the other two orders: insomuch that before the Reformation,
                    they were what the Jesuits have since been, namely, the very soul of the
                    hierarchy, the prime engine of the state, the secret spring of all the motions
                    of each, and the authors and directors of every important event, both in the
                    religious and political world. By a natural progression their pride and
                    confidence arrived at such a pitch, that they had the presumption to declare
                    publicly, that they had a divine impulse and commission to illustrate and
                    maintain the religion of Jesus; they treated with the utmost insolence and
                    contempt all the different orders of the priesthood; they even affirmed, without
                    a blush, that the true method of obtaining salvation was revealed to <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:194207089" xml:id="kp-eb0714-7089-0559"/> them alone; they
                    proclaimed, with ostentation, the superior efficacy and virtue of their
                    indulgences; and they vaunted beyond measure their interest at the court of
                    heaven, and their familiar connexions with the Supreme Being, the Virgin Mary,
                    and the saints in glory. By these impious pretensions, they so deluded and
                    captivated the miserable, and blinded the multitude, that the latter would not
                    entrust any other but the mendicants with the care of their souls. Towards the
                    close of the fourteenth century, they retained their credit and influence to
                    such a degree, that great numbers of both sexes, some in health, others in a
                    state of infirmity, and a third class at the point of death, earnestly desired
                    to be admitted into the mendicant order, which they looked upon as a sure and
                    infallible method of rendering heaven propitious. Many made it an essential part
                    of their testaments, that their bodies after death should be wrapped in old
                    ragged Dominican or Franciscan habits, and interred amongst tire mendicants; for
                    such were the superstition and ignorance of this age, that people universally
                    believed they would the more readily obtain mercy from Christ, at the day of
                    judgment, if they appeared before his great tribunal associated with the
                    mendicant friars.</p>
                <p> About this time, however, the mendicants fell into universal disrepute; but
                    being resolutely protected against all opposition, whether open or secret, by
                    the popes, who regarded them as their best friends and most effectual
                    supporters, they suffered little or nothing from the efforts of their numerous
                    adversaries. In the fifteenth century, besides their arrogance, which had grown
                    excessive, a quarrelsome and litigious spirit prevailed amongst them, and drew
                    upon them the just displeasure and indignation of many. At this time, by
                    affording refuge in their order to the Beguines, they became offensive to the
                    bishops, and were thereby involved in difficulties and perplexities of various
                    kinds. They lost their credit in the sixteenth century by their rustic
                    impudence, their ridiculous superstitions, their ignorance, their signal
                    cruelty, and their brutish manners. They discovered the most barbarous aversion
                    to the arts and sciences, and expressed a similar abhorrence of certain eminent
                    and learned men, who endeavoured to open the paths of science to the pursuits of
                    studious youth, recommended the cultivation of the mind, and attacked the
                    barbarism of the age in their writings and discourses. In a word their general
                    character, together with other circumstances, concurred to render a reformation
                    desirable, and to bring about that happy event.</p>
                <p>Amongst the number of mendicants are also ranked the Capuchins, Recollects,
                    Minims, and others.</p>
