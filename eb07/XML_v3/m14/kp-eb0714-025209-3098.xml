                    celebrated French writer, was born in 1723, at the picturesque village of Bort,
                    in the Limousin, in a family little removed above the rank of peasantry. Like
                    many other distinguished literary men of France, he owed the early part of his
                    education to private charity and gratuitous public institutions. His parents
                    destined him for trade; but his love for study induced him to assume the
                    clerical habit, and to obtain admittance into the academy or college of the
                    Jesuits at Clermont. Whilst there, he procured a subsistence by acting, during
                    his leisure hours, as a private tutor to some of the more opulent students. He
                    then went to Toulouse, where he delivered lectures in philosophy with
                    considerable reputation, and gained an academical prize. His disappointment as
                    to another prize opened for him a correspondence with Voltaire, which finally
                    led to his departure from Toulouse for Paris, where he obtained the personal
                    acquaintance of his illustrious correspondent, who at that time extended the
                    most friendly encouragement to all young men possessed of any talents for
                    poetry.</p><p>At the time of Marmontel’s arrival in the capital, in 1745, the prizes proposed
                    by the academy opened up the shortest roads to literary distinction, and one
                    which was eagerly pursued by those who were ambitious of celebrity. Marmontel,
                    like many others, commenced his career of letters by gaining a prize for a poem
                    on a subject proposed by the French Academy—the Glory of Louis XIV. perpetuated
                    in his Successor. But in that age the theatre afforded the most ample field for
                    the acquisition of wealth and eminence. All talent was in a manner forced into
                    that direction, and was often recompensed with extravagant liberality. In order
                    to qualify himself for dramatic composition, he commenced an assiduous study of
                    the best critical works on the subject, which he borrowed from Voltaire; he
                    obtained free admission to the French theatre, which he regularly attended; and
                    he frequented the Procope Coffee-House, which was then the tribunal of
                    criticism, and the school for young poets to study the humour and taste of the
                    public. His first tragedies, <hi rend="italic">Dionysius</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Aristο∙</hi><hi rend="italic">mènes,</hi> obtained a reception
                    sufficiently flattering for a youthful poet, but they did not keep their ground
                    on the stage; and his succeeding ones, <hi rend="italic">Cleopatra,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Heraclides,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Numitor,</hi> had no
                    success whatever. Laharpe, who was a great dramatic critic, condemns them all as
                    bad, except the <hi rend="italic">Heraclides,</hi> which he calls a tolerable
                    tragedy of the second rank. In fact, Marmontel does not appear to have been
                    endowed with any talents for poetry, at least of the higher order, either in
                    point of poetical conception or the mechanical construction of verse. It is also
                    evident, from his <hi rend="italic">Réflexions sur la Tragédie,</hi> published
                    at the end of his <hi rend="italic">Aristomenes,</hi> that he had formed, at
                    least in the early period of his life, the most unfounded and paradoxical
                    theories with regard to the rules of dramatic composition. Hence his plots
                    have,for the most part, but little interest; his dialogue is full of puerile
                    common-places, and his versification is cold and constrained. The plot of <hi rend="italic">Dionysius</hi> hinges on the conspiracy of Dion against the
                    Sicilian tyrant, and the love of the younger Dionysius (who, in defiance of all
                    historical truth, is represented as a paragon of virtue) for the daughter of
                    Dion, whose character is formed on the model of the heroines of Calprenede and
                    Scuderi. The plots of <hi rend="italic">Aristomenes</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Numitor</hi> are, for the most part, of his own invention, and are both
                    sufficiently extravagant. In the <hi rend="italic">Heraclides</hi> he has
                    followed the well-known tragedy of Euripides as his guide. At his first
                    interview with Voltaire, Marmontel had been assured by him, that by the stage he
                    might in one day obtain glory and fortune; and that one successful piece would
                    render him at the same moment rich and celebrated. The prediction was verified;
                    and from the instant at which his first tragedy appeared, he, who had not money
                    to pay the person who brought water to his lodgings, and who lived on credit
                    with his baker and green-grocer, was at once plunged into all the bustling
                    intrigue of the first literary circles, and into all the glare and dissipation
                    of fashionable society. His time was occupied with rehearsals and parties of
                    pleasure; he was received as the favoured lover of the most celebrated actress
                    of the age, Mademoiselle Clairon; and in another intrigue in which he engaged he
                    became the rival of Marshal Saxe. In order to shun the resentment of so
                    formidable a rival, he retired for some time to Passy, the country-seat of the
                    rich and sumptuous financier, Poplinière, who had married his mistress, and kept
                    open house for all the idle and dissipated <hi rend="italic">litterateurs</hi>
                    of the age. By flattering the king in some occasional verses, which he wrote
                    whilst residing here, he obtained<pb break="no" facs="nls:194203111" xml:id="kp-eb0714-3111-0253"/> the powerful
                    patronage of Madame de Pompadour, who procured for him the situation of under
                    secretary of the royal buildings. This employment fixed his residence at
                    Versailles for five years, which were passed wholly free from disquietude, and
                    are often alluded to by him as the happiest period of his life. The duties of
                    his situation occupied him two days in the week, and the remainder of his time
                    was employed in contributing articles to the <hi rend="italic">Encyclopédie,</hi> of which his friends D’Alembert and Diderot were the
                    editors. These articles, which contain many ingenious theories mixed up with
                    strange paradoxes, were afterwards printed together, in alphabetical order,

                    searching into nature for the rules and means of the art, this study led him to
                    examine if it were true, as was then often said, that all the great strokes of
                    ridicule had been seized by Molière and the dramatic poets who followed him. In
                    running over the canvass of society, he perceived that, in the inexhaustible
                    combinations of follies and extravagancies of all conditions of life, a man of
                    genius might still find sufficient employment. He had even collected some
                    observations to propose to young poets, when his friend Μ. de Boissy, who at the
                    time conducted the <hi rend="italic">Mercure de France,</hi> requested him to
                    supply some pieces in prose, to insert in that literary journal, from which
                    Marmontel derived a considerable pension. It occurred to him to employ, in a
                    tale, one of the touches of ridicule in his collection; and he chose, by way of
                    essay, the absurd pretension of being loved merely for one’s self. This was
                    exhibited in the first of his <hi rend="italic">Moral Tales,</hi> entitled <hi rend="italic">Alcibiade, ou Le</hi><hi rend="italic">Moi.</hi> The story was
                    much admired, and was by some attributed to Montesquieu, and by others to
                    Voltaire. Its success induced him towrite other tales of a similar description;
                    and thus commenced the <hi rend="italic">Contes</hi><hi rend="italic">Moraux,</hi> which were subsequently collected and printed by themselves. Many
                    of these tales, on which the fame of Marmontel principally if not solely rests,
                    bear reference to the original idea with which they commenced, being for the
                    most part intended to expose some absurdity or extravagance of character. Thus
                    the second displays the folly of those who exert authority in order to bring a
                    woman to reason; and he chose, for an example of this, a sultan and his slave,
                    as being placed in the two extremes of power and dependence. In most of them he
                    has reached a very happy imitation of nature, in the manners and language; and
                    it is only to be regretted that he has occasionally thrown a too glittering
                    varnish over conceptions of the most beautiful simplicity. As lively pictures of
                    French manners, both simple and fashionable, they are admitted to be unrivalled.
                    The early part of the life of Marmontel was passed amidst scenes of rural
                    innocence, with a family which lodged in a cottage, and subsisted by the labour
                    of their hands; the remainder of his days was spent in the most brilliant and
                    refined society which Paris or the world afforded, exhibiting the most splendid
                    union of literary talents with all the polish of exalted rank and the graces of
                    female elegance. This enabled him to succeed in scenes and characters which were
                    extremely remote, and indeed contrasted to each other, in the delineation of the
                    innocent pleasures of the country, as well as of the rivalships, whims, and
                    levities of gay or splendid life. <hi rend="italic">The Shepherdess of the
                    Alps,</hi> which has been the most popular of them all, and <hi rend="italic">Les deux Infortunées,</hi> are as distinguished for simple and touching pathos
                    as the great proportion are for liveliness. The style is remarkable for
                    facility, and the ease with which it inclines, in pursuing the course of events,
                    to the ludicrous or pathetic.</p><p>After the death of Μ. de Boissy, Marmontel obtained the patent and sole
                    management of the <hi rend="italic">Mercure,</hi> of which he had long been the
                    chief support. Upon receiving this appointment, he resigned that which he held
                    at Versailles, and fixed his residence at Paris, in apartments assigned to him
                    in the house of Madame Geoffrin. He appears to have conducted the journal of
                    which he had charge, with great ability and judgment. Few periodical works have
                    appeared more diversified, more attractive, or more abundant in resources; and
                    many who afterwards came to hold the highest rank in French literature were
                    first introduced through it to the favour of the public. After he had conducted
                    it, however, for two years, he became suspected of writing a satire against some
                    powerful nobleman. He was, in consequence, shut up for a few days in the
                    Bastille, and on his release was deprived of his agreeable and lucrative
                    situation. But this misfortune did not discourage his literary exertions. Soon
                    after he had recovered his freedom, he translated into prose the <hi rend="italic">Pharsalia</hi> of Lucan, of which he was a great admirer. He also
                    added to it a supplement, in which he details the events of Caesar’s war in
                    Africa, and concludes with his last campaign in Spain. The French have at all
                    times been great dealers in prose translations of the classics. But though the
                    shape in which Marmontel exhibited the <hi rend="italic">Pharsalia</hi> can
                    never convey an adequate idea of the original, his work is more agreeable to
                    read than the turgid poetical version of Brebenf, by which it was preceded.</p><p>About the same time at which he completed the translation of the <hi rend="italic">Pharsalia,</hi> he published his <hi rend="italic">Poétique</hi><hi rend="italic">Françoise,</hi> containing observations extracted from the
                    various articles which he had furnished for the <hi rend="italic">Encyclopedic.</hi> It is divided into two parts; the first expounding the
                    elementary principles of poetry, and the second applying them to its different
                    sorts.</p><p>Being about this period seized with a disorder in the chest, which had proved
                    fatal to both his parents, he resolved to devote his remaining days to the
                    composition of a romance or fiction of the higher order. The subject he chose
                    was <hi rend="italic">Belisarius,</hi> suggested to him by a print he possessed
                    from the celebrated picture of Vandyck. The fact on which his tale is founded
                    was rather a popular tradition and opinion than an historical truth. But the
                    belief had so universally prevailed, and the idea of a blind old man reduced to
                    beggary had been so closely associated with the name of Belisarius, that it
                    possessed all the advantages essential for the purposes of historical romance.
                    In other particulars the author relied on the faith of history, and Procopius
                    chiefly served as his guide. On its first appearance in 1768, <hi rend="italic">Bélisaire</hi> attracted universal attention. The first seven chapters,
                    describing the journey of the old blind hero to the village where his family
                    resided, his arrival there, and the visit paid to him by Justinian in his humble
                    habitation, are possessed of an interest almost dramatic, and are composed in a
                    higher tone of eloquence than any thing else which he has written. But those
                    which follow are almost entirely destitute of incident, and are just so many
                    separate lectures on different branches of government and politics delivered by
                    Belisarius to Justinian. In the course of these dissertations, there are
                    evidently many references to political incidents, and the system of French
                    politics pursued in the middle of the seventeenth century. The last chapter, on
                    religious toleration, involved the author in a dispute with the Sorbonne, who
                    published a censure of it, which was opposed by the arguments of Turgot, and by
                    the epigrams and squibs of Voltaire.</p><p>1 hough Belisarius cost its author many sleenless nichts, <pb break="no" facs="nls:194203124" xml:id="kp-eb0714-3124-0254"/>he recovered
                    during its composition from the disorder which had excited him to the
                    undertaking, and he some time afterwards produced his <hi rend="italic">Incas of
                    Peru,</hi> dedicated to Gustavus king of Sweden. Irritated as he was by the
                    recent anathemas of the Sorbonne, his great object in this new romance was to
                    show, that all the evils inflicted by the Spaniards on the Indians had their
                    origin in that fanaticism which he was desirous to bring into still deeper
                    detestation. In Fernando de Loquez and Vincentio Re-quelme, he has given a sort
                    of personification of fanaticism in its most hideous form; and has contrasted
                    their characters with that of Las Casas, which is intended as a model of the
                    exalted piety and tempered zeal most becoming a Christian. In the history on
                    which this romance is founded, Las Casas had given a tremendous picture of the
                    atrocities committed by the Spaniards in Peru, and of the sufferings of its
                    inoffensive inhabitants. The pencil of Marmontel had scarcely sufficient
                    strength to paint the determined courage, rapacity, debauchery, and remorseless
                    cruelty of the soldiery let loose upon the Indians, nor the desperate characters
                    of the adventurers at their head, who knew no law but the sword, and whose sole
                    object and aim was plunder. In painting Indian scenes of innocence,
                    tranquillity, and peace, he has been more fortunate. But he has unluckily
                    abandoned the simplicity which charmed so much in his <hi rend="italic">Moral
                    Tales,</hi> for a tone too highly rhetorical; and there is a want of unity of
                    interest, from the multiplicity of episodes. The longest is that of the conquest
                    of Mexico related to the Inca by some refugees from that country, and who had
                    come all the way to Quito, apparently for no other purpose than to tell their
                    long story.</p><p>In 1763 Marmontel had been admitted, though after considerable opposition, to the
                    much-envied place of a member of the French Academy, and, in 1783, he succeeded
                    D’Alembert as its perpetual secretary. The situation of historiographer of
                    France, and the chair of history in the Lyceum, which he successively obtained,
                    fully indemnified him for the loss of the <hi rend="italic">Mercure.</hi> He was
                    in the full enjoyment of affluent circumstances, domestic felicity, and literary
                    reputation, when the French Revolution suddenly changed the scene. During its
                    alarming progress he led a retired life, and, though reduced to indigent
                    circumstances, remained secure amidst all the violent events of the period. In
                    1797 he was chosen a deputy to the National Assembly by the department of Eure,
                    but he died soon afterwards, of an apoplectic attack, at his cottage near
                    Abbeville.</p><p>Several of his pieces were published after his death. The <hi rend="italic">Nouveaux Contes Moraux,</hi> which were inserted in the <hi rend="italic">Mercure,</hi> had been extracted from that journal, and translated into English
                    soon after their first appearance; but they were not printed apart in their
                    original language till after the demise of the author. This second series is
                    inferior in delicacy, grace, and beauty of style, to the former, but the scope
                    and tendency of the stories is more strictly moral. On account of his situation
                    as historiographer of France, Marmontel had thought it a duty incumbent on him
                    to write some historical work. The period he chose was the regency of the Duke
                    of Orleans, which he commenced in 1784; but though he completed it four years
                    afterwards, it was not given to the public during his life. This work is not
                    such, either in point of accuracy of facts or enlightened general views, as
                    might have been expected from the time occupied in its composition, the
                    materials which his situation opened up to him, and the pompous account which he
                    himself gives of his access to information. “All the eminent men of the age,”
                    says he, “opened to me the repositories which contained documents on my subject.
                    The Count de Broglio initiated me into the mysteries of his most secret
                    negociations; and Contades traced to me, with his own hand, the plan of his
                    campaigns, and particularly of the battle of Minden.” The most interesting part
                    is the last chapter, containing the relation of some particular incidents which
                    occurred during the regency, as the plague at Marseilles, and the visit of the
                    Czar Peter to France.</p><p>The <hi rend="italic">Posthumous Memoirs</hi> of Marmontel, drawn up in his
                    declining years for the instruction of his children, and edited in 1804 from a
                    manuscript in his own handwriting, are amongst the most amusing volumes of the
                    description ever presented to the public. They commence with the author’s
                    earliest youth. The portion which comprehends this period of his life is written
                    in the happiest style of his <hi rend="italic">Moral Tales,</hi> and contains
                    many interesting anecdotes of humble innocence, many animated sketches of
                    domestic happiness, and many agreeable traits of village society. In the
                    succeeding part, the portraits of the most distinguished characters in the most
                    brilliant age of France are delineated with so much life, discrimination, and
                    delicacy, and every thing is sketched with a colouring so light and aerial, that
                    the whole representation is exquisite. There is scarcely a single person of note
                    in France whose likeness is not exhibited in this vast gallery: the pictures of
                    Voltaire, D’Alembert, Marivaux, Thomas, St Lambert, and Helvetius, are all
                    excellent. The society which Marmontel frequented was probably the most refined
                    and brilliant that had ever assembled together; but there was evidently a
                    restraint, a desire of exhibition, and want of ease in its intercourse. “Every
                    guest,” says Marmontel, “arrived ready to play his part; in Marivaux, impatience
                    to give proof of acuteness and sagacity was visibly betrayed; Montesquieu, with
                    more calm, waited till the ball came to him, but he expected it; Helvetius,
                    attentive and discreet, sat collecting for a future day.” Literary fame was
                    enjoyed in France in its greatest extent, but also in its greatest anxiety. Of
                    all the others, Voltaire had gained the most brilliant literary success; yet of
                    him Marmontel remarks, that his glory was too dearly paid by the tribulations to
                    which it had exposed him. It had been said by Madame Genlis, that Marmontel, in
                    his <hi rend="italic">Moral Tales,</hi> showed gross ignorance of the French
                    manners and character, in representing the higher classes, particularly of
                    females, as so voluptuous, and in many cases abandoned; but the <hi rend="italic">Memoirs,</hi> if they record the truth, unhappily confirm his
                    representations. When so much amusement is derived from his minute descriptions,
                    it is perhaps hypercritical to remark, that some petty circumstances, of no
                    general interest, and which might have been better thrown into the background,
                    are brought too muchouton the canvass, and are drawn in disproportioned
                    magnitude. But for these details, he states as his apology that it is for his
                    children he writes the history of his life, and that those things which may
                    appear too minute to strangers, will prove interesting and useful to them. The
                    concluding volume, containing a sketch of the first events of the Revolution, is
                    confused and imperfect. Its incidents were too gigantic for the grasp of his
                    mind, and he appears to have been dizzied and stupified by the rapid whirl and
                    total subversion which he witnessed.</p><p>An author by profession, the literary character of Marmontel may be fully
                    appreciated from his various and numerous productions. Though he admits that,
                    whilst he has given the portrait of others at full length in his <hi rend="italic">Memoirs,</hi> he has only painted himself in profile, yet from
                    them his private character may be correctly enough estimated. Upon a review of
                    these, it has been remarked, “that, without great passions or great talents, he
                    seems to have had a lively imagination, a pliant and cheerful disposition, and a
                    delicacy of taste and discrimination, of still greater value in the society
                    which fixed his reputation. Although good tempered and social, he seems to <pb break="no" facs="nls:194203137" xml:id="kp-eb0714-3137-0255"/>
                    have been, in a great measure, without heart or affection; or rather the
                    dissipated and sensual life to which he devoted himself after his removal to
                    Paris, appears to have obstructed in him the growth of all generous and exalted
                    feeling. In society he was joyous and easy, gay without affecting to dazzle, and
                    ingenious without intolerance or fastidiousness.” <hi rend="smallcaps">(e.)</hi></p></div></body></text></TEI>
