                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">MENNONITES</label>, a sect in the United Provinces, and
                    inmost respects the same with those who were, in other places, called <hi
                    rend="italic">Anabaptists.</hi> They had their rise in 1536, when Menno Simon, a
                    native of Friesland, who had been a Catholic priest, and a notorious profligate,
                    resigned his rank and office in the Catholic church, and publicly embraced the
                    communion of the Anabaptists.</p>
                <p>Menno was born at Witmarsum, a village in the neighbourhood of Bolswert in
                    Friesland, in the year 1505, and died in 1561 in the duchy of Holstein, at the
                    country-seat of a certain nobleman not far from the city of Oldesloe, who, moved
                    with compassion by a view of the perils to which Menno was exposed, and the
                    snares which were daily laid for his ruin, took him with certain of his
                    associates under his protection, and gave them an asylum. The writings of Menno,
                    which are almost all composed in the Dutch language, were published in folio at
                    Amsterdam in the year 1651. About the year 1537, Menno was earnestly solicited
                    by many of the sect with which he connected himself, to assume amongst them the
                    rank and functions of a public teacher; and hence he looked upon the persons who
                    made this proposal as exempt from the fanatical frenzy of their brethren at
                    Munster, though according to other accounts, they were originally of the same
                    stamp, only rendered somewhat wiser by their sufferings, he yielded to their
                    entreaties. From this period to the end of his life, he travelled from one
                    country to another with his -wife and children, exercising his ministry, under
                    difficulties and calamities of various kinds, and constantly exposed to the
                    danger of falling a victim to the severity of the laws. East and West Friesland,
                    together with the province of Groningen, were first visited by the zealous
                    apostle of the Anabaptists; from thence he directed his course towards Holland,
                    Guelderland,</p>
                <p>Brabant, and Westphalia, continued it throughout the German provinces situated on
                    the coasts of the Baltic Sea, and penetrated as far as Livonia. In all these
                    places his ministerial labours were attended with remarkable success, and added
                    to his sect a prodigious number of followers. Hence he is deservedly considered
                    as the common chief of almost all the Anabaptists, and the parent of the sect
                    which still subsists under that denomination. Menno was a man of genius,
                    undirected by sound judgment. He possessed a natural and persuasive eloquence,
                    and such a degree of learning as made him pass for an oracle in the estimation
                    of the multitude. He appears, moreover, to have been a man of probity, of a meek
                    and tractable spirit, gentle in his manners, pliable and obsequious in his
                    commerce with persons of all ranks and characters, and extremely zealous in
                    promoting practical religion and virtue, which he recommended by his example as
                    well as by his precepts. The plan of doctrine and discipline drawn up by Menno
                    was of a much more mild and moderate nature than that of the furious and
                    fanatical Anabaptists, whose tumultuous proceedings have been recited under that
                    article, but somewhat more severe, though more clear and consistent than the
                    doctrine of the wiser branches of that sect, who aimed at nothing more than the
                    restoration of the Christian church to its primitive purity. Accordingly he
                    condemned the plan of ecclesiastical discipline which was founded on the
                    prospect of a new kingdom, to be miraculously established by Jesus Christ upon
                    the ruins of civil government and the destruction of human rulers, and which had
                    proved the fatal source of dreadful commotions, frequent rebellions, and
                    enormous crimes. He declared publicly his dislike of that doctrine, which
                    pointed out the approach of a marvellous reformation in the church by the means
                    of a new and extraordinary effusion of the Holy Spirit. He expressed his
                    abhorrence of the licentious tenets, which several of the Anabaptists had
                    maintained, with respect to the lawfulness of polygamy and divorce; and finally,
                    he considered as unworthy of toleration those fanatics who were of opinion that
                    the Holy Ghost continued to descend into the minds of many chosen believers, in
                    as extraordinary a manner as he did at the first establishment of the Christian
                    church, and that he testified this peculiar presence to several of the faithful
                    by miracles, predictions, dreams and visions of various kinds. He retained,
                    indeed, the doctrines commonly received amongst the Anabaptists, in relation to
                    the baptism of infants, the <hi rend="italic">millennium</hi> or reign of Christ
                    upon earth for a thousand years, the exclusion of magistrates from the Christian
                    church, the· abolition of war, the prohibition of oaths enjoined by our Saviour,
                    and the vanity as well as the pernicious effects of human science. But whilst
                    Menno retained these doctrines in a general sense, he explained and modified
                    them in such a manner as made them resemble the religious tenets which were
                    universally received in the Protestant churches; and this rendered them
                    agreeable to many, and made them appear inoffensive even to numbers who had no
                    inclination to embrace them. It happened, however, that the nature of the
                    doctrines considered in themselves, the eloquence of Menno which set them off to
                    such advantage, and the circumstances of the times, gave a high degree of credit
                    to the religious system of this famous teacher amongst the Anabaptists, so that
                    it made rapid progress in various parts. And thus it was in consequence of the
                    ministry of Menno, that the different sorts of Anabaptists agreed together in
                    excluding from their communion the fanatics who dishonoured it, and in
                    renouncing all tenets that were detrimental to the authority of civil
                    government; and by an unexpected coalition they formed themselves into one
                    community.</p>
                <p>Though the Mennonites usually pass for a sect of Anabaptists, yet Mr. Herman
                    Schyn, a Mcnnonite minister, who has published their history and apology,
                    maintains, that they are not Anabaptists either in principle or in origin.
                    Nothing, <pb break="no" facs="nls:194207115" xml:id="kp-eb0714-7115-0561"
                    />however, can be more certain than this fact, that the first Mennonite
                    congregations were composed of the different sorts of Anabaptists, of those who
                    had been always inoffensive and upright, and of those who, before their
                    conversion by the ministry of Menno, had been seditious fanatics. Besides, it is
                    alleged that the Mennonites do actually retain, even at this day, some of those
                    opinions and doctrines, which led the seditious and turbulent Anabaptists of old
                    to the commission of so many enormous crimes; such particularly is the doctrine
                    concerning the nature of Christ’s kingdom, or the church of the New Testament,
                    though modified so as to have lost its noxious qualities, and to be no longer
                    pernicious in its influence.</p>
                <p>The Mennonites are subdivided into several sects, the two principal of which are
                    the <hi rend="smallcaps">Flandrians</hi> or <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Flemingians,</hi> and the <hi rend="smallcaps">Waterlandians.</hi> The
                    opinions, says Mosheim, that arc held in common by the Menonnites, seem to be
                    all derived from this fundamental principle, that the kingdom which Christ
                    established upon earth is a visible church or community, into which the holy and
                    just alone are to be admitted, and which is consequently exempt from all those
                    constitutions and rules of discipline that have been invented by human wisdom,
                    for the correction and reformation of the wicked. This principle, indeed, was
                    avowed by the ancient Mennonites, but it is now almost wholly renounced;
                    nevertheless, from this ancient doctrine, many of the religious opinions that
                    distinguish the Mennonites from all other Christian communities, seem to be
                    derived. In consequence of this doctrine, they admit none to the saerament of
                    baptism but persons who are come to the full use of their reason; they neither
                    admit civil rulers into their communion, nor allow any of their members to
                    perform the functions of magistracy; they deny the lawfulness of repelling force
                    by force, and consider war, in all its shapes, as unchristian and unjust; they
                    entertain the utmost aversion to the execution of justiec, and more especially
                    to capital punishments; and they also refuse to confirm their testimony by an
                    oath. The particular sentiments which divided the more considerable societies of
                    the Mennonites are the following: The rigid Mennonites, called the <hi
                    rend="italic">Flemingians,</hi> maintain with various degrees of rigour, the
                    opinions of their founder Menno, as to the human nature of Christ, alleging that
                    it was produced in the womb of the Virgin by the creating power of the Holy
                    Ghost; the obligation that binds us to wash the feet of strangers, in
                    consequence of our Saviour’s command; the necessity of excommunicating and
                    avoiding, as one would do the plague, not only avowed sinners, but also all
                    those who depart, even in some slight instances pertaining to dress, &amp;c.
                    from the simplicity of their ancestors; the contempt due to human learning, and
                    other matters of less moment. However, this austere system declines, and the
                    rigid Mennonites are gradually approaching towards the opinions and discipline
                    of the more moderate or <hi rend="italic">Waterlandians.</hi></p>
                <p>The first settlement of the Mennonites in the United Provinces, was granted them
                    by William Prince of Orange, towards the close of the sixteenth century; but it
                    was not before the following century that their liberty and tranquillity were
                    fixed upon solid foundations, when, by a confession of faith published in the
                    year 1626, they cleared themselves from the imputations of those pernicious and
                    detestable errors that had been laid to their charge. In order to appease their
                    intestine discords, a considerable part of the anabaptists of Flanders, Germany,
                    and Friesland, concluded their debates in a conference held at Amsterdam, in the
                    year 1C30, and entered into the bonds of fraternal communion, each reserving to
                    themselves a liberty of retaining certain opinions. This association was renewed
                    and confirmed by new resolutions, in the year 1649; in consequence of which, the
                    rigorous laws of Menno and his successors were, in various respects, mitigated
                    and corrected.</p>
