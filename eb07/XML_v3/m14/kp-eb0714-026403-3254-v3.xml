                <p><label type="entry">MARTHA or <hi rend="smallcaps">Marta, Santa</hi></label>, a
                    province of South America, in Magdalena, formerly a department of Colombia. It
                    is bounded on the east by Rio Hacha, on the west by Carthagena, on the south by
                    Mariqnita and Antioquia, and on the north by the Caribbean Sea. The provinces of
                    Rio Hacha and Santa Martha, being separated by no recognised boundary or
                    physical characteristic, have been described by travellers and geographers as
                    one tract of country. It occupies about two degrees of longitude and one and a
                    half of latitude, being traversed by a branch of the Andes, and also by the
                    beautiful and lofty ridge called the Sierra Nevada, or Snowy Mountains of Santa
                    Martha, from which descend numerous streams of water in every direction. Several
                    of these streams are navigable for some distance, and between this ridge of
                    mountains and the sea, as well as in other parts of the country, the soil is
                    eminently fertile, and capable of producing abundantly cocoa, coffee, cotton,
                    sugar-cane, indigo, rice, tobacco, maize, and every description of fruit and
                    vegetable. These lands are . unoccupied, with the exception of two small
                    villages of peaceful and inoffensive Indians. There are also large tracts of
                    pasture lands of excellent quality, which are admirably adapted for raising
                    cattle. On the sea-coast, near the city of Santa Martha, there is another tract
                    of uninhabited country, extending about seventy leagues from north to south,
                    nearly covered with superb forests, and abounding in lands of excellent quality,
                    especially on the rivers which descend from the Snowy Mountains into the <hi
                    rend="italic">Cienaga</hi> or lake. There are only a few villages and farms
                    scattered over it, and altogèther this part of the South American continent
                    presents advantages to the foreign settler such as are but rarely to be met
                    with. The climate, though warm, is healthy, and the country is free from those
                    insects which are so troublesome in many parts. The great river Magdalena
                    crosses the southern extremity of Santa Martha; it afterwards, during the latter
                    part of its course, forms the boundary line between Carthagena and Santa Martha,
                    and finally empties its waters into the sea by several mouths.</p>
                <p>Santa Martha, the capital, is situated upon the coast, in latitude 11.19. 34.
                    north, and longitude 74. 8. 30. west. It was founded in 1525, and was
                    constituted an episcopal city four years afterwards. The bishopric, after being
                    suppressed in 1562, was re-established in 1577. The place was repeatedly sacked
                    by pirates during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries; in 1672, in
                    particular,it was completely pillaged by a French and an English vessel.
                    Latterly, however, it rose into considerable importance as a commercial city,
                    and enjoyed almost the exclusive privilege of importing goods for the capital of
                    the country. The bay upon which it is situated is small and somewhat exposed.
                    There is a castle admirably situated for the defence of the bay, upon the summit
                    of an almost perpendicular insulated rock, above the angle at which a ship’s
                    guns could have much effect. It commands the town and the entrance to the
                    harbour. There is also a small battery on a level with the sea, in front of the
                    town, mounted with a few guns. To the eastward is a range of hills, steep, and
                    of a conical form, through the passes of which the wind rushes with great
                    violence into the bay, thus contributing to its insecurity. Santa Martha
                    suffered severely during the Colombian war of independence, and much of it is in
                    ruins; but still there are some good houses, and it is improving. The cathedral
                    is a very conspicuous object, whether the city be approached by land or sea; but
                    neither its architecture nor its internal decorations are worthy of notice. The
                    Franciscans and Dominicans had each a convent here. This city has one advantage
                    over Carthagena, in being abundantly supplied with excellent fresh water from
                    the. river Gaira, which flows near to the city. The climate is salubrious,
                    although in summer the heat is very great. Behind the city are extensive
                    labyrinths of wood, infested however by a great number and variety of snakes.
                    These forests extend for some miles in an easterly direction, and are terminated
                    by mountains, which gradually rise till they attain the height of 16,419 feet
                    above the ocean level; and this is the elevation of the Snowy Mountains. These
                    are all clothed with fine timber or brushwood, and form highly picturesque back
                    ground to the town. The intermediate flat country is interspersed with numerous
                    <hi rend="italic">rosas</hi> or <hi rend="italic">quintas,</hi> where fruits and
                    vegetables are grown to supply the market. Within a league of the city there are
                    some natural salt-pits, from which salt is to be obtained in sufficient
                    quantities to render it capable of being made an important article of export.
                    Silver also is said to have been found in the vicinity of Santa Martha, and a
                    mine of lead has been discovered under the citadel. The population of this city
                    was formerly 8000, but it has been considerably reduced. At the distance of
                    seven or eight leagues from Santa Martha is situated the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cienaga</hi> or lake, which has a communication with the sea by a channel,
                    sometimes navigable for canoes. These lagoons have so little depth of water,
                    that though the canoes, by which alone they can be navigated, draw only two feet
                    of water, they occasionally ground. Near the lake of Santa Martha is the Indian
                    village of Pueblo Viejo, whence there is a water communication through a
                    succession of lakes and canals, to the villages of Barranquilla and Solidad.
                    These two places, situated on navigable canals communicating with the Magdalena,
                    are depots for goods brought from Santa Martha to be conveyed up the river.
                    Solidad is a place of considerable extent, built of bricks of sun-dried clay,
                    and containing nearly 2000 inhabitants. The exports consist chiefly of cotton,
                    which is exchanged for Osnaburg shirting, Russian duck, hardware, and other
                    necessary articles. The population of the entire province of Santa Martha has
                    been estimated at 62,000.</p>
