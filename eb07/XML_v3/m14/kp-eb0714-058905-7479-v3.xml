                    originally an apprentice to ∙a pastry-cook near the palace of Moscow, but by a
                    fortunate circumstance was drawn from that situation in early life, and placed
                    in the household of Peter the Great. Having made himself master of several
                    languages, and being formed for war and for business, he first rendered himself
                    agreeable, and afterwards became necessary to his master. He assisted Peter in
                    all his projects, and was rewarded for his services with the government of
                    Ingria, the rank of prince, and the title of major-general. He signalized
                    himself in Poland in 1708 and 1709; but in 1713 he was accused of embezzling the
                    public money, and fined in three hundred thousand crowns. The Czar remitted the
                    fine; and having restored him to favour, gave him the command of an army in
                    Ukraine in 1719, and sent him as his ambassador into Poland in 1722. Being
                    constantly occupied with the means of preserving his influence after the death
                    of his master, who was then evidently on the decline, Menz,ikoff discovered the
                    person to whom the Czar intended to leave the succession. The emperor was highly
                    offended, and his penetration cost him the principality of Plescoff. Under the
                    Czarina Catherine, however, he rose higher in favour than ever, because, upon
                    the death of the Czar in 1725, he was active in bringing different parties in
                    Russia to agree to her succession. This princess was not ungrateful. In
                    appointing her son-in-law Peter II. as her successor, she commanded him to marry
                    the daughter of Menzikoff, and gave the Czar’s sister to his son. The parties
                    were actually betrothed, and Menzikoff was made Duke of Cozel and grand steward
                    to the Czar. But this elevation was the prelude to his fall. The Dolgoroukis,
                    favourites of the Czar, had influence enough to procure his banishment, together
                    with that of his family, to one of his own estates, at the distance of two
                    hundred and fifty leagues from Moscow. Having had the imprudence to leave the
                    capital with the splendour and magnificence of a governor going to take
                    possession of his province, his enemies took advantage of this circumstance to
                    inflame the indignation of the Czar. At some distance from Moscow, he was
                    overtaken by a detachment of soldiers, and the officer who commanded them having
                    made him alight from his chariot, which he sent back to Moscow, placed him and
                    his whole family in covered waggons, to be conducted into Siberia, in the habit
                    of peasants. When he arrived at. the place of his destination, he was presented
                    with cows and sheep big with young, and poultry, without knowing from whom he
                    received the favour. His house was a simple cottage, and his employment was to
                    cultivate the ground, or to superintend its cultivation. New causes of sorrow
                    were added to the severities of exile. His wife had died on the journey; he had
                    also the misfortune to lose one of his daughters by the small-pox; and his other
                    two children were seized with the .same disease, but recovered. He sunk under
                    his misfortunes on the 2d of November 1729, and was buried beside bis daughter,
                    in. a little chapel which he had built. His misfortunes inspired him with
                    sentiments of devotion, which, amidst the splendour of his former situation, he
                    had altogether neglected.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
