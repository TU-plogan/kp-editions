                    is bounded on the north by Carnarvonshire and Denbighshire, on the east by the
                    latter county and Montgomeryshire, on the south by Cardiganshire, and on the
                    west by the Irish Channel. It is of a triangular shape, contracting towards the
                    south. Its length from north to south is thirty-six, and its greatest breadth
                    thirty-four miles. Its area is estimated at 691 miles.</p><p>There are few parts of the British Islands in which the scenery is more varied,
                    the surface more irregular, or the prospects more romantic. Many of the peaks of
                    the lofty mountains are near to each other, with deep valleys, or rather chasms
                    between; and in other parts, the variety of objects forming striking contrasts
                    with the vicinity of the sea, give a most picturesque collection of pleasing,
                    though sometimes terrific views. The principal mountains, and their heights
                    above the level of the sea, are Cader Idris, 2914 feet, Arran Fowdy, 2955 feet,
                    Arrening, 2809 feet, Cader Ferwyn, 2563 feet, and Pengam, 1510 feet. These
                    mountains consist principally of granite, porphyry, and other unstratified
                    rocks, whilst the secondary hills are composed of different kinds of
                    schistus.</p><p>The principal rivers are the Dee, which runs through this county, and after
                    passing the beautiful town of Corwin, enters Denbighshire; the Maw or Mawddach,
                    which rises in the middle of the county, and empties itself into the Irish
                    Channel; the Dovy, which rises near a pass in the mountains leading to
                    Montgomeryshire, and forming at last a large estuary, enters the sea at
                    Aberdovy; and the Gleslyn and Dwyrid, which unite their streams before entering
                    the ocean. These rivers receive the waters of numerous brooks and rivulets which
                    trickle from the mountains, and in their course fertilise the valleys through
                    which they run. There are several lakes, of which the most considerable for
                    extent, as well as for beauty, is Llyn Tegid, near Bala, sometimes called
                    Pimblemere. It is about four miles in length, and <pb break="no" facs="nls:194207544" xml:id="kp-eb0714-7544-0594"/>three quarters
                    of a mile in breadth; and its banks are most beautifully adorned with slopes,
                    partly covered with woods, and partly exhibiting verdant pastures. Lynn
                    Talyllin, at the foot of Cader Idris, is less extensive, but scarcely less
                    beautiful. Some fine cataracts add their beauty to the other romantic scenery of
                    this county; of these Rhaidr Dhu and the fall of the Glyn near Port Lyn Dyffws
                    are the most remarkable; but several smaller ones will reward the labour of the
                    traveller who delights in the picturesque.</p><p>The agriculture of the county is in a very imperfect state, though the spirited
                    exertions of some large proprietors have recently exhibited specimens of great
                    improvement. Nearly three-fourths of the county is nninclosed, and much even of
                    that part is unproductive waste. Large portions of the marsh lands on the coast
                    have, by inclosing, embanking, and draining, been converted into rich pasture,
                    and much more requires only the application of capital to bring it into the same
                    state. Very little of the land is adapted to the plough, and the principal
                    pursuit of the farmers is breeding and rearing cattle. The heifers from this
                    county are sent in droves to the fairs in the south of England, and when
                    improved by good pasture, are found very valuable beasts. The sheep are of small
                    size, the flesh of them being highly prized, and their wool forms the material
                    for the domestic manufactures.</p><p>There are scarcely any manufactures that can be noticed, excepting a few coarse
                    woollens; the females of all the families, however, employ themselves in
                    knitting hosiery goods from the native wool. These furnish considerable
                    quantities of the caps called Welsh wigs; and gloves, and stockings, the only
                    goods that are sent out of the county, and the annual value of which is
                    estimated at £25,000. The only trade is from the harbour of Barmouth, situated
                    on a small arm of the sea, into which several rivulets empty themselves. The
                    port is difficult of entrance, and but little frequented. It is chiefly devoted
                    to the coasting trade; exporting oats, barley, butter, cheese, oak-bark, and
                    timber, and importing coals, culm, and groceries. On account of the excellence
                    of the beach, and the romantic beauties of the surrounding country, it has been
                    much frequented of late years for sea-bathing.</p><p>The number of the inhabitants at the several decennial enumerations has been
                    found to stand thus: in 1801, 27,500; in 1811, 30,924; in 1821,34,362; and in
                    1831, 35,315. At this last period the males were 17,194, and the females 18,121.
                    In the year 1830 the baptisms were of males 254, and of females 284, being a
                    total of 538. The burials of the same year were of males 275 and of females 277,
                    being a total of552. The marriages were 255. The illegitimate births were of
                    males, eight, and of females thirteen. The families were 7358, of whom 3583 were
                    chiefly employed in agriculture, 1815 in trade, manufactures and handicraft, and
                    1960 were not comprehended in either of the preceding classes. The males twenty
                    years of age were 8879∙ The occupiers of land employing labourers were 1112 and
                    those not employing labourers were 1246. The labourers were 2601. The persons
                    employed in manufactures or in making manufacturing machinery were 194; those
                    engaged in retail trade or in handicraft as masters or workmen were 1761; the
                    capitalists, bankers, professional, or other educated persons, were 146; and the
                    labourers employed in other than agricultural labour were 738, and the other
                    males twenty years of age were 998. The male servants were 131, and the female
                    2222. The annual value of the real property of the county, as assessed for the
                    purpose of the income tax in 1815, was £111,436.</p><p>The towns of most consideration are Dolgelly, where the assizes are held with
                    4087 inhabitants; Llanghill, with 2359; Corwen, with 1980; and Festeniog, with
                    1648. The most remarkable seats are those of Sir Robert Williams Vaughan, at
                    Nannau; of Mr. Oakley, at Tany Bwlch Hall;</p><p>Sir Thomas Mostyns, at Cors y Gedel, and Mr. Corbet at Ynysymaengwyn. One member
                    is returned to parliament for the county.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
