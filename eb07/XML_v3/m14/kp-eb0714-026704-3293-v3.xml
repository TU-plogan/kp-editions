                    bearing this name, no less than seven are mentioned in different parts of the
                    sacred volume. They are the following:</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mary</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Miriam,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >the sister of Aaron and Moses.</hi> She was the daughter of Amram and Jochebed,
                    who were both of the tribe of Levi (Exod. ii. 1), and were related to each other
                    before marriage as aunt and nephew (Exod. vi. 20), and seems to have been their
                    eldest child (Numb, xxvi. 59). When the infant Moses was exposed by his mother
                    in the ark; upon the Nile, Miriam, then probably about eight years of age, was
                    sent to observe the fate of her brother; and when she beheld him picked up by
                    the attendants of the daughter of Pharaoh, and saw the interest taken in him by
                    that princess, she availed herself of the opportunity to have him again restored
                    to his mother, by offering to procure for him a Hebrew nurse, and, when that
                    offer was accepted, bringing his mother as the person she had selected (Exod.
                    ii. 4—10). On the occasion of the destruction of the Egyptians in the Red Sea,
                    after the Israelites had passed safely over, Miriam, who, in the passage giving
                    an account of the circumstance (Exod. xv. 20), is styled “the prophetess,”

                    celebrating with music and dancing the triumphant deliverance which their nation
                    had obtained. Shortly after this an event occurred which presents the character
                    of Miriam in a less favourable light. Her brother Moses had been rejoined by his
                    wife Zipporah, who had for a considerable time before been resident with her
                    father Jethro (Exod. xviii. 1-3); and as she was not of Israelitish but of
                    Cushite extraction, Miriam and her brother Aaron took occasion from this to
                    indulge what seems to have been a long-cherished feeling of jealousy and envy
                    towards Moses, by exciting a prejudice against him in the minds of the people.
                    For this she was punished by God, by being, in the sight of all the people,
                    afflicted with leprosy, so that “she became white as snow.” On the intercession,
                    however, of Aaron with Moses, and of Moses with God, this terrible infliction
                    was removed; but not until she had been “shut out from the camp seven days,”
                    during which time the people of Israel suspended their journey (Numb, xii.).
                    From this a period of nearly forty years elapses during which no mention is made
                    of Miriam; and when at length, towards the close of the history, her name is
                    again introduced, it is only for the purpose of informing us that, on the
                    arrival of the Israelites at Kadesh, in the desert of Zin, she died and was
                    buried in that place. At the time of her death it is calculated she must have
                    been nearly 130 years of age. Her decease preceded that of Aaron by about <hi

                    >eleven</hi> months, so that these three distinguished members of the same

                    Closely as this memorable female was connected with Him with whose person,
                    character, and work the Scriptures are chiefly occupied, it is remarkable how
                    slender is the information which they communicate to us respecting her; indeed
                    it is only as her history serves to illustrate that of her son, that her name
                    seems to be mentioned at all. From the genealogy furnished by St Luke in the
                    third chapter of his gospel, of our Lord’s descent from Adam, we learn that her
                    father’s name was Heli, a descendant of David through his son Nathan. In that
                    passage, indeed, it is her husband Joseph who is said to be the son of Heli; but
                    that he was so only from his connection with her, and that it is her descent and
                    not his that is given by St Luke, seems plain, for the following reasons: l sí,
                    In the genealogy of Christ’s descent furnished by St Matthew, we are informed
                    that the father of Joseph was Jacob, and not Heli; 2<hi rend="italic">dly,</hi>
                    The entire discrepancy of the genealogy as given by St Matthew from that given
                    by St Luke necessitates the conclusion, that as both relate to Christ’s descent,
                    the former gives his descent by his reputed father’s side, and the latter by his
                    mother’s side; and, <hi rend="italic">2&gt;dly,</hi> As the great object of
                    furnishing these genealogies is to show that Christ was lineally descended from
                    David, and as it was only through his mother that he was connected naturally
                    with any of the human race, it is absolutely necessary that we should regard the
                    genealogy of St Luke as that of his maternal descent, else we shall be left with
                    two genealogies, neither of which serves the purpose for which one of them at
                    least must have been intended. We conclude, therefore, that whilst the genealogy
                    of St Matthew was designed to meet the prejudices of the Jews, for whom chiefly
                    he wrote, by showing that even Joseph, whom they supposed to be the father of
                    Jesus, was of royal descent, that of St Luke presents to us the real descent of
                    Christ from his royal type and ancestor through his mother, and is accordingly
                    to be regarded as giving us her descent as well as his. This is confirmed by the
                    passages adduced by Lightfoot <hi rend="italic">(Hor. Talm.</hi> in loc.) from
                    the Jewish writings, where Mary is expressly spoken of as the daughter of
                    Heli.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>TJ <hi

                    married by one of her own tribe, who from that circumstance came to be called
                    the son of her father, a supposition which was maintained at a very early age in
                    the church, as we learn from Eusebius <hi rend="italic">(Hist. Eccl.</hi> i. 7),
                    is entirely arbitrary and unnecessary. See Crusii <hi rend="italic"

                    hypothesis.</p></note></p>
                <p>At the time the gospel history opens, Mary was the betrothed bride of Joseph,
                    who, though like herself of royal descent, followed the humble occupation of a
                    craftsman or artificer (τζκrω∣∕), probably, as our translators suppose, in wood.
                    Among the Jews it was no uncommon thing for females to be thus betrothed for a
                    very long time before they vγere married; and whenever this was the case, the
                    parties were regarded as bound to each other by as solemn ties as if they had
                    been really married.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    76.)</p></note> Hence Joseph is called the <hi rend="italic">husband</hi> of
                    Mary, and she his <hi rend="italic">wife,</hi> though as yet their contract of
                    marriage had not been fulfilled (Matt. i. 19, 20). The wild opinion that these
                    two terms are to be understood in their ordinary meaning, and that Joseph, when
                    a very old man, had espoused Mary merely to protect her in the observance of a
                    vow of perpetual virginity, rests only on the testimony of the apocryphal <hi
                    rend="italic">Protevangelium Jacobi,</hi> and is so plainly contradicted by the
                    entire tenor of the sacred narrative, as to be unworthy of serious notice.
                    Whilst thus in her virgin state, and as yet probably very young (for females
                    were betrothed at a very early age amongst the Jews), Mary became the mother of
                    our Lord. The circumstances attending this event are related with much
                    simplicity and minuteness by the Evangelist Luke. From his account we learn that
                    an angel appeared to Mary at Nazareth, and saluted her as “highly favoured of
                    Jehovah, blessed among women and when, startled by the suddenness of the
                    apparition, and perplexed with the strangeness of his salutation, she began to
                    be afraid, he calmed her anxiety by explicitly announcing to her the honour
                    which was intended for her, in that she should be the mother of the promised
                    seed, to whom should be given “the throne of his father David.” Amazed at such
                    an announcement, she asked, in all the simplicity of conscious innocence, “How
                    shall this be, seeing I know not a man upon which the angel informed her that
                    she was to hecome a mother fly the miraculous power of God, and that therefore
                    her child should be called “the Son of God.” For the confirmation of his
                    message, he further informed her that her cousin Elizabeth, then far advanced in
                    life, had conceived a son, and that the event was nigh at hand, which should
                    cause her reproach to cease amongst women; and having thus assured her that in
                    her the long-cherished hopes of every mother and every maiden in Israel were to
                    be realised, he left her meekly acquiescing in the will of God.</p>
                <p>Her first impulse after this occurrence was to visit her cousin Elizabeth, of
                    whose state the angel had informed her. The meeting of these pious and honoured
                    females was one of mutual joy and congratulation; nor did they fail to mingle
                    with their rejoicings, grateful thanksgivings to the author of their privileges
                    and blessings. After spending three months with her cousin, Mary returned to her
                    former residence. Here a severe trial awaited her; for Joseph, perceiving her
                    pregnancy, and of course ignorant of its true cause, regarded her as having
                    broken her vows of betrothal to him. Unwilling, however, toexposeher to the
                    ignominy and danger<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>By
                    the law of Moses such crimes were to be punished with death by stoning. Deut,

                    resolution of putting her away privately, when information was communicated to
                    him in a dream, of the real nature of the case, and the command of God laid upon
                    him to relinquish his intention of putting her away, and to take her to his home
                    as his wife. This he accordingly did, and thus came to be regarded by his
                    neighbours as the father of Jesus.</p>
                <p>In ancient prophecy<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Micah, V. 2.</p></note> it had been predicted that the Messiah should be
                    born at Bethlehem, and the fulfilment of this prediction was brought about by an
                    occurrence of a nature apparently purely accidental, and wholly independent of
                    the purposes of his parents. This was the issuing of an edict by the Roman
                    emperor, commanding a census to be taken of all the inhabitants of his
                    dominions, and ordaining that the name of each should be enrolled in the chief
                    city of the tribe or family to which he belonged. As Joseph and Mary were both
                    of the lineage of David, this necessitated their going to Bethlehem, the city of
                    David; and it was whilst they were there that the prophecy was fulfilled. Much
                    disorder has been introduced into the gospel chronology, from the confounding of
                    the edict mentioned by St Luke with a subsequent decree imposing a tax upon the
                    inhabitants of Judaea, and which led to serious strife and bloodshed, whilst
                    Quirinus was proconsul of Syria. The two, however, were perfectly distinct. The
                    edict which brought Joseph and Mary to Bethlehem, though in our version it is
                    said to have decreed “that all the world should be <hi rend="italic">taxedJ</hi>
                    seems to <pb break="no" facs="nls:194203319" xml:id="kp-eb0714-3319-0269"/>have
                    had reference merely to the taking of a census of the people, and of the amount
                    of their property. The word used by Luke is <hi rend="italic">atfoγgapn,</hi>
                    which is the classical word for a <hi rend="italic">census or enrolment,</hi>
                    whereas the proper word for <hi rend="italic">taxation</hi> is <hi rend="italic"

                    classical reader; and though there is no express mention in any of the profane
                    historians, of any such being sent forth at the time referred to by St Luke, yet
                    as it is not to be supposed that they have recorded <hi rend="italic">all</hi>
                    the events of this nature which occurred, their silence can hardly be regarded
                    as a sufficient reason for rejecting the testimony <hi rend="italic">of</hi> the

                    renders it extremely probable that that monarch had taken much pains to have

                    is indeed expressly stated by Cassiodorus, iii. 52. See also Suidas <hi

                    two distinct edicts, many have been led by the language of St Luke himself in
                    the second verse, where it is stated (according to our version) that “this
                    taxing was first made when Cyrenius was governor of Syria.” Here the Evangelist
                    seems at first sight to have fallen into the mistake alluded to, and of this an
                    eager use has been made by some of the enemies of Christianity, to discredit his
                    claims as an inspired historian. His words, however, when translated so as to
                    give them a meaning (which can hardly be said to be the case in our version),
                    seem rather designed to guard against such a mistake, than to indicate the
                    author’s having fallen into it. According to a usage not uncommon in the New

                <p>Owing to the multitudes of people whom this edict had brought together to
                    Bethlehem, Joseph and his wife, on their arrival, found themselves unable to
                    procure any better accommodation than what was afforded them by the stable of a
                    public lodging-house. Here Mary was delivered of her first-born son, whom she
                    herself swathed, and laid in the manger. Amongst the busy crowd then assembled
                    at Bethlehem this event excited no attention; but it was too important to be
                    allowed to pass unregarded by heaven, and accordingly an angel was commissioned
                    to announce it to some pious shepherds that same night, as they were watching
                    their flocks in the adjoining fields. Gladdened with the joyful news, that the
                    long-expected Messiah had at length appeared, these pious men lost no time in
                    going to Bethlehem, that they might see the thing which had come to pass, and
                    might offer their adoration to their infant Saviour. The intelligence they
                    brought was received by Mary and Joseph with astonishment, and by the former
                    carefully stored up in her remembrance (Luke, ii. 8-19).</p>
                <p>On the termination of the time appointed by the Mosaic law for the continuance of

                    type="authorial"><p>Exod. xiii. 2.</p></note> Mary went up to Jerusalem to
                    present her son to the Lord, and to offer the appointed sacrifice in such
                    cases.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Levit, xii.
                    6-8.</p></note> These rites observed, she returned with her husband to their
                    usual residence at Nazareth (Luke, ii. 39). From this place they were in the
                    habit of going up to Jerusalem every year at the feast of the passover (ver.
                    41); and it seems to have been on the occasion of one of these visits that the
                    Magi from the East came with their offerings and adorations to Christ. The
                    occurrence of this event is commonly regarded as having taken place immediately
                    after the visit of the shepherds; but a comparison of the facts stated by St
                    Matthew with those stated by St Luke forbids the entertaining of such a
                    supposition. From the former we learn, that immediately on the visit of the
                    Magi, Joseph and his wife fled into Egypt, where they abode till the death <hi
                    rend="italic">of</hi> Herod. But the latter informs us that, six weeks after the
                    birth of Christ, he was taken up to the temple, and from thence carried down to
                    Nazareth. From this it is plain that the visit <hi rend="italic">of</hi> the
                    Magi, and the consequent flight into Egypt, could not have taken place <hi
                    rend="italic">before</hi> the dedication in the temple, and must therefore be
                    referred to a subsequent period.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    another of these visits that the scene between Christ and the Jewish Rabbin took
                    place, when, after an absence from his parents of three days, he was found by
                    his anxious mother sitting with the doctors in the temple, both hearing them and
                    asking them questions (Luke, ii. 42-52).</p>
                <p>Some time before our Lord’s entrance upon his public ministry, Mary seems to have
                    lost her husband. This is rendered probable, not only from the circumstance that
                    no mention is made after this period of Joseph in the gospel history, but also
                    from the freedom with which Mary appears to have moved from place to place; a
                    freedom hardly consistent with her duties as a wife whose husband was still
                    alive. As confirmatory of this it may be mentioned, that it was admitted as an
                    acknowledged fact in the early ages of the church, that she supported herself by
                    weaving; and hence Celsus calls her <hi rend="italic">Xegvrir∕ς,</hi> and
                    Tertullian <hi rend="italic">Quaestuaria.</hi> Her residence seems to have been
                    principally at Capernaum, on which account probably this place was called
                    Christ’s “own city” (Matt. ix. 1), as her house would be the place to which he
                    would naturally retire during the intervals of his public labours. She is
                    mentioned as having been present at the marriage at Cana in Galilee, where he
                    commenced his miraculous works by turning water into wine (John ii. 1). Shortly
                    after this, whilst he was teaching in the synagogue at Capernaum, she
                    endeavoured to induce him to desist, fearing probably lest he should offend the
                    people by his pointed rebukes; but he resisted her entreaties, declaring that no
                    earthly connections could be so dear to him as those spiritual unions which he
                    sought to form by the truths he was teaching. On the occasion of his going up to
                    Jerusalem for the last time before his death, she was one of those who
                    accompanied him; she followed him to Calvary, beheld him elevated on the cross,
                    and retired not until she saw him expire. As she stood gazing on him, along with
                    some of his followers, he commended her to the care of his beloved disciple
                    John, who from that time took her to reside in his own house. We learn from
                    Acts, i. 14, that she was amongst the disciples at Jerusalem when they were
                    waiting for the gift of the Holy Spirit. An uncertain tradition informs us that
                    she removed with John to Ephesus when he went to reside there, and died and was
                    buried in that place. Other accounts state that she died and was buried at
                    Jerusalem, which is perhaps the more probable statement of the two. By the
                    Catholic church the Virgin <pb break="no" facs="nls:194203332"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0714-3332-0270"/>Mary has been deemed worthy of divine honours, and
                    has even been made to occupy a more prominent place in the devotions of the
                    people than the Saviour himself.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    assumption, nor to the offering of divine homage to the object of such
                    unwarranted eulogium. It is to be regretted that, even by Protestant writers, a
                    degree of importance has been attached to inquiries respecting her, which
                    nothing in Scripture would seem to authorize. How many, for instance, have
                    contended for her perpetual virginity, as if it were a matter on which the whole
                    of our religion depended. A more interesting question is that respecting the
                    fact of her . having had any children by Joseph after the birth of Christ,
                    because upon the answer given to this depends the meaning which we are to attach
                    to those passages that speak of our Lord’s· “brethren and sisters.” The
                    probability is that she had none, and that these titles are to be taken,
                    according to Hebrew usage, as merely signifying <hi rend="italic">near

                    birthplace, and from it she was named, to distinguish her from the other Marys
                    who followed Christ. She has been often confounded with Mary the sister of
                    Martha and Lazarus, and also with the “woman who was a sinner,” mentioned in
                    Luke, vii. 36, &amp;c. but in both cases without any sufficient reason. Equally
                    unfounded is the notion, that before her conversion she was a person of
                    abandoned character; a notion which, though resting on no better authority than
                    that of some monkish legends, has nevertheless become so generally received,
                    that few even in Protestant countries ever think of questioning its accuracy.
                    The only passage of Scripture, however, that can be quoted as favouring this
                    opinion, is that in which it is said that “out of her went seven devils.” (Luke,
                    viii.) But this cannot be admitted as evidence in support of the point in
                    question; for, whatever may be the conclusion to which we come as to the nature
                    of that diabolical possession which prevailed in the days of our Lord, one thing
                    is certain in regard to it, which is, that to be afflicted with it did not imply
                    in the individual so visited any peculiar moral depravity; so that, though the
                    case of Mary Magdalene was one of unusual severity (the number <hi rend="italic"
                    >seven</hi> being the number of completeness), it by no means follows from this
                    that she was not a virtuous, nay, pious female. On the contrary, the evidence
                    from Scripture seems rather to favour the supposition that she was a person at
                    once of blameless character and respectable station. She is introduced to us for
                    the first time in the society of Joanna, the wife of Chuza, steward of Herod’s
                    household <hi rend="italic">(iitiτξwroς, proefectus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >domus),</hi> with whom she was associated in ministering to the wants of our

                    rend="italic">facultates)</hi>; and from the language used by Mark (ch. xv. 41),
                    it would seem as if this had been the usual practice of these pious females
                    whenever he paid a visit to Galilee. Had she been, as is commonly supposed, a
                    mere common prostitute before her conversion, it is difficult to understand how
                    she should either associate with persons of such rank as Joanna, or be possessed
                    of the means of such liberality towards Christ.<note anchored="true"

                <p>On the occasion of our Lord’s going up to Jerusalem from Galilee, immediately
                    before his death, Mary Magdalene was one of those by whom he was followed; nor
                    does she seem to have left him as long as he continued upon earth. She was one
                    of those who beheld him from a distance when he was hanging upon the cross
                    (Mark, xv. 40); and when he was taken down and buried, it was she and Mary
                    Salome who sat over against the sepulchre and beheld where he was laid (Matt,
                    xxvii. 61; Mark, xv. 47). From the sepulchre she returned with her companion
                    into the city to procure materials for embalming his body; and having rested on
                    the Sabbath, they came at the dawn of the third day to perform this office of
                    respect to their departed Lord. Contrary to their expectations and fears, they
                    found the stone which they had seen placed upon the mouth of the tomb rolled
                    away, and free entrance afforded to its interior. Stooping down and looking in,
                    they were startled to find the body of Jesus gone; but as they wondered, an
                    angel appeared, who informed them of his resurrection, and at the same time
                    commanded them to carry the tidings of this event to the rest of the disciples
                    (Matt, xxviii. 7). Amazed and perplexed, they fled from the sepulchre, and
                    announced to their company what they had seen; upon which Peter ŉnd John
                    hastened to satisfy themselves of the correctness of their report, by returning
                    with them to the place where Jesus had been interred. When the others returned
                    home, Mary seems to have remained by the empty sepulchre to weep; and “as she
                    wept,” we are told, “she stooped down and looked into the sepulchre,'and seeth
                    two angels sitting, the one at the head and the other at the feet where the body
                    of Jesus had lain.” By them she was asked the cause of her tears; to which she
                    answered, that it was because they had taken away her Lord, and she knew not
                    where they had laid him. During this conversation, Jesus himself drew near and
                    addressed her; but, stιιpified with grief, she did not at first recognise his
                    voice, and, intent upon gazing into the sepulchre, she answered his inquiries as
                    to what she wept for, and what she sought, without turning herself, under the
                    impression that he was the gardener. To recall her recollection, Jesus addressed
                    her by name; upon which she immediately recognised the well-known voice, and,
                    turning herself, exclaimed, “Rabboni, which is to say, Master.” After a brief
                    conversation, he sent her to announce to the disciples that she had seen him,
                    and that he was about to ascend to heaven. This command she obeyed; and from
                    this time forward we find <pb break="no" facs="nls:194203345"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0714-3345-0271"/>no mention made of her in the New Testament. As to
                    certain traditionary accounts of subsequent actions and journeyings in which she
                    is said to have been engaged, they bear too obviously the marks of mere
                    legendary fiction to be worthy of notice.</p>

                    Lazarus.</hi> These three individuals composed the members of a family, than
                    which none was more beloved and honoured by our Lord in the days of his flesh.
                    Their residence was at Bethany, a village not far from Jerusalem, where Martha
                    seems to have been a householder; and thither our Lord was in the habit,
                    apparently, of frequently retiring during the intervals of his public labours.
                    The name of Mary is first introduced, in connection with that of her sister, in
                    the account given of a visit paid by Christ to their abode, during one of his
                    journeys; on which occasion, whilst Martha busied herself in caring for the
                    hospitable entertainment of her guest, Mary sat at his feet to receive his
                    instruction (Luke, x. 38, &amp;C.). The next mention that is made of her is in
                    the touching and striking account given by John (ch. xi. 1-46), of the death and
                    resurrection of Lazarus; and she appears for the last time shortly subsequent to
                    this, on the occasion of an entertainment given to our Lord, a few days before
                    his crucifixion, by Martha, when she anointed his feet with precious ointment,
                    and wiped them with the hair of her head (John, xii. 1-9).</p>
