                    of the empire in point of population, and the most important on account of its
                    manufactures, is situated almost at the south-eastern extremity of the county of
                    Lancaster, and is distant 186 miles north-west by north from London. The site of
                    the original town was early occupied by a fort, which the Celts, migrating from
                    the continent, and gradually spreading from the north, planted at Castle Field,
                    upon the bank of the river Irwell. Whitaker, the learned historian of the
                    ancient town, gives this station the name of “Mancenion, or the Place of Tents.”
                    Possession was taken of it by the Romans about a century after its formation <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">(a. d.</hi> 72), and they continued masters of it during three
                    centuries, until their final departure from the island. Several of the great
                    Roman roads, traces of which still remain, centred at this point. The fort
                    subsequently fell into the hands of the Pictish invaders, but, after a
                    lengthened struggle, was wrested from them by the Saxons, who repaired the
                    damage to the “Aldport Town,” brought the people into due subjection to the lord
                    or thegn, whose baronial hall covered the space of the existing Chetham’s
                    College, and built the churches of St Mary and St Michael. “Ma-nigeeastre,” as
                    Hollingworth styles the town, was occupied by the Danes about the year 870; and
                    little is known of its succeeding history until, in the apportionment of
                    territory made by the Norman conqueror, Manchester was assigned to William
                    ofPoictou, from whom the lordship of the manor has descended by marriage,
                    hereditary succession, or purchase, through the families of Grelley, De la
                    Warre, West, and De Lacye, to “Mossley of the Hough,” whose successor, Sir
                    Oswald Mosley, Bart., and member for North Staffordshire, is the present
                    possessor of the manorial rights and property. The Grelleys, De la Warres, and
                    Wests, sat as barons in parliament; and Thomas de Grelley granted, in 1301, a
                    “great charter of Manchester,” which, however, has no existing validity.</p>
                <p>The Reformation was violently opposed in Manchester; Collyer, the warden of the
                    “College of the thessed Virgin,” Bradford, and Pendlebury, were zealots in the
                    religious controversies it excited; and Bradford died a martyr. In Elizabeth’s
                    reign, Persons and Campion, the noted Jesuits, plotted in these districts; and
                    from Ancoat’s Lane, now a densely-peopled quarter of the town, one of the Martin
                    Marprelate presses sent forth its stirring missives. The clergy were said to be
                    so hostile to the progress of the Reformation, that the “college” was dissolved
                    in the reign of Edward the Sixth; in Elizabeth’s reign a Commissioner’s Court to
                    promote the Reformation was established; and the most severe measures were taken
                    against recusants, who swarmed in the dungeons of Manchester. In 1584 some were
                    executed, one at Manchester, and their heads exposed on the “college.” In the
                    “great rebellion,” Manchester took a very prominent part, the anti-monarchical
                    party having the ascendency. A brawl, which arose between the followers of Lord
                    Strange (afterwards the ill-fated Earl of Derby) and the inhabitants, was
                    magnified into a great battle, and proclaimed in the metropolis as “the
                    beginning of civil warres in England, or terrible news from the north Lord
                    Strange being impeached by the lower house for his conduct in the affair.
                    Subsequently the town was formally besieged by his lordship’s forces, but they
                    were driven off, and the troops which had been levied for the defence of the
                    place were engagèd in various expeditions, one of which was the noted attack on
                    Lathom House. When the warfare had ceased in England, sequestrators were sent
                    down, who alienated the revenues of the college; presbyteries were established
                    throughout the whole of Lancashire; Manchester was the central point of one
                    “classical division,” and the provincial synod met there. In these troubled
                    times the warden Heyrick, a man of eminent endowments and thrilling eloquence,
                    acted a distinguished part.</p>
                <p>Passing over another long interval, the people of Manchester are found espousing
                    the cause of the Chevalier St George, for their devotion to whom five of the
                    inhabitants were executed in the town. In 1745, they again stood forth in favour
                    of the young Prince Charles; one of the localities in which the plans for his
                    invasion of the monarchy were concocted being in the immediate vicinity, at
                    Jackson’s Ferry, near Didsbury. In the summer previous to his public appearance
                    in Scotland, the prince secretly visited Manchester, and was entertained for a
                    considerable time at Ancoat’s Hall, the seat of Sir Oswald Mosley, the lord of
                    the manor. The Pretender’s forces entered the town on the 28th and 29th of
                    November. They did not receive a very cordial welcome; and when they marched
                    forward by Macclesfield towards Derby, the prince had enlisted from the
                    inhabitants only about three hundred followers, and these chiefly of the lower
                    order. In his subsequent precipitate retreat through Manchester, his reception
                    was even less agreeable than before. The “Manchester regiment” were left to
                    garrison Carlisle, which place speedily surrendered to the Duke of Cumberland,
                    and they were made prisoners. Many were sent abroad; some of the leaders
                    suffered decapitation, and their heads were exhibited on the top of the
                    Manchester Exchange. <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi><pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194202630" xml:id="kp-eb0714-2630-0216"/>The later history of the
                    inhabitants is of a more loyal character. They were very active in the American
                    contest, the war of the French revolution, and the more recent struggle with
                    Napoleon, raising many regiments of volunteers, and otherwise affording their
                    aid very freely. Sir Robert Peel, then residing near Bury, but who was virtually
                    a Manchester merchant, his establishment being in that town, contributed money,
                    and raised a troop of volunteers; and, in the year 1798, Peel and Yates
                    subscribed ten thousand pounds to the “voluntary contribution for the defence of
                    the country.” The distress which the protracted war engendered, and the
                    political ferment of the times, gave rise, in August 1819, to the noted
                    “Peterloo” affair, in which a countless mass of people, having assembled for the
                    alleged object of petitioning the House of Commons, was dispersed by the
                    yeomanry and the troops of the line. The radicalism of these times has’ since
                    cooled down into a more mitigated species of liberalism. In 1830-1831, many very
                    numerous meetings were held in favour of the reform bill; and, when it became a
                    law, the electors returned as their representatives to parliament the Right
                    Honourable C. Poulett Thomson, then vice-president of the Board of Trade, and
                    Mark Philips, Esq. both gentlemen of liberal politics. Manchester had previously
                    sent representatives in early times. In the year 1366, the Sheriff of
                    Lancashire, being required to cause the return of burgesses to parliament from
                    boroughs of sufficient importance to require representation, reported that there
                    was no city or borough in the county willing to accept the burdensome honour,
                    “by reason of their inability, low condition, or poverty.” But in Cromwell’s
                    time, July 1654, Manchester sent Mr Charles Worsley, and, in the next year, Mr
                    R. Ratcliffe, to represent her interests.</p>
                <p>Manchester has been a place of trade from a very early period. In the most remote
                    antiquity the people traded with the Greeks of Marseilles, and with other
                    foreigners, through Ribchester, then a considerable port on the Ribble, which
                    river is now no longer navigable so far inland. In the reign of Henry VIII. a
                    law was enacted to remove the right of sanctuary from Manchester to Chester, on
                    the ground that it caused the resort hither of idle and dissolute persons, to
                    the injury of the “trade, both in linens and woollens,” for which the place was
                    “distinguished,” and which gave employment to “many artificers and poor folks,”
                    whose masters, “by their strict and true dealing,” caused “the resort of many
                    strangers from Ireland and elsewhere, with linen, yarn, wool, and other
                    necessary wares for making of cloth, to be sold there.” Camden speaks of the
                    town as “of great account for certain woollen clothes there wrought and in the
                    year 1650 the people are described as “the most industrious in the northern
                    parts of the kingdom.” The disturbances in France and the Netherlands had tended
                    not a little to the growth of manufactures in the town, by causing the
                    settlement of French and Flemish artisans in Lancashire. Early in the last
                    century it was mentioned as a remarkable fact, that in Manchester and Bolton
                    alone goods to the amount of L.600,000 were annually manufactured. The trade
                    appears, in fact, to have attained to as large a growth as was possible in the
                    then confined state of mechanical knowledge. It was not until an impulse was
                    given to invention, and that splendid series of machines was planned, of which
                    the effects have been so amazing, that Manchester became really a place of
                    commercial eminence and great resort.</p>
                <p>The first of these inventions, in point of date, was the water-frame, of which
                    Arkwright claimed to be the originator, in 1769. In 1770, the spinning-jenny of
                    James Hargreaves was first heard of. In 1779, Crompton’s mule-jenny was
                    invented. The “throstle’Ms another important discovery. In 1785 Arkwright took
                    out a patent for improved carding, drawing, and roving machines. The
                    steam-engine of Watt dates about the same time, although there were sundry
                    modifications of it both before and afterwards. The power-loom, for which
                    Cartwright took out his last patent in 1787, but which underwent many changes
                    before it could be considered as a practical machine, completes the list of
                    early discoveries. There were, of course, various inventions subordinate to
                    these. In the present century, also, a machine has been constructed which
                    promises almost to cutvie all others in importance; it is the self-acting mule,
                    the invention of Messrs Sharp, Roberts, and Company of Manchester. The last
                    patent was taken out in 1830; and there are now nearly half a million of
                    spindles at work on the principle ofspìnning yarn almost independently of human
                    labour.</p>
                <p>The history of this invention is fraught with instruction to the working classes.
                    Attention was first directed to the possibility of contriving a self-acting
                    mule, in consequence of the frequency of “turns-out” amongst the spinners, and
                    the intolerable domination which they were enabled to exercise, from the
                    circumstance of a comparatively small class of workmen having it in their power
                    at any moment to suspend the whole trade of cotton spinning. One “spinner” has
                    three or four young hands immediately dependent upon himself; he has also four
                    or five virtually dependent on him, inasmuch as they being occupied in preparing
                    the raw cotton for him to spin, if he take a fit of idleness or insubordination,
                    the preliminary processes are of course suspended. In the same way, if the
                    spinners, as a body, become idle, the weavers, and eventually the bleachers,
                    spinners, and printers, are brought to a stand; in fact, the whole cotton trade
                    is locked up, and misery and privation are the immediate and wide-spread
                    results. These considerations induced the master spinners, about ten years ago,
                    to call into play the talent of ingenious men, for the purpose of constructing
                    such a machine as would give more stability and regularity to the processes of
                    spinning. This machine has the virtue of being easily grafted on the
                    older-fashioned mules, a fifth of the value of which is sacrificed in making
                    them self-acting.</p>
                <p>But the mere discovery of all these machines was of little benefit to the
                    country, as long as they could be restricted in their use at the caprice of the
                    patentee. Accordingly, through the instrumentality of Mr Peel, an association of
                    master manufacturers was formed, and a subscription to take proceedings for
                    setting aside Arkwright’s patents was entered into, upon the principle of each
                    spinner paying a shilling per spindle for as many as he used. The original
                    subscription list is still in existence; the number of spindles subscribed for
                    was about twenty thousand, being not more than a fourth of the number now
                    employed by many large manufacturers. In 1781 and 1785 Arkwright’s patents were
                    annulled, and the cotton trade took a gigantic stride. The exports, which in
                    1701 were only to the value of L.23,253, and in 1780 only L.355,060, had risen
                    in 1787 to L.1,101,457, and in 1800 to L.5.406,501. The import of raw cotton,
                    which in 1751 was only 2,976,610 pounds weight, was in 1780 upwards of
                    6,700,000, in 1790 thirty-one millions and a half, and in 1800 fifty-six
                    millions of pounds. In 1787 it was estimated that there were in Lancashire
                    forty-one cotton factories, twenty-two in Derbyshire, and seventeen in
                    Nottinghamshire. In 1790 the estimate had increased; and in 1817 Mr Kennedy of
                    Manchester calculated that there were 110,763 persons employed in
                    cotton-spinning, and 20,768 horses’ power.</p>
                <p>In 1832, Messrs Greg of Manchester made a fresh estimate, giving the number of
                    operatives employed in the cotton-spinning and weaving mills only of Great
                    Britain 160,000. In 1833 the import of cotton to England was 303,658,837 lbs.
                    The weekly consumption is now from 18,000 to 19,000 bags; whilst, in the year
                    1782, a great <pb break="no" facs="nls:194202643" xml:id="kp-eb0714-2643-0217"
                    />panic was excited in Manchester by the announcement that 7012 bags of cotton
                    had been imported between December and April. In 1788, a meeting was held in
                    Manchester to consider the great depression under which the cotton manufacture
                    was labouring from the “immense importation” of Indian goods; and shortly
                    afterwards the cotton manufacturers of Lancashire, in conjunction with those of
                    Scotland, appointed deputies to obtain an interview with the king’s ministers,
                    and solicit permission to erect themselves into a Company of Traders, with
                    privileges similar to those enjoyed by the East India Company. At this time it
                    was estimated that the cotton manufacture employed 159,000 men, 90,000 women,
                    and 101,000 children, an exaggerated number. In truth, until the passing of the
                    factory act, and the appointment of inspectors and superintendents under its
                    authority, there were no means of ascertaining the number of hands employed
                    either in the whole country or in districts. Now, however, this can be done
                    satisfactorily. The most recent return of the hands employed (1836) is, for
                    Manchester, as follows:</p>

                <p>The trade of Manchester, however, is not to be considered as limited to the
                    amounts given in these tables. Numberless manufacturers have works on the
                    borders of Cheshire, Derbyshire, Yorkshire, and Staffordshire, whilst their
                    warehouses are situated, and all their transactions centre, in Manchester.
                    Wherever labour is cheap, thither they resort. Not to travel, however, out of
                    the county, we shall give the following summary of the factory hands in all the
                    other parishes of Lancashire, comprising nearly the whole of Lancashire :—</p>

                <p>Handdoom weaving has been almost wholly superseded. It is calculated that there
                    are in the town of Manchester only about 3000 weavers; but the out-townships of
                    Radcliffe, Pilkington, Unsworth, Pilsworth, Prestwich, Great and Little Heaton,
                    Blackley, Newton, Failsworth, Alkrington, and Tonge, also contain a considerable
                    number of hand-looms, in cotton, employed by Manchester houses.</p>
                <p>The earnings of weavers vary exceedingly. The weaver of Marseilles toilet-covers,
                    a Manchester manufacture, will earn from 7s. 6d. to 10s. a week nett, and the
                    weavers of fancy waistcoatings, &amp;c. (at Huddersfield) can earn 15s. weekly;
                    whilst the weavers at Bolton (from 7000 to 8000 in number) are said to average
                    only 4s. 1-∣d. weekly for I 60 cambrics, which constitute a staple article in
                    that town. Wages fell there twenty-one and a half per cent, between 1827 and
                    1834. The general rate was given to a recent parliamentary committee as

                <p>In a recent report made by Dr Kay, one of the assistant poor-law commissioners,
                    formerly a resident of Manchester, it was stated that contracts had been made
                    for the erection, within two years, of mills which would require seven thousand
                    horses’ power to set them in operation. It may be stated that, presuming one
                    half of the power to be employed in producing yarn,<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>No. 40’s may be taken as a general average
                    for the quality of the yarn spun.</p></note> there would be an addition to the
                    present consumption of raw cotton of about 2800 bags, weighing about 500 lbs.
                    each, per week, or about fifteen per cent, increase on the present sales. In
                    preparing this cotton, and spinning it into yarn, 19,600 hands wopld be
                    required; and, presuming the other moiety of the 7000 horses’ power to be
                    employed in afterwards weaving the yarn into cloth, there would be needed for
                    this process 26,250 weavers, making a total addition to the hands employed in
                    the cotton trade of 45,850 persons, besides mechanics, warehousemen, clerks,
                    &amp;c. For the 3500 horses’ power supposed to be employed in spinning, there
                    will be required 2,800,000 spindles, which alone will be worth about half a
                    million of money. Of the 19,600 persons working this horse-power, probably 8400
                    will be occupied in the preparatory processes, and will earn, on the average,
                    lθs. per week. Of the remaining 11,200 engaged in the spinning, about one fourth
                    will be men earning from 30s. to 40s. a week; the other three fourths, children,
                    receiving from 4s. to 9s. The 26,250 supposed to be employed in weaving will
                    earn probably, on an average, not less than lθs. a week. Extraordinary and
                    improbable as the extent of this increase may appear, there is reason to believe
                    that the estimate is by no means exaggerated. It is stated, upon good authority,
                    that in Bolton alone one foundery has orders, to be executed within this year,
                    for a thousand horse-power of steam-engines; and, with equal authenticity, it is
                    asserted that, in the district of Ashton-under-Lyne, the increase in factories
                    will cause a demand for at least 7000 new hands. Nor is the calculated increase
                    in the consumption of cotton so unprecedented as at first view it may appear.
                    Last year the weekly consumption was 17,750 bags, whilst in 1812 it was only
                    about 12,000. In one year, namely, in 1834-35, the weekly consumption has
                    increased 366 bags, or about 19,000 bags in the year. Cotton, indeed, has become
                    an article of universal use, and new fabrics, in which it forms the sole or a
                    main ingredient, are daily brought into the market.</p>
                <p>The following statement goes far to corroborate the estimate of Dr Kay.</p>

                <p>The power here stated is incomplete, several factories being yet unfinished. Of
                    the total number of mills given above, five of the cotton and one of the woollen
                    have merely been enlarged; and all the rest are new. The actual power of the
                    cotton-mills varies slightly from the available amount, which is 2007.</p>
                <p>It is a notorious fact, that the cotton manufacture has already attained to such
                    a height in Manchester, that extreme difficulty is experienced in obtaining
                    hands, both young and adult, for the mills; it is, then, a question for serious
                    consideration, how the dearth to be created by the “new mills” shall be
                    supplied. Some time ago an agent of the poor-law commissioners was stationed in
                    the town, where he still remains, for the purpose of locating the surplus
                    labourers of the agŋcultural counties in the south and west amongst the
                    manufactures of the cotton districts. From one to two thousand persons have
                    already migrated under his direction; and they express, <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194202682" xml:id="kp-eb0714-2682-0220"/>generally, the liveliest
                    satisfaction at their change of occupation.</p>
                <p>The wages of all classes of factory operatives, though they have undergone
                    reductions as the price of manufactures has sunk, and the price of food been
                    reduced, are still exceedingly good. Mr Rickards, the late inspector of
                    factories for the district, says, « It may be stated of operative families, that
                    a husband gets 26s. to 30s. per week; with perhaps three children as piecers at
                    10s., 7s. 6d., and 5s. 6d. per week. These are common rates of earnings by
                    mill-operatives.” As to children, he observes, “If there are any children now in
                    cotton mills, receiving less than 3s. per week, they must be the youngest
                    scavengers, and few in number; 3s. 8d. to 4s. 2d. being commonly paid to
                    scavengers since the passing of the present (factory) act, whilst the younger
                    piecers are sometimes paid extra to do scavengers’ work.” The following tables
                    give the wages of the various classes of operatives more in detail.</p>

                <p>Average Wages of Young Women employed in Cotton Mills at Manchester.</p>
                <p>Wages in cotton factories are not precisely of the same amount in the whole
                    country, but are increased or lowered according to various local circumstances,
                    such as the supply of hands or of water, the rental and local taxes, the
                    facilities of communication by land and water, or the abundance of coal. These
                    considerations have had the effect in recent years, combined with the pernicious
                    working of Trades’ Unions, to scatter the cotton trade over the surface of
                    Lancashire, of Cheshire, and Derbyshire, occasioning frequently the location of
                    mills in spots the most remote. Thus, for example, Preston is becoming’a large
                    depot of the cotton manufacture, the price of labour and local considerations
                    uniting in its favour; another ancient borough, Lancaster, is rising into
                    manufacturing importance, labour being there 25 or 30 per cent, cheaper than in
                    Manchester. Nearer home, in towns whose natural advantages have tended to foster
                    the trade, but in which there is no redundant supply of labour, it appears from
                    the following tables that wages are higher. “I cannot avoid concluding (says the
                    factory commissioners’ First Report), that the rate of wages is higher out of
                    Manchester than it is in it. The earnings of a fine spinner are nearly fifty per
                    cent, higher than those of a coarse spinner, and fine spinning is almost
                    entirely confined to Manchester; consequently, the average earnings of a
                    Manchester spinner should be considerably above those of a spinner of the
                    surrounding district. But if the earnings of coarse spinners in Manchester are
                    compared with those of coarse spinners in the country, no such superiority
                    appears to exist.” <pb break="no" facs="nls:194202695"

                    the returns. (Factory Commissioners Report, D. 1, p. 125.) By total number is
                    meant the total number of which the commission at Manchester obtained returns,
                    and not the total number of cotton-workers at the places indicated.N. B.—The
                    above are all spinners of the same quality of yarn, and consequently there can
                    be no objection to the return on the score that the work is different. The first
                    two manufacturers are both in Manchester, within a few yards of each other, and
                    one master pays double the rate of wages that the other does. The variance is
                    owing to sundry minute circumstances, the difference in machinery being probably
                    one.</p>
                <p>At Manchester and Glasgow, the great centres of the cotton trade in England and
                    Scotland, there is a material difference in the price of labour, as the
                    subjoined analysis from the Reports of the factory commissioners shows.</p>

                            established fact, that operatives in factories had an exemption from
                            cholera, when it raged in Manchester, which was not experienced by other
                            classes.</p></note></p></cell>

                    1044 56Upon this subject a more elaborate and careful investigation yas made in
                    1834 and 1835, by the Manchester Statistical Society, from which it appeared
                    that there were in the borough of Manchester 43,304 children receiving
                    education, or 21∙65 per cent, of the population; and in the borough of Salford
                    12,885 children, or 23∙4 per cent. Of these there are in Manchester 10,108 and
                    in Salford 3131 who attend only day or evening schools; 10,011 in Manchester and
                    3410 in Salford who attend both day and Sunday schools; and 23,185 in Manchester
                    and 6344 in Salford who attend only Sunday schools. It further appears, that in
                    Manchester two thirds, and in Salford twenty-two and a half per cent, of the
                    children between five and fifteen years of age are receiving instruction.The
                    total quantity of yarn spun in England in 1835 was 248,814,531 pounds, being an
                    increase of nearly seven millions, of pounds over the preceding year. Mr Burn
                    estimates the number of spindles employed in producing it at 11,152,990; and,
                    calculating the capital in the usual way, namely, at 17s. 6d. per spindle, it
                    would appear that L.9,758,864 is the amount embarked in the cotton spinning.
                    From the same excellent source is derived an estimate of the value of the goods
                    manufactured, and the yarn and thread spun in 1835.</p>

                <p>Liverpool and Hull are the principal ports through which the goods and yarn of
                    Manchester are sent abroad; and the amount of customs duties received there (at
                    the former port especially) tends to show the state of the manufactures in
                    Manchester and the county of Lancaster generally. It was, for the year ending
                    April 1834, L.3,733,166.8s. 10d. (gross); for the year ending April 1835,
                    L.3,846,306.9s. lid. (gross); and for the year ending April 1836, L.4,273,000
                    (gross).</p>
                <p>In addition to the cotton manufacture, Manchester has likewise a considerable and

                    celebrated throughout England for the thrown silk it sends out, was established
                    in 1819-20, and was the first erected in the district. Directly and indirectly,
                    it affords employment to about five thousand persons. In 1819 there were in
                    Manchester about a thousand weavers of mixed silk and cotton goods, and fifty of
                    pure silk. In 1823 the number of the former had increased to 3000 and of the
                    latter to 2500∙ In 1828 there were 4000 of the former class and 8000 of the
                    latter; and in 1832 from 12,000 to 14,000 looms were employed by Manchester
                    houses; and the throwing mills, twelve in number, but of which two were not then
                    in operation, gave occupation to about 3600 hands. The present state of the silk
                    throwing trade is as follows :—</p>

                <p>It is calculated that the Manchester throwsters produce about 8000 pounds of
                    thrown silk weekly, but that the silk looms consume not less than 24,000 pounds,
                    8000 pounds of which are derived from the Macclesfield throwsters, and the
                    remainder from Congleton, Sandbach, Newcastle, &amp;c. very little foreign
                    thrown being used in Manchester. According to the closest estimate which can be
                    formed, the silk manufacturers having their principal establishments in
                    Manchester employ now not less than 18,500 looms in the weaving of pure or mixed
                    silk goods; and, taking the usual trade average of four persons to a loom, the
                    silk trade of the district, in all its branches, keeps in employment not less
                    than seventy thousand persons. Few of the weavers live in Manchester; they are
                    scattered over the more or less remote rural districts of the county, viz. at
                    Gorton, Newton Heath, Harpurhey, Middleton, Stand, Radcliffe, Pendle-bury,
                    Worsley, Eccles, West Leigh, and Ormskirk. The silk trade is, in fact, changing
                    its centre, which used to be in Macclesfield; Manchester is now the mart; and
                    though in Macclesfield the number of hands employed in the throwing mills is
                    considerably larger than in Manchester, the latter town has very greatly the
                    superiority of numbers in all the other processes. Wages in the silk mills are
                    good; and the hand-loom silk-weavers earn considerably more than the mass of
                    those engaged in cotton. Many females and children are employed in the silk
                    mills. The powerloom has been partially introduced into the manufacture, but
                    hitherto with no decided success. By the returns already quoted it will be seen,
                    that throughout Lancashire only 366 power-looms are employed in silk, of which
                    number 306 are in Manchester, and sixty in the adjoining parish of Eccles.</p>
                <p>The population of Manchester has had a most amazing growth. The town comprehends
                    several townships, viz. Manchester, Chorlton-upon-Medlock, Cheetham, Ardwick,
                    Hulme, Newton, Harpurhey, Bradford, and Beswick, form the borough of Manchester;
                    Salford, Pendleton, and Broughton, that of Salford; but they are physically, as
                    well as politically and commercially, <hi rend="italic">one</hi> town, though
                    having separate local government. Of the townships of Manchester and Salford,
                    the population was as follows at the decennial periods:</p>

                <p>The township of Chorlton-upon-Medlock, which is filled with factories, was a
                    desert but yesterday, and the population has sprung up in a way wholly
                    unprecedented. It was, in 1801, 675 persons; in 1811, 2581; in 1821, 8209; and
                    in 1831, 20,569.</p>
                <p>Property has increased in the same rapid ratio. In 1815 the annual value was L.
                    19,830, in 1835 it was L.58,844. A similar augmentation has taken place in other
                    townships. In Manchester in 1815 the annual value of property was only
                    L.308,634, in 1835 it was L∙573,085; in Salford it was in 1815 L.49,048, it is
                    now L.l 14,769; in Broughton (a township without manufactures) the annual value
                    of lands and buildings was in 1815 only L.5082, in 1835, L.21,303; in Cheetham
                    (also a township containing only private residences) the value was, in 1815,
                    L.8524; and it is now L.28,541.</p>
                <p>It has recently been ascertained, that within a period of four years 700 new
                    streets have been added to the town. Calculating ten houses to a street, and six
                    occupants to each house (a fair estimate), we have an increase of 42,000 souls
                    since the census of 1831; and, making some allowance for the additions to and
                    improvements in <pb break="no" facs="nls:194202734" xml:id="kp-eb0714-2734-0224"
                    />existing streets, it will be found that the population of Manchester, Salford,
                    and their districts, which in 1831 was 232,758, is now not less than
                    300,000.</p>
                <p>Manchester ranks as the first manufacturing town in the empire, and in population
                    it is second only to London.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    </table></note> The county is divided into several hundreds, Manchester being
                    situated in the centre of that of Salford, in which there has been an immense
                    increase of population within the present century, the numbers being, in 1801,
                    177,682, and in 1831, 429,602. The next most important hundreds of the county
                    are those of Amounderness (168,057), and West Derby (170,062). The total annual
                    value of property in Salford hundred was, in 1815, L.918,397,and in 1829,
                    L.l,554,314. Of these amounts, L.488,053 at the former period, and L.751,200 at
                    the latter, were comprised in the parish of Manchester, which is divided into
                    thirty-two parishes.</p>
                <p>Manchester, as an old parish, has a parish church, said to have been constructed
                    by a Lord Delaware in 1422, out of two old churches built in 1300. It is a fine
                    Gothic structure, 216 feet in length from east to west, and 120 feet in breadth,
                    with a handsome tower. It is richly ornamented in the cathedral style, having on
                    the exterior numerous grotesque figures projecting from the roof, in the taste
                    of the age in which it was built. It has of late years been extensively repaired
                    and beautified in conformity with the original design, and affords
                    accommodation, by its great proportion of free seats, to a numerous
                    congregation. It was made collegiate by the founder, who amply endowed it; and,
                    by the increased value of the property, has become a rich ecclesiastical
                    establishment, with a warden, four fellows, and two chaplains. But as
                    arrangements are in progress for erecting Manchester and the county in which it
                    is situated into a bishopric, this will occasion considerable changes. The only
                    churches more than fifty years old are, St Ann’s, in the square of that name,
                    consecrated in 1765; and St John’s, in Byrom Street, opened in 1769. As the town
                    has grown, more churches have been built, and others are now being built. The
                    whole number of those edifices in which the established forms of worship are
                    observed is now twenty-four. They are all handsome, some of them elegant
                    structures, and all in the interior are neatly and appropriately finished. As in
                    other manufacturing towns, the number of those who dissent from the Established
                    Church is very considerable. There is one congregation belonging to the Scotch
                    Kirk, and one of the Secession; but the largest division is the adherents to the
                    Roman Catholic Church, consisting for the most part of Irish emigrants employed
                    in the lowest kinds of labour. They have four places of worship, one of them, in
                    Granby Row, opened in 1820, very handsome and costly, in the Gothic style. There
                    are twenty-seven chapels belonging to Wesleyan Methodists of different shades of
                    opinion, the Independents have nine chapels, the Baptists six, the Unitarians
                    three; and there are seven belonging to other smaller sects.</p>

                    more general nature. The church accommodation in Manchester and Salford consists
                    of about 30,000 sittings, exclusively of the Scotch Kirk; that in the Wesleyan
                    Methodist chapels, of about 9000; Roman Catholic and all other dissenting
                    chapels, of about 21,000 sittings. The Sunday schools in Manchester and Salford

                    rates from the 31st of May 1833. In 1833, the only manufacturer who carried on
                    business in Manchester Collection ceased work ing, and the whole of the soap
                    which is consumed in the town must consequently be supplied from other parts of
                    the country. With respect to the duties on spirits for consumption in <hi

                    supply is derived from other places, chiefly, it is presumed, from the
                    metropolis; and the duties are paid thereon at the place where the same is
                    distilled or imported, as the case may be. The decrease or total cessation of
                    payments under some heads is of course accounted for by the reduction or
                    abolition of the respective duties.</p>

                <p>A striking and most important difference appears in the expenditure of another
                    township (Broughton), in which there are few or no manufactures to employ the
                    poor; showing that the poor rates fall much heavier on an agricultural than on a
                    manufacturing population :—</p>
                <p>In connection with these statistics, which are intended to communicate, in as
                    concise a form as possible, a correct view of the condition of the people of the
                    principal manufacturing town of Great Britain, it is important to exhibit some
                    data as to the state of crime in the district; and the following table affords
                    that information in an authentic form. It should be premised, that the gaol for
                    the hundred is situated in Manchester, and that the total population of the
                    hundred was, in 1831, 429,602.</p>

                <p>The towns of Manchester and Salford are governed by a boroughreeve and
                    constables, elected, the former by a jury summoned to the court of Sir Oswald
                    Mosley, the lord of the manor, and the latter at a court of the Earl of Sefton,
                    the high steward. The two towns have also police acts, and a representative body
                    of police commissioners, elected in Manchester by persons having a high
                    qualification, and in Salford by the rate payers at large. Such is also the case
                    with the township of Chorlton-upon-Medlock; whilst in Ardwick, all persons
                    occupying premises of the yearly value of L.30, and in Hulme all occupants to
                    the value of L.30, are capable of qualifying as commissioners.</p>
                <p>Manchester possesses large gas-works, which are important, inasmuch as the
                    profits accruing from them (in 1835 nearly L.I4,000) are expended upon those
                    improvements which tend so much to the health, the comfort, and the ornament of
                    a densely-peopled town.</p>
                <p>The gigantic undertakings of the celebrated Duke of Bridgewater, who may without
                    exaggeration be styled the parent of canal navigation in England, had their
                    centre in Manchester. In succeeding years the example so nobly set was rapidly
                    followed, and Manchester has the advantage of a connexion, as direct as canal
                    and river navigation conjoined can afford, with Liverpool, Hull, Goole, London,
                    Lancaster, and indeed all the great sea-ports and inland commercial towns. It is
                    remarkable that this district should have been the first to manifest the immense
                    importance of railway communication. The history of the Liverpool and Manchester
                    railway, from its infancy to its present state of maturity and unexampled
                    excellence, is familiar to the whole world. Branching from the main road, there
                    are lines to Bolton, Wigan, Warrington, St Helen’s, &amp;c.; and that to
                    Warrington will shortly be incorporated in the Liverpool and Birmingham railway,
                    the road having been purchased to form a part of the great line now
                    constructing. A line is also in course of formation, by which railroad
                    communication may be had with Preston, a rising town in the cotton manufacture;
                    and thence the northern districts will speedily, no doubt, carry forward the
                    communication towards Scotland. Another line is now in active progress directly
                    from Manchester to Bolton, to which a degree of importance exceeding the mere
                    abstract extent of the undertaking attaches, inasmuch as it runs in the same
                    line with the canal to Bolton, and, in fact, both are the property of the same
                    proprietors. It is understood that the two lines of carriage, by land and water,
                    will be worked conjointly, the railroad for passengers and certain descriptions
                    of merchandise, the canal for other descriptions of merchandise; and from these
                    operations the public will be enabled to form ’a just conclusion on the very
                    important and still undetermined point, whether, and in what circumstances,
                    canals are capable of successful competition with railways. During the session
                    of parliament 1836 a bill was obtained to authorize the construction of a
                    railroad from Manchester to Leeds.</p>
                <p>Manchester has been the birth-place, or abode, or central point of action, of
                    many eminent men. In remoter times the names of Hugh Oldham, Bradford, Booker,
                    Dee (the astrologer), Whitaker (the historian), Byrom (a poet, and the inventor
                    of a system of short-hand), Worthington, Percival, Ogden, Hugh Manchester,
                    Humphrey Chetham, Heyrick, Lord Delamere, Bancroft, Barlow, and Crabtree, hold a
                    prominent place? in the history of the town and its connexions. Amongst ⅛he
                    illustrious of modern days, the commercial metropolis may claim as her own the
                    eccentric Duke of Bridgewater. Mr Thomas Henry, though not born in Manchester,
                    spent his life there; and his attainments as a chemist were brought into
                    beneficial exercise upon the cotton manufacture of the country, in the discovery
                    of most important improvements in the art of dyeing, through the operation of
                    mordaunts, and by simplifying and applying practically to manufactures the
                    discovery of M.Berthollet in regard to the qualities of oxymuriatic acid, a
                    discovery by which the time occupied in the process of bleaching calicoes has
                    been reduced from days to hours. The late Sir Robert Peel, though born near
                    Blackburn, and a resident of Bury, had his mercantile establishment in
                    Manchester, and was probably the most extensive merchant of his day, excepting
                    perhaps Sir Richard Arkwright. Dr Dalton, also, though born in Cumberland, has
                    spent his life from the age of twenty-six or thereabouts in Manchester, whither
                    he went originally from Kendal on his appointment to the post of professor of
                    mathematics and natural <pb break="no" facs="nls:194202786"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0714-2786-0228"/>philosophy at the Manchester New College, an
                    institution which was subsequently removed to and is still in existence at York.
                    The doctor is now, and has been for many years, president of the Manchester
                    Literary and Philosophical Society, through which many of his most valued
                    discoveries have been communicated to the world.</p>
                <p>The municipal government of the township of Manchester is committed to the
                    boroughreeve and two constables, who are elected at the court-leet of the lord
                    of the manor, Sir Oswald Mosley, Bart. The boroughreeve exercises the power,
                    without enjoying any of the external distinctions, usually pertaining to a
                    mayor. There is an effective police establishment, under the direction of 240
                    commissioners elected by the occupants of tenements of a certain annual
                    value.</p>
                <p>Manchester has a considerable number of associations for the cultivation of
                    science and literature, and the promotion of education. The Royal Manchester
                    Institution ranks first in importance, the inhabitants having expended about
                    L.30,000 in the erection of a noble edifice for periodical exhibitions of
                    paintings, the delivery of lectures, &amp;c. leaving themselves unhappily almost
                    without the means of fulfilling the purposes for which the building was raised.
                    An excellent Natural History Society is in a flourishing state; a Mechanics’
                    Institute receives extensive support; the town boasts a Concert Hall, having an
                    income of L.3000 per annum; there are two schools of medicine, the elder of
                    which (the Pine Street) has attained to considerable celebrity, and has recently
                    obtained the patronage of the king; and amongst the numerous public libraries is
                    one to which free access is afforded, and which has a large and most valuable
                    collection of books, ancient and modern. This is the library attached to that
                    antique structure Chetham’s Hospital, or the College (now so called), an
                    institution founded two centuries ago, by the man whose name it bears, for the
                    maintenance, education, and apprenticing of a number of boys, the offspring of
                    poor parents. The Grammar School is another of the ancient foundations which do
                    honour to the town; in late years its funds have so far increased as recently to
                    justify the erection of a second school, in which a course of general education
                    may be gratuitously obtained, whilst the parent building is still devoted to the
                    diffusion of classical knowledge. The school has the advantage of several
                    “exhibitions.” The recent inquiry into the public charities of England includes
                    a very large return of charitable bequests still existent within the hundred of
                    Salford, and of these Manchester has its full share. The town also supports,
                    with a most liberal hand, medical institutions for the cure of almost every
                    disease incident to humanity. At the head of these stands the Royal Infirmary,
                    where, since its establishment in 1752, no less than 576,859 patients have been
                    treated; four thousand accidents are annually brought under the attention of its
                    medical officers; and the patients in the different wards of the infirmary
                    average about 180 weekly. There are also a Ladies’ Jubilee Charity, a School for
                    the Deaf and Dumb, and (in course of erection jointly with the deaf and dumb
                    institution) a Blind Asylum, which had its foundation in a bequest of L.40,000
                    made several years ago by Mr Henshaw, a wealthy inhabitant of Oldham; the
                    condition of its application to that benevolent object being, that no part of
                    the sum should be expended in the erection or furnishing of the building, but
                    that the latter should be provided by the inhabitants. After considerable
                    delay,about L,9000have been subscribed; and the asylum is now in course of
                    erection on the outskirts of the town. Other institutions for the relief of the
                    afflicted and the distressed, for the promotion of education and the spread of
                    religion, abound in Manchester, which indeed exhibits a prominent example of the
                    almost profuse expenditure of wealth, hardly acquired, for philanthropic and
                    useful purposes.</p>
                <p>The foregoing sketch of the town of Manchester, and its hitherto unpublished
                    statistics, are furnished by Mr James Wheeler, author of “Manchester, its
                    Political, Social, and Commercial History, ancient and modern ;” to which work,
                    and to the History of the County Palatine of Lancaster, by Edward Baines, we
                    refer those who desire a more enlarged acquaintance with the modern history of
                    this nationally important and industrious community.</p>
