                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">MARIVAUX, <hi rend="smallcaps">Pierre Carlet de Chamblain
                    de</hi></label>, one of the most prolific and ingenious writers of the
                    eighteenth century, in the department of comedy and romance, was born at Paris
                    in the year 1688. He was of an ancient family of the robe, which had given
                    magistrates to the parliament of Rouen; and his father, who held the office of
                    director of the mint at Riom, having little fortune to leave him, spared no
                    pains on his education. Young Marivaux early discovered the subtilty and
                    activity of his genius. Before the completion of his studies at college, he had
                    rendered himself the friend of his masters, and the master of his
                    fellow-students. The society to which he was introduced on his entrance into
                    life also contributed to the development of his talents, and exercised a
                    sensible influence on the characterof his writings. Admitted into the salons of
                    the opulent females of the capital, who then vied with one another in protecting
                    men of letters, he there contracted that affectation of wit, of which the
                    comedies of Molière had not yet entirely cured the <hi rend="italic"
                    >précieuses</hi> of the age. It was there that he became acquainted with
                    Lamotte, and more especially with Fontenelle, whose conversation, though full of
                    attraction, was in no respect calculated to give him a taste for simplicity.
                    Soon afterwards he figured amongst the writers of every description who composed
                    the court of Madame de Tencin, and whom that celebrated woman familiarly called
                    her “beasts.” It was in this society that Marivaux, naturally inclined to
                    controversy, and fond of paradox, though otherwise gentle and tolerant, amused
                    himself in tilting with the partisans of antiquity, depreciating poetical
                    talent, and deriding the admirers of Voltaire, whom he cavalierly denominated
                    “an arrant bel-esprit, the perfection of common ideas.” He even went so far as
                    to maintain that Molière did not understand comedy, and pretended that he could
                    not conceive how people should admire the <hi rend="italic">Tartuffe</hi> and
                    the <hi rend="italic">Femmes·Savantes.</hi> In other respects his history
                    presents no remarkable event. Married in 1721, he lost his wife two years
                    afterwards; and his only daughter having embraced a religious life, he thus
                    found himself freed from all family ties, and at liberty to follow the bent of
                    his own inclinations. In fact, it is the same with his life as with his genius;
                    it is altogether composed of little traits, a few of which will serve better to
                    give an idea of his character than the most elaborate general description.</p>
                <p>Finding himself one day in a circle where some persons were discussing the nature
                    of the soul, he had the good sense to admit that this question was beyond his
                    comprehension. In this case, said one of the interlocutors, I must go in quest
                    of Μ. Fontenelle. “You may spare yourself the trouble,” replied Marivaux;
                    “Fontenelle has too much sense to know more of the subject than I do.”
                    Notwithstanding the extreme sensitiveness of his self-love, he rarely replied to
                    the criticisms which were made on his productions. “I love my own peace above
                    everything,” said he; “and I do not wish to disturb that of others.” Living in
                    the world at a period when Pyrrhonism in matters of religion was the fashion, he
                    combated, without asperity, but with laudable zeal, that truly deplorable mania.
                    “Ah, my God,” said he on one occasion to a freethinker, who was otherwise an
                    honest man, “take not from poor humanity that consolation which Providence has
                    reserved for it. You may do what you will to cast off all thoughts of the other
                    world; you will be saved in spite of yourself.” On this subject we may also cite
                    his reply to Lord Bolingbroke, <pb break="no" facs="nls:194203085"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0714-3085-0251"/>who, credulous on many points, affected to call in
                    question the truths of religion. “If you do not believe, my Lord, it is
                    certainly not from want of faith.” Marivaux had only a small income, yet he
                    found means to make a regular allowance to a young orphan, whom he had withdrawn
                    from the stage in order to place her in a religious house. Towards the close of
                    his life, when he began to feel the approach of want, he accepted for himself a
                    pension from his friend Helvetius, who had the generosity never to assume the
                    character of a benefactor. This trait recalls another which does no less honour
                    to the men of letters. Marivaux was sick, and his friend Fontenelle, fearing
                    that he wanted money, lost no time in carrying to him an hundred louis, of which
                    he begged his acceptance. “I hold them as received,” replied Marivaux; “I have
                    made use of them, and I restore them to you with all the gratitude which such a
                    service demands.” If Marivaux had some defects of character; if, for example, he
                    was not altogether insensible to jealousy, nor a stranger to the spirit of
                    coterie, and if the efforts that he made to appear modest proved insufficient to
                    disguise the susceptibility of his self-love; he was also distinguished for
                    magnanimous disinterestedness and severe probity. He died at Paris, on the 12th
                    of February 1763, at the age of seventy-five. He had been unanimously admitted a
                    member of the French Academy in 1743; and it is not indifferent to remark that
                    he had Voltaire as a competitor. .</p>
                <p>The number of his works is so considerable that we shall only notice the more
                    interesting and important of them. To the <hi rend="italic">Théâtre-Italien</hi>
                    he contributed, L’Amour et la Vérité, 1720; Arlequin poli par Amour, 1720; La
                    Surprise de l’Amour, 1722; La Double Inconstance, 1723; Le Prince travesti,
                    1724; L’Ile des Esclaves, 1725; L’Hérétier de Village, 1725; Le Triomphe de
                    Plutus, 1728; ,La Nouvelle Colonie, ou la Ligue des Femmes, 1729; Jeux de
                    l’Amour et du Hazard, 1730; Le Triomphe de l’Amour, 1732; L’Ecole des Mères,
                    1732; L’Heureux Stratagème, 1732; La Méprise, 1734; La Mère Confidante, 1735;
                    Les Fausses Confidences, 1736; LaJoie imprévue, 1738; Les Sincères, 1739; and
                    L’Epreuve, 1740. The dramatic works of Marivaux originally represented at the
                    <hi rend="italic">Théâtre-Français</hi> are somewhat less numerous. They consist
                    of Annibal, a tragedy, 1720; Le Denouement imprévue, a comedy, 1724; L’Ile de la
                    Raison, ou les Petits Hommes, derived from the romance of Gulliver, 1727; La
                    Surprise de l’Amour, 1727; La Réunion des Amours, 1731; Les Serments indiscrets,
                    1732; Le Petit-Maitre corrigé, 1734; Le Legs, 1736; La Dispute, 1744; and Le
                    Préjugé, 1746. The dramatic pieces of Marivaux were collected and published in
                    seven vols. 12mo, and of this collection there have been several editions. His
                    romances are in general more esteemed than his plays, although now-a-days they
                    are perhaps even less read. They consist of <hi rend="italic">Don</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Quichotte moderne; Effets Surprenants de la Sympathie; La Vie de
                    Marianne; Le Paysan Parvenu;</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Le Philosophe indigent.
                    Le Spectateur Français</hi> was a species of critical and moral journal in
                    imitation of the English Spectator, but in which the delineations are presented,
                    so to speak, in half tint. His works have been collected and published in
                    twelvevols. Paris, 1781, in 8vo. <hi rend="smallcaps">(a.)</hi></p>
