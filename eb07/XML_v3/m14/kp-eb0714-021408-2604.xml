                    Spain, being the southernmost division of New Castille. It produces wheat and
                    barley, but in quantities insufficient to feed its inhabitants. Wine is its most
                    abundant production, with which it principally supplies Madrid. The wines are of
                    both colours, and of various qualities: some of them, in colour, strength, and
                    flavour, are similar to the wines of Burgundy; but as they seldom or never have
                    any casks or coopers near the vineyards, and the wine is conveyed in bottles
                    made of the skins of goats, its good qualities become <pb break="no" facs="nls:194202617" xml:id="kp-eb0714-2617-0215"/>deteriorated at
                    the moment of its production. Some silk is produced in .this province, and in
                    various parts the plantations of mulberry trees are extensive. The other
                    vegetable productions which create commerce are saffron, barilla, and kelp. They
                    breed a considerable number of mules, which are sent for sale to Portugal and
                    the intermediate places. The whole district, however, is very poor, and the
                    inhabitants generally are in a state of great distress, which may be attributed
                    in a considerable degree to the want of water; for though the river Guadiana
                    runs through it, and by its streams fructifies the borders, yet the influence of
                    that river is of too little extent to benefit any but its immediate vicinity.
                    The capital, Ciudad Real, is benefited by the Guadiana more than the whole
                    province besides. The extent of this division of New Castille is 631 square
                    leagues, and the population 205,548, or 326 to each square league, being, with
                    the exception of Cuença, the most thinly peopled of any part of Spain.</p><p>Although La Mancha is destitute both of agricultural and manufacturing wealth,
                    yet the two extremities of the province are favoured with considerable mineral
                    riches. On the eastern extremity, near the source of the river Munda, is a rich
                    mine of calamine, and in its vicinity is a royal manufactory of tin plates. On
                    the western side are the celebrated quicksilver mines of Almadin, whose valuable
                    product is of the greatest importance to the silver mines of Mexico where it is
                    conveyed, and is indispensable in the extraction of silver by the process of
                    amalgamation. The only towns in La Mancha, besides the capital, Ciudad Real, are
                    Alcazar de St Juan, Consuegra, Infantes, and Almago. This province has derived
                    considerable notoriety throughout Europe, from having been the theatre of the
                    imaginary exploits of the hero of Spanish fiction, Don Quixote. It is bounded on
                    the north by Toledo, on the east by Cuença and Murcia, on the south by Murcia,
                    and on the west by Estremadura.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
