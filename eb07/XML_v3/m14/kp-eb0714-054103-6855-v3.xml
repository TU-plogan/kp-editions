                    modulation, that it forms a sentiment agreeable to the ear. Vocal melody is
                    called <hi rend="italic">singing;</hi> and that which is performed upon
                    instruments has been termed <hi rend="italic">symphonic melody.</hi></p>
                <p>The idea of rhythmus necessarily enters into that of melody. An air is not an air
                    but in proportion as the laws of measure and quantity are observed. The same
                    succession of sounds is susceptible of as many different characters, as many
                    different kinds of melody, as the various ways by which its emphatic notes, and
                    the quantities of those which intervene, may be diversified; and the change in
                    duration ⅛&gt;fthe notes alone, may disguise that very succession in such a
                    manner that it cannot be known. Thus, melody in itself is nothing; it is the
                    rhythmus or measure which determines it, and there can be no air without time.
                    If then we abstract measure from both, we cannot compare melody with harmony;
                    for to the former it is essential, but not at all to the latter.</p>
                <p>Melody, according to the manner in which it is considered, has a relation to two
                    different principles. When regarded only as agreeable to the proportions of
                    sound and the rules of modulation, it has its principle in harmony; since it is
                    an harmonical analysis, which exhibits the different gradations of the scale,
                    the chords peculiar to each mode, and the laws of modulation, which are the sole
                    elements that compose an air. According to this principle, the whole power of
                    melody is limited to that of pleasing the ear by agreeable sounds, as the eye
                    may be pleased by an agreeable assemblage of suitable colours. But when
                    considered as an imitative art, by which we may affect the mind with various
                    images, excite different emotions in the heart, inflame or soothe the passions,
                    and produce different effects upon our moral faculties, which cannot be produced
                    by the influence of external sense alone, we must explore another principle for
                    melody; for in our whole internal frame there appears to be no power upon which
                    either harmony alone, or its necessary results, can seize, to affect us in such
                    a manner.</p>
                <p>What, then, is the second principle? It is as much founded on nature as the
                    first; but, in order to discover its foundation in nature, it will require a
                    more accurate though simple observation, and a more exquisite degree of
                    sensibility in the observer. This principle is the same which varies the tone of
                    the voice, when we speak, according as we are interested in what we say, and
                    according to the different emotions which we feel in expressing it. It is the
                    accent of languages which determines the melody of every nation; it is the
                    accent which leads ns to employ the emphasis of speaking whilst we sing, and to
                    speak with more or less energy according as the language which we use is more or
                    less accented. That language the accents of which are the most sensible, ought
                    to produce the most passionate and lively melody; that which has little
                    accentuation, or none at all, can only produce a cold and languid melody,
                    without character and without expression. These are the true principles. In
                    proportion as we depart from them, when we speak of the power of music upon the
                    human heart, we shall become unintelligible to ourselves and others; our words
                    will be without meaning.</p>
                <p>If music does not impress the soul with images except by melody, if it thence
                    obtains its whole power, it must follow, that all musical sounds which are not
                    pleasing by themselves alone, however agreeable to harmony they maybe, do not
                    form an imitative music; and, being incapable, even with the most beautiful
                    chords, either of presenting the images of things, or exciting the finer
                    feelings, very soon cloy the ear, and leave always the heart in cold
                    indifference. It follows likewise, that notwithstanding the parts which harmony
                    has introduced, and which the actual taste of music so wantonly abuses, wherever
                    two different melodies are heard at the same time, they counteract each other,
                    and destroy the effects of both, however beautiful each may be when performed
                    alone. From this it may be judged with what degree of taste the French composers
                    have introduced into their operas the miserable practice of accompanying one air
                    with another, as well in singing, as in instrumental performances.</p>
                <p>But the causes by which national melody is diversified and characterized, are
                    more profound and permanent than the mere accentuation of language. This indeed
                    may have great influence in determining the nature of the rhythm, and the place
                    of emphatic notes, but very little in regulating the nature of the emphasis and
                    expression themselves. If Rousseau’s principle be true in its full extent, it
                    must of necessity be acknowledged, that an air which was never set or intended
                    for words, however melodious, cannot be imitative; that what is imitative in one
                    nation cannot be so in another; and that, upon his hypothesis, the recitative,
                    which is formed upon the mode of speaking, is the most forcible of all melodies,
                    which is absurd. But his other observations are at once judicious and profound.
                    Though it is impossible to exhibit the beauty and variety of harmony by playing
                    the same melody at the same time upon different keys, admitting those keys to
                    form amongst themselves a perfect chord, which will of consequence preserve all
                    the subsequent notes in the same intervals; yet this perfect harmony would by no
                    means be uniformly pleasing to the ear. We must therefore of necessity introduce
                    less perfect chords to vary and increase the pleasure, and these chords in any
                    complex system of music must of necessity produce dissonances. It then becomes
                    the business of the composer to be careful that these discords may arise as
                    naturally from, and return as naturally to, perfect harmony as possible. These
                    causes must inevitably have the effect of varying the melody of the different
                    parts; but still, amidst all these difficulties, the artist ought to be zealous
                    in preserving the melody of each as homogeneous with others as possible, that
                    the result of the whole may be in some measure uniform. Otherwise, by
                    counteracting each other, the parts will reciprocally destroy their effects.</p>
