                <p><label type="entry">MEDINA</label>, a city of Arabia, and one of the holy cities
                    of the Mahommedans, celebrated for affording refuge to Ma-hoitimed in his flight
                    from Mekka, for his residence in it, and for his tomb, to which the devout
                    hadjis still resort, although its visitation is not considered as a duty, nor
                    necessary part of the Mahommedan pilgrimage. It is situated on the edge of the
                    great Arabian desert, close to the chain of mountains which traverses that
                    country from north to south, and forms a continuation of the chain of Lebanon.
                    The town is built on the lowest part of the plain, and it is enclosed on three
                    sides with gardens, trees, and walks, leaving only that part of the plain open
                    to the view, which is on the side of the road towards Mekka, where the rocky
                    nature of the ground renders cultivation impossible. It is mentioned by
                    Burckhardt, <hi rend="italic">{Travels in Arabia,</hi> vol. ii. p. 148,) as one
                    of the best built towns which he saw in the cast, ranking in this respect next
                    to Aleppo. The houses consist generally of two stories; they are built of stone,
                    and have flat roofs. The stone being of a dark colour, the streets present
                    rather a gloomy aspect, and are, with some exceptions, very narrow, being often
                    only two or three paces across; a few of the principal are paved with large
                    blocks of stone, a comfort seldom found in the Arabian towns. Medina is divided
                    into the interior town and the suburbs; the interior forming an oval of about
                    2800 paces in total circuit, ending in a point. The castle is built at the
                    point, on a small rocky elevation, and the whole is enclosed by a thick stone
                    wall, between thirty-five and forty feet in height, flanked by about thirty
                    towers, and surrounded by a ditch, formed by the Wahabees, and now in many
                    places filled up. Three fine gates lead into the town, one of them the finest
                    town gate, according to Burckhardt, that he had seen in the east. The principal
                    street of Medina, which is also the broadest, leads from the Cairo gate to the
                    great mosque. This street contains most of the shops. Another considerable
                    street runs from the mosque to the Syrian gate; but many of its houses are in
                    ruins. This contains also a few shops, but none arc found in other parts of the
                    town; and in this respect Medina differs from Mekka, which is one continued
                    market. At pre- £ent, especially since the great pilgrimage was interrupted by
                    the incursions of the Wahabees, the town has a desolate appearance; the houses
                    are suffered to go to decay; the crowd of visitors to whom they were in the
                    habit of letting their apartments having diminished, the owners have no prospect
                    of being reimbursed for any extra expense which they may lay out. Ruined houses,
                    and walls wanting repair, are seen in every part of the town; and Medina, like
                    most eastern towns exhibits buta faint image of its ancient splendour. On the
                    west and south of the town, extend the suburbs, which cover more ground than the
                    town itself. An open space intervenes, narrow on the south side, but widening on
                    the west, before the Cairo gate, where it forms a large public place called
                    Monakh, where the caravans alight, and which is always crowded with camels and
                    Bedouins. Here are erected huts and sheds, in which provisions are sold, and a
                    number of coffee huts which are beset all day with visitors. The side of the
                    suburbs which fronts this place has no wall; but on the outside they are
                    enclosed by a wall of inferior size and strength to the interior town wall. Four
                    gates, or rather wooden doors, none of them of any strength except that leading
                    from the Cairo gate, which is larger and better built than the rest, lead into
                    the suburbs. These consist of large court-yards, with low apartments built round
                    them, on the ground-floor, and separated from each other by gardens and
                    plantations, with the exception of the west side directly opposite the Cairo
                    gate, where the suburb consists of regular and well-built streets, with houses
                    resembling those of the interior of the town. Many of the richer inhabitants
                    have their summer houses in these quarters, where they pass a month in the date
                    harvest. Every garden is enclosed by mud walls, and several narrow by-lanes,
                    just broad enough for a loaded camel to cross the suburbs in every direction.
                    The suburbs are principally inhabited by all the lower classes of the town, by
                    many of the Bedouin Arabs who have become settlers there, and by all who are
                    engaged in agriculture. The town is divided into separate hamlets, called hosh,
                    containing thirty or forty families, who often in times of unsettled government,
                    are engaged in desperate feuds with one another.</p>
                <p>Few large public buildings are found within the precincts of the town. The great
                    mosque, containing the tomb of Mahommed, is the only temple. A fine public
                    school, called Medrese el Hamdye; a similar one near the mosque; a large corn
                    magazine, enclosing a wide yard in the southern quarter of the town; and a bath
                    not far distant from it, built in the year of the hcjira 973 (A.D. 1678,) by
                    Mahommed Pasha <hi rend="subscript"> i</hi> are all the public buildings that
                    were observed by Burckhardt. The want of public buildings, however, in the town
                    is compensated by the numerous pretty private habitations, having small gardens
                    with wells, the water of which is used in irrigation, and fills marble basins,
                    round which in summer time, the owners pass the hours of noon under lofty
                    shades. The castle already mentioned is surrounded by very strong walls, and
                    several high and solid towers. It contains sufficient space for 600 or 800 men;
                    has many arched rooms bomb proof; and would be impregnable against any Arabian
                    force, being built upon a rock, which cannot be undermined. But it would not
                    hold out for any time against European artillery.</p>
                <p>The great ornament of Medina, which nearly raises the sanctity of the city to a
                    level with that of Mekka, is the great mosque containing the tomb of Mahommed,
                    which is situated towards the eastern extremity of the town; it is inferior in
                    its dimensions to the mosque at Mekka, being 165 paces in length, and 130 in
                    breadth. It is built on much the same plan of an open square, surrounded on all
                    sides by covered colonnades of ten, four, and three rows, on the south, west,
                    and north sides, with a small building in the centre of the square. The roof of
                    the colonnade consists of a number of small domes, white-washed on the outside,
                    in the same manner as those of Mekka. The interior walls are also
                    white-washed<pb break="no" facs="nls:194206725" xml:id="kp-eb0714-6725-0531"/>
                    except the southern one, which is cased with slabs of marble up to the top, and
                    has several rows of inscriptions in gilt letters. The floor under the collonades
                    is coarsely paved, excepting in those parts nearest to the tomb of Mahommed,
                    where the pavement is mosaic, forming one of the best specimens of that kind of
                    workmanship to be seen in the East. Large and high windows, with glass panes,
                    the only instance of glass in windows that Burckhardt saw in Arabia, some of
                    them of fine painted glass, admit the light through the southern wall. Near the
                    south-east corner stands Mahommed’s tomb, detached from the walls of the mosque,
                    and enclosed by an iron railing painted green, which is entered by four gates.
                    Within the inclosnre is a curtain carried wholly round it, which is said to
                    cover a square building of black stones, supported by two pillars, in which are
                    the tombs of Mahommed and his two earliest friends and immediate successors,
                    Abou Bekr and Omar. These tombs, as far as Burckhardt could learn, are covered
                    with precious stuffs; and here were deposited all sorts of vessels set with
                    jewels, ear-rings, bracelets, necklaces, and other ornaments, brought as
                    presents from all parts of the empire, by the rich pilgrims as they passed
                    through Medina. The whole formed a collection of considerable value; though it
                    was, no doubt, occasionally pillaged by the pious priests who are appointed to
                    the service of the temple, in the same manner as they stole the golden lamps
                    from the mosque at Mekka. Amongst other curious relics, a copy of the Koran in
                    Cufic characters, which belonged to Othman ibn Affan, was deposited here. When
                    Medina was taken by the Wahabees, their chiefs seized all the golden vessels.
                    Saoud, who penetrated behind the curtain, took everything that was valuable, and
                    amongst other precious articles, the Cufic manuscripts of the Koran, and a
                    brilliant star set in diamonds and pearls which was suspended directly over the
                    prophet’s tomb. Several of the golden vessels were re-purchased by Tous-sonn
                    Pasha, the son of Ali Pasha, when he entered Medina in his war against the
                    Wahabees, and replaced in their original situation. The door between the curtain
                    and the railing is inlaid with various coloured marble in mosaic; and here are
                    suspended glass lamps which are lighted every evening, and remain burning all
                    night. The whole of this inclosure is covered with a fine lofty dome, which the
                    Wahabces determined to destroy; but it was so strong that it resisted all their
                    efforts to destroy it. The dome is surmounted with a globe and crescent both
                    glittering with gold. A wooden partition, about eight feet in height, and richly
                    painted with arabesque, runs from the western side of the railing across the
                    mosque, parallel with the south wall, and separates the holy place called El
                    Rodha, or the garden of paradise, from the common passage. Here, on the carpet,
                    the congregation assembles, this being the favourite spot for prayers. The
                    entrance has a splendid appearance; but, says Burckhardt, it is all tinsel
                    decoration, and has a paltry appearance compared with the catholic churches of
                    Europe. The mosque is entered by four gates; and its service is entrusted to
                    forty or fifty eunuchs, who have, like their brethren in Mekka, large stipends
                    annually remitted from Constantinople. Medina is abundantly supplied with water,
                    though not of a very good quality, by a fine subterraneous canal, carried hither
                    from the village of Koba, about two miles distant; and water is everywhere found
                    by digging to the depth of twenty-five or thirty feet. A supply of water is also
                    derived from a torrent, which flows from south to north, passing across the
                    suburbs. In 1804, Medina surrendered to the Wahabee arms; but was again besieged
                    and taken in 1812, by the Egyptian army of Ali Pasha, under his son, Tonssoun
                    Bey, when a thousand of the inhabitants were massacred in the streets. Yembo is
                    the port of Medina, from which it is distant 160 miles.</p>

                    a high mountain, from whence, owing to the transinceney of the atmosphere, it

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Medina, Sir John,</hi> an eminent painter, was son of Medina
                    de l’Asturias, a Spanish captain, who settled at Brussels, where the subject of
                    this notice was born in 1660. He was instructed in painting by Duchatel, under
                    whose direction he made great progress; and applying himself to the study of
                    Rubens, he made that eminent master his principal model. He painted both
                    historical subjects and portraits, and was held in extraordinary estimation by
                    most of the princes of Germany, who distinguished his merit by several marks of
                    honour. He married young, and came into England in 1686, where he painted
                    portraits for several years with great reputation, exhibiting remarkable freedom
                    of touch, with a delicate management of tints, and producing a strong
                    resemblance to the originals. The Earl of Leven encouraged him to go to
                    Scotland, and procured him employment there to the extent of £500. He went
                    thither, carrying a large number of bodies and postures, to which he afterwards
                    painted heads. He returned to England for a short time, but went back to
                    Scotland, where he died, and was buried in the churchyard of the Greyfriars at
                    Edinburgh, in 1711, aged fifty-two. He painted most of the Scotch nobility.
                    Medina was knighted by the Duke of Quecnsberry, lord high commissioner, and was
                    the last knight made in Scotland before the Union.</p>
