                    concerning which we affirm or deny any thing; or, it is the cause why the

                    the lesser extreme as much as it is exceeded by the greater, in respect of
                    quantity, not of proportion. Thus 9 is a medium between 6 and 12.</p>

                    where the same ratio is preserved between the first and second as between the
                    second and third terms, or that which exceeds in the same ratio or quota of
                    itself, as it is exceeded. Thus 6 is a geometrical medium between <hi

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Medium,</hi> in <hi rend="italic">Philosophy,</hi> that
                    space or region throughout which a body in motion passes to any point. Thus
                    aether is supposed to be the medium through which the heavenly bodies move; air,
                    the medium in which bodies move near our earth; water, the medium in which
                    fishes live and move; and glass is also a medium of light, as it affords it a
                    free passage. That density or consistency in the parts of the medium, by which
                    the motion of bodies in it becomes retarded, is called the <hi rend="italic"
                    >resistance of the medium,</hi> which, together with the force of gravity, is
                    the cause of the cessation of the motion of projectiles. Sir Isaac Newton
                    considers it probable that, besides the particular aerial medium in which we
                    live and breathe, there is another more universal one, which he calls an <hi
                    rend="italic">aethereal medium;</hi> vastly more rare, subtle, elastic, and
                    active, than air, and freely permeating the pores and interstices of all other
                    mediums, and diffusing itself throughout the whole of creation, and by the
                    intervention of which it is that, according to him, most of the great phenomena
                    of nature are produced.</p>
