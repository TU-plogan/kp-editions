                <p><label type="entry">METHODISTS</label>, a numerous religious body both in this
                    country and in America. They are divided into several distinct sects; but from
                    the minute shades by which these arc distinguished, and the extreme obscurity of
                    some of their numbers, it is difficult to furnish a perfectly accurate account
                    of them. We shall describe those which are best known.</p>
                <p>The first in order of time, as well as in point of numbers, is that of <hi
                    rend="italic">Wesleyan Methodists.</hi> This body derives its name from its
                    principal founder, the Rev. John Wesley. Whilst a student at Christ-Church
                    College, Oxford, and engaged in the pursuit of theology, as preparatory to his
                    entering into deacon’s orders, Wesley’s mind had become strongly imbued with
                    that peculiar asceticism which colours the writings of Thomas a Kempis, Fenelon,
                    William Law, and occasionally of Jeremy Taylor, of whose works he had been a
                    diligent and admiring student. On his assuming the sacred office, this tendency
                    was increased rather than diminished; and when, after officiating as curate to
                    his father, who was a clergyman in Lincolnshire, for about two years, he
                    returned to Oxford to resume his duties as a fellow of Lincoln College, it was
                    apparent that it had acquired the complete ascendency over his mind. His
                    condition at this time was distressing. He felt himself burdened under a sense
                    of guilt in the sight of God, and ignorant of the only way in which that burden
                    could be relieved. Sympathy of feeling and unity of opinion led him to enter
                    into an association which had been formed during his absence among a few of his
                    former friends, in whom a similar course of discipline had produced similar
                    effects. Of this society he soon became the leader and most active member,
                    employing the resources of his comprehensive mind for the regulation of their
                    meetings, and setting an example of diligence in the discharge of every office,
                    and of patience in the endurance of every penance, which in their misguided zeal
                    they had instituted among them, in the hope of thereby obtaining the divine
                    favour. The regulations which they had adopted for the guidance of their conduct
                    were unusually severe: they were in the habit of partaking of the sacrament
                    every week; they were abstemious in their diet, and plain in their clothing;
                    they had set hours for reading Thomas a Kempis, with meditation and prayer, and
                    for musing on the Passion; they spent much of their time in visiting the prisons
                    and the hospitals; they observe^ rigidly all the fasts of the English church,
                    besides a constant abstinence on Wednesdays and Fridays; and in several other
                    respects they exhibited the hold which a morbid asceticism had acquired over
                    their minds. By such conduct, while they commanded the respect of a few, they
                    became the object of ridicule and derision to the many, and had to run the usual
                    gantlope of jokes and nicknames which is destined for all, especially at an
                    university, who are audacious enough to be guilty of innovation either in
                    politics or religion. Of the various titles which the wits of the university
                    devised for them, the only one that has adhered to them is that by which they
                    are now distinguished, viz. Methodists. The author of this appellative is said
                    to have been a fellow of Merton College, who, observing the regularity with
                    which they divided their time among their different pursuits, exclaimed, “Here
                    is anew sect of Methodists sprung up;” alluding to the ancient Methodici, or
                    College of Physicians, at Rome, of whom an account is given by Celsus in the
                    preface to his work <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Medicina.</hi> At
                    this time their members amounted to fifteen, most of whose names Wesley has
                    preserved in his journal. Among the rest are those of James Hervey, the author
                    of <pb break="no" facs="nls:194209598" xml:id="kp-eb0714-9598-0752"/>the
                    Meditations; and George Whitefield, for some time the most efficient assistant,
                    and subsequently the most powerful rival, of Wesley.</p>
                <p>The regular formation of this society took place in the year 1729. During the
                    three following years it maintained its ground under the energetic guidance of
                    its head, and increased to the number of twenty-five. In the course of the year
                    1733, however, Wesley being frequently absent from Oxford, his associates began
                    to lose heart, and to shrink from the persecution which continued to assail
                    them; so that, on his return from a visit he had paid to Manchester and other
                    places in that year, he found the members reduced to five. Grieved, but not
                    disheartened, he immediately set himself to repair the loss, but with what
                    success does not appear. His exertions, however, were so great, that, combined
                    with his abstemiousness, they began seriously to affect his health. It is
                    probable that this, together with other circumstances of a private nature,
                    combined with his religious zeal to induce his acceptance of an offer made to
                    him by the trustees of the new colony of Georgia, to go out as one of the
                    chaplains of that settlement. This offer was made about the middle of 1735, and
                    towards the close of that year be left' England, accompanied by his brother
                    Charles and two other of his Oxford associates, in order to enter upon the
                    duties of his office. On his voyage out he became acquainted with David
                    Nitschman, a Moravian bishop, who, with a party of bis followers, was proceeding
                    in the same vessel to join a colony of their brethren already established in the
                    new settlement. From this individual he derived no small advantage in a
                    religious point of view; nor was the insight which he thus obtained into the
                    Moravian institutions and polity without service to him, when, in subsequent
                    years, he had to assume the office of arranging and legislating for a party of
                    his own.</p>
                <p>But Wesley’s connection with the Georgian colony was not of long continuance. It
                    was dissolved in 1737, and, in the month of February of the following year, he
                    arrived in London, a wiser if not a better man than when he had set out. A few
                    months of irregular occupation followed his return; but in September of that
                    year he commenced that course of life in which he persevered till his death, and
                    in the pursuit of which he visited personally the principal places, not only in
                    England, but also in Ireland and in Scotland. The example of his friend
                    Whitefield first induced him to commence field-preaching; a practice which he
                    followed ever afterwards with great success. His brother Charles, who had
                    followed him from America, became a zealous and able coadjutor; and others were
                    speedily added to them. No systematic plan of itinerant preaching seems to have
                    been at first contemplated by them; but their exertions in one place led to
                    their visiting another, and thus a regular course of occasional ministrations
                    was gradually adopted. At first both Wesley and his brother were decidedly
                    opposed to lay-preaching; but the difficulty, or rather the impossibility, of
                    finding individuals who had received orders to supply their rapidly increasing
                    stations, combined with the evidence furnished by one or two remarkable
                    examples, of the possibility of successfully employing individuals who had not
                    been regularly educated for the ministry, in itinerant preaching, led to the
                    ultimate adoption of this as a part of their ecclesiastical machinery. An
                    extensive agency was thus called into operation, by which the Wesleys were
                    enabled to bear in upon the mass of the people throughout the country, and in
                    consequence very widely to diffuse their principles, and augment the number of
                    their adherents. By what steps they advanced it is impossible accurately to
                    detail; but in a very few years they had succeeded in overcoming the persecution
                    by which at first they were everywhere assailed, and in forming societies in all
                    the principal towns and larger villages of England. Over all these Wesley
                    maintained a vigilant watchfulness; and though in general lenient and patient,
                    he yet visited with rigorous discipline those communities or preachers by whom
                    any flagrant departure from the accredited doctrines or practices of the body
                    had been committed. His influence among the societies was maintained partly by
                    frequent visitations, and partly by the power which was concentrated in an
                    annual convention of the preachers, called the Conference, of which he was the
                    moving spring. The first meeting of conference was held in 1744, and this body
                    has regularly held its meetings ever since.</p>
                <p>Before Wesley’s death, Methodism had obtained a considerable footing not only in
                    England and Wales, but in Ireland, America, the West Indies, and to a limited
                    extent also in Scotland. At the time of his death “the number of members in
                    connection with him in Europe, America, and the West India Islands, was
                    80,000."<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Watson’s Life
                    of Wesley, p. 378.</p></note> Since that time this denomination has been making
                    a steadily increasing progress. At the Conference of 1836, the numbers returned
                    were, in Great Britain 293,132; in Ireland 26,434; in the Foreign Missions
                    61,803; in Upper Canada 16,092; under the care of the American Conferences
                    652,528; total 1,049,989. The number of preachers throughout the world is 4273.
                    Foreign missions have been established in various parts of Europe, Asia, Africa,
                    and America, including the West Indian, Polynesian, and Australasian Islands. An
                    important branch of these missions is the schools which are attached to the
                    different stations, and which are conducted by the missionaries themselves, or
                    under their immediate superintendence. The sum raised for these purposes at the
                    close of the year 1835-36 was L.70,996. Is. lid.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">doctrines</hi> taught by Mr Wesley and his preachers may be
                    technically described as those of Evangelical Arminianism. In regard to all the
                    positive doctrines of Christianity, he assented, with a few modifications, to
                    the standards of the reformed churches. He maintained the depravity of human
                    nature; the necessity of an atonement for sin before it can be forgiven; the
                    doctrine of a divine influence to lead men to Christ; justification by faith
                    alone; and the importance of good works, not as the ground of acceptance with
                    God, but as the evidence of faith, and the measure of the final reward. He
                    differed from the system of Calvin chiefly in regard to the extent of the
                    atonement, which he maintained was for all men; to the doctrine of a common
                    grace, which he supposed was given to all, though in various degrees and in
                    different ways;<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See this
                    tenet defended at length in Watson’s Theological Institutes, vol. ii. p.

                    might relinquish his belief, and so perish; and to the notion that Christians
                    might obtain salvation from all sin, or entire sanctification, before death. He
                    also held that repentance, which he defined to be “conviction of sin, producing
                    real desires and sincere resolutions of amendment,” and fruits meet for
                    repentance, preceded faith; and that the believer has not only the testimony of
                    his own consciousness to persuade him that he is justified, but also the direct
                    testimony of the Spirit of God. These opinions are still retained by the
                    Methodist body.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Watson’s

                <p>Of the <hi rend="italic">polity</hi> of Wesleyanism, the fundamental principle
                    is, that all power is centred in the Conference or annual convention of the
                    clergy. From this body all authority emanates, and by them all regulations to be
                    observed throughout the society are devised and appointed. In <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194209611" xml:id="kp-eb0714-9611-0753"/>their name also are levied
                    all the funds that are required for carrying on the operations of the society,
                    of appointing the individuals who are to superintend the different sections into
                    which the denomination is divided, of assigning to each preacher the station he
                    is to occupy, and of suspending or excluding any member of the community, whom a
                    subordinate jurisdiction, entitled a Leader’s Meeting, may have found guilty of
                    certain faults. All their deliberations being carried on with closed doors, the
                    people at large have no check on their decisions, nor any means of controlling
                    their power: the results of their discussions, however, are published, after
                    each meeting, under the title of Minutes. The management of the body is thus
                    vested entirely in an oligarchy of clergymen, self-elected, and all but entirely
                    uncontrolled. The security of this system is perpetuated by the careful
                    gradation of rank which obtains throughout the whole body of functionaries. The
                    supreme power being vested in Conference, the whole field of Methodism is
                    divided into distinct departments, to which is given the name of Circuits. To
                    each of these as many preachers are appointed as its exigencies may require, and
                    at their head is placed one whose experience and reputation, but especially his
                    fidelity to the cause of Conferential supremacy, entitle him to the distinction,
                    and to whom, under the name of Superintendent, the charge of the whole circuit
                    is committed, The appointment of these functionaries is made annually; and no
                    preacher or superintendent can be rc-appointed to the same place for more than
                    three years successively. Besides these, each circuit has its local preachers,
                    who are generally persons engagedin secular business, but who, having by zeal
                    and ability obtained for themselves the approbation of a Local Preacher’s
                    Meeting, are permitted by the superintendent to preach, throughout the vicinity
                    of the place where they reside, in private houses and small country chapels. Out
                    of the number of these the regular preachers are generally chosen, as they have
                    been themselves for the most part chosen from amongst the Classleaders or
                    superintendents of the portions into which each congregation is divided. These
                    classes consist generally of twelve members, and it is the duty of the leader to
                    visit, instruct, and exhort them, as well as to collect their contributions to
                    the funds of the society, and to watch over the correctness of their general
                    conduct. At the meetings of these classes the members state their religious
                    experience, and confess their faults to one another. This, however, is more
                    particularly the object of another subdivision (connection with which, however,
                    is not deemed imperative) called Bands: the members of these are all of one
                    condition in life; that is, the married males meet in one Band, the married
                    females in another, and so on. In these Bands, which are also under the charge
                    of Leaders, there is, in consequence of this arrangement, more freedom of
                    communication, especially in regard to besetting sins and peculiar temptations.
                    Another portion of the members are engaged in the duties of Sunday-school
                    teachers, and are also under the superintendence of a leader. Over all these
                    different agencies’jtis the duty of the circuit superintendent to watch; and to
                    all of them his word is law. An appeal, indeed, lies from his decisions to
                    Conference, but experience has so abundantly shown the uselessness of all such
                    appeals, except in cases of the most glaring nature, that they are hardly ever
                    made.</p>
                <p>Whatever objection may be brought against the complication of the machinery of
                    Methodism as opposed to the simplicity of the New Testament, this should not
                    prevent our doing justice to Wesley and his followers, by admitting the
                    importance of the services which they have rendered to the cause of religion,
                    education, and morality, through out the empire. By no denomination of
                    Christians, perhaps, have greater benefits been conferred, in these respects, on
                    the nation at large, than by the Wesleyans. Impelled by an undaunted zeal, they
                    have visited the most abandoned, and instructed the most ignorant, of the
                    population. Wherever they have gone they have carried the elements of a
                    renovated state of society with them, in the doctrines they have taught and the
                    duties they have inculcated. In many parts of England, where, before they
                    commenced their labours, the truths of Christianity were as little known as they
                    are in heathen countries,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>"He (Wesley) found thousands of his countrymen, though nominally Christians,
                    yet as ignorant of true Christianity as infidels or neatnens. (Bishop
                    Coplestone, as quoted in Watson’s Life of Wesley, p. 313.)</p></note> they have
                    succeeded in raising large and active communities, amongst which the effects of
                    Christian teaching are apparent, in the good conduct, comfortable circumstances,
                    and increasing respectability of those by whom they are composed. Their zeal has
                    also operated beneficially on other denominations, and has called forth energies
                    that, but for the stimulus of their example, might have continued to lie
                    dormant. In short, it must be confessed, that England and America owe an immense
                    debt of gratitude to the illustrious founder of this powerful society; and that
                    the loss of Methodism would be a loss to the world.</p>
                <p>Next in order to the Wesleyan Methodists are the <hi rend="italic">Calvinistic
                    Methodists.</hi> Under this term are included three distinct connections, all of
                    which, however, either arose from, or were greatly strengthened by, the
                    exertions of Whitefield, the original companion of Wesley; and from that
                    circumstance they are sometimes ranked under the name of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Whitefieldians.</hi> Whitefield separated from Wesley shortly after the time
                    when the latter commenced his regular labours as a preacher, upon his return
                    from America. The cause of their separation was their having espoused opposite
                    sides of the Arminian and Calvinistic controversy; Wesley ranking himself with
                    the adherents of the former class of opinions, and Whitefield with those of the
                    latter. This led to their carrying on their itinerant labours independently of
                    each other, though without any attempt on either side to interrupt the peace or
                    the usefulness of the other. Whilst Wesley, however, was skilfully availing
                    himself of his success for the purpose of forming a sect, Whitefield, with less
                    worldly wisdom, contented himself with merely preaching from place to place, and
                    associating himself with any who would acknowledge him as a minister of Christ.
                    At several places, indeed, where he had attracted much attention by his powerful
                    and (to judge from the effects) unparalleled eloquence, he erected chapels, or
                    tabernacles as he called them; but these he invariably left to the care of any
                    evangelical clergymen, whether in the establishment or among the dissenters,
                    whom he saw raised up to occupy them. Since his death, the members of these
                    congregations have been nominally, and only nominally, classed together as a
                    distinct body, under the name of the <hi rend="italic">Tabernacle
                    Connection.</hi> In some of these congregations the service is conducted
                    according to the ritual of the church of England, whilst in others the order of
                    worship is more in accordance with that observed by the Independents. They all,
                    however, agree in this, that whether there is a settled minister in the place or
                    not, a succession of supplies from the country is kept up throughout the year,
                    each minister being engaged for a month or six weeks at a time. Where there is
                    no settled pastor, the “supply” for the time being discharges the whole duty of
                    the place; where there is a settled pastor, the duties are divided between them.
                    The members of this connection have of late years been gradually verging towards
                    the Independents, and it is probable that in a short time both bodies will
                    coalesce.</p>
                <p>Amongst the most zealous and devoted of Mr White-field<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194209624" xml:id="kp-eb0714-9624-0754"/>’s adherents was
                    Selina,’countess of Huntingdon, in whose family he at one time officiated as
                    chaplain. After the death of her husband she employed her ample resources in the
                    erection of chapels in different parts of the country, to the occupation of
                    which she invited at first none but regularly ordained clergymen of the
                    Episcopal Church. Many such accepted her invitation, and laboured in the places
                    she had erected; but finding the supply from this source not adequate to the
                    demand, she founded a college at Trevecca, in South Wales, for the education of
                    pious young men of talent for the university. By these means a distinct party
                    was formed, which assumed her name, and is known as <hi rend="italic">Lady
                    Huntingdon’s Connection.</hi> They have about sixty congregations, in all of
                    which the service is conducted strictly according to the ritual of the
                    established church. The college has been removed, since the death of its
                    foundress, to Cheshunt in FI ertford shire, where it is now in a flourishing
                    state.</p>
                <p>Another body, which, though not founded by Mr Whitefield, was much strengthened
                    through his means, is that denominated the <hi rend="italic">Welsh Calvinistic
                    Methodists.</hi> The original founder of this body was Mr Howel Harris, of
                    Tre-vccca. This gentleman had intended to take orders in the church of England,
                    but was turned from his purpose by what he witnessed amongst the students at
                    Oxford, who seemed to him wholly given to folly and impiety. On his return home
                    he began to preach to his neighbours and in the surrounding parishes. This took
                    place in 1735, and excited no small attention; numbers collected in every place
                    where he preached, to hear him; and, ultimately, societies were formed, which
                    were placed under the superintendence of experienced individuals. The preaching
                    of Mr Harris was not only successful among the people at large, but was also
                    followed by several clergymen, who at length gave up their livings, and united
                    themselves with him. To this party Mr Whitefield lent the aid of his powerful
                    eloquence, and in return received from it many of his most zealous preachers. It
                    was not, however, till the year 1785, when it was joined by the Rev. Thomas
                    Charles of Bala, that, owing mainly to the exertions of that individual, it was
                    organized into a regular body. Since that time its numbers and resources have
                    been steadily increasing, both in North and South Wales. It is said that there
                    is hardly a village in the principality where one of its chapels is not to be
                    found. The doctrines held by its members are those of high or hyper-calvinism.
                    Their form of church government inclines to the presbyterian, though many
                    practices are encouraged among them that presby-terians in general would
                    condemn, such as the utterance of exclamations of desire or exultation on the
                    part of the audience during public prayer, jumping and throwing themselves into
                    violent postures under the excitement produced by the preacher’s address, and
                    others of a similar kind. They admit also of lay-preaching, and some of their
                    most popular orators are of this class. The sermons of their preachers are
                    generally delivered in a slow recitative, interrupted by quick and startling
                    appeals and interrogations. Even upon those who arc ignorant of the language in
                    which the address is uttered, this peculiar mode of delivery is productive of a
                    powerful sensation. It is not surprising, therefore, that on those by whom the
                    whole is understood, and who can enter fully into the highly figurative and
                    impassioned style of sentiment in which the Welsh preachers generally indulge,
                    the most singular effects should be produced. It is no unusual thing to see
                    whole congregations convulsed, and thrown into the most violent agitation,
                    almost instantaneously, by some well-managed appeal to their feelings on the
                    part of the preacher; and this once accomplished, it is not very difficult to
                    keep up the excitement, until both speaker and hearers are ready to sink to the
                    ground from pure exhaustion. The prevalence of this habit cannot but be
                    regretted; but it is characteristic of the people, and though it is doubtless
                    productive of much that is injurious to true piety, it cannot be questioned,
                    that, upon the whole, the labours of these preachers have told most
                    beneficially, as well as extensively, upon the religious and moral improvement
                    of their countrymen.</p>
                <p>The other classes of Methodists have been produced by secessions from the great
                    body of Wesleyan Methodists. The reason assigned for these secessions has been
                    nearly the same for all, viz. thearbitrary and unconstitutional power assumed by
                    the Conference. The only exception to this is in the case of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Primitive Methodists,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Panters,</hi>
                    whose ground of secession was, that the true spirit of Methodism was no longer
                    kept up in the body. By this they meant that too much attention was paid to
                    order and decorum in the conduct of public worship; and that sufficient zeal was
                    not manifested in obtruding religion upon the minds of the people by
                    street-services, field-preaching, &amp;c. They are fond of doing nothing in a
                    corner, and, accordingly, often parade the streets, singing hymns and inviting
                    the populace to their places of worship. They also admit of females being
                    allowed to preach. The number of their chapels is about 400; that of their
                    preachers 2700; and that of their members 33,720.</p>
                <p>The first secession upon the ground of the unscriptural power exercised by the
                    Conference (and the “earliest in point of time of any of the secessions), was
                    made by a party in 1797, very soon after Mr Wesley’s death. At the Conference
                    held at Leeds that year, delegates appeared from many of the societies
                    throughout the country, who were instructed to request that the people might
                    have a voice in the formation of their own laws, the choice of their own
                    officers, and the distribution of their own property. These reasonable demands
                    having been refused, the petitioners agreed to secede from the Conference
                    connection, and to form themselves into a distinct party, upon a more liberal
                    basis. The person who took the largest share in prompting and providing for this
                    step was Mr Alexander Kilham, and from him the body thus formed have taken the
                    name of <hi rend="italic">Killiamites.</hi> They also style themselves the <hi
                    rend="italic">New Connection Methodists.</hi> Their doctrinal views arc those of
                    Wesley, but in their polity they seem to have followed in a good measure the
                    forms of presbyterianism as exhibited in Scotland. The people choose their
                    officers, and appear by representatives at all the synodical meetings of the
                    denomination. This party is not very numerous. In 1829 they had 162 chapels,
                    fifty-nine circuits, 492 local preachers, and about 11,7 ’ 80 members. .</p>
                <p>Of late there have been several considerable secessions from the general body of
                    the Wesleyans. At least <hi rend="italic">four</hi> distinct parties have been
                    formed within a few years. These are the <hi rend="italic">Bryanites,</hi> so
                    called from a Mr Bryan, their founder; the <hi rend="italic">Independent
                    Methodists</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Wesleyan
                    Protestant Methodists;</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Warnendes,</hi> or
                    followers of Dr Warren. A proposal has, it seems, been made to unite these
                    parties under some common name, all having seceded on nearly the same
                    fundamental grounds, and all holding the same leading principles.</p>
