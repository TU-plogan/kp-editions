                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">MASINISSA</label>, a king <hi rend="italic">of</hi> the
                    Massyli, a tribe of the Nu∙ midians, in Africa, was son of Gala, and born about
                    239 B. c. He died 149 <hi rend="smallcaps">b. c.</hi> The earlier part of his
                    life seems to have been spent in Carthage, where he attracted so much of the
                    attention of Asdrubal, the son of Gisgo, that he offered to him his daughter in
                    marriage. His previous admiration of the young lady, who was called Sophonisba,
                    made him willingly accept of the proposal; but before the marriage was
                    consummated, he accompanied Asdrubal into Spain, where the Carthaginians were
                    then carrying on war against the Romans, <hi rend="smallcaps">b. c.</hi> 212,
                    towards the beginning of the second Punic war. (Liv. xxv. 34; Appian. <hi
                    rend="italic">Pun.</hi> 10, 37; <hi rend="italic">Hisp.</hi> 25, 27.) Whilst
                    Asdrubal and his intended son-in-law were employed in opposing Scipio, the
                    Carthaginians were alarmed by the declaration of Syphax, a powerful prince of
                    Numidia, that unless Sophonisba, of whom he had become enamoured, were given him
                    in marriage, he would join the Romans in an attack on Carthage. To this demand
                    of Syphax the Carthaginians agreed without the knowledge of Asdrubal, and to the
                    great mortification of Masinissa when he was made acquainted with it. It induced
                    him to enter into a private alliance with the Homans, towards whom he felt well
                    inclined from their kindness in releasing from captivity his nephew Missiva, <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b. c.</hi> 207. Asdrubal having become apprised of his
                    intrigues with the Romans, determined to put him to death privately; but
                    Masinissa, discovering his intentions, escaped to Africa, where he found his
                    father dead, and part of his kingdom possessed by Syphax. Here he collected a
                    considerable army, and employed himself in bringing it into a proper state of
                    discipline. The Carthaginians and Syphax, believing that the army was intended
                    to be employed against them, determined to anticipate him in the attack, and
                    marched with a large army into his kingdom, B. c. 204. Syphax defeated him, and
                    compelled him to lie concealed for a time. He collected another army on <pb

                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi>. the frontiers of his kingdom, and was again obliged
                    to ' fly. Upon the arrival of Scipio in Africa, <hi rend="smallcaps">b. c.</hi>
                    203, Masinissa hastened to join him with all the troops he could collect, and
                    contributed in a great measure to the victory gained over Asdrubal and Syphax.
                    He proceeded in pursuit of Syphax, and took him prisoner. Having got possession
                    of Cirta, the capital of Syphax, he found there Sophonisba, who persuaded him
                    that her marriage with Syphax had been much against her inclinations. He married
                    her, but was soon obliged to dissolve this union, as Scipio highly disapproved
                    of his being united to a woman who was supposed to bear an implacable hatred to
                    the Romans. Masinissa found himself obliged to yield, and furnishing Sophonisba
                    with poison, advised her to employ it, that she might escape from the hands of
                    the Romans. The honours which he received from the Romans, and the hope he
                    entertained of becoming sole king of Numidia, made him bear the loss of
                    Sophonisba with more equanimity. Masinissa contributed much to the victory which
                    Scipio gained over Hannibal at Zama, <hi rend="smallcaps">b. c.</hi> 202, and
                    was soon afterwards re-instated in the possession of his hereditary dominions,
                    to which was added the kingdom of Syphax. He and his successors were from that
                    time honoured with the title of kings of Numidia. (Appian. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pun.</hi> 10-70; Liv. xxix. XXX.) From this time he was for many years employed
                    in promoting peaceful habits amongst his people, and in changing their erratic
                    propensities. He was never on very amicable terms with the Carthaginians, and we
                    find him at war, <hi rend="smallcaps">b. c.</hi> 193, when commissioners were
                    sent from Rome to settle the dispute; but they seem to have left it undecided.
                    (Liv. xxxiv. 62.) He was again at war, B. c. 182, when the Romans became
                    mediators between the contending parties. (40,17,34.) Towards the end of his
                    life, B. c. 150, he was engaged in war with the Carthaginians, whom he conquered
                    in several battles; and when the Romans commenced the third Punic war, he joined
                    them with all his forces. He died the same year, B. c. 149, and left three sons,
                    Micipsa, who succeeded him, Gulussa, and Manastabal. (Appian. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pun.</hi> 71, 105.)</p>
