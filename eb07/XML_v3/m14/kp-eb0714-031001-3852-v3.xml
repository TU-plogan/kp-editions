                    distinguished dramatic writer, was born at Salisbury in 1584, and educated at
                    Wilton, the scat of the Earl of Pembroke, to whose family his father was
                    attached. In May 1602, he became a commoner of Alban Hall, Oxford, where he
                    studied for some time; but he left the university abruptly, without taking a
                    degree, probably in consequence of having exchanged the Protestant for the
                    Catholic religion. “A close and repeated perusal of Massinger’s works,” says Mr
                    Gifford, “has convinced me that he was a Catholic.” But whatever might be the
                    cause, the period of his misfortunes commenced with his arrival in London, where
                    he was driven by his necessities to dedicate himself to the services of the
                    stage. This expedient, though not the most prudent, nor indeed the most
                    encouraging to a young adventurer, was not altogether hopeless. Men who will
                    ever be considered as the pride and boast of their country, Shakspeare, Jonson,
                    and Fletcher, were solely, or in a considerable degree, dependent upon it; nor
                    were there wanting others of an inferior rank, such as Rowley, Middleton, Field,
                    Decker, Shirley, and Ford, writers to whom Massinger, without any impeachment of
                    his modesty, might consider himself as fully equal, who subsisted on the
                    emoluments derived from dramatic writing. Little is known of him, however, from
                    the year 1606, the period of his first appearance in London, until 1622, when
                    his <hi rend="italic">Virgin Martyr,</hi> the first of his printed works, was
                    given to the public. This long interval of sixteen years Mr Gifford endeavours
                    to account for, by supposing that at first his modesty deterred him from
                    attempting to write alone, and that he lent his assistance to others of a more
                    confirmed reputation, w ho could depend upon a ready vent for their joint
                    productions. He afterwards produced in succession a variety of plays, of which
                    ten or twelve have been lost, and eighteen preserved. Massinger died on the 17th
                    of March 1640. He went to bed in good health, and was found dead in the morning,
                    in his own house on the Bankside. He was buried in the churchyard of St
                    Saviour’s; but it does not appear that a stone, or inscription of any kind,
                    marked the spot where his dust was deposited; and even the memorial of his
                    mortality is given with a pathetic brevity, which accords but too well with the
                    obscure and humble passages of his life. Of his private life so little is known
                    that all his editor has presumed to give is merely the history of the successive
                    appearance of his works, for which the reader is referred to Mr Gifford’s <hi rend="italic">Introduction.</hi> But though we are ignorant of every
                    circumstance respecting Massinger, except that he lived, wrote, and died, we may
                    yet form to ourselves some conception of his personal character from the
                    incidental hints which are scattered throughout lis works. In what light he was
                    regarded, may be collected from the recommendatory poems prefixed to his several
                    plays, in which his panegyrists express an attachment, apparently derived not so
                    much from his talents as his virtues. All the writers of his life unite in
                    representing him as a man of singular modesty, gentleness, candour, and
                    affability; nor does it appear that he ever made or found an enemy. He speaks,
                    indeed, of opponents on the stage; but the contention of rival candidates for
                    popular favour must not be confounded with personal hostility. Yet,
                    notwithstanding all this, he appears to have maintained a constant struggle with
                    adversity; since not only the stage, from which his natural reserve seems to
                    have prevented him from deriving the usual advantages, but even the bounty of
                    his particular friends, on which he chiefly relied, left him in a state of
                    absolute dependence. Jonson, Fletcher, Shirley, and others not superior to him
                    in abilities, had their periods of good fortune, their bright as well as their
                    stormy hours; but Massinger seems to have enjoyed no gleam of sunshine. His life
                    was all one wintry day, and shadows, clouds, and darkness rested on it. Davies
                    finds a servility in his dedications which no one else has been able to
                    discover. They are principally characterized by gratitude and humility, without
                    a single trait of that gross and servile adulation which distinguishes and
                    disgraces the addresses of some of his contemporaries. Poverty made him no
                    flatterer, and, what is still more rare, no maligner, of the great; nor is there
                    one symptom of envy manifested in any part of his compositions. His patriotism
                    is unimpeached, and his morality is superior to that of his contemporaries. His
                    loyalty is combined with just and rational ideas of political freedom; and guilt
                    of every kind is usually left to the punishment<pb break="no" facs="nls:194203865" xml:id="kp-eb0714-3865-0311"/> of divine
                    justice. Nor is the rectitude of his mind less apparent in the uniform respect
                    with which he treats religion and its ministers. No priests are introduced by
                    him, to set on some quantity of barren spectators to laugh at their licentious
                    follies; the sacred name is not lightly invoked nor daringly sported with; nor
                    is Scripture profaned by blasphemous distortions or buffoon allusions put into
                    the mouths of fools and women. Compared with the other dramatic writers of his
                    age, Massinger appears more natural in his characters, and more poetical in his
                    diction, than Jonson or Cartwright, more elevated and nervous than Fletcher, the
                    only writers who can be supposed to contest his pre-eminence. It must indeed be
                    confessed, that in comedy he falls considerably below Shakspeare. His wit is
                    less brilliant, and his ridicule less delicate and various; but, in his Great
                    Duke of Florence, he exhibits a specimen of elegant comedy, of which there is no
                    archetype in the productions of his great predecessor. In tragedy he is rather
                    eloquent than pathetic. If not a master of the passions, he is a powerful ruler
                    of the understanding; with the heavy disadvantage of succeeding Shakspeare,
                    there is still much original beauty in his works; and the most extensive
                    acquaintance with poetry will hardly diminish the pleasure which they afford on
                    perusal. His occasional grossness is to be considered as the vice of the age
                    rather than as the fault of the writer. Of the editions of Dell in 1761 and
                    Davies in 1779 it is unnecessary to say any thing, much less to point out their
                    numerous faults and imperfections. They have been completely superseded by that
                    of Mr Gifford, which has revived the fame of Massinger, and fulfilled the most
                    sanguine expectations of the lovers of our dramatic literature. This, which is
                    perhaps the most correct edition of any of our ancient poets, was published in
                    1805, in four vols. 8vo, and reprinted in 1813. It displays a genuine spirit of
                    research, united with great acuteness and critical ability, in detecting and
                    rectifying the mistakes of former editors; and it admirably explains the
                    customs, and manners, and language which obtained at the time when Massinger
                    lived and wrote. <hi rend="smallcaps">(a.)</hi></p></div></body></text></TEI>
