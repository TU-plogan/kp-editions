                <p><label type="entry">KONIGSBERG</label>, a city of Prussia, on the river Rorike,
                    in the circle of that name, and in the Frankfort division of the province of
                    Brandenburg. It is walled, and contains 458 houses, with 4178 inhabitants,
                    employed in making cloth and hosiery, and in distilleries and breweries.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Königsberg.</hi> In the recent division that has been made
                    of those parts of the dominion of Prussia that are out of Germany, East Prussia
                    has been formed into two governments, viz. Königsberg and Gumbinnen. The former
                    of these is composed of the territory formerly called East Prussia, and a small
                    part of Lithuania. It is bounded on the north by Russia, on the east by the
                    province of Gumbinnen, on the south by Poland, and on the west by the Baltic Sea
                    and the province of Dantzic. Its extent is 8910 square mdes. It contains
                    forty-eight cities or places formerly waded, thirteen market-towns, 3717
                    villages, and 76,949 houses. The inhabitants in 1826 were 683,925, of whom about
                    450,000 were Protestants, 110 Catholics, and the rest consisted of Jews,
                    Moravians, and Menonites. It is generally a level country, presenting few
                    elevations, and these scarcely higher than 200 feet above the level of the sea.
                    It is a district in which are to be seen numerous lakes, some of great extent.
                    The largest of these, the Kurische-Haff, extends over 620 square miles; and the
                    next in size, the Frische-Haff, is upwards of 500 miles. Besides these, there
                    are others of various extent, amounting in number to near five hundred. The soil
                    is generally sandy, but moderately productive, and yields good crops of rye and
                    barley, and a small proportion of wheat. Its breeds of sheep and cows have
                    nothing remarkable, either for their number or their qualities; but this
                    province has been the repository from which the best and most numerous horses
                    have been reared of the whole monarchy.</p>
                <p>The country is tolerably fertile; and from some of the districts of Polish Russia
                    much corn is brought down by the navigable rivers. The export of corn is,
                    therefore, one of the chief branches of commerce, and has been as follows :—</p>

                <p>The other exports in one year (1831) were as follow :— Bristles, 167,997 pounds;
                    feathers, 13,860 pounds; flax, 75,230 stones; hemp, 60,276 stones; hides and
                    skins, 53,707 pounds; wax, 31,955 pounds; wool, 118,068 pounds; linen yarn, 9000
                    bundles. The remaining exportable commodities are chiefly the produce of the
                    extensive forests, consisting of ship-timber, pot-ash, and tar. These are
                    chiefly shipped at Memel, but some at the capital. Some portions of flax and of
                    flax-seed are also exported. The manufactures of the province are merely of a
                    domestic nature, and very inconsiderable.</p>
                <p>Konigsberg, the capital of the province, is a city standing on the navigable
                    river Pregel, which empties itself into the Frische-Haff, about five miles below
                    it. With the exception of Berlin, it is the largest city in the Prussian
                    dominions, and was formerly the capital. It is surrounded with walls defended by
                    thirty-two ravelins, contains a royal palace, eleven Lutheran, two Reformed, one
                    Catholic, and one Menonite church, amongst which the domkirch or cathedral is
                    remarkable as containing the remains of the most distinguished individuals. It
                    has several establishments for benevolent purposes, especially the great royal
                    hospital, with nearly 1000 patients. The houses are 4503, and the inhabitants,
                    including troops, 63,240, of whom more than 1500 are Jews. Königsberg is the
                    seat of an ancient and celebrated university, containing twenty-two professors,
                    having a botanic garden, an astronomical observatory, and the other
                    establishments for the education of students in medicine, law, theology, and
                    philosophy. It has, besides, institutions for the earlier stages of education.
                    The trade is considerable, notwithstanding the shallowness of the river renders
                    it necessary to load and unload ships by the aid of lighters. The manufactures
                    are only for the consumption of the province. Long. 20. 25. 1. E. Lat. 54. 42.
