                    significant corrections to the OCR text, predominantly in cases of confusing "c"
                    and "e." Isolates 90 entries that were mistakenly included at the end of prior
                    entries in v1 and v2. Normalizes ordinal numbers. Separates metadata in
                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,
                    the end fragment is now joined to the start fragment, making a machine-readable
                    word.</change>

                <p><label type="entry">KIPPIS, <hi rend="smallcaps">Andrew</hi></label>, a learned
                    and eminent English nonconformist divine and biographer, was born at Nottingham,
                    on the 28th of March 1725. On the death of his father, he was, at the age of
                    five, removed to Sleaford, in Lincolnshire, where he received his grammatical
                    education, and gave such early proofs of talents and progress as attracted the
                    notice of Mr Merrivale, the pastor of a congregation of dissenters at that
                    place. To this excellent man it was probably owing that young Kippis directed
                    his views to the profession of a dissenting minister, and to those studies in
                    which he afterwards so much excelled. In 1741 he was placed under the tuition of
                    Dr Doddridge in the academy at Northampton, a seminary at that time in high
                    reputation. Of the advantages which this institution afforded him Mr Kippis knew
                    how to make the best improvement; and his regular conduct and proficiency
                    secured him the esteem of his excellent tutor. Having completed his course of
                    studies in five years, he was invited to a dissenting congregation at
                    Dorchester; but he gave the preference to a similar call from Boston, in
                    Lincolnshire, in 1746, where he remained till 1750, removing from thence to
                    Dorking, in Surrey, and, two years afterwards, to Long Ditch, Westminster, in
                    the room of Dr Hughes, deceased. This was in October 1753; in the preceding
                    month he had married Miss Elizabeth Bott, the daughter of a merchant at
                    Boston.</p>
                <p>The situation, for which Mr Kippis was eminently qualified by his extensive
                    abilities, being now respectable, introduced him to useful and honourable
                    connections. He became a manager of the presbyterian fund for assisting poor
                    congregations in the country in supporting their ministers; and in 1762 he was
                    chosen a member of Dr Williams’s trust, for nearly similar purposes, together
                    with the doctor’s valuable library, which afforded him opportunities of very
                    extensive usefulness. In 1762, he signified amongst his friends his design of
                    taking private pupils, and was on the eve of entering into engagements with the
                    parents of two or three young gentlemen, when a more honourable though,less
                    lucrative employment was offered him. He was appointed classical and
                    philological tutor in Coward’s academy, an office which he filled for upwards of
                    twenty-five years, with uncommon reputation to himself, and unspeakable
                    advantage to his students. He received the degree of doctor of divinity from the
                    university of Edinburgh, by the unsolicited recommendation of the learned
                    Professor Robertson, in 1767; in 1778 he was made a member of the Antiquarian,
                    and in 1779 a fellow of the Royal Society.</p>
                <p>His literary engagements having become extremely numerous, he was, in 1784,
                    obliged to resign his appointment in Coward’s academy, which was discontinued in
                    the subsequent year. In 1786, attempts were made to establish a new academy in
                    the vicinity of London, a design which Dr Kippis exerted all his influence to
                    accomplish; and although his numerous engagements made it extremely difficult
                    for him to fill any department in it, he reluctantly yielded to the wishes of
                    the subscribers, and became a tutor. But the inconvenience arising from the
                    distance of Hackney from his place of residence induced him to resign that
                    office in a few years. His professional duties and private studies occupied his
                    time after this period; and as he enjoyed an uninterrupted state of good health
                    and constitutional vigour, his friends were led to hope that his life and
                    usefulness would be long continued; but, in consequence of a cold which he
                    caught on a journey, he was seized with a fever which no medical skill could
                    subdue, and he died on the 5th of October 1795, in the seventy-first year of his
                    age.</p>
                <p>Dr Kippis was distinguished in a high degree for those virtues and
                    accomplishments which are universally allowed to be the chief ornaments of human
                    nature. His temper was mild and gentle, benevolent and candid; his manners and
                    address were easy, polished, and conciliating. Notwithstanding his great
                    reputation, he was void of pride, vanity, and self-conceit; on the contrary, he
                    was humble, modest, affable, and engaging. The powers and vigour of his mind
                    were far above mediocrity; he had a sound judgment, a comprehensive
                    understanding, correct imagination, retentive memory, à refined taste, and he
                    could exert his faculties on any subject with the utmost facility. He was an
                    early riser from his youth, to which his good health may in a great measure be
                    ascribed. He excelled in his acquaintance with the classics, belles-lettres,
                    history, and biography. He was the steady friend and advocate of genuine civil
                    and religious liberty; and, as a divine, he was well acquainted with the
                    different branches of theology, and with those subjects which are subservient to
                    the critical study of the Scriptures. He very seldom introduced controverted
                    topics into the pulpit, but confined himself to such doctrines and duties as
                    have an immediate influence upon the temper and practice.</p>
                <p>Of his works, which are numerous and valuable, the following are the principal:
                    1. Review of the Transactions of the present Reign; 2. The History of Learning,
                    Knowledge, and Taste, in Great Britain; 3. A Vindication of the Protestant
                    Dissenting Ministers, with regard to their late application to Parliament; 4.
                    Considerations on the Provisional Treaty with America, and the Preliminary
                    Articles of Peace with France and Spain; 5. The Life of Sir John Pringle; 6. Six
                    Discourses delivered at the Royal Society, on assigning the Copley Medal; 7. The
                    Life of Captain James Cook, of Dr Lardner, and Dr Doddridge; 8. Sermons preached
                    on public occasions; and, 9. the Biographia Britannica. This last great work,
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:192947318" xml:id="kp-eb0712-7318-0732"/>which he did
                    not live to finish, has assigned him a high rank amongst the learned of his
                    country, and will transmit his name with distinction to posterity.</p>
