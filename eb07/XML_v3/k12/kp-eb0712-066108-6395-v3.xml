                <p><label type="entry">KAJAAGA, or <hi rend="smallcaps">Galam</hi></label>, a
                    kingdom of Western Africa, extending from within a few miles of the Cataract of
                    Feloo in the east (where it is bounded by Kasson), about forty miles west of the
                    Falume, to the north of Geereer Creek, which divides it from Foota. On the south
                    it is bounded by Bondoo. The most complete description of this country is that
                    contained in Major Gray’s <hi rend="italic">Travels in Africa,</hi> who visited
                    it in 1819. At that time Kajaaga was composed of a series of towns situated on
                    either bank of the river Senegal. It formerly extended several miles in the
                    direction of Bondoo, Foota, and Bambouk, but had shrunk into its present
                    dimensions in consequence of the encroachments of the neighbouring tribes, with
                    whom a war was kept up, and who were enabled to carry it on more successfully
                    from disagreements amongst the various branches of the royal family. The river
                    Fa-lemmê (which signifies “small river”) divides it into Upper and Lower
                    Kajaaga. The former is governed by the Tonca of Maghana, and the latter by the
                    Tonca of Tuabo. These towns constitute the capitals of the respective divisions,
                    but neither acknowledge the supremacy of the other, although previously and of
                    right it belonged to the former, near which is situated Fort St Joseph, now
                    deserted and in ruins. This was the point at which the French attempted to carry
                    on the commerce of the Upper Senegal, and a voyage thither was calculated to
                    realize cent, per cent.; but the unhealthiness of the climate, the difficulties
                    of the navigation, and the constant hazard of being plundered by a succession of
                    barbarous chiefs, who occupy the banks, render it a very precarious speculation.
                    The Serawoollies, who are located in this quarter, rank amongst the most
                    industrious of the African tribes, and have engrossed the trade of Barnbouk,
                    Manding, and most of the upper districts of the Senegal as well as the
                    Niger.</p>
                <p>The face of the country is very mountainous, and covered to a considerable extent
                    with wood, a large portion of which is well adapted to common uses. The
                    vegetable productions, like those of Bondoo, are corn of four different kinds,
                    together with rice, pumpions, water melons, gourds, sorrell, onions, tobacco,
                    red pepper, pistachios, cotton, and indigo. Numbers of tamarinds, baobabs,
                    rhamnus lotus, and other fruit-trees, are likewise scattered about the beautiful
                    and picturesque valleys. This country differs from Bondoo only in its proximity
                    to the river, and in its partial inundation during the rains. The commerce
                    consists in the exchange of the cotton cloths manufactured in the country, and
                    the superabundance of their provisions, for European merchandise, such as
                    fire-arms, gunpowder, India goods, hardware, amber, coral, and glass beads.
                    These are again exchanged with their neighbours of Kaarta, Kasson, and Bambouk,
                    for gold, ivory, and slaves, who are in their turn sold to vessels from Senegal.
                    The manufactures of Kajaaga are nearly similar to those of the neighbouring
                    kingdoms, consisting of wearing apparel, household furniture, together with
                    implements of husbandry, carpenters’, blacksmiths’, and leather-workers’ tools,
                    and knives, spear and arrow heads, bridle-bits, stirrups, and a variety ofother
                    small articles. But they have an advantage over their neighbours in some
                    respects, particularly in the weaving and dyeing of cotton; “and,” Major Gray
                    observes, “whether it be that the humidity of the soil on the banks of the river
                    is more congenial to the growth of the cotton and indigo, or that the
                    manufacturers are more expert, I cannot say; but certain it is, that they can
                    dye a much finer blue than I have before <pb break="no" facs="nls:192946408"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0712-6408-0662"/>seen in Africa.” The dress of the people is far
                    from being inelegant or inconvenient. The men wear on the head a white cotton
                    cap, very neatly worked with different coloured silks or worsteds; whilst a
                    shirt of white cotton, with short sleeves, worn next the skin, covers the body
                    from the neck to about the thigh, and is surmounted by a very large one of the
                    same materials, descending below the knees, as do also the small clothes, which
                    are very roomy above, and generally of a blue colour. They wear their hair cut
                    close; and the cap, which is always white, is of a very graceful form, and
                    embroidered. The dress of the women, who are extremely neat in their persons, is
                    handsome; and they are very fond of such ornaments as amber, coral, and glass
                    beads of different colours, wherewith they bedeck different parts of their
                    bodies. In their living they are proverbially fond of animal food; indeed a
                    putrid hippopotamus floating down the Senegal is considered as a prize, the
                    division of which, when dragged to shore, sometimes occasions strife amongst the
                    captors. From a state of paganism, these people are gradually veering round to
                    the tenets of Mahommed. Some towns are wholly inhabited by priests, who are by
                    far the most wealthy and respectable members of the community. There is a mosque
                    in every town, and the times of worship are strictly attended to by the priests
                    and their disciples. Great numbers of dates are grown in all the towns, which
                    are beautifully shaded with large trees of the fig and other kinds of timber;
                    and being well walled, present a more respectable appearance than might be
                    expected amongst a people whose means are so limited. In their persons they are
                    rather robust, and of a grave and sober deportment. Their colour is a jet black,
                    which they are at much pains to preserve, by profusely anointing their bodies
                    with rancid butter. They are considered as more friendly to Europeans than any
                    other of the surrounding tribes, probably from the long existence of a state of
                    commercial intercourse between them and the inhabitants of Senegal, with whom
                    they claim relationship, and towards whom they show much attachment. The
                    advantages which they derive from their local situation render them enemies to
                    the people of Bondoo, who have nothing to do with the river except through the
                    medium of the Kajaaga country. Hence the exertions which have been made by
                    Bondoo to subjugate the nations, and kindle up intestine warfare between the
                    inhabitants of the upper and lower states; and this to a certain extent they
                    have succeeded in effecting. But with these barbarous races of men, amongst whom
                    war is a regular trade, and moral restraint can be but imperfectly recognised,
                    there is such a continual fluctuation of affairs, that it is hazardous to assign
                    limits to the territory which they possess, or to say what the form of
                    government is at any given time; for the predatory inroad of a neighbouring foe
                    may totally alter both in the course of a single day. According to Major Gray’s
                    account, the succession to the crown is not hereditary, but descends in a
                    regular line to the eldest branch of a numerous race called Batelleries, who are
                    the undisputed chiefs of the country. The population was considerably increased
                    by an influx of inhabitants from the north bank of the river who were obliged to
                    quit their own country on account of the exorbitant demands of the Kaartans,' to
                    whom they paid tribute. But what the total amount may at present be it is
                    impossible to form a conjecture.</p>
