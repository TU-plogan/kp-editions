                <p><label type="entry">KEPLER, <hi rend="smallcaps">John</hi></label>, one of the
                    most eminent astronomers who have appeared in any age, was born at Wiel, on the
                    27th of December 1571. His father’s name was Henry Kepler, an officer of
                    distinction in the army of Wirtemberg, but reduced to poverty by numerous
                    misfortunes. This exposed young Kepler to many difficulties and interruptions
                    whilst acquiring the rudiments of his education; but such was his genius and his
                    avidity for knowledge, that he surmounted every difficulty, and made astonishing
                    proficiency. He studied at the university of Tubingen, where he obtained the
                    degree of bachelor in the year 1588, and that of master of philosophy in 1591.
                    In the year 1592 he applied himself to the study of divinity; and the sermons he
                    produced afforded sufficient indication that he would have excelled as a
                    preacher had he continued in the clerical profession. The mathematics, however,
                    became his favourite study; and he soon acquired such distinguished reputation
                    as a geometrician, that he was invited to Gratz in Styria in the year 1594, to
                    fill the mathematical chair in the university of that city. After this period
                    his chief attention was directed to the study of astronomy, and he made many
                    interesting discoveries respecting the laws of the planetary motions.</p>
                <p>Two years after his marriage with a lady descended from a noble family,
                    persecution on account of his religion compelled him to quit Gratz, to which he
                    was afterwards recalled by the states of Styria. The calamities of war, however,
                    induced him to look out for a residence where he might enjoy greater safety and
                    tranquillity. During this uncomfortable situation of affairs, the celebrated
                    Tycho Brahe strongly urged him to settle in Bohemia as his assistant, where he
                    himself had every necessary requisite furnished to him by the Emperor Rodolph
                    for the prosecution of his astronomical studies. The numerous and urgent letters
                    which Kepler received upon this subject, and the solemn assurances that he
                    should be introduced to the emperor, at length induced him to leave the
                    university, and settle in Bohemia with his family, in the year 1600. But on his
                    way to that country he was seized with a quartan ague, which afflicted him for
                    seven or eight months, and rendered him incapable of contributing that aid to
                    Tycho which he would otherwise have done. He was likewise displeased with the
                    conduct of this astronomer towards him, and thought that he behaved in an
                    unfriendly manner, by neglecting to do a material service to his family when he
                    had it in his power. Kepler further, considered him as by far too reserved, in
                    not communicating to him the whole of his discoveries and improvements. Tycho
                    died in the year 1601, and the intercourse between these two eminent men being
                    thus of short duration, precluded Kepler from being either serviceable to, or
                    deriving much advantage from, the investigations and researches of the Danish
                    astronomer. Kepler, however, was introduced to the Emperor by Tycho, in
                    conformity to his promise, and appointed mathematician to his imperial majesty,
                    with instructions to complete the Rodolphine Tables, which that great man had
                    commenced. These were not published till the year 1627, owing to a variety of
                    obstructions and difficulties which were thrown in his way. Two years after the
                    publication of this work, he went, by permission of the emperor, to Ratisbon, to
                    claim payment of the arrears of his pension, but he was there seized with a
                    violent fever, supposed to have been brought upon him by too hard riding; and to
                    this he fell a victim in the month of ^November 1630, in the fifty-ninth year of
                    his age.</p>
                <p>The learned world is indebted to this sagacious and able astronomer for the
                    discovery of the true figure of the planetary orbits, and the proportions of the
                    motions of the solar system. Like the disciples of Pythagoras and Plato, Kepler
                    was seized with a peculiar passion for finding analogies and harmonies in
                    nature; and although this led him to the adoption of strange and ridiculous
                    conceits, we shall readily be disposed to overlook these, when we reflect that
                    they were the means of leading him to the most important discoveries. He was for
                    some time so charmed with the whimsical notions contained in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Mysterium</hi><hi rend="italic">Cosmographicum,</hi> published in
                    1596, that he declared he would not give up the honour of having invented what
                    was contained in that book for the electorate of Saxony; so easy is it for the
                    greatest of men to be deceived by a favourite hypothesis.</p>
                <p>He was the first who discovered that astronomers had been mistaken in ascribing
                    circular orbits and uniform motions to the planets, since each of them moves in
                    an ellipsis having one of its foci in the sun; and, after a variety of fruitless
                    efforts, he, on the 15th of May 1618, made his splendid discovery, that the
                    squares of the periodic times of the planets are always in the same proportion
                    as the cubes of their mean distances from the sun. As it was long a favourite
                    opinion of Kepler’s that there are only six primary planets, he seems to have
                    been alarmed at the discovery made by Galileo of four new planets, or satellites
                    of Jupiter, which gave a deathblow to the doctrines contained in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Mysterium</hi><hi rend="italic">Cosmographicum.</hi> The sagacity
                    of this wonderful man, and his incessant application to the study of the
                    planetary motions, pointed out to him some cf the genuine principles from which
                    these motions originate. He considered gravity as a power that is mutual between
                    bodies; that the earth and moon tend towards each other, and would meet in a
                    point so many times nearer to the earth than to the moon as the earth is greater
                    than the moon, if their motions did not prevent it. His opinion of the tides
                    was, that they arise from the gravitation of the waters towards the moon; but
                    his notions of the laws of motion not being accurate, he could not turn bis
                    conceptions to the best advantage. The prediction he uttered at the end of his
                    epitome of astronomy has been long since verified by the discoveries of Sir
                    Isaac Newton, namely, that the determination of the true laws of gravity was
                    reserved for the succeeding age, when the Author of nature would be pleased to
                    reveal those mysteries.</p>

                    excellent performance for the period in which he flourished. See the
