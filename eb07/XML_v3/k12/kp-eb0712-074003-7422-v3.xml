                    celebrated chemist, born in the county of Galway, in Ireland. He was originally
                    destined to the study of the law, and, having been called to the bar, followed
                    the profession of advocate, until some circumstances obliged him to quit it;
                    whereupon he applied himself to the study of the natural sciences, to which his
                    taste had always inclined him. Having established himself in London or its
                    neighbourhood, about the year 1779, he read, at the sittings of the Royal
                    Society of which he had become a member, several memoirs, for which, in 1781,
                    the Copley medal was adjudged to him. Having returned to his native country
                    about the year 1789, he was some time afterwards elected president of the Royal
                    Irish Academy, and published several works, not only on chemistry, geology, and
                    mineralogy, but also on metaphysics and logic. He was likewise president of the
                    Dublin Society, and a member of the principal literary and scientific
                    associations in Europe. He died on the 22d of June 1812, at a very advanced age.
                    Kirwan was regarded as the Nestor of the British chemists, and almost all the
                    natural sciences have been more or less indebted to his long labours. His works
                    are, 1. Experiments and Observations on the Specific Gravities and Attractive
                    Powers of various Saline Substances, published in the Philosophical
                    Transactions; 2. Elements of Mineralogy, 1784, in two vols. 8vo, translated into
                    German by Crell; 3. An Essay on Phlogiston and the Constitution of Acids, 1787;
                    4. An Estimate of the Temperature of Different Latitudes, 1787, in 8vo; 5. A
                    Treatise on the Analysis of Mineral Waters, 8vo; 6. Logic, 1789, in two vols.
                    8vo; to which may be added, various communications to the learned societies of
                    which he was a member. At Dublin he formed an association for the express
                    purpose of cultivating mineralogy; and, as a geologist, be distinguished himself
                    by advocating what has since been called the Neptunian theory of the earth, in
                    opposition to that of Dr Hutton. <hi rend="smallcaps">(a.)</hi><hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Kirwan,</hi><hi rend="italic">Walter Blake,</hi> a celebrated
                    Irish preacher, was born in the county of Galway about the year 1754. He was
                    descended of an ancient family of the Roman Catholic persuasion, and, in early
                    youth, went to the college of the English Jesuits at St Omer, where he received
                    the rudiments of his education. At the age of seventeen, he embarked for the
                    Danish island of St Croix, in the West Indies, where a relation of his father
                    had large possessions; but, after a residence of six years, during which he
                    suffered severely from the baneful influence of the climate, he returned to
                    Europe. He then entered the university of Louvain, where he took priest’s
                    orders, and was soon afterwards promoted to the chair of natural and moral
                    philosophy. In 1778, he was appointed chaplain to the Neapolitan ambassador at
                    the British court; and having obtained some reputation as a <hi rend="subscript"
                    > c</hi> preacher, he published several sermons, which, however, do not appear
                    to have attracted any notice. In 1787, he resolved to conform to the established
                    religion, from “a conviction that he would thus obtain more extensive
                    opportunities of doing good ;” and was introduced by Dr Hastings archdeacon of
                    Dublin, to the congregation of St Peter’s church, where he preached on the 24th
                    of June. His audience were impatient to hear him relate the causes of his
                    conversion, but they were disappointed; for, neither at this nor at any other
                    time, did he ever breathe a syllable of contempt or reproach against any
                    religious persuasion whatsoever. For some time after he had conformed to the
                    established religion, he preached every Sunday in St Peter’s church; but his
                    reputation as a pulpit orator increased so rapidly that, before the expiration
                    of a year, he was exclusively employed to preach charity sermons, a duty in the
                    discharge of which his success had been unprecedented. In 1788, he was preferred
                    to the prebend of Howth, and in the following year to the parish of St Nicholas
                    Without, the joint incomes of which amounted to about L.400 a year; but he
                    resigned the prebend on being presented, in 1800, to the deanry of Killala. His
                    popularity as a preacher appears to have been extraordinary. Whenever he
                    appeared in the pulpit, multitudes crowded to hear him. He was presented with
                    addresses and pieces of plate from several parishes, and with the freedom of
                    different corporations; his portrait was painted and engraved by the most
                    eminent artists; and the collections made, when he preached, exceeded any thing
                    that had ever been known. Even at periods of public distress, his irresistible
                    powers of persuasion produced, by a single sermon, contributions exceeding a
                    thousand or twelve hundred pounds; and his auditors, not content with emptying
                    their purses into the plate, sometimes threw in jewels or watches, as earnests
                    of future benefactions. But the fire which burned in his bosom at length
                    consumed him, and he died on the 27th of October 1805, exhausted by the fatigues
                    of his vocation, leaving a widow with two sons and two daughters, to whom the
                    king granted a pension of L.300 a year, with reversion to the daughters. In
                    1814, a volume of his sermons was printed for the benefit of his sons, who were
                    not included in this provision; but from these it would be difficult to discover
                    the cause of his unexampled popularity, since, in point of literary merit, they
                    bear no sort of proportion to the effects which, when delivered by him, they
                    appear to have produced. The master-charm no doubt consisted in the manner, of
                    which it is impossible for us to form any opinion. One thing is certain,
                    however, that, in recommending charity, he was successful beyond all precedent,
                    and that his private character corresponded, in all respects, with the humane
                    and benevolent sentiments expressed in his public discourses. <hi
