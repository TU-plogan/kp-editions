                    the greatest tragedians that England ever produced, was born on the 1st of
                    February 1757, at Prescot, in Lancashire. Mr Roger Kemble, his father, though
                    only the manager of a provincial company of actors, was of ancient and
                    respectable family; and, sensible of the disadvantages attending his own
                    profession, sent his son to receive his education at a Roman Catholic seminary,
                    for the purpose, it is believed, of qualifying him to take orders in the
                    Catholic church. He was also a student for two or three years at the College of
                    Douay; but the strength of natural bias prevailed, and he became an actor in
                    1776. After performing in York, Liverpool, Manchester, Edinburgh, Dublin, and
                    other places, and gradually acquiring reputation, he made his first appearance
                    before a London audience on the 30th of September 1783, in the character of
                    Hamlet. He was received by the public generally with great applause, although,
                    as always happens in such cases, a party lagged behind, preferring and paying
                    greater homage to a favourite idol of longer standing. He rapidly attained an
                    acknowledged pre-eminence in the tragic scene, and took that decided lead which
                    he ever afterwards maintained. He subsequently undertook the management of Drury
                    Lane Theatre, which he conducted, with only a slight interruption, till 1801;
                    and during that period the drama was indebted to him for various and
                    considerable improvements, particularly in introducing appropriate costume. In
                    1794, he brought out a musical piece of his own, entitled <hi rend="italic">Lodoiska,</hi> which was very successful at the time, and is still occasionally
                    performed. He likewise revived old pieces of merit, and brought forward many new
                    productions, some of which were of considerable merit, altered by himself. In
                    1802, he visited the Continent; and on his return to London, purchased a sixth
                    share of Covent Garden Theatre, and became manager of that establishment. His
                    career in this place was brilliantly successful, but partially suspended in
                    consequence of the total destruction of the theatre by fire in 1809. A new
                    edifice, however, was speedily reared, and opened with an increase of
                    entrance-money, which, along with certain arrangements regarding the private
                    boxes, created a series of disturbances, known by the name of O. P. riots, which
                    lasted for sixty-six nights, and in which the public finally <pb break="no" facs="nls:192946772" xml:id="kp-eb0712-6772-0690"/>carried their
                    point. Kemble stood the storm with firmness; but he was subjected to much
                    insolence, without having the power of retaliation within his reach. In 1812 he
                    retired for two years, conceiving he had done his part, and being desirous of
                    repose. His return to the stage was hailed with the utmost enthusiasm. He rose
                    to the summit of popularity, and was acknowledged, without dispute, as the first
                    actor in Britain, probably in the world. His health, however, began to give way;
                    and he formed the resolution of taking farewell of the stage, which he did on
                    the 23d of July 1817, after performing, with unabated power, his great character
                    of Coriolanus. The “Valedictory Stanzas” addressed to him at a public meeting
                    held in that month, do equal honour to the actor, and the poet Mr Campbell; and
                    Sir Walter Scott composed the “Farewell Address” which he delivered on taking
                    leave of the Edinburgh stage in the month of March preceding. He retired to the
                    Continent, and fixed his residence at Lausanne, where he died on the 26th of
                    February 1823.</p><p>In judging of the talents of Mr Kemble, we must regard him in the threefold
                    character of actor, manager, and improver of dramatic representation. In
                    reference to the first, tragedy, and that of the most stately and majestic
                    character, was the line in which he excelled. His person was on a scale suited
                    to the stage, being tall and stately; his countenance, in nobleness of
                    expression, resembled the finest models of the antique; and his movements and
                    demeanour, at once majestic and graceful, corresponded to the heroic cast of his
                    form and features. What others assumed, seemed in him to be nherent. He looked
                    an abstraction of the characteristics of tragedy, and trode the stage with
                    solemn and majestic step, as if he were there “native, and to the manner born.”
                    His style was his own, and seemed to grow out of the peculiar qualities of his
                    person and his intellect. It was that in which taste and judgment qualify and
                    soften spontaneous conception and feeling with profound consideration, measured
                    dignity, and learned precision. Talking of him generally, his deportment was
                    solemn, his movements slow, his utterance deliberate, and always finely
                    articulated, and his bearing and expression of countenance contemplative. His
                    voice was distinct and impressive; but an early tendency to asthma rendered it
                    necessary for him to husband his efforts in the more level parts, reserving them
                    for those bursts of passion to which he gave such sublime effect. His acting was
                    the result of long and laborious study, assisted by learning; he was a profound
                    master in his art, and metaphysically curious in expressing each line of his
                    part with the accent and manner exactly appropriate. Every word of a sentence
                    had its peculiar emphasis; and this attention to minute details led him
                    sometimes to suspend the action so long as to injure the effect, which, to be
                    perfectly grand, should be instant, and not anticipated by any “note of
                    preparation.” A sacrifice of energy of action to grace has likewise been
                    reckoned amongst the faults ascribed to this great actor; but this was more than
                    compensated by the correctness of his conception of character, the precision of
                    his taste, the patience of his investigation, which allowed of no point passing
                    unconsidered, and that moral firmness which enabled him to maintain his own
                    views regarding readings, when he believed himself in the right, against all
                    opposition. Although some detracted from his merits on account of his
                    peculiarities, all concurred in regarding him as a highly-gifted actor; and the
                    impression which he made in characters more immediately adapted to his style of
                    excellence, such as Cato, Coriolanus, Penruddock, Brutus, Macbeth, Hamlet, John,
                    Jaques, and many others, will last as long as any mere recollection connected
                    with the drama can last. As a manager he was gentlemanly, accurate, and regular;
                    but somewhat strict. Reformation was carríed by him into almost every department
                    of the drama, and his innovations were calculated to confer permanent benefit on
                    the art. Before his time there was no such thing as regular costume, and
                    anachronisms of dress of the most ludicrous description were constantly
                    exhibited. These Kemble reformed, by diligently consulting illuminated
                    manuscripts, ancient pictures, and other contemporary authorities. Scenic
                    decoration he also carried to a high degree of perfection, thereby adding to the
                    splendour and illusion of the drama. In early life he published a volume of <hi rend="italic">Fugitive Pieces</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> but all the copies
                    of this production he afterwards carefully destroyed. His life (in 2 vols. 8vo,
                    1825) has been written by Mr James Boaden, a person whose power of doing justice
                    to the subject of his biography appears to be extremely disproportionate to the
                    admiration with which the great founder of the classic school of acting had
                    inspired him. <hi rend="smallcaps">(r. r. r.)</hi></p></div></body></text></TEI>
