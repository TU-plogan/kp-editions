                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                    rend="italic">Lingua Franca,</hi> a kind of jargon spoken on the Mediterranean,
                    and particularly throughout the coasts and ports of the Levant, composed of
                    Italian, Spanish, French, Romaic Greek, and other languages.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Frank,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Franc,</hi> an ancient
                    coin, either of gold or silver, struck and current in France. The value of the
                    gold franc was something more than that of the gold crown; but it has been long
                    out of use, though the name is still retained as the name of a money of
                    accounts, in which sense it is equivalent to the livre, or twenty sols.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Frank,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Franc,</hi> meaning
                    literally <hi rend="italic">free</hi> from charges and impositions, or exempt
                    from public taxes, has various significations in the ancient English
                    customs.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">FR4Nκ-Almoigne (libera</hi><hi rend="italic">eleemosyna),</hi>
                    or free alms, a tenure of a spiritual nature, by which a religious corporation,
                    aggregate or sole, holds lands of the donor granted to them and their successors
                    for ever. The service which they were bound to render for these lands was not
                    definitively stated; but only in general they were to pray for the souls of the
                    donor and his heirs, dead or alive. Hence they did no fealty, which is incident
                    to all other services, because this religious service was of a higher and more
                    exalted nature. This is the tenure by which almost all the ancient monasteries
                    and religious houses held their lands, and by which also the parochial clergy,
                    and many ecclesiastical and eleemosynary foundations, hold them at this day. But
                    the nature of the service was altered at the Reformation, and made conformable
                    to the reformed doctrines of the church of England. It was an old Saxon tenure;
                    and continued under the Norman domination, from the veneration paid to religious
                    institutions. This was also the reason why tenants in frank-almoigne were
                    exempted from all other services except the <hi rend="italic">trinoda</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">necessitas,</hi> of repairing the highways, building castles, and
                    repelling invasions, just as the Druids, amongst the ancient Britons, had <hi
                    rend="italic">omnium</hi><hi rend="italic">rerum immunitatem.</hi> And even at
                    present this is a tenure of a very different nature from all others, being not
                    in the least feudal, but merely spiritual; for, if the service be neglected, the
                    law gives no remedy by distress, or otherwise, to the lord of whom the lands are
                    holden, but merely enters complaint to the ordinary or visitor to correct
                    it.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Frank-</hi><hi rend="italic">Chase</hi> is defined
                    to be a liberty of free chase, by which persons who possess lands within the
                    compass of the same are prohibited from cutting down wood, &amp;c. out of the
                    view of the forester.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Frank-Fcb</hi> signifies the same thing as holding
                    lands and tenements in fee simple; that is, to any person and his heirs, and not
                    by such service as is required by ancient demesne, but is pleaded at common
                    law.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Frank-</hi><hi rend="italic">Law,</hi> a word
                    applied to the free and common law of the land, or the benefit which a person
                    has by it.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">F</hi><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> 'rank-</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Marriage,</hi> in <hi rend="italic">Law,</hi> is where tenements are given by
                    one man to another, together with a wife, who is the daughter or cousin of the
                    donor, to hold in frank-marriage. By such a gift, although nothing but the word
                    <hi rend="italic">frank-marriage</hi> is expressed, the donees have the
                    tenements to themselves and the heirs; that is, they are tenants in special
                    tail. For the word <hi rend="italic">frank-marriage</hi> not only denotes <hi
                    rend="italic">ex vi termini,</hi> an inheritance, like the word <hi
                    rend="italic">frank-almoigne,</hi> but likewise limits that inheritance,
                    supplying not only words of descent, but also of procreation. Such donees in
                    frank-marriage are liable to no service but fealty; for a rent reserved therein
                    is void until the fourth degree of consanguinity be past between the issues of
                    the donor and donee.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">FRΛNK-Pledye,</hi> in <hi rend="italic">Law,</hi> signifies a
                    pledge or surety fol the behaviour of freemen.</p>
