                    between two persons, and arising not merely from the general principle of
                    benevolence, from emotiona of gratitude for favours received, from views of
                    interest, or from instinctive affection or animal passion, but from an opinion
                    entertained by each of them that the other is adorned with some amiable or
                    respectable qualities.</p>
                <p>The object of the general principle of benevolence is <hi rend="italic"
                    >mankind,</hi> not any particular individual. Gratitude regards the person from
                    whom he who feels its emotions has received a favour, whether that person be a
                    virtuous or a vicious, a respectable or a contemptible character; it prompts the
                    person obliged to make some suitable return to his benefactor, but not to enter
                    into any particular intimacy with him merely on account of the favours which he
                    has received. Many connections are formed and dignified with the name of <hi
                    rend="italic">friendship,</hi> upon no other principle but the sordid hope which
                    one or perhaps each of the parties entertains of accomplishing some selfish
                    purpose through the assistance of the other. The instinctive affection which a
                    parent entertains for his child, as well as that which the child feels for his
                    parent, seems intended by nature to form an union between the persons thus
                    related to each other; but the union between parents and children, when
                    supported by no other principle but instinct, is different from friendship; it
                    extends no further than to cause the parent to provide for his child during his
                    helpless years, and the child to look up to his parent for protection and
                    support. We need not mention that appetite which is the foundation of love, and
                    is the provision which nature has made for the continuation of our species. This
                    appetite alone, and unassisted by some nobler principle, cannot give rise to any
                    connection worthy of an honourable name.</p>
                <p>After excluding these principles, we can refer the origin of friendship only to
                    “an opinion entertained by each of the parties between whom it subsists that the
                    other is adorned with some amiable or respectable qualities.” A connection
                    founded on different principles we cannot honour with the nameof friendship; but
                    that which flows from this pure source must be noble and virtuous. When two
                    persons of virtue and abilities contemplate each the other’s character and
                    conduct, they cannot but view them with complacency and esteem. Habits and
                    actions displaying prudence, fortitude, moderation, integrity, benevolence, and
                    piety, naturally command the approbation of the impartial spectator, and even
                    affect him with delight. But as we are disposed to revisit a landscape the
                    beauties of which we have contemplated with rapture, and read with frequent
                    delight a poem in which genius has faithfully delineated some of the most
                    enchanting scenes or the most interesting events in nature; so we also become
                    desirous to enjoy frequent opportunities of contemplating a character
                    distinguished for eminent abilities and virtues. Hence, whenever men of truly
                    respectable characters enjoy opportunities of mutual intercourse, an attachment
                    naturally takes place between them, entirely disinterested, and founded solely
                    on the approbation with which the one cannot avoid regarding the conduct of the
                    other. The esteem which the one is thus induced to entertain for the other will
                    lead them to seek frequent opportunities of enjoying each other’s society,
                    mutually to ask and listen to advice, to trust their most secret and important
                    purposes to each other’s confidence, and to be no less concerned each of them
                    for the other’s interest and honour than for his own. This, and this alone, is
                    genuine friendship, founded on virtue, and on that approbation which virtue
                    never fails to command; it is a natural consequence of intercourse between
                    virtuous men.</p>
                <p>But perhaps such a pure and sublime attachment can scarcely be expected to exist
                    among beings of so mixed and imperfect a character as mankind. The wise man of
                    the</p>
                <p>ļr ancient Stoics, or the Christian who fully obeys the pre-: s cepts and follows
                    the steps of his Saviour, might be capa- , b)e of it; but, unfortunately,
                    humanity never reaches such 1 perfection. Even the purest and most disinterested
                    of s those friendships which prevail among men owe their origin to other meaner
                    principles, as well as to that which 3 has been mentioned as the principle of
                    genuine friendship.</p>
                <p>3 There are certain circumstances favourable, and others</p>
                <p>- adverse, to the formation and continuance of friendship, r These, making
                    amends, as it were, for the imperfection of t human virtue and human knowledge,
                    lead men to overlook</p>
                <p>- each other’s faults and follies, and to unite in the bonds of friendship; a
                    friendship which, though less solid, less ge-I nerous, and less lasting, than
                    that which we have above described, is yet attended with effects favourable to
                    the . happiness of individuals, and to the interests of society! in general.</p>
                <p>Equality of age is favourable to friendship. Infancy, • manhood, and old age,
                    differ so considerably from each ι other in their views, passions, and pursuits,
                    that the man will seldom be disposed to associate with the boy or the youth, in
                    preference to one who has had equal experience in the world with himself.</p>
                <p>They who cultivate the same trade or profession enjoy opportunities favourable to
                    the formation of friendship. Equality of rank and fortune is also favourable to
                    friendship. Seldom will a man of fortune be able to gain the sincere friendship
                    of any of his dependents. Though he treat them with the most obliging
                    condescension, and load them with favours, yet still either the sense of
                    dependence, or resentment for imaginary injuries, or impatience of the debt of
                    gratitude, or some other similar reason, will be likely to prevent them from
                    regarding him with cordial affection. Similarity of taste and temper will
                    generally be found favourable to friendship. Two individuals of mild, humane
                    dispositions will naturally take delight in each other’s society and
                    conversation. They who are charmed with the bustle of a gay and active life
                    avoid the haunts of the indolent and contemplative, and join hand in hand to
                    climb the heights of ambition, or tread the round of amusement and
                    dissipation.</p>
                <p>As friendship is an attachment which takes place between certain human characters
                    when placed in certain circumstances, there must therefore be laws for
                    supporting the attachment and regulating the intercourse of friendship. Mutual
                    esteem is the basis on which true friendship is established; and the intercourse
                    of friendship ought surely to be conducted in such a manner that this foundation
                    be not injured. Sincerity may be considered as the first law of friendship.
                    Artifice and hypocrisy are inimical to all social intercourse. Between the
                    deceitful and the honest, therefore, friendship can never subsist for any length
                    of time. But though sincerity is to be faithfully observed in the intercourse of
                    friendship, yet the harshness of contradiction must be carefully avoided. Those
                    obliging manners which are so agreeable in an acquaintance or casual companion
                    are still more so in a friend. If they are necessary to recommend the advantages
                    of social intercourse in general to the members of society, they are no less
                    necessary to communicate a charm to the intercourse of friendship. Mild obliging
                    manners are understood as the natural and genuine expression of kindness and
                    affection; boisterous rudeness, petulance, and neglect, are naturally considered
                    as expressive of opposite sentiments. Mutual confidence is the very soul of
                    friendship. If friendship be rightly defined to be a mutual affection founded on
                    mutual esteem, those who are united in the bonds of friendship cannot but repose
                    mutual confidence in each other.</p>
                <p>Many instances are related which show what power it is possible for friendship to
                    acquire over the human heart.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193517009" xml:id="kp-eb0710-7009-0234"/>
                <p>We need not here repeat the well-known story of Damon and Pythias, whose generous
                    friendship afforded a spectacle which softened even the savage heart of
                    Dionysius. It is known to every school-boy; for the affecting narrative of
                    Valerius Maximus has been studiously detailed and commented on by almost every
                    succeeding story-teller or moralist. Addison, in one of his Spectators, gives a
                    beautiful little relation, which finely illustrates the power of both friendship
                    and love. The reader is referred to the number of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Spectator</hi> in which the narrative occurs.</p>
