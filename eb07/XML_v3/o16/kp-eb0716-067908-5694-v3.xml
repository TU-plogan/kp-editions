                <p><label type="entry">OVIDIUS, P</label>. <hi rend="smallcaps">Naso,</hi> one of
                    the most celebrated of the Roman poets, was born at Sulmo, a city of the
                    Peligni, on the 20th of March, <hi rend="smallcaps">b c.</hi> 43., the very year
                    in which Cicero lost his life. His father, who was of equestrian rank, bestowed
                    on his son the best education that Rome could furnish, and this was afterwards
                    improved by a residence at Athens. On his return to Rome he applied himself to
                    law, and we find him in succession triumvir, centumvir, and decemvir. He soon
                    found, however, that such a course of life did not suit his inclination; and
                    withdrawing himself from active business, he devoted his whole time to the study
                    of poetry. He was three times married; but his first two wives he divorced, and
                    to his third, who was of the family of the Fabii, he was passionately attached.
                    His daughter Perilla appears also to have been a favourite. With Virgil he could
                    have been but little acquainted, as the Mantuan bard died when Ovid had scarcely
                    attained his twentyfifth year; but he was the intimate friend of Propertius,
                    Catullus, and Cornelius Gallus. He passed many peaceful years in Rome, enjoying
                    all the pleasures of a luxurious capital, and pursuing his favourite studies;
                    but at last some of his proceedings having excited the displeasure of Augustus,
                    he was ordered to retire from Rome, and take up his residence at Tomi, a city of
                    the Getae, situated near the mouth of the Danube. What really was the cause of
                    his banishment is a poipt which has been much discussed by <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194565707" xml:id="kp-eb0716-5707-0680"/>the learned; but as the poet
                    always speaks of it in dark and obscure terms, no satisfactory solution has as
                    yet been suggested. It would appear to have been something of which he had been
                    an innocent witness, and which he had been indiscreet enough to mention to his
                    friends on some convivial occasion. As Julia, the niece ofAugustus, was at this
                    time banished on account of her shameless debaucheries, some have imagined that
                    Ovid’s punishment might have arisen from participation in her pleasures, or from
                    some indiscreet disclosure of them. It has even been suggested that the lady
                    whom he celebrates under the name ofCorinna was no other than Julia; but this is
                    impossible, as he himself states that he was only about his twentieth year when
                    he sung her praises; and his banishment took place about his fiftieth year.
                    Others have suggested that it arose from the disclosure of some state secret
                    respecting Agrippa, the nephew of Augustus, who had been banished to Campania;
                    but there is nothing in the works either of Ovid or of any ancient author that
                    can enable us to come to any satisfactory conclusion. Ovid did not submit to the
                    inconveniences of exile without murmuring, nor was he willing to allow himself
                    to be forgotten. He showed that his mind was completely enervated by the
                    luxurious life he had led at Rome; and he allowed himself to make the most
                    abject entreaties to Augustus to procure his recall; but neither Augustus, nor
                    after him Tiberius, would listen to his request. He remained at Tomi till the
                    time of his death, which happened in the eighth year of his banishment, and the
                    fifty-ninth of his age, <hi rend="smallcaps">a. d.</hi> 16.</p>
                <p>Ovid’s principal work is entitled <hi rend="italic">Metamorphoscon Libri,</hi>
                    probably from the Latin language not affording a word equally expressive of the
                    author’s meaning. They contain, in fifteen books, a series of about three
                    hundred and fifty fables, which begin with Chaos, and end with the death of
                    Caesar; and they are so arranged that one fable seems to arise naturally from
                    the other. The poet has shown much art in selecting those fables which were
                    suited to his purpose, and in uniting into one consistent whole, materials which
                    differ so much in form and in character. He has also contrived to throw into his
                    work much dramatic spirit, which keeps up the attention of the reader, and gives
                    a liveliness to every scene which he describes. No poet has succeeded better in
                    painting the passions and affections which agitate the breast of man. The
                    materials for his work are no doubt mainly drawn from the Greeks, and more
                    particularly from the Alexandrine school, by which this subject had been
                    frequently treated. He has borrowed much from Nicander, who also afforded
                    materials for the work of Antoninus Liberalis, a Greek of the later ages. We
                    possess a Greek translation of the Metamorphoses by Manuel Planudes.</p>
                <p>His work entitled <hi rend="italic">Amorum Libri</hi> consists of forty-nine
                    elegies, and was originally divided, as he himself states, into five books; but
                    he omitted two. The subject of these elegies is the poet himself and his
                    love-adventures, which he describes with the utmost freedom and sincerity. The
                    passions which moved him, and the feelings he experienced, are expressed with
                    all the lightness of touch and grace so peculiar to the poet, and which has
                    taken off much of the grossness that is natural to such a subject. According to
                    a German critic, this work must have been published somewhere between 744 and
                    752 u. c. <hi rend="smallcaps">(b.</hi> c. 10-2).</p>
                <p>His work entitled <hi rend="italic">Tristia,</hi> in fifty elegies, and <hi
                    rend="italic">Epistolae ex</hi><hi rend="italic">Ponto,</hi> forty-six elegies,
                    in four books, were both composed at Tomi during his exile, the first between
                    the years 762-765 <hi rend="smallcaps">(a. d.9-!2),</hi> and the second between
                    765- 969 <hi rend="smallcaps">(a. d.</hi> 12-16). Both contain heavy and
                    unceasing complaints of the unhappiness of his fate; but the constant repetition
                    of the same idea produces a disagreeable effect; and the unmanliness of his
                    grief does not tend to raise his character in the mind of the reader. The
                    versification of these works, however, is perfect.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Heroides</hi> are a series of love-letters written by
                    heroines of the mythological age, to their absent lovers. Ovid does not appear
                    to have borrowed the idea of this species of elegy from any Greek writer, though
                    some have been inclined to suspect that such was the case. We possess twenty-one
                    of these letters, but the genuineness of the last six has been doubted, some
                    ascribing them to the pen of Aulus Sabinus. Love forms the subject of them all,
                    with complaints of the absence of lovers; but the different circumstances in
                    which each is placed have enabled the poet to throw much agreeable variety into
                    the letters. The feelings are described with much truth ;· and though the
                    simplicity of an earlier age is sometimes to be regretted, still they must be
                    considered as one of the most successful of his works.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Fasti</hi> is another work of very high merit, in which he
                    describes the origin and customs observed in different Roman festivals, in
                    chronological order. The six books which we possess include only the first six
                    months of the year, though the poet intended to have completed in the same
                    manner the circle of the year, but was prevented probably by his banishment. The
                    subject is one which enabled him to display his historical and mythological
                    learning; and as he seems to have taken much interest in the investigation of
                    the ancient native religion of Italy, this poem is one of the chief sources from
                    which we gather the customs and superstitions of those early times.</p>
                <p>The bibliography of Ovid is immense; indeed the different editions of his works,
                    together with the commentaries, and the translaticns, would fill a volume. We
                    shall here confine ourselves to the citation of the principal editions. These
                    are, 1. The Bologna edition, Azzoguidi, 1471, in folio, being the first book
                    printed at Bologna; 2. That of Rome, Conrad Sweynheym and Arnold Pùnnartz, 1471,
                    in two volumes folio, published under the auspices of the Bishop of Alenia; 3.
                    Those published by the Aiduses, at Venice, about the beginning of the sixteenth
                    century, which are greatly esteemed, particularly that of 1502, 1503, in three
                    vols. 8vo, and that of 1515, 1516, also in three vols. 8vo, with notes by
                    Navagero; 4. The Leyden edition, 1661, 1662, in three vols. 8vo, <hi
                    rend="italic">cum</hi><hi rend="italic">notis</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >variorum,</hi> brought out under the superintendence of Cnipping; and, 5. That
                    of Amsterdam, 1727, in four vols. 4to, being the beautiful edition of ßurmann.
                    The French translations are exceedingly numerous, and, upon the whole, the best
                    that have appeared in any modern language.</p>
