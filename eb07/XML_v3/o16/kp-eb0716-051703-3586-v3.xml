                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">ORAN, <hi rend="smallcaps">Warran, Auran</hi>, or <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Guharan</hi></label>, a famous maritime city of Algiers, and
                    the most westerly in the regency. It is built on the declivity and along the
                    foot of a high mountain, which overlooks it from the north and northwest; and on
                    this ridge are planted two castles, commanding the city on the one side and the
                    port on the other. To the south and south-east there are two other castles,
                    erected upon the same level with the lower part of the city, but separated from
                    it by a deep winding valley, which serves as a natural trench on the south side.
                    A rivulet flows through it, and passing afterwards under the walls of the city,
                    affords a copious supply of water. At every opening of this valley a pleasing
                    and varied prospect presents itself, of rocky precipices, orange plantations,
                    and rills of water winding down the heights. Near the head of the rivulet just
                    mentioned there is a fifth castle, which not only guards the <hi rend="italic"
                    >mattamores</hi> dug under its walls, but serves as an important defence to the
                    city. Yet strongly fortified as Oran is, both by nature and art, it has been
                    repeatedly taken by the Spaniards, between whom and the Moors it was for
                    centuries a subject of contention. It was taken by the former in the year 1509,
                    but was recovered by the Moors in 1708. In the year 1732 the Spaniards retook it
                    by surprise; the Bey, otherwise a valiant soldier, having been panic-struck on
                    the first landing of the enemy, and, without shutting the gates, abandoned the
                    city to their mercy. Oran was afterwards restored, and, along with other parts
                    of Algiers, has recently fallen under the dominion of France. During the time
                    that the Spaniards retained possession of Oran, they erected several beautiful
                    churches, and other edifices, in the style of the Roman architecture, though of
                    less strength and solidity. They have further imitated the Romans in carving
                    upon the friezes and other parts several inscriptions in large characters, and
                    in their own language. Shaw describes Oran as a fortified city, about a mile in
                    circumference. The port called Mer-el-Quiver, corrupted from Mers-el-Kibeer, and
                    answering to the ancient Portus Magnus, is formed by a neck of land, which runs
                    out almost a furlong into the bay, and thereby secures it against the north and
                    northwest winds. It is defended by a castle more remarkable for spaciousness and
                    extent than for strength or beauty, though a part of it has been skilfully hewn
                    out of the native rock. Oran has much declined of late years, as the occupation
                    of the place by the French has induced the Arab population to leave it, although
                    the former repaired some of the edifices, and converted an old mosque into an
                    hospital. The inhabitants are estimated at about 4000. In the year 1790 this
                    city was destroyed by an earthquake, and six thousand of its inhabitants were
                    buried under the <pb break="no" facs="nls:194563599"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0716-3599-0518"/>ruins. Oran is situated in 35. 50. north, and
                    longitude 0. 18. west.</p>
