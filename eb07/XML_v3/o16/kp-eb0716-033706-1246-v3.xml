                <p><label type="entry">OMEN</label> is a word which, in its proper sense, signifies
                    a sign or indication of some future event, taken from the language of a person
                    speaking without any intention to prophecy. Hence Tully says that the
                    Pythagoreans attend to the discourse, not only of gods, but also of men, which
                    they call <hi rend="italic">omens.</hi> This sort of omen was supposed to de-
                    'pend much upon the will of the person concerned in the event; and hence the
                    phrases, <hi rend="italic">accepit omen,</hi><hi rend="italic">arripuit</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">omen.</hi> Such were the original omens; but they were afterwards
                    derived from things as well as from words. Thus Paterculus, speaking of the bead
                    of Sulpicius on the rostrum, says it was <hi rend="italic">velut amen</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">imminentis</hi><hi rend="italic">proscriptioms,</hi> the omen of
                    an impending proscription. Suetonius observes of Augustus, that he believed
                    implicitly in certain omens; and that if his shoes were improperly put on in the
                    morning, especially if the left shoe was put upon his right foot, he considered
                    it as a bad omen. Omen was used, in a still larger sense, to signify an augury,
                    as in the following line of Tully: “Sic aquilae clarum firmavit Jupiter <hi
                    rend="italic">omen”</hi> thus Jove confirmed the bright omen of the eagle.
                    Lastly, it was used, in the most generic sense of all, for a portent or prodigy;
                    as in the third book of the Aeneid, where a myrtle torn up by Aeneas dropped
                    blood.</p>
                <p>The portentous or supernatural omens were either external or internal. Of the
                    former kind were those showers of blood so frequently occurring in the Roman
                    history, which were much of the same nature with this adventure of Aeneas, which
                    he calls <hi rend="italic">monstra deum.</hi> Of the latter kind were those
                    sudden consternations, which, seizing upon men without any visible cause, were
                    imputed to the agency of the god Pan, and hence called <hi rend="italic">panic
                    terrors.</hi> But indeed there was hardly any thing, however trivial, from which
                    the ancients did not draw omens. That it should have been thought a direful omen
                    when any thing befell the temples, altars, or statues of the gods, need
                    therefore excite no wonder; but that the meeting of an eunuch, a negro, a bitch
                    with whelps, or a snake lying on the road, should have been looked upon as
                    portending bad fortune, <pb break="no" facs="nls:194561259"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0716-1259-0338"/>is a deplorable instance of human weakness, and of
                    the pernicious influence of superstition on the mind.</p>
                <p>It is more than probable that this practice of making ordinary events ominous of
                    good or bad fortune took its rise in Egypt, the parent land of almost every
                    superstition; but wherever it may have arisen, it spread itself over the whole
                    inhabited globe, and at this day prevails in a greater or less degree amongst
                    the vulgar of all nations. The following may be cited as examples.</p>
                <p>To break a looking-glass is extremely unlucky; the party to whom it belongs will
                    lose his best friend. If, going a journey on business, a sow cross the road, you
                    will probably meet with a disappointment, if not a bodily accident, before you
                    return home. To avert this you must endeavour to prevent her crossing you; and
                    if that cannot be done, you must ride round on fresh ground. If the sow be
                    attended with her litter of pigs, it is lucky, and denotes a successful journey.
                    It is unlucky to see first one magpie, and then more; but to see two denotes
                    marriage or merriment; three, a successful journey; four, an unexpected piece of
                    good news; and five, that you will shortly be in a great company. To kill a
                    magpie will certainly be punished with some terrible misfortune. If in a family
                    the youngest daughter should be married before her elder sisters, they must all
                    dance at her wedding without shoes. This will counteract their ill luck, and
                    procure them husbands. If you meet a funeral procession, or if one pass by you,
                    always take off your hat. This keeps all the evil spirits attending the body in
                    good humour. If, in eating, you miss your mouth, and the victuals fall, it is
                    very unlucky, and denotes approaching sickness. It is lucky to put on a stocking
                    the wrong side outwards; changing it alters the luck. When a person goes out to
                    transact any important business, it is lucky to throw an old shoe after him. It
                    is unlucky to present a knife, scissors, razor, or any sharp or cutting
                    instrument, to one’s mistress or friend, as they areapt to cut love and
                    friendship. To avoid the evil effects of this, a pin, a farthing, or some
                    trifling recompense, must be taken. To find a knife or razor denotes ill luck
                    and disappointment to the party that finds it.</p>
