                    or division of Asiatic Turkey. It is almost entirely formed by the windings of
                    the Euphrates and the river Khabour, and occupies a considerable portion of the
                    most barren part of Mesopotamia. It touches on the north and east the pachalik
                    of Diarbekir, and the dependencies of Malatea; and on the south and west it is
                    separated by the Euphrates from the deserts of Syria. The southern part of this
                    province is, for the most part, flat, sandy, and uncultivated, and inhabited by
                    tribes of wandering Arabs, who pitch their tents on the banks of the rivers and
                    in the vicinity of the springs; but towards the north the country is mountainous
                    and better inhabited. In the early ages of the Roman empire this division of
                    Mesopotamia bore the name of Osrhoene, and had subsisted for 840 years as an
                    independent kingdom, when it was reduced into the form of a Roman province
                    by’the Emperor Caracalla. It was finally swallowed up in the Turkish empire. The
                    principal towns are Orfa, Racca, and Soverick.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Orfa,</hi> a large town, and the capital of a pachalik of
                    the same name, in Asiatic Turkey. It is situated on the eastern side of a hill,
                    at the commencement of a plain; so that whilst its western extremity stands on
                    elevated ground, the eastern quarter of the town stands on a lower level; and,
                    with some trifling inequalities, the whole town may be said to be nearly flat.
                    It is surrounded by a stone wall, which encloses a circuit of from three to four
                    miles, in the form of an irregular triangle; and it is bounded on the west by
                    modern burying-grounds, gardens, hills, and vales, on the south by a rising
                    ground, on the east and south-east by a fertile plain, terminating at the foot
                    of a bare ridge of hills, and on the south-west is a hill nearly overlooking the
                    town, and crowned with the walls of a ruined castle. The houses are well built,
                    and of good masonry; they have mostly a small door of entrance from the street,
                    with an open court, and divans in recesses below, whilst the upper story is laid
                    out in public rooms more expensively furnished. Above is the terrace, on which
                    are placed sofas and beds, where, in hot weather, the family sleeps. The streets
                    are narrow, but having a paved causeway on each side, with a central channel for
                    water, and being more or less sloping downwards, are generally clean. The
                    bazaars are numerous and well supplied, and are appropriated to the manufacture
                    and sale of particular commodities. Most of these are commodious; they are also
                    covered, and are always fresh and cool, being sheltered both from the sun and
                    rains. The bazaar in which muslins, cottons, and other piece goods are exposed,
                    is from twenty to twenty-five feet in width, and from thirty to forty feet in
                    height, covered in by a range of fine domes in succession, admitting light and
                    air by a sort of lantern windows in the roof. The khans and caravanse rais are
                    numerous, and some few are excellent. The Khan Khoolah-Oghlee, on the outskirts
                    of the town, is spacious, and capable of accommodating in its central court 100
                    camels with their lading, in the adjoining stables as many horses, mules, and
                    asses, and in the chambers above there is room for 200 persons. The
                    Khan-el-Goomrook, or the customhouse khan, consists of an open court 100 feet
                    square, and paved throughout. Through this court runs a fine broad stream of
                    transparent water, crossing it diagonally, and serving for the watering of
                    horses, the ablutions of the pious, and the washing and cleaning of
                    manufactures. There are, above and below, about 100 chambers large enough to
                    accommodate eight or ten persons each. There are fifteen mosques crowned with
                    minarets. The most magnificent of these, though not the largest, is that of
                    Ibrahim el Khaleel, or the mosque of the patriarch. It is situated on a lake
                    filled from a clear spring which runs in the south-west quarter of the town, and
                    abounds with fine carp, in which the superstitious people believe that, owing to
                    the care of the patriarch, no impression can be made by any process of cooking.
                    The grand façade of this mosque is a square pile of building, over which rise
                    three large domes of equal size; and a lofty minaret springs up from amidst a
                    cluster of tall cypress trees. At each end of this central pile, towards the
                    stream, are flights of steps descending to the water’s edge, for the ablutions
                    of the pious. The wings are terminated by two solid masses of building, uniform
                    in design, and “completing,” says Buckingham, “one of the most regular edifices
                    of this kind to be found perhaps in Turkey.” The largest of the mosques at Orfa
                    has a square steeple, and this form is also repeated in one of the smaller ones.
                    The castle is on the south side of the city; the ascent is very steep, and is
                    about half a mile in circumference, surrounded by a deep ditch cut in the rock,
                    which can be filled with water from the river Scirtus. On this rock are the
                    ruins of a building called by the Arabs the palace of Nimrod, consisting of two
                    lofty and fine Corinthian pillars, and of some subterranean apartments,
                    apparently of great antiquity. There are four or five large baths, some reported
                    to be good; but the one which was seen by Mr Buckingham was, though spacious,
                    dirty and badly attended. The manufactures of the town are chiefly confined to
                    articles of the first necessity, namely, to coarse woollen cloths, used for
                    shirts and drawers, and, when printed, made into gowns for females, shawls for
                    the head, and some other articles. The process used for printing cottons is
                    tedious. A few carpets are made, of a very good quality, also silk bands and
                    tapes, hair-cloth for sacks and bags, and every description of saddlery and
                    smith’s work, as well as of mason’s work and carpentry. Cook-shops and
                    coffee-houses abound everywhere; and, during all the summer, there is an
                    abundant supply of solid ice brought down from the summits of Mount Taurus, and
                    sold at present for a farthing a pound. It is the seat of a considerable inland
                    trade, being a thoroughfare for caravans passing from Aleppo into the interior
                    of Persia. The population may be estimated at 50,000, amongst whom are 2000
                    Christians and 500 Jews, the rest being all Mahommedans. The Christians are
                    chiefly Armenians and Syrians, each of whom have a separate church, and live in
                    a separate quarter.</p>
                <p>Orfa is of great antiquity, and is considered by all the learned Jews and
                    Mahommedans, and by Christian scholars, as the Ur of the Chaldees. It was the
                    Edessa of the Greeks and Romans, and was frequently taken and retaken during the
                    wars between the Persians and Romans. In the reign of Heraclius, about <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a. d.</hi> 637, Orfa was taken by the Saracens, and its walls
                    levelled with the dust. It was retaken by Baldwin in 1097, who founded the first
                    principality of the Franks or Latins. It was also taken by Genghis Khan about
                    the year 1144, and thirty years afterwards by <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194563742" xml:id="kp-eb0716-3742-0529"/>Saladdin. It was sacked by
                    the Moguls in the thirteenth century; and two centuries afterwards suffered the
                    same calamity from the armies of Tamerlane. It was visited in 1544 by Tavernier,
                    in 1738 by Pococke, who describes it as being in a flourishing state, and in
                    1766 by Niebuhr, who gives the same account of it. It is sixty-seven miles from
                    Bir, and 232 from Diarbekir. Long. 38. 25. E. Lat. 36. 50. N.</p>
