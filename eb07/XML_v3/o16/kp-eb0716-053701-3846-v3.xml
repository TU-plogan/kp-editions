                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">ORION</label>, in fabulous history, was the son of Jupiter,
                    Neptune, and Mercury. As these gods were visiting the earth, they entered the
                    house of Hyrieus, a native of Tanagra, in Boeotia, under the character of
                    benighted travellers, on account of his being famed for hospitality to
                    strangers. Hyrieus treated them in the best manner possible; and even killed an
                    ox, the only one he had, for their entertainment. With this the gods were so
                    pleased, that they offered the old man whatever he should ask; and he having let
                    them know that he desired nothing so much as a son, they, anxious to gratify his
                    wish, caused the ox’s hide to be brought before them, and having deposited in it
                    their urine, bade him keep it under ground for nine months. He then dug for the
                    skin, and found in it a beautiful child, whom he called <hi rend="italic"
                    >Urion.</hi> The name was afterwards changed into Orion, by the corruption of
                    one letter, as Ovid observes: <hi rend="italic">Perdidit</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >antiquum</hi><hi rend="italic">littera</hi><hi rend="italic">prima</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">sonum.</hi> Orion soon became conspicuous, and Diana admitted him
                    amongst her attendants, and even became deeply enamoured of him. His gigantic
                    stature, however, displeased Oenopion king of Chios, whose daughter Hero or
                    Merope he requested in marriage. The king, not willing to deny him openly,
                    promised to make him his son-in-law as soon as he should have delivered that
                    island from wild beasts. This task, which Oenopion supposed to be impracticable,
                    was soon performed by Orion, who eagerly demanded his reward. Oenopion, on
                    pretence of complying, <pb break="no" facs="nls:194563859"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0716-3859-0538"/>made his illustrious guest drunk, and in this
                    state put out his eyes on the sea-shore, where he had laid himself down to
                    sleep, so that Orion, when he awoke from his debauch, found himself blind.
                    Directed by the sound, he then went to a neighbouring forge, where he placed one
                    of the workmen on his back, and by his directions proceeded to a place where the
                    rising sun was seen with the greatest advantage. Here he turned his face towards
                    the luminary; and, according to report, he immediately recovered his eye-sight,
                    and hastened to punish the perfidious cruelty of Oenopion. Orion was believed to
                    have been an excellent workman in iron, and to have fabricated a subterranean
                    palace for Vulcan.</p>
                <p>Some say that Orion was the son of Neptune and Euryale, and that he had received
                    from his father the privilege and power of walking over the sea without wetting
                    his feet; but others assert that he was a son of Terra, like the rest of the
                    giants. He had married a nymph called Sida before his connection with the family
                    of Oenopion; but Sida was the cause of her own death, by boasting herself fairer
                    than Juno. Diodorus says that Orion was a celebrated hunter, superior to the
                    rest of mankind by his strength and uncommon stature. He built the port of
                    Zancle, and fortified the coast of Sicily against the frequent inundations of
                    the sea, by heaping up a mound of earth called Pe-lorum, on which he built a
                    temple to the gods of the sea. After his death Orion was placed in heaven, where
                    one of the constellations still bears his name. The constellation of Orion was
                    placed near the feet of the bull. It was composed of seventeen stars, in the
                    form of a man holding a sword; for which reason the poets often speak of Orion’s
                    sword. As the constellation of Orion, which rises about the 9th day of March,
                    and sets about the 21st of June, is generally supposed to be accompanied at its
                    rising with great rains and storms, it has acquired the epithet of <hi
                    rend="italic">aquo-</hi><hi rend="italic">sus,</hi> which is applied to it by
                    Virgil.</p>
