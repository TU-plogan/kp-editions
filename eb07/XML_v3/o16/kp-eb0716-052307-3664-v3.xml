                <p><label type="entry">OREGON <hi rend="smallcaps">Territory</hi></label>, a vast
                    extent of country belonging to the United States of North America, and situated
                    to the west of the Rocky Mountains. It is bounded on the north by the British
                    and Russian possessions, the limits of neither power having been very clearly
                    fixed. On the west it is bounded by the Pacific; on the south by Mexico and on
                    the east by the stupendous ridges of the Rocky Mountains, situated in the
                    territories of Arkansas and Missouri. It may be assumed as stretching between
                    the forty-first and fifty-fourth parallels of north latitude, and the
                    thirty-fourth and forty-eighth meridians of west longitude. The waters which
                    rise on the western declivities of the gigantic mountain chain bounding Oregon
                    on the east, flow into the Columbia, the Multnomah, and the lake Buene-ventura.
                    In general the elevated summits of the Rocky Mountains rise above the line of
                    perpetual congelation. Beyond the mountains the country descends by regular
                    belts, in the form of immense terraces, or descènding plains, disposed
                    regularly, the one below the other. Beyond the first plain, and between the
                    Rocky Mountains and the Pacific, is another extensive and high chain of
                    mountains, in which are the great falls of the Columbia; still farther to the
                    west, running parallel with the coast, and at the distance of one hundred and
                    fifty miles, is the third and last chain. The peaks of all these mountain ridges
                    are covered with perpetual snow. The loftiest of them have been named Mount
                    Baker, Mount Regnier, Mount St Helens, Mount Hood, and Mount Jefferson.</p>
                <p>The Columbia and its branches are the only rivers which have been explored to any
                    extent in the region of Oregon. This noble river, sometimes named after the
                    territory, has its head waters near those of the Missouri, and it collects
                    innumerable tributary streams throughout a great extent along the western ridges
                    of the Rocky Mountains. Immediately after it emerges from these, its current
                    becomes broad and deep, and having received Clarke’s and Lewis’ Rivers, which
                    flow into it on the south-east side, its breadth is enlarged to nine hundred and
                    sixty yards. It there takes a great bend to the south, and penetrates the second
                    mountain barrier. One hundred and thirty-six miles lower down are the great
                    falls, where the river descends fifty-seven feet in one rapid; but none of the
                    cataracts singly are above twenty feet. Below these falls it winds first to the
                    northwest, and then to the south-west, and intersects the third <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194563677" xml:id="kp-eb0716-3677-0524"/>chain of mountains, where it
                    is again compressed to one' hundred and fifty yards in breadth. Below this
                    rapid, which is distant one hundred and eighty miles from the Pacific, it meets
                    the tide, and from this point it has a broad estuary to the sea. Sixty miles
                    below the rapids, the Wallamat or Multnomah, a large tributary, flows in from
                    the north-east; and this river, together with those of Clarke and Lewis,
                    constitute the three great tributary streams of the Columbia. Vessels of three
                    hundred tons may reach the Multnomah, and large sloops may ascend as high as the
                    tide. Above the rapids the navigation is good for sixty-five miles, when it is
                    interrupted by the long narrows; and higher up it is also interrupted by falls,
                    which renders about five miles of portage necessary to obviate these
                    obstructions to navigation. The river at the narrows, for upwards of three
                    miles, is compressed into a strait, not exceeding sixty or seventy yards in
                    breadth, the whole of which is a succession of boiling whirlpools. The Columbia
                    flows into the Pacific Ocean in latitude 46. 19. north, and longitude 123. 54.
                    west; and although its main sources are estimated at only eight degrees of
                    latitude from this, yet if we take into calculation its serpentine windings, its
                    course cannot be less than fifteen hundred miles. The mouth of this great river
                    is upwards of four miles wide, and, to the distance of thirty or forty miles
                    from its entrance into the sea, it is, properly speaking, a mere estuary,
                    indented by deep bays, so as to vary from three to seven miles in width. It is
                    rendered extremely intricate and dangerous by shoals reaching nearly from shore
                    to shore, on which at times the winds and currents produce foaming and
                    tumultuous breakers. The river proper, however, is only about half a mile wide
                    at its confluence with the sea, being narrowed by the contracting shores of the
                    estuary. The entrance from the Pacific is bounded on the southern side by a flat
                    sandy neck of land, stretching into the ocean, and commonly called Point Adams.
                    The opposite or northern side is Cape Disappointment, a kind of peninsula,
                    terminating in a steep knoll or promontory, crowned with a forest of pine-trees,
                    and connected with the mainland by a low and narrow neck. The Columbia River is,
                    for a considerable distance, seldom less than a mile in breadth; in some places
                    it is from two to five miles wide, and in others it forms lakes of very
                    considerable magnitude. The shores are generally bold and thickly wooded. Pine
                    in all its varieties predominates, and is mixed with white oak, ash, beech,
                    poplar, alder, crab, and cotton wood, with an undergrowth of briars and other
                    shrubs. Up to the rapids the river is covered with numerous islands, from one to
                    three miles in length, some of which present fine meadows, and others are well
                    wooded. Sand banks also prevail, and these, being so large and high as to be
                    laid bare at low water, materially obstruct the navigation of the river. In the
                    neighbourhood of these the shores are generally low, and present some fine flat
                    “bottoms” of meadow ground, bordered by a profusion of blackberry and other
                    wild-fruit shrubs; in the deep and narrow parts of the channel the shores are
                    bolder. The pine-tree declines considerably above the rapids, and is much more
                    equally mixed with other trees, amongst which the hazel occasionally
                    predominates. But in regard to size, the pine and the cedar are as gigantic at
                    the very source of the Columbia as they are on the shores of the Pacific. The
                    Columbia and its tributaries abound with the finest salmon, which seem in fact
                    to constitute the principal article of food of the savages who inhabit the
                    country to the west of the Rocky Mountains. Seals and other aquatic animals are
                    likewise abundant in this river, and the skins, which are exported to China,
                    constitute the chief article of trade. A number of the head streams of the
                    Missouri interlock with the waters of this river, as Wisdom River with Clarke’s
                    of the Columbia; and Jefferson of the Missouri with Lewis’s of the Columbia.
                    Clarke’s River has a course of between two and three hundred miles before it
                    unites with the Columbia. Lewis’s River is also a large and long tributary,
                    receiving in its course the North Fork and Kooskooskee, and, after winding six
                    hundred miles, it joins the Columbia by a mouth upwards of six hundred yards in
                    width. The current is very rapid. Its waters are deep, of a white colour, and
                    slightly tepid, in which respect Lewis River forms a marked contrast with the
                    Columbia, the waters of which are quite clear and cool. The latter river at this
                    place is upwards of one thousand yards wide, and the current descends at an even
                    rate of about four miles an hour. The two most important rivers which join the
                    Columbia below the rapids are, the Multnomah, which has been already mentioned,
                    and the Coweliskee. The general course of the former is a little to the eastward
                    of south. It runs through a low, well-wooded country, for upwards of sixty
                    miles, when the navigation is interrupted by a considerable fall, above which
                    the channel contracts, and the banks become higher and less wooded. The climate
                    on the shores of this river is remarkably mild, and not so moist as it is on the
                    coast. It possesses a rich and luxuriant soil, which yields an abundance of
                    fruits and roots; and amongst other herbs the tobacco plant has been discovered,
                    and found to be of excellent quality. The Indians here are of a pacific
                    character. There are no noxious reptiles, and beaver, deer, and elk are
                    plentiful. Indeed it is anticipated, that when Oregon shall become generally
                    colonized, the country about the Wallamat will be rendered one of the most
                    delightful districts to the westward of the Rocky Mountains. Little is known of
                    the Coweliskee. It enters the Columbia from the northward, about half a day’s
                    journey below the Wallamat. Its banks are high and thickly wooded, but its
                    current is much interrupted by rapids.</p>
                <p>Little information has been obtained regarding the geological features of this
                    vast expanse of country; but it is presumed that the western declivities of
                    these mountains are of primitive formation. The territory must have an abrupt
                    slope towards the Pacific, as it descends as much in six hundred miles to the
                    west, as it does in one thousand five hundred miles to the east. The summits of
                    the mountain ranges, being rugged rocks, the only covering of which is snow,
                    that remains during the greater part of the year, are necessarily sterile; but
                    these rocky chains embosom and shelter valleys of considerable fertility. The
                    timber which clothes the mountains consists of pine, spruce, fir, and the other
                    terebinthines. The terrace plains below have in general a fine soil, but they
                    are very scantily furnished with timber, except on the banks of the rivers. The
                    prairies are covered with grass and a profusion of beautiful flowers, the same
                    as on the eastern sides of the mountains. Amongst the prairie plants are found
                    various species of edible roots, which are used by the savages, in addition to
                    the immense quantities of salmon, which constitute their staple article of food.
                    Wild sage is not only a most abundant herb, but it grows to so large a size that
                    it is used as the chief article of fuel on these extensive plains. Deep and
                    thick forests of such evergreens as pine and hemlock stretch along the shore,
                    and extend a considerable way into the interior; and altogether it appears that
                    the region which lies between the Rocky Mountains and the Pacific Ocean
                    possesses in many parts a fertile soil, besides enjoying an agreeable climate.
                    Its southern, border, where it joins with Mexico is indeed remarkably mild. In
                    the year 1805 this region was explored by order of the American government; and
                    from the tables which were drawn up by Lewis and Clarke, the persons employed on
                    that service, a pretty correct idea may be formed of the meteorology, and
                    consequently of the climate, of the country in question. From September it
                    gradually became colder till the end of January, after which the rigour of the
                    winter abated, and by the end of <pb break="no" facs="nls:194563690"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0716-3690-0525"/>February it was “quite warm.” By the middle of
                    March plants appeared above ground, and put forth their leaves; and on the 30th
                    of that month, “grass was sixteen inches high in river bottoms.” It is not,
                    however, till the end of May that snow disappears from the high plains; and
                    about the beginning of June the river Columbia is at its greatest height, being
                    swelled by the melting of the snow on the mountains. Strawberries are ripe at
                    the end of this month, and July and August appear to be the season when fruits
                    and flowers arrive at full perfection. From other and more recent authorities we
                    learn that the summer is reckoned temperate, the thermometer never rising above
                    eighty degrees. Westerly winds prevail during the spring and early part of
                    summer, and they are succeeded by fresh breezes from the north-west. In the
                    month of October the southerly winds set in, bringing with them frequent rain.
                    The rainy season, which commences in this month, continues, with little
                    intermission, till April; and although the winters, as we have already observed,
                    are mild, the mercury in the thermometer seldom sinking below the freezing
                    point, yet the tempests of wind and rain are terrible. The sun is said to be
                    sometimes obscured for weeks, the brooks swell into roaring torrents, and the
                    country is threatened with a deluge.</p>
                <p>The foregoing observations regarding the climate, soil, and productions of
                    Oregon, apply chiefly to that part of the country which lies between the rapids
                    and the Pacific Ocean. Mr Ross Cox, who spent several years in this region,
                    informs us, that from the falls to the land of the Spokans, a distance of about
                    five hundred miles, the summers are excessively hot, and the winters intensely
                    cold, yet the climate is withal remarkably healthy, and, during these seasons,
                    subject to but little variation. The soil is unproductive, consisting chiefly of
                    a light yellowish sandy clay. The plains are covered with a short kind of grass,
                    mixed with prickly pears, wormwood, and tufts of long, coarse grass, from three
                    to five feet in height. Patches of clover are here and there visible, and in
                    their vicinity the chappallel and the camas or quamash roots are found. Wild
                    onions grow in considerable quantities along the banks of the river above the
                    falls. Cotton wood, small willow, sumac, furze, and sarsaparilla, are also
                    occasionally found; but from the falls to Spokan River, none of the larger trees
                    are met with. The principal animals are horses, small deer, prairie wolves, red
                    foxes, badgers, polecats, hares, and dogs. Otters are sometimes seen; but the
                    great staple animal of the American trapper, the beaver, is a stranger to this
                    particular district, whilst in other parts of the country it is frequently
                    found. The Indians affirm that buffaloes were formerly numerous, but, together
                    with the elk and the sheep, they have long since deserted the plains. No
                    rattle-snakes are seen below the falls; but at a short distance above them they
                    make their appearance, and are in some parts very numerous, as are also horned
                    lizards and grasshoppers. Within the region of the Rocky Mountains vegetation on
                    the Columbia is rich and luxuriant, including all the varieties, from a profuse
                    growth of blackberry and wild cherry, to the stately pine and majestic cedar. On
                    the eastern side of the mountains, the reverse of this is observed, vegetation
                    being dwarfish and stunted. The difference is supposed to arise from the great
                    humidity of the atmosphere on the Columbia. There, westerly and south-westerly
                    winds prevail during eight months of the year, and are loaded with exhalations
                    from the Pacific. Such of the clouds as are not arrested by the high lands on
                    the coast, are stopped in their progress eastward by the lofty chain of the
                    Rocky Mountains, and thus serve to keep the climate perpetually moist.</p>
                <p>In the year 1811, a settlement was formed by American citizens at the mouth of
                    the Columbia, and called Astoria, alter Mr Astor, who conceived the idea of
                    forming an ex tensive fur dépôt in this part of America. Astoria was taken by
                    the British in 1813, and by them the name of the place was changed to that of
                    Fort George. The soil and productions of this portion of the Oregon territory
                    are thus described by Mr Ross Cox. “The soil in the valleys consists of a bed of
                    rich black mould, about six inches in depth, which covers a stratum of gray
                    earth, extremely cold. The latter lies on a layer of large gravelly sand; and
                    under all is a bed of hard flinty stones. On the high grounds, under a thin
                    covering of black mould, are found good quarry stones, well adapted for
                    building. There is a bank of white earth, resembling chalk, to the southward of
                    Point Adams; and farther on in the same direction, the Indians find red, green,
                    and yellow earths, and a species of heavy shining clay resembling lead-mine. No
                    limestone is found in the neighbourhood.” In June there are, amongst other wild
                    fruits, small white strawberries, of a sweet flavour; and these are followed by
                    red and amber raspberries, which grow upon bushes from ten to fifteen feet in
                    height. During the three months which follow, there are obtained considerable
                    quantities of blueberries, blackberries, wild cherries, gooseberries, wild
                    pears, and a species of bitter crab-apple. There is a shrub of a peculiar
                    description, which yields a fruit much esteemed by the natives. The country
                    likewise abounds in various nutritive roots, amongst which is a kind resembling
                    young onions, collected by the Indians in great quantities, which, after being
                    dried and pulverized, are made into loaves, and laid up for seasons of scarcity.
                    The principal quadrupeds are the elk, the red deer, the black-tailed deer; the
                    black, brown, and grizzly bear, the last of which is extremely ferocious; the
                    wolf, lynx, panther, tiger-cat, wild cat, marmot, fox, beaver, land-otter,
                    sea-otter, musk-rat, wood-rat, and the horse. White bears are occasionally
                    killed on the coast to the northward of the Columbia, but they are scarce. The
                    most remarkable of the feathered tribes are the black, brown, and nun eagle, the
                    hawk, pelican, cormorant, swan, heron, crane, bustard, gray and white goose,
                    various species of wild duck, and other water-game. In some parts, the
                    humming-bird and bee, in great numbers, banquet during the summer months amongst
                    the wild flowers and aromatic herbs. The trees most common in the neighbourhood
                    of Astoria are the cedar, spruce, pine, alder, and some others equally valuable.
                    The cedars are from twenty to thirty feet in circumference, and proportionally
                    high. The alders also are extremely large; and ash and oak, the former of a
                    tolerable size, are found a few leagues above the fort.</p>
                <p>The rivers and the lakes are most abundantly furnished with fish of various
                    kinds. In the spring months they swarm with immense quantities of small fish
                    resembling pilchards, which are smoke-dried, and form an important article of
                    barter with the upper Indians for roots. Prime sturgeon, which attains an
                    enormous size, abound in the months of August and September; but the grand
                    staple is salmon, the chief fishing of which is at the “long narrows,” already
                    mentioned, where the river, compressed into a channel from fifty to one hundred
                    feet in breadth, boils and roars with great fury for a distance of three miles.
                    In the spring of the year, when the water is high, the salmon ascend the river
                    in incredible numbers. As they pass through this narrow strait, the Indians,
                    standing upon the rocks, or on the end of wooden stages projecting from the
                    banks, scoop them up with small nets distended on hoops, and attached to long
                    handles, and cast them ashore. They are then cured and packed in a peculiar
                    manner. After being disembowelled, they are exposed to the sun on scaffolds
                    erected on the river-banks. When sufficiently dry, they are pounded fine between
                    two stones, pressed into the smallest compass, and packed in baskets or bales of
                    grass matting, about two feet in length and one in diameter, <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194563703" xml:id="kp-eb0716-3703-0526"/>lined with the cured skin of
                    a salmon. Packages are then made, each containing twelve of these bales, and
                    being well wrapped up and secured, they are placed in dry situations, and again
                    covered with matting. Each of these packages contains from ninety to a hundred
                    pounds of dried fish, which in this state will keep sound for several years. At
                    the head of the long narrows the Indians had some years ago, and have still, it
                    is presumed, their principal trading mart or emporium. Here the salmon caught in
                    the neighbouring rapids are “warehoused,” to await customers. Hither the tribes
                    from the mouth of the Columbia repair with the fish of the sea-coast, the roots,
                    berries, and especially the wappatoo, gathered in the lower parts of the river,
                    together with goodsand trinkets obtained from the ships which visit the coast,
                    or from the colonists. Hither also the tribes from the Rocky Mountains bring
                    down horses, bear grass, quamash, and other commodities of the interior. The
                    trade is of course pursued on the primitive principle of barter, the merchant
                    fisherman acting as middleman or factor.</p>
                <p>Although only a comparatively small portion of Oregon, and that chiefly situated
                    on the banks of the great river, has been described, the greater part of the
                    territory being still an unexplored wilderness, yet from this partial account we
                    are induced to form a favourable opinion of the country. Wood appears to abound
                    on the banks of the rivers, but many of the immense prairies of which the
                    interior principally consists are nearly destitute of it, being chiefly covered
                    with a coarse grass, and a prodigious growth of prickly pear, and other shrubs.
                    Occasionally, however, there intervene bright green patches intermixed with wild
                    flowers, and gently rising eminences, partially covered with clumps of small
                    trees, which give an agreeable variety to the face of the country. Lewis and
                    Clarke give a very pleasing account of what they term the great Columbian
                    valley. It is sixty miles in width, and extends far to the south-south-east,
                    between parallel ridges of mountains, which bound it on the east and west.
                    Through the centre of this valley flows the Wallamat, which has already been
                    described as traversing for several hundred miles a still unviolated wilderness.
                    The sheltered situation of this immense valley has an obvious effect upon the
                    climate, as might be expected. It is represented as a region of great beauty and
                    luxuriance, with lakes, and pools, and green meadows, shaded by noble groves.
                    Various Indian tribes are said to reside in this valley, and all along the banks
                    of the Wallamat. There is another place called Oakinagan, of which Mr Ross Cox
                    gives a very flattering description. It is a point of land three miles in length
                    by two in breadth, formed by the confluence of the river Oakinagan with the
                    Columbia. This small spot is enclosed at the upper end by a chain of hills,
                    within which the rattlesnakes never intrude. The climate here is highly
                    salubrious, the soil is fertile, producing immense quantities of sarsaparilla;
                    the horses are abundant, and ample facilities exist for water-carriage. The
                    native Indians who inhabit the peninsula are an honest, quiet, inoffensive
                    tribe, whose chief occupation is catching and curing salmon, and hunting the
                    deer and beaver. This was reckoned an eligible situation for a fort, and here
                    one has accordingly been erected.</p>
                <p>There is a district called <hi rend="smallcaps">New Caledonia,</hi> generally
                    included in the territory of Oregon, of which a short account is requisite in
                    this place. It extends from north latitude 51° 30 ’ to about 56°. The principal
                    trading post is called Alexandria, which is built on the banks of Fraser’s
                    River, in latitude 53° north. The country in its immediate vicinity presents a
                    beautiful and picturesque appearance. The banks of the river are somewhat low;
                    but at a little distance inland, elevations, partially diversified by groves of
                    fir and poplar, raise their heads above the general level.</p>
                <p>This region is full of small lakes, rivers, and marshes. It extends about ten
                    days’ journey in a north and north-east direction. To the south and south east
                    the Atnah or Chin Indian country extends about one hundred miles; on the east
                    there is a chain of lakes, and the mountains bordering Thompson’s River; whilst
                    to the westward and north-west lie the lands of the Naskotinsand Clinches. The
                    principal rivers are Fraser’s, Quesnel’s, Rough Poplar, Chilcotin,and West Road.
                    Of these, Fraser’s River only is navigable. It receives the waters of Quesnel’s
                    and West Poplar Rivers, which issue from small lakes to the westward. The lakes
                    and rivers abound in fish, such as salmon, trout, sucker, and the like. The soil
                    is thin and poor, and the vegetation here is considerably inferior to that on
                    the Columbia. On the banks of the chief river, and in the interior, the trees
                    consist of poplar, cypress, alder, cedar, birch, and different species of fir,
                    spruce, and willow. There are some wild fruits, and edible and medicinal roots,
                    but not at all so plentifully distributed as in other parts of the territory. A
                    number of valuable minerals are found in New Caledonia, including coal in
                    considerable quantities. There have also been discovered rock-crystal, cobalt,
                    talc, iron, marcasites of a gold colour, marble and limestone, quartz and
                    granite. The animal kingdom does not differ so much from that which
                    characterises the banks of the Columbia, as to require specific mention. Spring
                    commences in April, when the wild flowers begin to bud, and from this period to
                    the latter end of May the weather is delightful. In June it rains incessantly,
                    with strong southerly and easterly winds. During the months of July and August
                    the heat is very great; and in September the fogs are so dense that it is quite
                    impossible to distinguish the opposite side of the river any morning before ten
                    o’clock. October gives indications of the approach of winter; and in January the
                    cold is sometimes most intense. In general, however, the climate may be
                    characterised as neither unhealthy nor unpleasant. The natives prosecute the
                    salmon fishery to a considerable extent, and their mode of catching them is very
                    similar to that already described. Large-sized sturgeon are occasionally taken,
                    but this fish is not relished by the natives.</p>
                <p>Of the various Indian tribes who still inhabit the immense tract of country which
                    we have described, our limits permit us to present only a very brief notice.
                    Their number has been estimated at about 140,000, and they are distributed into
                    a great many tribes, which often engage in war with each other. Many of them are
                    excellent hunters; and the mode of fishing and preparing the article for the
                    market shows a practised ingenuity seldom evinced by the aborigines of America.
                    There are striking contrarieties of character between the Indian tribes; some of
                    them being pugnacious and bloodthirsty, and others of a comparatively mild and
                    inoffensive disposition. Their diet and their mode of living also vary
                    considerably, but they all chiefly subsist on the fish of the rivers, and the
                    native roots of the soil. For some years a settlement of fur traders, called
                    Astoria, has existed in Oregon. The chief intercourse of this place is with
                    China. The question of settling this delightful country permanently has been
                    more than once debated in Congress; and were such settlements authorized, and
                    rendered secure by the requisite military establishments, there can be no doubt
                    but it would receive large accessions of emigrants. This region is claimed by
                    the United States, on the ground of priority of discovery, examination, and
                    occupation. It was certainly first discovered by the Spaniards, but they made no
                    attempt either to explore or settle it. Its rediscovery belongs to Gray, an
                    American, who entered the mouth of the Columbia in 1790-1, the river being
                    called after the ship which he commanded. Subsequently it has been explored by
                    navigators belonging to Great Britain, as well as to the United States. <hi
