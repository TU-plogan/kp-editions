                    significant corrections to the OCR text, predominantly in cases of confusing "c"

                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                <p><label type="entry">OLDHAM</label>, one of those towns which, within the present
                    generation, have grown up with rapidity since the establishment of the cotton
                    manufacture. It is situated in the hundred of Salford, in the county of
                    Lancaster, eight miles from Manchester, and 186 from London. It stands on the
                    river Medlock, very near the source of that and of another stream called the
                    Irk, in a district abounding in coal. Oldham had been created into a
                    market-town; and was by the reform act constituted a borough, with the power of
                    returning two members to the House of Commons. It is parochially united with
                    Prestwick, and these places comprehend ten townships, extending over 21,160
                    acres, with a population, in 1831, of 67,579 persons. The whole is a <pb

                    district, making fustians and spinning cotton yarn, and also haying a great
                    trade in making hats. The town of Oldham is, for the most part, of very recent
                    erection, containing many large piles of buildings destined for manufacturing
                    purposes, and a proportional number of small dwellings for the workmen; but all
                    are discoloured by the smoke which issues from numerous steam-engines, few of
                    the proprietors of which reside within the town. It has a fine large parish
                    church, and, as is usual with such a population, a very great variety of places
                    of worship for the several discordant and dissenting sects. At the first
                    election for this borough, it was distinguished by its selection of Mr Cobbett
                    as one of its representatives. The population of the township of Oldham amounted
                    in the year 1801 to 12,024, in 1811 to 16,690, in 1821 to 21,662,"and in 1831 to
                    32,381.</p>

                    poet of the seventeenth century, was educated under his father, a nonconformist
                    minister, and then sent to Edmund Hall in Oxford. He afterwards became usher to
                    the free school at Croydon in Surrey, where he received a visit from the Earls
                    of Rochester and Dorset, Sir Charles Sedley, and other persons of distinction,
                    merely on account of some verses of his which they had seen in manuscript. He
                    was successively tutor to the sons of several gentlemen; and having saved a
                    small sum of money, he came to London, where, being an agreeable companion, he
                    became a perfect votary to the bottle. He was quickly found out by the noblemen
                    who had visited him at Croydon, and who made him acquainted with Dryden, He
                    lived mostly with the Earl of Kingston, at Holme Pierr-point. in
                    Nottinghamshire, where he died of the smallpox in 1683, in the thirtieth year of
                    his age. His acquaintance with learned authors appears, by his satires against
                    the Jesuits, to have been considerable; and Dryden esteemed him highly. His
                    works, which are printed in two vols. 12mo, consist chiefly of satires, odes,
                    translations, paraphrases of Horace and other authors, elegiac verses,
                    imitations, parodies, and familiar epistles.</p>
