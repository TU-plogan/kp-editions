                    significant corrections to the OCR text, predominantly in cases of confusing "c"
                    and "e." Isolates 90 entries that were mistakenly included at the end of prior
                    entries in v1 and v2. Normalizes ordinal numbers. Separates metadata in
                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,
                    the end fragment is now joined to the start fragment, making a machine-readable
                    word.</change>

                    commonly called the Good Lord Cobham, was born in the reign of Edward III. He
                    obtained his peerage by marrying the heiress of that Lord Cobham who had
                    strenuously opposed the tyranny of Richard II.; and, with the estate and title
                    of his father-in-law, he seems to have acquired the patriotic and independent
                    spirit for which that nobleman was distinguished. By his means, the statute
                    against provisors was revived, and guarded with more severe penalties than ever;
                    and he was also one of the leaders of the party who, having drawn up a number of
                    articles against the corruptions which then prevailed amongst ecclesiastics,
                    presented them in the form of a remonstrance to the Commons. He was at great
                    pains in collecting and transcribing the works of Wickliffe, which he dispersed
                    amongst the people; and he sent a number of his disciples as itinerant preachers
                    into various parts of the country. In the reign of Henry IV. he commanded an
                    English army in France, at that time distracted by the contentions of the two
                    factions of Orleans and Burgundy; and, in this capacity, he compelled the Duke
                    of Orleans to raise the siege of Paris. In the reign of Henry V. he was accused
                    of heresy, the growth and extension of which was mainly attributed to his
                    influence. The king having a favour for Lord Cobham, who held a domestic office
                    at court, delayed the prosecution, and kindly undertook, by reasoning and
                    expostulation, to reclaim him from his errors. But the attempt proved abortive.
                    “Next to God,” said his lordship, “I profess obedience to my king; but as to the
                    spiritual dominion of the pope, I could never see upon what foundation it is
                    claimed, nor can I pay him any obedience;” and he added, “It is as sure as God’s
                    word is true, he is the great Antichrist foretold in holy writ.” This answer,
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:194561194" xml:id="kp-eb0716-1194-0333"/>so different
                    from what had been expected, deeply offended the king, who, turning away in
                    visible displeasure, withdrew his favour from Cobham, and left him to the
                    censures of the church, which speedily overtook him. Being summoned to appear
                    before the archbishop, he disobeyed the citation, and was excommunicated on the
                    ground of contumacy. Reckless in exposing himself to danger, he seems to have
                    wanted the courage to confront it boldly when it appeared in a definite shape.
                    Hoping to avoid the impending storm, he waited upon the king with a confession
                    of his faith in writing; but whilst he was in the royal presence, an officer of
                    the ecclesiastical court entered, and cited him to appear before the archbishop,
                    upon which he was immediately conveyed a prisoner to the Tower. When brought
                    before the proper tribunal, he read his opinion of the several articles in
                    regard to which he supposed that he had been called in question, particularly
                    the eucharist, images, penance, and pilgrimages; but he was informed, that in
                    some things he had not been sufficiently explicit in stating his particular
                    views; that on all these points the church had already decided, and by her
                    determinations all Christians ought to abide; that these determinations would be
                    given him as a direction of his faith; and that, in a few days, he must appear
                    again and state his opinions. The second examination, however, ended like the
                    first. Cobham declared that “he knew none holier than Christ and his apostles;
                    and that these determinations were surely none of theirs, as they were against
                    Scripture.” He was accordingly condemned as a heretic, and remanded to the
                    Tower; but he contrived to effect his escape from prison, and lay concealed in
                    Wales, until information reached the king at Eltham that about twenty thousand
                    Lollards had assembled for his destruction at St Giles, with Lord Cobham at
                    their head. A bill of attainder then passed against him, a price was set upon
                    his head, and a perpetual exemption from taxes promised to any town which should
                    secure him. After having spent four years in Wales, he was at length seized,
                    carried to London, and executed in St Giles’s Fields, in December 1417, with
                    circumstances of cruelty characteristic of the times.</p>
                <p>As a writer, Lord Cobham is only known by a piece entitled “Twelve Conclusions,
                    addressed to the Parliament of England,” at the end of the first book of which
                    are some monkish rhymes in Latin, which Bale has preserved. “A Brefe Chronycle
                    concerning the Examynacyon and Death of the blessed martyr of Christ, Syr Johan
                    Oldecastell, the Lorde Cobham, was also published by Bale, and reprinted under
                    the care of a Mr Lewis of Margate in 1729. Since that time the life of Lord
                    Cobham has been written by Mr Gilpin, who describes him as a person of uncommon
                    parts and varied talents, well qualified either for the cabinet or the field; as
                    possessing acquirements equal to his parts; and, besides, as remarkable for his
                    ready and poignant wit in conversation. “It was "his thirst of knowledge,” adds
                    his biographer, “which first brought him acquainted with the opinions of
                    Wickliffe. The novelty of them engaged his curiosity. He examined them as a
                    philosopher, and in the course of his examination became a Christian.” <hi
