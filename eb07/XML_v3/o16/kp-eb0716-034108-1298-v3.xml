                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">ONTARIO</label>, one of the five great lakes which separate
                    Canada from the United States, and which are the wonder and admiration of the
                    world. It is situated between the parallels of 43. 10. and 44. 11. of north
                    latitude, and the meridians of 76. 25. and 79. 56. of west longitude, being the
                    most easterly of these vast inland seas. It lies nearly east and west, and is of
                    an elliptical shape, being a hundred and seventy-two miles in length by
                    fifty-nine and a quarter in extreme breadth, and having a circumference of about
                    four hundred and sixty-seven miles. The depth of water varies exceedingly, from
                    a few feet up to several hundreds. Towards the middle, attempts have been made
                    to reach the bottom with three hundred fathoms, without striking soundings. If
                    this be correct, the bottom must be very considerably below the level of the
                    Atlantic Ocean; for its surface is only two hundred and thirty-one feet above
                    tide-water at Three Rivers on the St Lawrence, and at Albany on the Hudson. The
                    appearance of the shores of Lake Ontario exhibit great diversity. Towards the
                    northeast part they are low, with numerous marshy places. To the north and
                    north-west they assume a grand and lofty character, but subside again on the
                    south to a very moderate elevation. Bordering the lake, the country is
                    everywhere covered with woods, through the numerous openings of which frequent
                    settlements are seen, imparting a pleasing effect, which is greatly enhanced by
                    the white cliffs of Toronto, and the remarkable high land over Presqu’île,
                    called the Devil’s Nose, on the north. The view on the <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194561311" xml:id="kp-eb0716-1311-0342"/>south is well relieved by
                    aback ground of hills, which, after forming the precipice of the cataract,
                    stretch away to the eastward. The crowning object of the prospect in this
                    direction is a conical eminence towering above the chain of heights, called
                    Fifty-Mile Hill, as denoting its distance from the town of Niagara. Along the
                    southern border of the lake is the celebrated ridge road, or alluvial way,
                    extending from Rochester on the Genessee, to Lewiston on the river Niagara,
                    eighty-seven miles. It is composed of common beech sand, and gravel-stones worn
                    smooth, and these are intermixed with small shells. Its general width is from
                    four to eight rods, and it is raised in the middle with a handsome crowning
                    arch, the general surface preserving a very uniform level. It is between a
                    hundred and twenty and a hundred and thirty feet above Lake Ontario, whence it
                    is distant from six to ten miles.</p>
                <p>A great number of rivers flow into Lake Ontario. Towards the western part it
                    receives the Niagara, and from this point to the St Lawrence River, which flows
                    from the north-east part of the lake, the line dividing Canada from the United
                    States is in the middle of the lake, so that nearly one half of it is in the
                    state of New York. From this state it receives the Genessee, Oswego, and Black
                    Rivers, besides a number of smaller streams, all of which have a sand bar across
                    the entrance. There are some fine bays and inlets, where vessels of every
                    description may find protection in bad weather. The largest of these are
                    Chaumont, Sodus, Little Sodus, Toronto, and Braddocks, on the United States’
                    side of the lake; and Quinte, Burlington, and many other large ones, on the
                    Canada side. Burlington Bay is both spacious and secure; and the disadvantages
                    of a narrow entrance and shallow water have been obviated by a canal cut across
                    the breach, which has opened an access to the bay for lake vessels, and made it
                    an important and interesting harbour. Hungry Bay is very conspicuous, affording
                    good anchorage and safe shelter amongst the islands to ships of the largest size
                    at all seasons. York and Kingston harbours belonging to Great Britain, and
                    Sacket’s harbour to the Americans, possess every natural advantage, and are
                    considered as the best upon the lake. The two latter are strongly fortified,
                    being the arsenals where ships of war, even of the first rate, have been
                    constructed by both powers, and where were fitted out those powerful hostile
                    squadrons which conferred so much consequence on the naval operations in this
                    quarter. Lake Ontario is navigated by sloops, schooners, and steamboats; and the
                    sea is frequently so rough, and swept by such heavy squalls of wind, that
                    steam-boats of common size were at first not considered as fit to traverse its
                    waters with comfort and safety. Of the many islands situated at the eastern end
                    of the lake, Wolf or Grand Island, lying abreast of Kingston, is the most
                    extensive, and, by being placed at the commencement of the Cataraqui River,
                    forms two channels leading into it, which bear the names of the North or
                    Kingston Channel, and the South or Carleton Island Channel. Stony and Grenadier
                    Islands are situated at the eastern end, and there are some at Quinte Bay in
                    Canada. Lake Ontario abounds with excellent fish of various kinds, the most
                    celebrated of which are the Oswego bass, the salmon, trout, and salmon-trout,
