                    celebrated Hebrew of Spain. He was carefully educated in Judaism by his parents,
                    who were Jews, though they outwardly professed themselves Catholics; abstaining
                    from the practice of their religion in every thing, except only the fast of
                    expiation, in the month Tisis or September. Orobio studied the scholastic
                    philosophy as taught in Spain, and became so skilled in it that he was appointed
                    professor of metaphysics in the university of Salamanca. Afterwards, however,
                    having applied himself to the study of physic, he practised with success that
                    art at Seville, till, being accused of Judaism, he was thrown into the prison of
                    the Inquisition, and suffered the most dreadful cruelties, in order to extort a
                    confession. He tells us himself that he was put into a dark dungeon, so narrow
                    that he could scarcely turn round in it; and he suffered so many hardships that
                    his brain began to be disturbed. He talked to himself often in this way: “Am I
                    indeed that Don Balthasar Orobio, who walked freely about in Seville, who was
                    entirely at ease, and who had the blessings of a wife and children ?” Sometimes
                    he supposed that his past life had been but a dream, that the dungeon where he
                    then lay was his true birthplace, and that it would to all appearance prove also
                    the place of his death. At other times, as he had a very metaphysical head, he
                    first formed arguments, and then resolved them; thus at once performing the
                    different parts of opponent, respondent, and moderator. In this whimsical way he
                    amused himself from time to time, and constantly denied that he was a Jew. After
                    having appeared twice or thrice before the Inquisitors, his treatment was
                    varied. At the bottom of a subterranean vault, lighted by two or three small
                    torches, he was brought before two persons, one of them judge of the
                    Inquisition, and the other secretary, who, having asked him whether he would
                    confess the truth, protested, that in case of a criminal denial, the Holy Office
                    would not be deemed the cause of his death, if he should expire under the
                    torments, but that it must be imputed entirely to his own obstinacy. The
                    executioner then stripped off his clothes, tied his feet and hands with a strong
                    cord, and set him upon a little stool, whilst he passed the cord through some
                    iron buckles which were fixed in the wall; after which, the stool having been
                    drawn away, he remained hanging by the cord, which the executioner still drew
                    tighter and tighter, to make him confess, till a surgeon assured the court of
                    examiners that he could not possibly bear more without expiring. These cords put
                    him to exquisite torture, by cutting into the flesh, and making the blood burst
                    from under his nails. As there was certainly danger that the cords would tear
                    off' his flesh, care was taken to gird him about the breast with bands, which,
                    however, were drawn so very tight that he would have run the risk of being
                    suffocated, if he had not held in his breath whilst the executioner put the
                    bands round him; by which device his lungs had room enough to perform their
                    functions. In the agony of his sufferings, he was told that this was but the
                    beginning of his torments, and that he would better confess before they
                    proceeded to extremities. Orobio added further, that in order to frighten him,
                    the executioner, placing himself on a small ladder, frequently let it fall
                    against the shin-bones of his legs, and the staves being sharp, created
                    exquisite pain. At last, after a confinement of three years, the Inquisitors,
                    finding themselves baffled by his perseverance in denying his religion, ordered
                    his w ounds to be cured, and discharged him. As soon as he had obtained his
                    liberty, he resolved to quit the I Spanish dominions; and, proceeding to France,
                    he was 1 made professor of physic at Toulouse. The theses which be prepared as
                    candidate for this place treated of putrefaction; and he maintained them with a
                    metaphysical subtlety which embarrassed all his competitors. He resided for some
                    time in this city, still outwardly professing the Catholic religion; but at
                    last, weary of dissembling, he repaired to Amsterdam, where he was circumcised,
                    took the name of Isaac, and professed Judaism, still continuing, however, to
                    practise physic, in which he was much esteemed. Upon the publication of
                    Spinoza’s work, he began to despise a system the falsehood of which he quickly
                    discovered; and when Bredenburg’s answer to it came to his hands, Orobio, being
                    persuaded that the writer, in refuting Spinoza, had also admitted some
                    principles which tended to atheism, took up his pen against both, and published
                    a piece entitled <hi rend="italic">Certamen Philosophicum.</hi> But the dispute
                    in which he engaged with the celebrated Philip Limborch against the Christian
                    religion made the greatest noise. In this he exerted the utmost force of his
                    metaphysical genius, and conducted himself with great temper. The three papers
                    which he wrote on the occasion were afterwards printed by his antagonist, in an
                    account which he published of the controversy, under the title of <hi rend="italic">Amica Collatio</hi><hi rend="italic">cum Judaeo.</hi> Orobio died
                    in the year 1687.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
