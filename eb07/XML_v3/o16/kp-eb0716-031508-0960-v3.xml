                <p><label type="entry">OATH</label>, an affirmation or promise, accompanied with an
                    invocation of God to witness what we say, and with an imprecation of his
                    vengeance, or a renunciation of his grace, if what we affirm be false, or what
                    we promise be not performed. The word is a corruption of the Saxon <hi

                    called a <hi rend="italic">corporal oath,</hi> because, in the days of

                    Christi.</hi></p>
                <p>The laws of all civilized states have required the security of an oath for
                    evidence given in a court of justice, and on other occasions of high importance;
                    but the Quakers andf ’ some other sects refuse to swear on any occasion, even at
                    the requisition of a magistrate, and in a court of justice. The text of
                    Scripture upon which the Quakers principally rest their argument for the
                    unlawfulness of all swearing, is our Saviour’s prohibition, “I say unto you,
                    swear not at all.” But it is only in ordinary conversation, and by no means in
                    courts of justice, that Christ prohibits his followers from swearing at all.
                    There is no evidence whatever, that swearing by heaven, by the earth, by
                    Jerusalem, or by their own heads, was the form of a judicial oath in use amongst
                    the Jews. On the contrary, we are told by Maimonides, that “if any man swear by
                    heaven or <pb break="no" facs="nls:194560973" xml:id="kp-eb0716-0973-0316"/>by
                    earth, yet this is not an oath ;” which, surely, he could not have said had such
                    been the forms of judicial swearing. Indeed the Jews could not have admitted
                    such forms into their courts without expressly violating the law of Moses, who
                    commands them to “Fear Jehovah their God, to serve him, and to swear by his
                    name.” But the Jews, as every one knows, had such a reverence for the name of
                    Jehovah, that they would not pronounce it on slight occasions, and therefore
                    could not swear by that name in common conversation. Hence, to gratify their
                    propensity to common swearing, they invented such oaths as, by heaven, by earth,
                    by Jerusalem, by the life of thy head, and such like, and by this contrivance
                    they thought to avoid the guilt of profaning the name of Jehovah. These,
                    however, being appeals to insensible objects, either had no meaning, or were in
                    fact, as our Saviour justly argues, oaths by that God whose creatures they were;
                    so that the Jew who swore them was still guilty of profaneness towards the very
                    Jehovah whose name his superstition would not permit him to pronounce. But what
                    puts it beyond all doubt that the use of judicial oaths is not wholly prohibited
                    in the gospel, is the conduct of our Saviour himself, as well as that of his
                    apostle St Paul. When Jesus was simply asked by the high priests, what it was
                    which certain false witnesses testified against him, we are told by the
                    evangelists, that “he held his peace ;” but being adjured by the living God to
                    declare whether he was the Christ, the Son of God, or not, he immediately
                    answered the high priest, without objecting to the oath (for such it was) upon
                    which he was examined. St Paul, in his Epistle to the Romans, says, <hi
                    rend="italic">“</hi><hi rend="italic">God is my witness,</hi> that, without
                    ceasing, I make mention of you in my prayers ;” and to the Corinthians, still
                    more strongly, “<hi rend="italic">I call God for a record upon my soul,</hi>
                    that, to spare you, I came not as yet to Corinth.” Both these expressions are of
                    the nature of oaths; and the author of the Epistle to the Hebrews speaks of the
                    custom of swearing judicially without any mark of censure or disapprobation:
                    “Men verily swear by the greater; and an oath, for confirmation, is to them an
                    end of all strife.”</p>
                <p>But although a nation has an undoubted right to require the security of an oath
                    upon occasions of real importance, it is something worse than bad policy to
                    multiply oaths, and to hold out to the people temptations to perjure themselves.
                    The security which an oath affords depends entirely upon the reverence which
                    attaches to it in the mind of him by whom it is given; but that reverence is
                    much weakened by the frequency of oaths, and by the careless manner in which
                    they are too often administered. Paley observes, with truth, that “the levity
                    and frequency with which oaths are administered, has brought about a general
                    inadvertency to the obligation of them, which, both in a religious and political
                    view, is much to be lamented; and it merits,” continues he, “public
                    consideration, whether the requiring of oaths on so many frivolous occasions,
                    especially in the customs, and in the qualification for petty offices, has any
                    other effect than to make them cheap in the minds of the people. A pound of tea
                    cannot travel regularly from the ship to the consumer without costing half a
                    dozen oaths at least; and the same security for the due discharge of his office,
                    namely, that of an oath, is required from a churchwarden and an archbishop, from
                    a petty constable and the chief justice of England. Let the law continue its own
                    sanctions if they be thought requisite, but let it spare the solemnity of an
                    oath; and where it is necessary, from the want of something better to depend
                    upon, to accept a man’s bwn word or own account, let it annex to prevarication
                    penalties proportioned to the public consequence of the offence.”</p>
                <p>Besides the frequency of oaths, we have mentioned the irreverent manner in which
                    they are too often administered as one of the causes which make them cheap in
                    the esti mation of the people. In this view, the form of the oath, and the
                    ceremonies with which it is required to be taken, are of considerable
                    importance. “The forms of oaths in Christian countries,” says Palcy, “are very
                    different; but in none, I believe, worse contrived, either to convey the meaning
                    or to impress the obligation of an oath, than in England.” Oaths are either
                    assertory or promissory. Assertory oaths are required both to confirm our
                    veracity in evidence, and to give security to the public, that we believe
                    certain propositions conceived to be of public importance. An oath in evidence
                    binds the juror to declare what he knows to be true, and nothing but what he
                    knows to be true. An oath required to assure the public of our belief in the
                    truth of any proposition cannot, without the guilt of perjury, be taken by any
                    man, who, at the time of swearing, has the slightest doubt in his mind whether
                    the proposition be really true. Such an oath, however, though it unquestionably
                    requires the sincerity of the juror’s belief at the time when it is given,
                    cannot oblige him to continue in that belief as long as he may live; for belief
                    is not in any man’s power, being the necessary consequence of evidence, which
                    compels the assent of the mind, according as it appears to preponderate on the
                    one side or on the other. No man, therefore, can be justly accused of perjury
                    for holding opinions contrary to those which he may formerly have sworn to
                    believe; because his belief at the time of emitting his oath may have been the
                    necessary result of the evidence which then appeared before him, and his change
                    of opinion may have resulted with the same necessity from superior evidence
                    which had been since then thrown into the opposite scale, and made it
                    preponderate. On this account we cannot help thinking that all assertory oaths,
                    excepting such as are necessary to confirm testimony respecting facts, ought
                    either to be abolished, or expressed with great caution. Of truths intuitively
                    certain, or capable of rigid demonstration, no man of common sense can entertain
                    a doubt; and therefore the public never requires from individuals the solemnity
                    of an oath as an assurance of their believing such truths. But with respect to
                    the truth of propositions which admit of nothing superior to moral evidence upon
                    either side, a man of the most steady virtue may think differently at different
                    periods of his life; and in such cases, the effect of an oath, if it have any
                    effect, can only be either to shut the man’s eyes against the light, or to make
                    his integrity be causelessly questioned by those who may observe his change of
                    belief.</p>
                <p>Promissory oaths cannot, without the guilt of perjury, be given by him who, at
                    the time of swearing, knows that it will not be in his power to fulfil the
                    promise, or who does not seriously intend to fulfil it. A promissory oath
                    cannot, without great guilt, be given by any man, who at the time of swearing
                    believes the object of the promise to be in itself unlawful; for if he seriously
                    mean to fulfil his oath, he calls upon Almighty God to witness his intention to
                    commit a crime. Promissory oaths give to the public greater security than a
                    simple promise; because the juror having the thoughts of God and of religion
                    more upon his mind at the one time than .at the other, offends with a higher
                    hand, and in more open contempt of the divine power, knowledge, and justice,
                    when he violates an oath, than when he breaks a simple promise. Yet it is
                    certain that promissory oaths, though more solemn and sacred, cannot be binding
                    when the promise without an oathwould not be so, though in an inferior
                    degree.</p>
