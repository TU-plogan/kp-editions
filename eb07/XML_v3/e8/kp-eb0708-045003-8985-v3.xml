                <p><label type="entry">EDWARDS, <hi rend="smallcaps">Georoe</hi></label>, fellow of
                    the Royal and Antiquarian Societies, was born at Stratford, a hamlet belonging
                    to Westham in Essex, on the 3d of April 1693. After having spent some time at
                    school, he was put as apprentice to a tradesman in Fenchurch Street. His master,
                    who was eminent both for his piety and skill in the languages, treated him with
                    very great kindness; but about the middle of his apprenticeship an accident
                    happened which totally put a stop to the hopes of young Edwards advancing
                    himself in the way of trade. Dr Nicoas, a person of eminence<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193328998" xml:id="kp-eb0708-8998-0451"/> in the physical world, and a
                    relation of his master’s, happened to die. The doctor’s books were removed to an
                    apartment occupied by Edwards, who eagerly employed all his leisure hours, both
                    during the day and great part of the night, in perusing those which treated of
                    natural history, sculpture, painting, astronomy, and antiquities. The reading of
                    these books entirely deprived him of any inclination which he might have
                    formerly had for mercantile business, and he resolved to travel into foreign
                    countries. In 1716 he visited most of the principal towns in Holland, and in
                    about a month returned to England. Two years afterwards he took a voyage to
                    Norway, at the invitation of a gentleman who was disposed to be his friend, and
                    who was nephew to the master of the ship in which he embarked. At this time
                    Charles XII. was besieging Frederickshall, an operation which prevented our
                    young naturalist from making such excursions into the country as he would
                    otherwise have done, for the Swedes were very careful to intercept such
                    strangers as could not give a good account of themselves. But notwithstanding
                    all his precaution he was confined by the Danish guard, who supposed him to be a
                    spy employed by the enemy to procure intelligence of their designs. However, by
                    obtaining testimonials of his innocence, a release was granted. In 1718 he
                    returned to England, and next year he visited Paris by the way of Dieppe. During
                    his stay in France he made two journeys of one hundred miles each, the first to
                    Chalons in Champagne, in May 1720, and the second on foot to Orleans and Blois;
                    but an edict happening at that time to be issued for securing vagrants, in order
                    to transport them to America, as the banks of the Mississippi wanted population,
                    our author narrowly escaped a western voyage. On his arrival in England, Mr
                    Edwards closely pursued his favourite study of natural history, applying himself
                    to drawing and colouring such animals as fell under his notice. In this pursuit
                    he paid a strict attention to natural rather than to picturesque beauty. Birds
                    first engaged his particular attention; and having purchased some of the best
                    pictures of them, he was induced to make a few drawings of his own, which were
                    admired by the curious, who encouraged the young naturalist to proceed, by
                    paying a good price for his early labours. Amongst his first patrons and
                    benefactors may be mentioned Mr James Theobalds of Lambeth, a gentleman zealous
                    for the promotion of science. Being thus unexpectedly encouraged, he increased
                    in skill and assiduity, and, by application to his favourite pursuit, procured a
                    decent subsistence and a large acquaintance. However, he remitted his industry
                    in 1731, when, in company with two of his relations, he made an excursion to
                    Holland and Brabant, where he collected several scarce books and prints, and had
                    an opportunity of examining the original pictures of several great masters at
                    Antwerp, Brussels, Utrecht, and other cities. In December 1733, by the
                    recommendation of Sir Hans Sloane, then president of the College of Physicians,
                    he was chosen librarian to that body, and had apartments assigned him in the
                    college. This office wns peculiarly agreeable to his taste and inclination, as
                    he had the opportunity of a constant recourse to a valuable library filled with
                    scarce and curious books on the subject of natural history, which he so
                    assiduously studied. By degrees he became one of the most eminent ornithologists
                    in this or in any other country. His merit in this respect is too well known to
                    render it necessary to pronounce any eulogium on his performances; but it may be
                    observed, that he never trusted to others what he could perforin himself, and he
                    often found it so difficult to satisfy his own mind, that he frequently made
                    three or four drawings in order to delineate the object in its most lively
                    character, attitude, and representation. In the year 1743, the first volume of
                    the <hi rend="italic">History of Birds</hi> was published in quarto. As the
                    number of his subscribers exceeded even his most sanguine expectations, a second
                    volume appeared in 1747. The third volume was published in 1750; and in 1751
                    appeared the fourth volume. This being the last which he intended to publish at
                    that time, he seems to have considered it as the most perfect of his productions
                    in natural history; and therefore devoutly offered it up to the great God of
                    nature, in humble gratitude for all the good things which he had received from
                    Him in this world. Our author, in 1758, continued his labours under a new title,
                    that of <hi rend="italic">Gleanings of Natural History.</hi> A second volume of
                    the Gleanings was published in 1760. The third part, which formed the seventh
                    and last volume of his works, appeared in 1764. Thus our author, after a long
                    series of years, the most studious application, and the most extensive
                    correspondence in every quarter of the world, concluded a work which contains
                    engravings and descriptions of more than six hundred subjects in natural history
                    not before described or delineated. He likewise added a general index in French
                    and English, which was afterwards perfected with the Linnaean names, by Linnaeus
                    himself, who frequently honoured him with his friendship and correspondence.
                    Some time after Mr Edwards bad been appointed librarian to the Royal College of
                    Physicians, he was, on St Andrew’s Day, in the year 1750, presented by the
                    president and council of the Royal Society with the gold medal, the donation of
                    Sir Godfrey Copley, annually given on that day to the author of any new
                    discovery in art or nature, in consideration of his natural history just then
                    completed. A copy of this medal he had afterwards engraved, and placed under the
                    title in the first volume of his history. He was a few years afterwards elected
                    fellow of the Royal Society and of the Society of Antiquaries, London, and also
                    a member of many of the academies of sciences and learning in different parts of
                    Europe. In return for these honorary distinctions from learned bodies, he
                    presented elegantly-coloured copies of all his works to the Royal College of
                    Physicians, the Royal Society, the Society of Antiquaries, and to the British
                    Museum; and also to the Academy of Sciences at Paris, from which he received a
                    very polite and obliging letter of thanks by their then secretary Μ. Defouchy.
                    His collection of drawings, which amounted to upwards of nine hundred, were
                    purchased by the Earl of Bute. They contain a great number of British as well as
                    foreign birds, and other animals hitherto not accurately delineated nr
                    described. After the publication of the last work, having arrived at his
                    seventieth year, he found his sight beginning to fail, and his hand losing its
                    wonted steadiness. He retired front public employment to a little house which he
                    had purchased at Plaistow, previously to which he disposed of all the copies as
                    well as plates of his works. The conversation of a few select friends, and the
                    perusal of a few select books, were the amusement of the evening of his life;
                    and now and then he made an excursion to some of the principal cities in
                    England, particularly to Bristol, Bath, Exeter, and Norwich. Some years before
                    his death, the alarming depredation of a cancer, which baffled all the efforts
                    of medical skill, deprived him of the sight of one of his eyes; and he also
                    suffered much from the stone, to which at different periods of his life he had
                    been subject; but in the severest paroxysms of pain he was scarcely known to
                    utter a single complaint. Having completed his eightieth year, emaciated with
                    age and sickness, he died, deservedly lamented, on the 23d of July 1773.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Edwards,</hi><hi rend="italic">Bryan,</hi> the well-known
                    historian of the <hi rend="italic">West Indies,</hi> was born at Westbury, in
                    Wiltshire, on the 21st of May 1743. His father had a small paternal estate; <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193329011" xml:id="kp-eb0708-9011-0452"/> but as this did
                    not exceed L.100 per annum, he found it insufficient for the maintenance of a
                    numerous family, and endeavoured to improve his circumstances by dealing in corn
                    and malt. This hazardous trade proved, as it often does, only a means of more
                    deeply involving his affairs; and he died in 1756, leaving a widow and six
                    children in a very distressed situation. Mrs Edwards, however, had two opulent
                    brothers in the West Indies, the eldest of whom, Zachary Bayly, possessing a
                    princely fortune, and being of a very amiable and generous disposition,
                    undertook the support and education of young Edwards. He had already been placed
                    by his father at the school of Mr Foot, a dissenting clergyman at Bristol, where
                    he had been taught the elementary branches of education; but, for some reason
                    which he never was able to divine, that person was strictly prohibited from
                    initiating him in any branches of classical learning. He gave a species of
                    instruction, however, not usual in schools, and from which his pupil probably
                    derived the greatest benefit. He was accustomed to make the boys write letters,
                    or rather essays, on various subjects, such as the beauty and dignity of truth,
                    the obligations to a religious life, the benefits of good education, and the
                    like, giving them, where it appeared necessary, an outline of the arguments
                    which might be employed on the subject. When the papers were given in, he made
                    such observations as appeared proper, insisting at least that they should be
                    correct in point of grammar and orthography. These exercises gave occasion to
                    display the superior talents of Edwards, whose powers of elegant composition
                    already began to appear. He soon became the favourite of his master, who
                    liberally praised these youthful performances, and often transmitted them for
                    the gratification of his parents. They were entirely satisfied; but when the
                    care of liis education devolved on his uncle, the agent employed by him at
                    Bristol was much surprised to find an entire deficiency in classical knowledge,
                    and, imputing the blame to the master, removed him immediately to a French
                    boarding school in the same city. It is not said that he acquired here any great
                    portion of Greek and Latin, but he became master of the French language, and
                    having access to an extensive circulating library, cultivated a taste for
                    reading which adhered to him throughout the whole of his future life.</p>
                <p>In 1759, another uncle, the younger brother of him under whose care he had
                    hitherto been, arrived in England. He, too, was possessed of an ample fortune,
                    became member of parliament, first for Abingdon, and afterwards for his native
                    town, and set up a splendid establishment in London. He appeared quite disposed
                    to befriend young Edwards, and even took the latter to reside with him; but the
                    nephew observes, that, after enumerating his external advantages, he had nothing
                    else to say in favour of his uncle. What the bad qualities were which drew forth
                    so unfavourable a sentence we are not informed; but in a few months they
                    separated, and Edwards went out to his other uncle. In this friend he seems to
                    have found every thing he could desire; the most enlightened mind, the sweetest
                    temper, and the most generous disposition. To this was added a truly paternal
                    regard for himself, which was returned with all the warmth of filial affection.
                    His uncle, finding him possessed of literary talents, but deficient in classical
                    acquirements, engaged a Mr Teale, a clergyman, and formerly master of a free
                    grammar-school, to reside in his house, and give him the instruction of which he
                    stood in need. This choice proved most acceptable to Edwards; he found in Mr
                    Teale a man of extensive information, and one, too, possessing considerable
                    taste in poetry. He viewed him, therefore, as a companion rather than as a
                    teacher; but this relation between the tutor and pupil, however agreeable to
                    both, was not favourable for instilling the dry principles of grammar and
                    prosody. A much larger proportion of their time was spent in tasting the
                    beauties of Dryden and Pope, and in laughing at the comic sallies of Molière. Mr
                    Edwards, upon the whole, acquired, during this period, small Latin and less
                    Greek; but he continued to practise composition, both in prose and verse; and
                    the two companions sent occasional pieces to the colonial newspapers.</p>
                <p>The time was now coming when Mr Edwards’ talents were to be exercised in a wider
                    sphere. His uncle dying, bequeathed to him his property; and in 1773 he became
                    heir to the much larger estate of Mr Hume, also of Jamaica. His wealth and
                    talents united, now entitled him to take a lead in the political concerns of the
                    island. In 1784 he published <hi rend="italic">Thoughts on the Proceedings of
                    Government respecting the Trade of the West India Islands with the United States
                    of America.</hi> This was followed by a speech delivered at a free conference
                    between the Council and Assembly at Jamaica, held on the 25th of November 1789,
                    on the subject of Mr Wilberforce’s propositions in the House of Commons
                    concerning the slave trade. It was in 1793, however, that he published his great
                    work, on which he had been many years engaged, entitled <hi rend="italic"
                    >History, Civil and Commercial of the British Colonies in the West Indies,</hi>
                    2 vols. 4to. He begins the work by giving a view of the original inhabitants of
                    the West Indies, their manners, institutions, and the means by which they have
                    been so entirely exterminated. This was followed by a sketch of the revolutions
                    through which these islands have passed since the first European invasion. He
                    gives next a geographical and statistical description of each particular island.
                    He treats finally, at great length, of the government, the social state, and
                    above all the commerce, of this remarkable region. In the course of the
                    discussion, he enters fully into its relations with the African coast and the
                    negro slave trade. Mr Edwards, as a great and long-resident proprietor, was
                    almost inevitably led to be a supporter of this traffic. He reasons, however, in
                    a liberal and candid manner on the question, and does not even attempt to deny
                    the extent of the evils with which it was accompanied. He only insists that
                    these evils have been overrated; and that Great Britain, by renouncing it whilst
                    it was still prosecuted by the other nations of Europe, would ruin her own
                    colonies, without doing any thing to improve the condition of the Africans. In
                    1796 he published, in one volume quarto, a <hi rend="italic">History of St
                    Domingo,</hi> an island which had excited a deep interest, in consequence of the
                    insurrection of the slaves, and the consequent establishment of an independent
                    negro government. In 1801 a new edition of both these works was published, in

                    West Indies.</hi> A fifth edition issued from the press in the year 1819. When
                    Park returned from his celebrated journey, Mr Edwards, from his oral
                    information, drew up a report of it. which was submitted to the African Society,
                    and published in their <hi rend="italic">Transactions.</hi> Mr Park afterwards
                    incorporated the greater part of this into the general narrative of his <hi
                    rend="italic">Travels,</hi> in preparing which he availed himself much of the
                    assistance and suggestions of Mr Edwards. It has beer currently said that this
                    narrative was entirely written by Mr Edwards; but as this assertion has been
                    pointedly contradicted by Park, who has elsewhere shown respectable talents for
                    composition, it can only be understood in the limited sense which has now been
                    stated. It appears, however, that Mr Park was induced, by Mr Edwards’ influence,
                    to give rather a more favourable view of the trade in slaves than reflection
                    afterwards led him to sanction.</p>
                <p>Mr Edwards, after his removal to England, took up his residence at Polygon, near
                    Southampton; and in 1796 he <pb break="no" facs="nls:193329024"

                    Grampound, which he continued to represent till his death, which took place on
                    the 15th of July 1800. He left a short narrative of his life, which was prefixed
                    to the edition of his history published in 1801. <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >(e.)</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Edwards,</hi><hi rend="italic">Jonathan,</hi> a
                    celebrated American metaphysician and divine, was born on the 5th of October
                    1703, at Windsor, in the province of Connecticut. His family had originally
                    emigrated from England in the reign of Queen Elizabeth. His father, Mr Timothy
                    Edwards, was a clergyman of great piety and respectability, and by his mother he
                    was grandson of Mr Solomon Stoddard, a noted and zealous divine of Northampton.
                    Jonathan was accordingly reared in the bosom of Puritanism, and all his ideas
                    were early imbued with the cast of thought which was native to the stock from
                    which he had sprung. There was something indeed not a little singular in the
                    prevailing character of religion in America in those days. A conversion seems to
                    have been a regular era in a man’s life, which could be fixed down to a date, as
                    much as his coming of age or his being married. A very curious document remains
                    of Jonathan’s conversion, the whole steps and progress of which he has detailed
                    for the behoof of his children; and it is a document which, even amidst all its
                    frequent weakness and extravagance, impresses us with a high sense of the genius
                    and of the worth of this remarkable man. We cannot avoid giving our readers a
                    little insight into it, especially as it contains some passages of deep feeling
                    and sensibility, which form a striking contrast to the controversial hardness of
                    his other writings. It is full of bursts of tenderness; and even whilst the
                    subjects of his earliest meditations were the same dark doctrines, in their most
                    tremendous form, which he afterwards defended so ably by the help of his mature
                    reason, amidst all the gloom which naturally surrounds them, they seem to have
                    left upon his mind no sentiments but those of gentleness and charity. At the
                    same time, this document affords us a distinct proof that such doctrines take
                    their origin, in a great measure, in peculiar circumstances of society, or of
                    the individual mind; and since they were quite as fully impressed upon Edwards
                    before he was capable of any profound reasoning concerning them, as afterwards,
                    the presumption is, that his early prepossessions came strongly in aid of his
                    later conclusions.</p>
                <p>It was in the midst of these youthful musings that he acquired a full and firm
                    persuasion of tenets which we will own scarcely seem to us to be either so
                    lovely, or of so good report, as the more natural sentiments of his unconverted
                    state, which he gave up in exchange for them. “I had a variety,” says he “of
                    concerns and exercises about my soul from my childhood; but had two more
                    remarkable seasons of awakening before I met with that change by which I was
                    brought to those new dispositions, and that new sense of things, that I have
                    since had. The first time was when I was a boy, some years before I went to
                    college, at a time of remarkable awakening in my father’s congregation. I was
                    then very much affected for many months, and concerned about the things of
                    religion.” This state of mind, however, appears to have passed off; but, in his
                    last year at college, he was visited by a severe sickness, which made him form
                    many wise and holy resolutions, which he was afterwards for the most part
                    enabled to keep. So far it was well; but now follows the grand proof of his
                    conversion. “From my childhood up,” he says, “my mind had been wont to be full
                    of objections against the doctrine of God’s sovereignty in choosing whom he
                    would to eternal life, and rejecting whom lie pleased, leaving them eternally to
                    perish, and be everlastingly tormented in hell. It used to appear like a
                    horrible doctrine to me. But I remember very well when I seemed to be convinced
                    and fully satisfied as to this sovereignty of God, and his justice in thus
                    eternally disposing of men according to his sovereign pleasure. But I never
                    could give an account how or by what means I was thus convinced, not in the
                    least imagining in the time of it, nor a long time after, that there was any
                    extraordinary influence of God’s Spirit in it, but only that now I saw farther,
                    and my reason apprehended the justice and reasonableness of it. However, my mind
                    rested in it, and it put an end to all those cavils and objections that had till
                    then abode with me all the preceding part of my life. And there has been a
                    wonderful alteration in my mind with respect to God’s sovereignty from that day
                    to this, so that I scarce ever have found so much as the rising of an objection
                    against God’s sovereignty in the most absolute sense, in showing mercy to whom
                    he will show mercy, and hardening and eternally damning whom he will. God’s
                    absolute sovereignty and justice, with respect to salvation and damnation, is
                    what my mind seems to rest assured of as much as of any thing that I see with my
                    eyes.” This doctrine continued throughout Mr Edwards’ life in peculiar favour
                    with him; and he employs the whole resources of his dialectics to support it,
                    with a full conviction that he was thereby glorifying God, and performing an
                    important service to mankind.</p>
                <p>In this document of Mr Edwards' early opinions, we have said that, amidst all the
                    horrors of his creed, there are many intimations of the natural fineness and
                    sensibility of his spirit. The following passages are remarkably beautiful, and
                    have about them a tone of pastoral or rather scriptural poetry. “Not long after
                    I first began to experience these things, I gave an account to my father of some
                    things that had passed in my mind. I was pretty much affected by the discourse
                    we had together; and when the discourse was ended, I walked abroad alone in a
                    solitary place in my father’s pasture for contemplation. And as 1 was walking
                    there, and looked up on the sky and clouds, there came into my mind so sweet a
                    sense of the glorious majesty and grace of God that I know not how to express
                    it....God’s excellency, his wisdom, his purity and love, seemed to appear in
                    every thing; in the sun, moon, and stars; in the clouds and blue sky; in the
                    grass, flowers, trees; in the water and all nature, which used greatly to fix my
                    mind. I often used to sit and view the moon for a long time, and so in the day
                    time spent much time in viewing the clouds and sky, to behold the sweet glory of
                    God in these things; in the mean time singing forth with a loud voice my
                    contemplations of the Creator and Redeemer...! used to be a person uncommonly
                    terrified with thunder; and it used to strike me with terror when I saw a
                    thunder-storm rising; but now,on the contrary, it rejoiced me. I felt God at the
                    first appearance of a thunder-storm, and used to take an opportunity at such
                    times to fix myself to view the clouds, and see the lightnings play, and hear
                    the majestic and awful voice of God’s thunder.” These confessions have let us
                    already into the inside of Edwards' mind, and there is no need to return upon
                    them whilst we pursue the account of his studies, life, and writings. There is a
                    poetry and grandeur in some of his passages of this sort which show a moral
                    sublimity of genius in the midst of enthusiastic reveries, often, in inferior
                    minds, more productive of dark and disorderly sentiments than of sound and
                    elevated piety. When he comes, however, to reason on his theological or
                    philosophical tenets, he is no longer either an enthusiast or a poet; for he
                    then proceeds with all the pertinacity and ingenuity of a hard-headed
                    dialectician, determined neither to tolerate nor employ any weapon but stem
                    argument</p>
                <p>He went young to Yale College, and as early as his thirteenth year had read Locke

                    and profit. He had a great taste for natural philosophy, but the moral and
                    divine sciences were his chief object; and after a long residence at college,
                    during which time he prepared himself assiduously for the ministry, he was in
                    due form licensed to preach. In August 1722 he was invited to preach to the
                    English Presbyterians at New York, where he continued with approbation above
                    eight months; but as this society was too small to maintain a preacher, he
                    returned in the year 1723 to his father’s house at Connecticut, where, for some
                    time, he applied to his studies with much industry and perseverance; and this
                    severe application became habitual to him, although he was of a delicate
                    constitution. In the spring of 1724·, having taken his master’s degree, he was
                    appointed tutor of Yale College, being then in his twenty-first year; an office
                    which, notwithstanding his youth, he filled for two years with great success and
                    reputation. In September 1726 he received an invitation from the people of
                    Northampton in Connecticut, to become assistant to his mother’s father, Mr
                    Stoddard, to whom he was ordained colleague in his twenty-fourth year, and
                    continued as pastor of this congregation till the year 1750. During this time he
                    married, had many children, and wrote several pious and useful treatises,
                    chiefly suggested by the events of the times, such as his <hi rend="italic"

                    rend="italic">Religious Affections,</hi> in which he endeavoured to restrain the
                    extravagance and fanaticism into which, under these strong impressions, the
                    religion of his flock was but too apt to degenerate. He was a most faithful and
                    conscientious minister, but at last fell under the displeasure of his people,
                    from no other cause except his anxiety for their spiritual interests. They
                    appear, indeed, to have been a very stiff-necked generation, full of absurd
                    whimsical vagaries on the subject of religion, but at the same time evincing
                    little of its spirit in their lives and conversations. They had all a voice in
                    the election and continuance of their clergyman, and they were very ready to
                    seize any opportunity to show their power. Mr Edwards discovered that some
                    licentious books had got among the youth of his congregation, a fact as to which
                    he wished some investigation to take place; and this was the first point upon
                    which his people flew off from him. There arose afterwards another point about
                    the administration of the holy communion. His grandfather Mr Stoddard had, it
                    seems, a notion that the administration of the sacrament was a moment which the
                    Divine Spirit was much disposed to seize for the conversion of sinners; and
                    that, therefore, the most notorious sinners were almost without scruple to be
                    admitted to that holy ordinance, in the hope that this conversion would fall
                    upon them. The result of this precious notion was, that the utmost
                    licentiousness, mingled as it was with wild religious fancies floating in every
                    brain, began to prevail amongst the people. When Mr Edwards, on his
                    grandfather’s death, obtained the entire charge, he endeavoured to make a change
                    in this particular; but the outcry against him “as loud and overbearing. Even
                    his brethren of the clergy tamely gave way to a clamour which they condemned;
                    and this excellent, able, and pious clergyman was thus driven away by the
                    misguided flock, for whom he had laboured assiduously during twenty-four years;
                    and at an advanced period of life, with a wife and a large family, he was thrown
                    upon the world and the care of providence.</p>
                <p>His next position was at Stockbridge, in the western part of Massachusetts Bay,
                    where he was put at the head of a mission for converting the Indians. He was not
                    enabled to do much as a missionary; but here he had a great deal of leisure,
                    which he employed in writing his principal works. It was now he completed his
                    chief treatise on the subject of free will; a work concerning the rapid
                    execution of which we have the following information in Sir Henry Moncreiff
                    Wellwood’s able and interesting <hi rend="italic">Life of Dr Erskine.</hi> “It
                    was not till the month of July 1752, that he appears to have resumed his studies
                    on the subject of free will; for on the 7th of that month he writes Dr Erskine,
                    that ‘ he hoped soon to be at leisure to resume his design ;’ and gives him
                    another sketch of the plan of his book, in which, though there be nothing new,
                    there is more detail than in that which he had formerly sent him. Whatever
                    opinion,” continues this able writer, “may be held with regard to Mr Edwards’
                    argument, it must appear astonishing to those who are capable of appreciating
                    the difficulty of his subject, that, in nine months from the date of this
                    letter, on the 14th of April 1753, he could write Dr Erskine, that he had almost
                    finished the first draught of what he originally intended; though he was under
                    the necessity of delaying the publication till he knew the result of proposals
                    which he had circulated for printing his book by subscription. His book was
                    published in 1754, and, though he had made some progress in preparing his
                    materials before he left Northampton, was certainly written, and nearly
                    completed, within the time ascertained by the two letters referred to, and must
                    be admitted to convey a very striking idea, both of his mental resources and of
                    his literary ardour.”</p>
                <p>In 1757, on the death of Mr Aaron Burr, Mr Edwards was chosen president of New
                    Jersey College. He had only been here, however, a very short time, when he was
                    carried off on the 22d of March 1758, in the fifty-fifth year of his age, by the
                    small-pox. This disease was at that time raging in the neighbourhood. Mr
                    Edwards, who had never had it, proposed to be inoculated, which his physicians
                    approved of. He had the disease favourably, but a secondary fever set in, and by
                    reason of a number of pustules in his throat, the obstruction became such that
                    he could not swallow the necessary medicines, and the fatal result was what we
                    have stated. The character of Mr Edwards is that of a very primitive,
                    self-mortified, simple, and amiable man, and affords a strong proof of the power
                    of genuine Christian piety upon the heart, in spite of the most gloomy and
                    repulsive tenets. He was solely occupied with his professional duties and his
                    theological studies, insomuch that, as is mentioned with inimitable simplicity
                    by the author of his life, “he was less acquainted with most of his temporal
                    affairs than many of his neighbours, and seldom knew when and by whom his forage
                    for winter was gathered in, or how many milk-kine he had; whence his table was
                    furnished,” or by what means his wants were provided for. Mrs Edwards, however,
                    a most valuable and sensible woman, fully supplied his defects in these
                    particulars. We must quote another passage from this piece of biography, which
                    is equal in simplicity, though by no means in any thing else, to some of the
                    exquisite biographies of Isaac Walton. After being informed that he did not
                    permit dancing, against which <pb break="no" facs="nls:193329050"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0708-9050-0455"/>amusement, indeed, he wrote a sermon, we are told
                    that “he allowed not his children to be from home after nine o’clock at night,
                    when they went abroad to see their friends and companions; neither were they
                    allowed to sit up much after that time, in his own house, when any came to make
                    them a visit. If any gentleman desired acquaint-tance with his daughters, after
                    handsomely introducing himself, by properly consulting the parents, he was
                    allowed all proper opportunity for it, and a room and fire, if needed; but must
                    not intrude on the proper hours of rest and sleep, nor the religion and order of
                    the family.”</p>
                <p>Mr Edwards comes nearer Bishop Butler as a philosophical divine than any other
                    theologian with whom we are acquainted. His style, like Butler’s, is very much
                    that of a man thinking aloud. In both these authors the train of thinking in
                    their own minds is more clearly exhibited to us than perhaps by any other
                    writer, whilst they show us with great truth and distinctness what their notions
                    are, and how they came by them, with very little concern about the form of
                    expression in which they are brought out. Butler, however, had a larger mind
                    than Edwards, and was by no means so much of a mere dialectician. If, therefore,
                    he be less acute than the American, he is more comprehensive, and gives fairer
                    play to every opposing argument. We do not mean here to enter into any of
                    Edwards’ speculations. Both on the subject of original sin, and on the freedom
                    of the will, he seems to us to unite a great deal too closely the views which
                    originated, as we have seen, in no small degree, amidst his early reveries, with
                    the infallible discoveries of divine revelation. Our notion is, that in all
                    discussions on such subjects which have hitherto appeared, the speculatists have
                    forgotten how little a part either of the history or the nature of man we are in
                    fact acquainted with; and bow ready we ever are, in laying the foundations of
                    our theories, to place a tortoise beneath the elephant. The whole difficulty,
                    for instance, on the freedom of the will, turns upon a puzzle in the idea of
                    cause and effect. Perhaps this idea is far from being precise in our minds (Mr
                    Edwards uses it very loosely in his speculations); yet we do not scruple, in our
                    reasonings upon it, to draw the most positive inferences from the assumptions
                    with which we set out. We suspect, indeed, that the true and accurate notion of
                    causation always involves the idea of volition; and, on that supposition, to ask
                    for the cause of volition itself is absurd. It may be very true that we cannot
                    will to do any thing without previous thought or motive; neither can we think
                    without previous existence. But is our existence the cause of our thinking? Just
                    as much as our thinking is the cause of our willing. We are far, however, from
                    wishing to add our own crude conceptions to those which have been piled up on
                    this subject from the beginning of time to the present hour, without, we
                    believe, doing the slightest service to the cause of moral and religious truth,
                    or accomplishing any thing, in short, beyond affording an exercise for
                    ingenuity, and too often a handle for uncharitable rancour and presumptuous
                    absurdity. Mr Edwards, with all his great powers, has accordingly, we apprehend,
                    done but little good to the world, we mean as a philosopher; for he did much
                    good in his own day, whilst he was living the life of a zealous and faithful
                    Christian minister. But it is “thus we play the fools with the time; and the
                    spirits of the wise sit in the clouds and mock us.” Exalted above all the folly
                    of human wisdom, the spirit of this truly good and pious man is now, it may be,
                    disposed to regard with some such sentiment many of his own most severe and
                    laborious speculations, which were carried on in the serious belief, that if
                    “the knots of Calvinism were trimmed off, or its doctrines, in the whole length
                    and breadth of them, were not rigidly maintained, a man could nowhere set his
                    foot down with consistency and safety, short of Deism, or even Atheism itself,
                    or rather universal Scepticism.”</p>
                <p>Edwards’ works consist of several volumes of sermons, printed at various times,
                    and often reprinted in this country as well as in America. Besides these, he
                    wrote, 1. <hi rend="italic">A Treatise concerning Religious Affections,</hi>
                    1746, 8vo; 2. <hi rend="italic">An Account of the Life of the Rererend David

                    Qualifications for full Communion in the Visible Church,</hi> 1749, intended as
                    a vindication of his principles in the matter which occasioned his dismission
                    from Northampton; 4. <hi rend="italic">A careful and strict Inquiry into the
